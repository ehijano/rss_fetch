      <title>Bounds on the ground state energy of quantum $p$-spin Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the ground state energy of quantum $p$-local spin glass random Hamiltonians, the quantum analogues of widely studied classical spin glass models. Our main result shows that the maximum energy achievable by product states has a well-defined limit (for even $p$) as $n\to\infty$ and is $E_{\text{product}}^\ast=\sqrt{2 \log p}$ in the limit of large $p$. This value is interpreted as the maximal energy of a much simpler so-called Random Energy Model, widely studied in the setting of classical spin glasses. The proof of the limit existing follows from an extension of Fekete's Lemma after we demonstrate near super-additivity of the (normalized) quenched free energy. The proof of the value follows from a second moment method on the number of states achieving a given energy when restricting to an $\epsilon$-net of product states.
  Furthermore, we relate the maximal energy achieved over all states to a $p$-dependent constant $\gamma\left(p\right)$, which is defined by the degree of violation of a certain asymptotic independence ansatz over graph matchings. We show that the maximal energy achieved by all states $E^\ast\left(p\right)$ in the limit of large $n$ is at most $\sqrt{\gamma\left(p\right)}E_{\text{product}}^\ast$. We also prove using Lindeberg's interpolation method that the limiting $E^\ast\left(p\right)$ is robust with respect to the choice of the randomness and, for instance, also applies to the case of sparse random Hamiltonians. This robustness in the randomness extends to a wide range of random Hamiltonian models including SYK and random quantum max-cut.</description>

      <title>Stability of mixed-state quantum phases via finite Markov length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For quantum phases of Hamiltonian ground states, the energy gap plays a central role in ensuring the stability of the phase as long as the gap remains finite. We propose Markov length, the length scale at which the quantum conditional mutual information (CMI) decays exponentially, as an equally essential quantity characterizing mixed-state phases and transitions. For a state evolving under a local Lindbladian, we argue that if its Markov length remains finite along the evolution, then it remains in the same phase, meaning there exists another quasi-local Lindbladian evolution that can reverse the former one. We apply this diagnostic to toric code subject to decoherence and show that the Markov length is finite everywhere except at its decodability transition, at which it diverges. CMI in this case can be mapped to the free energy cost of point defects in the random bond Ising model. This implies that the mixed state phase transition coincides with the decodability transition and also suggests a quasi-local decoding channel.</description>

      <title>Bounds and guarantees for learning and entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information theory provides tools to predict the performance of a learning algorithm on a given dataset. For instance, the accuracy of learning an unknown parameter can be upper bounded by reducing the learning task to hypothesis testing for a discrete random variable, with Fano's inequality then stating that a small conditional entropy between a learner's observations and the unknown parameter is necessary for successful estimation. This work first extends this relationship by demonstrating that a small conditional entropy is also sufficient for successful learning, thereby establishing an information-theoretic lower bound on the accuracy of a learner. This connection between information theory and learning suggests that we might similarly apply quantum information theory to characterize learning tasks involving quantum systems. Observing that the fidelity of a finite-dimensional quantum system with a maximally entangled state (the singlet fraction) generalizes the success probability for estimating a discrete random variable, we introduce an entanglement manipulation task for infinite-dimensional quantum systems that similarly generalizes classical learning. We derive information-theoretic bounds for succeeding at this task in terms of the maximal singlet fraction of an appropriate finite-dimensional discretization. As classical learning is recovered as a special case of this task, our analysis suggests a deeper relationship at the interface of learning, entanglement, and information.</description>

      <title>Generating Reservoir State Descriptions with Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel approach to reservoir computer measurements through the use of a simple quantum system and random matrices to motivate how atomic-scale devices might be used for real-world computing applications. In our approach, random matrices are used to construct reservoir measurements, introducing a simple, scalable means for producing state descriptions. In our studies, systems as simple as a five-atom Heisenberg spin chain are used to perform several tasks, including time series prediction and data interpolation. The performance of the measurement technique as well as their current limitations are discussed in detail alongside an exploration of the diversity of measurements yielded by the random matrices. Additionally, we explore the role of the parameters of the spin chain, adjusting coupling strength and the measurement dimension, yielding insights into how these learning machines might be automatically tuned for different problems. This research highlights the use of random matrices as measurements of simple quantum systems for natural learning devices and outlines a path forward for improving their performance and experimental realisation.</description>

      <title>Certifying almost all quantum states with few single-qubit measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certifying that an n-qubit state synthesized in the lab is close to the target state is a fundamental task in quantum information science. However, existing rigorous protocols either require deep quantum circuits or exponentially many single-qubit measurements. In this work, we prove that almost all n-qubit target states, including those with exponential circuit complexity, can be certified from only O(n^2) single-qubit measurements. This result is established by a new technique that relates certification to the mixing time of a random walk. Our protocol has applications for benchmarking quantum systems, for optimizing quantum circuits to generate a desired target state, and for learning and verifying neural networks, tensor networks, and various other representations of quantum states using only single-qubit measurements. We show that such verified representations can be used to efficiently predict highly non-local properties that would otherwise require an exponential number of measurements. We demonstrate these applications in numerical experiments with up to 120 qubits, and observe advantage over existing methods such as cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB).</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms to simulate quadratic classical Hamiltonians and optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation of realistic classical mechanical systems is of great importance to many areas of engineering such as robotics, dynamics of rotating machinery and control theory. In this work, we develop quantum algorithms to estimate quantities of interest such as the kinetic energy in a given classical mechanical system in the presence of friction or damping as well as forcing or source terms, which makes the algorithm of practical interest. We show that for such systems, the quantum algorithm scales polynomially with the logarithm of the dimension of the system. We cast this problem in terms of Hamilton's equations of motion (equivalent to the first variation of the Lagrangian) and solve them using quantum algorithms for differential equations. We then consider the hardness of estimating the kinetic energy of a damped coupled oscillator system. We show that estimating the kinetic energy at a given time of this system to within additive precision is BQP hard when the strength of the damping term is bounded by an inverse polynomial in the number of qubits. We then consider the problem of designing optimal control of classical systems, which can be cast as the second variation of the Lagrangian. In this direction, we first consider the Riccati equation, which is a nonlinear differential equation ubiquitous in control theory. We give an efficient quantum algorithm to solve the Riccati differential equation well into the nonlinear regime. To our knowledge, this is the first example of any nonlinear differential equation that can be solved when the strength of the nonlinearity is asymptotically greater than the amount of dissipation. We then show how to use this algorithm to solve the linear quadratic regulator problem, which is an example of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.</description>

      <title>Building a controlled-NOT gate between polarization and frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By harnessing multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs) within a single photon, controlled quantum unitaries, such as the two-qubit controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, play a pivotal role in advancing quantum communication protocols like dense coding and entanglement distillation. In this work, we devise and realize a CNOT operation between polarization and frequency DoFs by exploiting directionally dependent electro-optic phase modulation within a fiber Sagnac loop. Alongside computational basis measurements, we validate the effectiveness of this operation through the synthesis of all four Bell states in a single photon, all with fidelities greater than 98%. This demonstration opens new avenues for manipulating hyperentanglement across these two crucial DoFs, marking a foundational step toward leveraging polarization-frequency resources in fiber networks for future quantum applications.</description>

      <title>A Modified Depolarization Approach for Efficient Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Computing in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era has shown promising applications in machine learning, optimization, and cryptography. Despite the progress, challenges persist due to system noise, errors, and decoherence that complicate the simulation of quantum systems. The depolarization channel is a standard tool for simulating a quantum system's noise. However, modeling such noise for practical applications is computationally expensive when we have limited hardware resources, as is the case in the NISQ era. We propose a modified representation for a single-qubit depolarization channel with two Kraus operators based only on X and Z Pauli matrices. Our approach reduces the computational complexity from six to four matrix multiplications per execution of a channel. Experiments on a Quantum Machine Learning (QML) model on the Iris dataset across various circuit depths and depolarization rates validate that our approach maintains the model's accuracy while improving efficiency. This simplified noise model enables more scalable simulations of quantum circuits under depolarization, advancing capabilities in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Classifying Density Matrices of 2 and 3 Qubit States Up To LU Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a modified version of the proof given Jing-Yang-Zhao's paper titled "Local Unitary Equivalence of Quantum States and Simultaneous Orthogonal Equivalence," which established the correspondance between local unitary equivalence and simultaneous orthogonal equivalence of $2$-qubits. Our modified proof utilizes a hypermatrix algebra framework, and through this framework we are able to generalize this correspondence to $3$-qubits. Finally, we apply a generalization of Specht's criterion (first proved in "Specht's Criterion for Systems of Linear Mappings" by V. Futorney, R. A. Horn, and V. V. Sergeichuk) to reduce the problem of local unitary equivalence of $3$-qubits to checking trace identities and a few other easy-to-check properties. We also note that all of these results can be extended to $2$ and $3$ qudits if we relax the notion of LU equivalence to quasi-LU equivalence, as defined in the aforementioned paper by Jing et. al.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable phase transition in a bosonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metamaterials engineered to host topological states of matter in controllable quantum systems hold promise for the advancement of quantum simulations and quantum computing technologies. In this context, the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model has gained prominence due to its simplicity and practical applications. Here, we present the implementation of a gate-tunable, five-unit-cell bosonic SSH chain on a one-dimensional lattice of superconducting resonators. We achieve electrostatic control over the inductive intra-cell coupling using semiconductor nanowire junctions, which enables the spectroscopic observation of a transition from a trivial to a topological phase in the engineered metamaterial. In contrast to prior work, our approach offers precise and independent in-situ tuning of the coupling parameters. Finally, we discuss the robustness of the topological edge state against various disorder realizations. Our results supplement efforts towards gate-controlled superconducting electronics and large controllable bosonic lattices to enable quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Controllable transitions among phase-matching conditions in a single nonlinear crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled photon pairs are crucial resources for quantum information processing protocols. Via the process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), we can generate these photon pairs using bulk nonlinear crystals. Traditionally, the crystal is designed to satisfy specific type of phase-matching condition. Here, we report controllable transitions among different types of phase-matching in a single periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate (PPKTP) crystal. By carefully selecting pump conditions, we can satisfy different phase-matching conditions. This allows us to observe first-order type-II, fifth-order type-I, third-order type-0, and fifth-order type-II SPDCs. The temperature-dependent spectra of our source were also analyzed in detail. Finally, we discussed the possibility of observing more than nine SPDCs in this crystal. Our work not only deepens the understanding of the physics behind phase-matching conditions, but also offers the potential for a highly versatile entangled biphoton source for quantum information research.</description>

      <title>Quantum Multigrid Algorithm for Finite Element Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum linear system algorithms (QLSAs) can provide exponential speedups for the solution of linear systems, but the growth of the condition number for finite element problems can eliminate the exponential speedup. QLSAs are also incapable of using an initial guess of a solution to improve upon it. To circumvent these issues, we present a Quantum Multigrid Algorithm (qMG) for the iterative solution of linear systems by applying the sequence of multigrid operations on a quantum state. Given an initial guess with error e_0, qMG can produce a vector encoding the entire sequence of multigrid iterates with the final iterate having a relative error e'=e/e_0, as a subspace of the final quantum state, with exponential advantage in O( poly log (N/e') ) time using O( poly log (N/e') ) qubits. Although extracting the final iterate from the sequence is efficient, extracting the sequence of iterates from the final quantum state can be inefficient. We provide an analysis of the complexity of the method along with numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>Color code decoder with improved scaling for correcting circuit-level noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional color codes are a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computing, as they have high encoding rates, transversal implementation of logical Clifford gates, and high feasibility of magic state constructions. However, decoding color codes presents a significant challenge due to their structure, where elementary errors violate three checks instead of just two (a key feature in surface code decoding), and the complexity in extracting syndrome is greater. We introduce an efficient color-code decoder that tackles these issues by combining two matching decoders for each color, generalized to handle circuit-level noise by employing detector error models. We provide comprehensive analyses of the decoder, covering its threshold and sub-threshold scaling both for bit-flip noise with ideal measurements and for circuit-level noise. Our simulations reveal that this decoding strategy nearly reaches the best possible scaling of logical failure ($p_\mathrm{fail} \sim p^{d/2}$) for both noise models, where $p$ is the noise strength, in the regime of interest for fault-tolerant quantum computing. While its noise thresholds are comparable with other matching-based decoders for color codes (8.2% for bit-flip noise and 0.46% for circuit-level noise), the scaling of logical failure rates below threshold significantly outperforms the best matching-based decoders.</description>

      <title>Multiparameter cascaded quantum interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a multiparameter cascaded quantum interferometer in which a two-input and two-output setup is obtained by concatenating 50:50 beam splitters with n independent and adjustable time delays. A general method for deriving the coincidence probability of such an interferometer is given based on the linear transformation of the matrix of beam splitters. As examples, we analyze the interference characteristics of one-, two- and three-parameter cascaded quantum interferometers with different frequency correlations and input states. Some typical interferograms of such interferometers are provided to reveal more rich and complicated two-photon interference phenomena. In principle, arbitrary two-input and two-output experimental setups can be designed with the proposal. This work offers a toolbox for designing versatile quantum interferometers and provides a convenient method for deriving the coincidence probabilities involved. Potential applications can be found in the complete spectral characterization of two-photon states, multiparameter estimation, and quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Hyperpolarisation Dynamics: Asymptotic Polarisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For applications of solid state quantum computing and quantum simulations, high fidelity initialisation of thermally mixed electronic and nuclear spin qubits is essential. Whereas electronic spins can readily be initialised optically to high fidelity, initialisation of the nuclear spins requires alternative approaches, such as dynamic nuclear polarisation (DNP) via the electronic spin. Pulse-based DNP methods, such as PulsePol, are already widely utilised. By means of repeated application of PulsePol sequences, interspersed with re-initialisation of the electronic spin, high levels of nuclear polarisation -- termed hyperpolarisation -- have been achieved. From theoretical analysis of these protocols perfect nuclear initialisation is expected; however, in practice, saturation below $\sim$ 95$\%$ is seen in experiment. We develop an analytical model to describe hyperpolarisation dynamics, predicting non-maximal nuclear polarisation saturation in the asymptotic limit for realistic nuclear spin clusters. We argue that perfect initialisation of a typical nuclear cluster using this method may not, in general, be possible even with an arbitrarily large number of repetitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $\alpha$-$z$-R\'enyi divergences $D_{\alpha,z}(\psi\|\varphi)$ where $\alpha,z&gt;0$ ($\alpha\ne1$) for normal positive functionals $\psi,\varphi$ on general von Neumann algebras, introduced in [S.~Kato and Y.~Ueda, arXiv:2307.01790] and [S.~Kato, arXiv:2311.01748]. We prove the variational expressions and the data processing inequality (DPI) for the $\alpha$-$z$-R\'enyi divergences. We establish the sufficiency theorem for $D_{\alpha,z}(\psi\|\varphi)$, saying that for $(\alpha,z)$ inside the DPI bounds, the equality $D_{\alpha,z}(\psi\circ\gamma\|\varphi\circ\gamma)=D_{\alpha,z}(\psi\|\varphi)&lt;\infty$ in the DPI under a quantum channel (or a normal $2$-positive unital map) $\gamma$ implies the reversibility of $\gamma$ with respect to $\psi,\varphi$. Moreover, we show the monotonicity properties of $D_{\alpha,z}(\psi\|\varphi)$ in the parameters $\alpha,z$ and their limits to the normalized relative entropy as $\alpha\nearrow1$ and $\alpha\searrow1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetric top molecule YbOCH$_3$ is studied for its potential to $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$-violation searches. The influence of the rotations and vibrations of the YbOCH$_3$ on such violating effects as the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM) and the scalar-pseudoscalar electron-nucleon interaction (Ne-SPS) is studied using the coupled channels method. The corresponding sensitivity parameters $E_{\rm eff}$ and $E_{\rm s}$ are computed.</description>

      <title>Maximum and minimum causal effects of quantum processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two quantitative measures of the strength of causal relations. These two measures capture the maximum and minimum changes in a quantum system induced by changes in another system. We show that both measures possess important properties, such as continuity and faithfulness, and can be evaluated through optimization over orthogonal input states. For the maximum causal effect, we provide numerical lower bounds based on a variational algorithm, which can be used to estimate the strength of causal relations without performing a full quantum process tomography. To illustrate the application of our algorithm, we analyze two paradigmatic examples, the first involving a coherent superposition of direct cause and common cause and the second involving communication through a coherent superposition of two completely depolarizing channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a locality preserving unitary mapping from fermions to qubits on a 2D torus whilst accounting for the mapping of topological sectors. Extending the work of Shukla et al. [Phys. Rev. B 101, 155105], an explicit intertwiner is constructed in the form of a projected entangled pair operator. By encoding the information about the charge sectors (and if applicable the twisted boundary conditions) in ancillary qubit(s), the intertwiner becomes a unitary operator which exchanges boundary conditions and charge sectors.</description>

      <title>Impossibility of universal work extraction from coherence: Reconciling axiomatic and resource-theory approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare how the impossibility of a universal work extractor from coherence arises from different approaches to quantum thermodynamics: an explicit protocol accounting for all relevant quantum resources, and axiomatic, information-theoretic constraints imposed by constructor theory. We first explain how the impossibility of a universal work extractor from coherence is directly implied by a recently proposed constructor-theoretic theorem based on distinguishability, which is scale- and dynamics- independent. Then we give an explicit demonstration of this result within quantum theory, by proving the impossibility of generalising a proposed quantum protocol for deterministically extracting work from coherence. We demonstrate a new connection between the impossibility of universal work extractors and constructor-based irreversibility, which was recently shown using the quantum homogenizer. Finally we discuss additional avenues for applying the constructor-theoretic formulation of work extraction to quantum thermodynamics, including the irreversibility of quantum computation and thermodynamics of multiple conserved quantities.</description>

      <title>Synergy between noisy quantum computers and scalable classical deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of combining the computational power of noisy quantum computers and of classical scalable convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The goal is to accurately predict exact expectation values of parameterized quantum circuits representing the Trotter-decomposed dynamics of quantum Ising models. By incorporating (simulated) noisy expectation values alongside circuit structure information, our CNNs effectively capture the underlying relationships between circuit architecture and output behaviour, enabling predictions for circuits with more qubits than those included in the training set. Notably, thanks to the quantum information, our CNNs succeed even when supervised learning based only on classical descriptors fails. Furthermore, they outperform a popular error mitigation scheme, namely, zero-noise extrapolation, demonstrating that the synergy between quantum and classical computational tools leads to higher accuracy compared with quantum-only or classical-only approaches. By tuning the noise strength, we explore the crossover from a computationally powerful classical CNN assisted by quantum noisy data, towards rather precise quantum computations, further error-mitigated via classical deep learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second in a series of "graphical grokking" papers in which we study how stabiliser codes can be understood using the ZX calculus. In this paper we show that certain complex rules involving ZX diagrams, called spider nest identities, can be captured succinctly using the scalable ZX calculus, and all such identities can be proved inductively from a single new rule using the Clifford ZX calculus. This can be combined with the ZX picture of CSS codes, developed in the first "grokking" paper, to give a simple characterisation of the set of all transversal diagonal gates at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy implementable in an arbitrary CSS code.</description>

      <title>Counting statistics of ultra-broadband microwave photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report measurements of counting statistics, average and variance, of microwave photons of ill-defined frequency: bichromatic photons, i.e. photons involving two well separated frequencies, and "white", broadband photons. Our setup allows for the detection of single photonic modes of arbitrary waveform over the 1-10 GHz frequency range. The photon statistics is obtained by on-the-fly numerical calculation from the measured time-dependent voltage. After validating our procedure with thermal- and squeezed- radiation of such photons, we relate the detected statistics to the squeezing spectrum of an ac+dc biased tunnel junction. We observe an optimal squeezing of $\sim$1.5dB over a bandwidth $&gt;1$ GHz, better than 1dB over 3.5 GHz and still see squeezing over a bandwidth of $\sim6$ GHz around 6 GHz. We also show how the waveform of a bichromatic photon can be optimized for maximum squeezing.</description>

      <title>Accurate neural quantum states for interacting lattice bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, neural quantum states have emerged as a powerful variational approach, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy when representing the ground-state wave function of a great variety of quantum many-body systems, including spin lattices, interacting fermions or continuous-variable systems. However, accurate neural representations of the ground state of interacting bosons on a lattice have remained elusive. We introduce a neural backflow Jastrow Ansatz, in which occupation factors are dressed with translationally equivariant many-body features generated by a deep neural network. We show that this neural quantum state is able to faithfully represent the ground state of the 2D Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian across all values of the interaction strength. We scale our simulations to lattices of dimension up to $20{\times}20$ while achieving the best variational energies reported for this model. This enables us to investigate the scaling of the entanglement entropy across the superfluid-to-Mott quantum phase transition, a quantity hard to extract with non-variational approaches.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian dynamics with a giant atom coupled to a semi-infinite photonic waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-Markovian dynamics of a two-level giant atom interacting with a one-dimensional semi-infinite waveguide through multiple coupling points, where a perfect mirror is located at the endpoint of the waveguide. The system enters a non-Markovian process when the travel time of the photon between adjacent coupling points is sufficiently large compared to the inverse of the bare relaxation rate of the giant atom. The photon released by the spontaneous emission of the atom transfers between multiple coupling points through the waveguide or is reabsorbed by the atom with the photon emitted via the atom having completed the round trip after reflection of the mirror, which leads to the photon being trapped and forming bound states. We find that three different types of bound states can be formed in the system, containing the static bound states with no inversion of population, the periodic equal amplitude oscillation with two bound states, and the periodic non-equal amplitude oscillation with three bound states. The physical origins of three bound states formation are revealed. Moreover, we consider the influences of the dissipation of unwanted modes and dephasing on the bound states. Finally, we extend the system to a more general case involving many giant atoms coupled into a one-dimensional semi-infinite waveguide. The obtained set of delay differential equations for the giant atoms might open a way to better understand the non-Markovian dynamics of many giant atoms coupled to a semi-infinite waveguide.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Reorientation of Spin Multipoles in Silicon Carbide by Transverse Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-lived and optically addressable high-spin state of the negatively charged silicon vacancy ($\mathrm{V_{Si}}$) in silicon carbide makes it a promising system for applications in quantum technologies. Most studies of its spin dynamics have been performed in external magnetic fields applied along the symmetry axis. Here, we find that the application of weak magnetic fields perpendicular to the symmetry axis leads to nontrivial behavior caused by dynamical reorientation of the $\mathrm{V_{Si}}$ spin multipole under optical excitation. Particularly, we observe the inversion of the quadrupole spin polarization in the excited state and appearance of the dipole spin polarization in the ground state. The latter is much higher than thermal polarization and cannot be induced solely by optical excitation. Our theoretical calculations reproduce well all sharp features in the spin resonance spectra, and shine light on the complex dynamics of spin multipoles in these kinds of solid-state systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a quantum many-body system driven by two competing measurements, which induces a topological entanglement transition between two distinct area law phases. We employ a positive operator-valued measurement with variable coupling between the system and detector within free Fermion dynamics. This approach allows us to continuously track the universal properties of the transition between projective and continuous monitoring. Our findings suggest that the percolation universality of the transition in the projective limit is unstable when the system-detector coupling is reduced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intra-particle entanglement of individual particles such as neutrons could enable a new class of scattering probes that are sensitive to entanglement in quantum systems and materials. In this work, we present experimental results demonstrating quantum contextuality as a result of entanglement between the spin and energy modes (i.e., degrees of freedom) of single neutrons in a beam using a pair of resonant radio-frequency neutron spin flippers in the MIEZE configuration (Modulated IntEnsity with Zero Effort). We verified the mode-entanglement by measuring a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) contextuality witness $S$ defined in the spin and energy subsystems, observing a clear breach of the classical bound of $|S| \leq 2$, obtaining $S = 2.40 \pm 0.02$. These entangled beams could enable novel approaches for directly probing dynamics and entanglement in quantum materials whose low-energy excitation scales match those of the incident entangled neutron.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a low-depth randomised algorithm for the estimation of entanglement fidelity between an $n$-qubit matchgate circuit $\mathcal{U}$ and its noisy implementation $\mathcal{E}$. Our procedure makes use of a modified Pauli-Liouville representation of quantum channels, with Clifford algebra elements as a basis. We show that this choice of representation leads to a block-diagonal compound matrix structure of matchgate superoperators which enables construction of efficient protocols for estimating the fidelity, achieving a $1/\sqrt{n}$ speedup over protocols of Flammia \&amp; Liu [PRL 106, 230501]. Finally, we offer simple extensions of our protocol which (without additional overhead) benchmark matchgate circuits intertwined by Clifford circuits, and circuits composed of exclusively nearest-neighbour $XY(\theta)$ gates or Givens rotations - forming the first known method for direct benchmarking of matchgate subgroups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe analytical properties of the average output entropy of a quantum channel as a function of a pair (channel, input ensemble). In particular, tight semicontinuity bounds for this function with the rank/energy constraints are obtained by using the modified semicontinuity bounds for the quantum conditional entropy of quantum-classical states and a special approximation technique.
  Several applications are considered. New semicontinuity and continuity bounds for the output Holevo information of a channel as a function of a pair (channel, input ensemble) are obtained. The semicontinuity bound for the entanglement of formation with the rank constraint obtained in [1] is improved.
  In the preliminary part, some results concerning ensembles of quantum states are presented. In particular, a new useful metric on the set of generalized ensembles is proposed and explored. The concept of passive energy of an ensemble introduced here plays an important role in the article.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon time-of-flight (TOF) non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging enables the high-resolution reconstruction of objects outside the field of view. The compactness of TOF NLOS imaging systems, entailing the miniaturization of key components within such systems is crucial for practical applications. Here, we present a miniaturized four-channel time-correlated single-photon counting module dedicated to TOF NLOS imaging applications. The module achieves excellent performance with a 10 ps bin size and 27.4 ps minimum root-mean-square time resolution. We present the results of TOF NLOS imaging experiment using an InGaAs/InP single-photon detector and the time-correlated single-photon counting module, and show that a 6.3 cm lateral resolution and 2.3 cm depth resolution can be achieved under the conditions of 5 m imaging distance and 1 ms pixel dwell time.</description>

      <title>Introducing Quantum Information and Computation to a Broader Audience with MOOCs at OpenHPI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is an exciting field with high disruptive potential, but very difficult to access. For this reason, numerous concepts are being developed worldwide on how quantum computing can be taught. This always raises questions about the didactic concept, the content actually taught, and how to measure the success of the teaching concept. In 2022 and 2023, the authors gave a total of nine two-week MOOCs (massive open online courses) with different possible learning paths on the Hasso Plattner Institute's OpenHPI platform. The platform's purpose is to make computer science education available to everyone free of charge. The nine quantum courses form a self-contained curriculum. A total of 17157 course attendances have been taken by 7413 natural persons, and the number is still rising. This paper presents the course concept and then evaluates the anonymized data on the background of the participants, their behavior in the courses, and their learning success. In the present paper for the first time such a large dataset of MOOC-based quantum computing education is analyzed. The summarized results are a heterogeneous personal background of the participants biased towards IT professionals, a majority following the didactic recommendations, and a high success rate, which is strongly correlatatd to following the didactic recommendations. The amount of data from such a large group of quantum computing learners offers numerous starting points for further research in the field of quantum computing education.</description>

      <title>Exact deconfined gauge structures in the higher-spin Yao-Lee model: a quantum spin-orbital liquid with spin fractionalization and non-Abelian anyons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-S Kitaev model has recently been shown to definitely exhibit topological order with spin liquid ground states for half-integer spin, but could be trivially gapped insulators for integer spin. This interesting "even-odd" effect is largely due to the fermionic (bosonic) $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges for half-integer (integer) spin. In this Letter, we theoretically show that a spin-S Yao-Lee model (a spin-orbital model with SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry) possesses exact deconfined fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges for any spin (both integer and half integer spin), which implies a topologically-nontrivial quantum spin-orbital liquid (QSOL) ground state regardless of the value of the spin quantum number. We further study the easy-axis limit of the spin-1 Yao-Lee model which can be solved in a controlled perturbative way and show that it exhibits a gapless QSOL ground state, which can even host a non-Abelian topological order by further considering time-reversal breaking interactions to gap out the Dirac cones of the gapless QSOL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general technique to produce cold spin-polarized molecules, in which rotationally excited states are first populated by coherent microwave excitation, and then allowed to spin-flip and relax via collisional quenching, which populates a single final spin state. We illustrate the high selectivity of the technique for $^{13}$C$^{16}$O molecules immersed in a cold buffer gas of helium atoms, achieving a high degree ($\geq$95\%) of nuclear spin polarization at 1 K.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on adiabatic state preparation in the one-dimensional quantum Ising model using ultracold bosons in a tilted optical lattice. We prepare many-body ground states of controllable system sizes and observe enhanced fluctuations around the transition between paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic states, marking the precursor of quantum critical behavior. Furthermore, we find evidence for superpositions of domain walls and study their effect on the many-body ground state by measuring the populations of each spin configuration across the transition. These results shed new light on the effect of boundary conditions in finite-size quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of the quantum inverse algorithm on small molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the accuracy of the quantum inverse (Q-Inv) algorithm in which the multiplication of $\hat{H}^{-k}$ to the reference wavefunction is replaced by the Fourier Transformed multiplication of $e^{-i\lambda \hat{H}}$, as a function of the integration parameters ($\lambda$) and the power $k$ for various systems, including H$_2$, LiH, BeH$_2$ and the notorious H$_4$ molecule at single point. We further consider the possibility of employing the Gaussian-quadrature rule as an alternate integration method and compared it to the results employing trapezoidal integration. The Q-Inv algorithm is compared to the inverse iteration method using the $\hat{H}^{-1}$ inverse (I-Iter) and the exact inverse by lower-upper decomposition (LU). Energy values are evaluated as the expectation values of the Hamiltonian. Results suggest that the Q-Inv method provides lower energy results than the I-Iter method up to a certain $k$, after which the energy increases due to errors in the numerical integration that are dependent of the integration interval. A combined Gaussian-quadrature and trapezoidal integration method proved to be more effective at reaching convergence while decreasing the number of operations. For systems like H$_4$, in which the Q-Inv can not reach the expected error threshold, we propose a combination of Q-Inv and I-Iter methods to further decrease the error with $k$ at lower computational cost. Finally, we summarize the recommended procedure when treating unknown systems.</description>

      <title>Photon Counting Interferometry to Detect Geontropic Space-Time Fluctuations with GQuEST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The GQuEST (Gravity from the Quantum Entanglement of Space-Time) experiment uses tabletop-scale Michelson laser interferometers to probe for fluctuations in space-time. We present an interferometer design featuring a novel photon counting readout method that provides unprecedented sensitivity, as it is not subject to the interferometric standard quantum limit. We evaluate the potential of this design to measure space-time fluctuations motivated by recent `geontropic' quantum gravity models. The accelerated accrual of statistical power offered by the photon counting readout enables GQuEST to detect the predicted quantum gravity phenomena within measurement times at least 100 times shorter than equivalent conventional interferometers. The GQuEST design thus enables a fast and sensitive search for signatures of quantum gravity in a laboratory-scale experiment.</description>

      <title>Haldane graphene billiards versus relativistic neutrino billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fluctuation properties in the energy spectra of finite-size honeycomb lattices, graphene billiards, subject to the Haldane-model onsite potential and next-nearest neighbor interaction at critical points, referred to as Haldane graphene billiards in the following. The billiards had the shapes of a rectangular billiard with integrable dynamics, one with chaotic dynamics, and one whose shape has, in addition, threefold rotational symmetry. It had been shown that the spectral properties of the graphene billiards coincide with those of the nonrelativistic quantum billiard with the corresponding shape, both at the band edges and in the region of low energy excitations around the Dirac points at zero energy. There, the dispersion relation is linear and, accordingly, the spectrum is described by the same relativistic Dirac equation for massless half-spin particles as relativistic neutrino billiards, whose spectral properties agree with those of nonrelativistic quantum billiards with violated time-reversal invariance. Deviations from the expected behavior are attributed to differing boundary conditions and backscattering at the boundary, which leads to a mixing of valley states corresponding to the two Dirac points, that are mapped into each other through time reversal. We employ a Haldane model to introduce a gap at one of the two Dirac points so that backscattering is suppressed in the energy region of the gap and demonstrate that there the correlations in the spectra comply with those of the neutrino billiard of the corresponding shape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the Hamiltonian hybrid coupling between a classical and a quantum subsystem. If applicable to classical gravity coupled to quantized matter, this hybrid theory might realize a captivating `postquantum' alternative to full quantum-gravity. We summarize the nonrelativistic hybrid dynamics in improved formalism adequate to Hamiltonian systems. The mandatory decoherence and diffusion terms become divergent in special and general relativistic extensions. It is not yet known if any renormalization method might reconcile Markovian decoherence and diffusion with relativity. Postquantum gravity could previously only be realized in the Newtonian approximation. We argue that pending problems of the recently proposed general relativistic postquantum theory will not be solved if Markovian diffusion/decoherence are truly incompatible with relativity.</description>

      <title>Quantization of optical quasinormal modes for spatially separated cavity systems with finite retardation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multi-cavity quantization scheme is developed using quasinormal modes (QNMs) of optical cavities embedded in a homogeneous background medium for cases where retardation is significant in the inter-cavity coupling. Using quantities that can be calculated in computational optics with numerical Maxwell solvers, we extend previous QNM quantization schemes and define a quantitative measure to determine if a separate quantization of QNM cavities is justified or if a joint quantization of the system is necessary. We test this measure for the examples of two coupled one-dimensional dielectric slabs and a dimer of metal nanorods acting as QNM cavities. For sufficiently large separations, the new scheme allows for an efficient treatment of multi-cavity phenomena using parameters defined for the individual cavities. Formulating the Hamiltonian in a familiar system-bath form, the scheme connects the rigorous QNM theory and widespread phenomenological models of open cavities coupled to a shared photonic bath with parameters obtained directly from Maxwell calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In paraxial approximation, the electromagnetic eigenmodes inside an optical microresonator can be derived from a Schr\"odinger-type eigenvalue problem. In this framework, tilting the cavity mirrors effectively introduces a linear potential to the system. In our work, we apply solution strategies for inverse problems to precisely determine and control the relative orientation of two mirrors forming an optical microcavity. Our approach employs the inversion of the Schr\"odinger equation to reconstruct the effective potential landscape, and thus mirror tilts, from observed mode patterns. We investigate regularization techniques to address the ill-posed nature of inverse problems and to improve the stability of solutions. Our method consistently achieves an angle resolution of order 100 nanoradians per measurement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis describes how isolated many-body quantum systems reach thermal equilibrium. However, quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation violate this hypothesis and cause nonthermal behavior. We demonstrate that Hilbert space fragmentation may arise from lattice geometry in a spin-1/2 model that conserves the number of domain walls. We generalize a known, one-dimensional, scarred model to larger dimensions and show that this model displays Hilbert space fragmentation on the Vicsek fractal lattice of arbitrary generation. Using Monte Carlo methods, the model is characterized as strongly fragmented on the Vicsek fractal lattice when the number of domain walls is either small or close to the maximal value. We show that the model displays signatures similar to Hilbert space fragmentation on the second-generation hexaflake fractal lattice, the two-dimensional lattice, and a modified two-dimensional lattice. We study the autocorrelation function of local observables and demonstrate that the model displays nonthermal dynamics.</description>

      <title>On Reducing the Execution Latency of Superconducting Quantum Processors via Quantum Program Scheduling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has gained considerable attention, especially after the arrival of the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. Quantum processors and cloud services have been made world-wide increasingly available. Unfortunately, programs on existing quantum processors are often executed in series, and the workload could be heavy to the processor. Typically, one has to wait for hours or even longer to obtain the result of a single quantum program on public quantum cloud due to long queue time. In fact, as the scale grows, the qubit utilization rate of the serial execution mode will further diminish, causing the waste of quantum resources. In this paper, to our best knowledge for the first time, the Quantum Program Scheduling Problem (QPSP) is formulated and introduced to improve the utility efficiency of quantum resources. Specifically, a quantum program scheduling method concerning the circuit width, number of measurement shots, and submission time of quantum programs is proposed to reduce the execution latency. We conduct extensive experiments on a simulated Qiskit noise model, as well as on the Xiaohong (from QuantumCTek) superconducting quantum processor. Numerical results show the effectiveness in both QPU time and turnaround time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal properties of quantum fields at finite temperature are crucial to understanding strongly interacting matter and recent development in quantum computing has provided an alternative and promising avenue of study. In this work, we study thermal field theories involving only fermions using quantum algorithms. We first delve into the presentations of fermion fields via qubits on digital quantum computers alongside the quantum algorithms such as quantum imaginary time evolutions employed to evaluate thermal properties of generic quantum field theories. Specifically, we show numerical results such as the thermal distribution and the energy density of thermal field theories for Majorana fermions in 1+1 dimensions using quantum simulators. In addition to free field theory, we also study the effects of interactions resulting from coupling with a spatially homogeneous Majorana field. In both cases, we show analytically that thermal properties of the system can be described using phase-space distributions, and the quantum simulation results agree with analytical and semiclassical expectations. Our work is an important step to understand thermal fixed points, preparing for quantum simulation of thermalization in real time.</description>

      <title>Spectral Multifractality and Emergent Energyscales Across the Many-Body Localisation Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scaling theory of the many-body localisation transition in terms of emergent, characteristic energyscales. The analysis is based on the decomposition of the eigenstates in the basis of trivially localised states, resolved in the energies of the latter, which we refer to as the spectral decomposition of the eigenstates. The characteristic energyscales emerge when the multifractal properties, or lack thereof, of the spectral decomposition are studied at different scales. These characteristic scales correspond to the ones, above which the spectral decompositions exhibit their global behaviour, namely full ergodicity in the ergodic phase and multifractality in the many-body localised phase. On the other hand, at scales below the characteristic ones, the decomposition in the ergodic phase shows finer (multi)fractal structures whereas in the localised phase, the decomposition picks out well-separated, localised resonant peaks. The scaling of these characteristic energyscales across the many-body localisation transition admits a scaling theory consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless type scenario and bears striking resemblances to that of inverse participation ratios of eigenstates.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we survey the existing quantum physics related games and based on them propose a definition for the concept of quantum games. We define quantum games as any type of rule-based games that use the principles or reference the theory of quantum physics or quantum phenomena through any of three proposed dimensions: the perceivable dimension of quantum physics, the dimension of quantum technologies, and the dimension of scientific purposes like citizen science or education. We also discuss the concept of quantum computer games, games on quantum computers and discuss the definitions for the concept of science games. At the same time, there are various games exploring quantum physics and quantum computing through digital, analogue, and hybrid means with diverse incentives driving their development. As interest in games as educational tools for supporting quantum literacy grows, understanding the diverse landscape of quantum games becomes increasingly important. We propose that three dimensions of quantum games identified in this article are used for designing, analysing and defining the phenomenon of quantum games.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.00386v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectral characterization of noise environments that lead to the decoherence of qubits is critical to developing robust quantum technologies. While dynamical decoupling offers one of the most successful approaches to characterize noise spectra, it necessitates applying large sequences of $\pi$ pulses that increase the complexity and cost of the method. Here, we introduce a noise spectroscopy method that utilizes only the Fourier transform of free induction decay or spin echo measurements, thus removing the need for the application many $\pi$ pulses. We show that our method faithfully recovers the correct noise spectra for a variety of different environments (including $1/f$-type noise) and outperforms previous dynamical decoupling schemes while significantly reducing their experimental overhead. We also discuss the experimental feasibility of our proposal and demonstrate its robustness in the presence of statistical measurement error. Our method is applicable to a wide range of quantum platforms and provides a simpler path toward a more accurate spectral characterization of quantum devices, thus offering possibilities for tailored decoherence mitigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general strategy for mapping fermionic systems to quantum hardware with square qubit connectivity which yields low-depth quantum circuits, counted in the number of native two-qubit fSIM gates. We achieve this by leveraging novel operator decomposition and circuit compression techniques paired with specifically chosen low-depth fermion-to-qubit mappings and allow for a high degree of gate cancellations and parallelism. Our mappings retain the flexibility to simultaneously optimize for qubit counts or qubit operator weights and can be used to investigate arbitrary fermionic lattice geometries. We showcase our approach by investigating the tight-binding model, the Fermi-Hubbard model as well as the multi-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori model. We report unprecedentedly low circuit depths per single Trotter layer with up to a $70 \%$ improvement upon previous state-of-the-art. Our compression technique also results in significant reduction of two-qubit gates. We find the lowest gate-counts when applying the XYZ-formalism to the DK mapping. Additionally, we show that our decomposition and compression formalism produces favourable circuits even when no native parameterized two-qubit gates are available.</description>

      <title>Complete Characterization of Entanglement Embezzlement</title>

Abstract: Using local operations and classical communication (LOCC), entanglement can be manipulated but not created. However, entanglement can be embezzled. In this work, we completely characterize universal embezzling families and demonstrate how this singles out the original family introduced by van Dam and Hayden. To achieve this, we first give a full characterization of pure to mixed state LOCC-conversions. Then, we introduce a new conversion distance and derive a closed-form expression for it. These results might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Criticality-enhanced Electric Field Gradient Sensor with Single Trapped Ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a driven-dissipative quantum sensor that is continuously monitored close to a dissipative critical point. The sensor relies on the critical open Rabi model with the spin and phonon degrees of freedom of a single trapped ion to achieve criticality-enhanced sensitivity. Effective continuous monitoring of the sensor is realized via a co-trapped ancilla ion that switches between dark and bright internal states conditioned on a `jump' of the phonon population which, remarkably, achieves nearly perfect phonon counting despite a low photon collection efficiency. By exploiting both dissipative criticality and efficient continuous readout, the sensor device achieves highly precise sensing of oscillating electric field gradients at a criticality-enhanced precision scaling beyond the standard quantum limit, which we demonstrate is robust to the experimental imperfections in real-world applications.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we introduce an autonomous method for addressing the detection and classification of quantum entanglement, a core element of quantum mechanics that has yet to be fully understood. We employ a multi-layer perceptron to effectively identify entanglement in both two- and three-qubit systems. Our technique yields impressive detection results, achieving nearly perfect accuracy for two-qubit systems and over $90\%$ accuracy for three-qubit systems. Additionally, our approach successfully categorizes three-qubit entangled states into distinct groups with a success rate of up to $77\%$. These findings indicate the potential for our method to be applied to larger systems, paving the way for advancements in quantum information processing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic is a property of quantum states that enables universal fault-tolerant quantum computing using simple sets of gate operations. Understanding the mechanisms by which magic is created or destroyed is, therefore, a crucial step towards efficient and practical fault-tolerant computation. We observe that a random stabilizer code subject to coherent errors exhibits a phase transition in magic, which we characterize through analytic, numeric and experimental probes. Below a critical error rate, stabilizer syndrome measurements remove the accumulated magic in the circuit, effectively protecting against coherent errors; above the critical error rate syndrome measurements concentrate magic. A better understanding of such rich behavior in the resource theory of magic could shed more light on origins of quantum speedup and pave pathways for more efficient magic state generation.</description>

Abstract: Accelerated light has been demonstrated with laser light and diffraction. Within the diffracting field it is possible to identify a portion that carries most of the beam energy, which propagates in a curved trajectory as it would have been accelerated by a gravitational field for instance. Here, we analyze the effects of this kind of acceleration over the entanglement between twin beams produced in spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Our results show that acceleration does not affect entanglement significantly, under ideal conditions. The optical scheme introduced can be useful in the understanding of processes in the boundary between gravitation and quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Operationally independent events can influence each other in quantum theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In any known description of nature, two physical systems are considered independent of each other if any action on one of the systems does not change the other system. From our classical intuitions about the world, we further conclude that these two systems are not affecting each other in any possible way, and thus these two systems are causally disconnected or they do not influence each other. Building on this idea, we show that in quantum theory such a notion of classical independence is not satisfied, that is, two quantum systems can still influence each other even if any operation on one of the systems does not create an observable effect on the other. For our purpose, we consider the framework of quantum networks and construct a linear witness utilizing the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality. We also discuss one of the interesting applications resulting from the maximal violation of classical independence towards device-independent certification of quantum states and measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantum speedups for linear programming via interior point methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a quantum algorithm based on an interior point method for solving a linear program with $n$ inequality constraints on $d$ variables. The algorithm explicitly returns a feasible solution that is $\varepsilon$-close to optimal, and runs in time $\sqrt{n} \cdot \mathrm{poly}(d,\log(n),\log(1/\varepsilon))$ which is sublinear for tall linear programs (i.e., $n \gg d$). Our algorithm speeds up the Newton step in the state-of-the-art interior point method of Lee and Sidford [FOCS~'14]. This requires us to efficiently approximate the Hessian and gradient of the barrier function, and these are our main contributions.
  To approximate the Hessian, we describe a quantum algorithm for the \emph{spectral approximation} of $A^T A$ for a tall matrix $A \in \mathbb R^{n \times d}$. The algorithm uses leverage score sampling in combination with Grover search, and returns a $\delta$-approximation by making $O(\sqrt{nd}/\delta)$ row queries to $A$. This generalizes an earlier quantum speedup for graph sparsification by Apers and de Wolf~[FOCS~'20]. To approximate the gradient, we use a recent quantum algorithm for multivariate mean estimation by Cornelissen, Hamoudi and Jerbi [STOC '22]. While a naive implementation introduces a dependence on the condition number of the Hessian, we avoid this by pre-conditioning our random variable using our quantum algorithm for spectral approximation.</description>

      <title>Automatic Detection of Nuclear Spins at Arbitrary Magnetic Fields via Signal-to-Image AI Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum sensors leverage matter's quantum properties to enable measurements with unprecedented spatial and spectral resolution. Among these sensors, those utilizing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond offer the distinct advantage of operating at room temperature. Nevertheless, signals received from NV centers are often complex, making interpretation challenging. This is especially relevant in low magnetic field scenarios, where standard approximations for modeling the system fail. Additionally, NV signals feature a prominent noise component. In this Letter, we present a signal-to-image deep learning model capable of automatically inferring the number of nuclear spins surrounding a NV sensor and the hyperfine couplings between the sensor and the nuclear spins. Our model is trained to operate effectively across various magnetic field scenarios, requires no prior knowledge of the involved nuclei, and is designed to handle noisy signals, leading to fast characterization of nuclear environments in real experimental conditions. With detailed numerical simulations, we test the performance of our model in scenarios involving varying numbers of nuclei, achieving an average error of less than $2\ \rm{kHz}$ in the estimated hyperfine constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large qubit capacity and an individual readout capability are two crucial requirements for large-scale quantum computing and simulation. As one of the leading physical platforms for quantum information processing, the ion trap has achieved quantum simulation of tens of ions with site-resolved readout in 1D Paul trap, and that of hundreds of ions with global observables in 2D Penning trap. However, integrating these two features into a single system is still very challenging. Here we report the stable trapping of 512 ions in a 2D Wigner crystal and the sideband cooling of their transverse motion. We demonstrate the quantum simulation of long-range quantum Ising models with tunable coupling strengths and patterns, with or without frustration, using 300 ions. Enabled by the site resolution in the single-shot measurement, we observe rich spatial correlation patterns in the quasi-adiabatically prepared ground states, which allows us to verify quantum simulation results by comparing with the calculated collective phonon modes and with classical simulated annealing. We further probe the quench dynamics of the Ising model in a transverse field to demonstrate quantum sampling tasks. Our work paves the way for simulating classically intractable quantum dynamics and for running NISQ algorithms using 2D ion trap quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Glassy word problems: ultraslow relaxation, Hilbert space jamming, and computational complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a family of local models of dynamics based on ``word problems'' from computer science and group theory, for which we can place rigorous lower bounds on relaxation timescales. These models can be regarded either as random circuit or local Hamiltonian dynamics, and include many familiar examples of constrained dynamics as special cases. The configuration space of these models splits into dynamically disconnected sectors, and for initial states to relax, they must ``work out'' the other states in the sector to which they belong. When this problem has a high time complexity, relaxation is slow. In some of the cases we study, this problem also has high space complexity. When the space complexity is larger than the system size, an unconventional type of jamming transition can occur, whereby a system of a fixed size is not ergodic, but can be made ergodic by appending a large reservoir of sites in a trivial product state. This manifests itself in a new type of Hilbert space fragmentation that we call fragile fragmentation. We present explicit examples where slow relaxation and jamming strongly modify the hydrodynamics of conserved densities. In one example, density modulations of wavevector $q$ exhibit almost no relaxation until times $O(\exp(1/q))$, at which point they abruptly collapse. We also comment on extensions of our results to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Unified understanding of the breakdown of thermal mixing dynamic nuclear polarization: the role of temperature and radical concentration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reveal an interplay between temperature and radical concentration necessary to establish thermal mixing (TM) as an efficient dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) mechanism. We conducted DNP experiments by hyperpolarizing widely used DNP samples, i.e., sodium pyruvate-1-$^{13}$C in water/glycerol mixtures at varying nitroxide radical (TEMPOL) concentrations and microwave irradiation frequencies, measuring proton and carbon-13 spin temperatures. Using a cryogen consumption-free prototype-DNP apparatus, we could probe cryogenic temperatures between 1.5 and 6.5 K, i.e., below and above the boiling point of liquid helium. We identify two mechanisms for the breakdown of TM: (i) Anderson type of quantum localization for low radical concentration, or (ii) quantum Zeno localization occurring at high temperature. This observation allowed us to reconcile the recent diverging observations regarding the relevance of TM as a DNP mechanism by proposing a unifying picture and, consequently, to find a trade-off between radical concentration and electron relaxation times, which offers a pathway to improve experimental DNP performance based on TM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations often entail a large computational burden on classical computers. At present, these simulations can require up to trillions of grid points and millions of time steps. To reduce costs, novel architectures like quantum computers may be intrinsically more efficient at the appropriate computation. Current quantum algorithms for solving CFD problems use a single quantum circuit and, in some cases, lattice-based methods. We introduce the a novel multiple circuits algorithm that makes use of a quantum lattice Boltzmann method (QLBM). The two-circuit algorithm we form solves the Navier-Stokes equations with a marked reduction in CNOT gates compared to existing QLBM circuits. The problem is cast as a stream function--vorticity formulation of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations and verified and tested on a 2D lid-driven cavity flow. We show that using separate circuits for the stream function and vorticity lead to a marked CNOT reduction: 35% in total CNOT count and 16% in combined gate depth. This strategy has the additional benefit of the circuits being able to run concurrently, further halving the seen gate depth. This work is intended as a step towards practical quantum circuits for solving differential equation-based problems of scientific interest.</description>

      <title>Expansion of higher-dimensional cubical complexes with application to quantum locally testable codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a high-dimensional cubical complex, for any dimension t&gt;0, and apply it to the design of quantum locally testable codes. Our complex is a natural generalization of the constructions by Panteleev and Kalachev and by Dinur et. al of a square complex (case t=2), which have been applied to the design of classical locally testable codes (LTC) and quantum low-density parity check codes (qLDPC) respectively.
  We turn the geometric (cubical) complex into a chain complex by relying on constant-sized local codes $h_1,\ldots,h_t$ as gadgets. A recent result of Panteleev and Kalachev on existence of tuples of codes that are product expanding enables us to prove lower bounds on the cycle and co-cycle expansion of our chain complex.
  For t=4 our construction gives a new family of "almost-good" quantum LTCs -- with constant relative rate, inverse-polylogarithmic relative distance and soundness, and constant-size parity checks. Both the distance of the quantum code and its local testability are proven directly from the cycle and co-cycle expansion of our chain complex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the influence of chiral Casimir-Polder (CP) forces in Talbot-Lau interferometry, based on three nanomechanical gratings. We study scenarios where the second grating is either directly written into a chiral material or where the nanomask is coated with chiral substances. We show requirements for probing enantiospecific effects in matter-wave interferometry in the transmission signal and the interference fringe visibility, which depend on the de Broglie wavelength and the molecular chirality. The proposed setup is particularly sensitive to CP forces in the non-retarded regime where chiral effects can be comparable in magnitude to their electric and magnetic counterparts. While the first and third gratings do not change the phase of the matter wave, applying a coating of chiral substances to them enhances the instrument's chiral selectivity.</description>

      <title>The role of polaron dressing in superradiant emission dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperative effects of multiple quantum emitters are characterized by transitions via delocalized collective states with altered emission properties due to the existence of inter-emitter coherences. When realized with excitonic condensed matter nanostructures, these effects are significantly affected by the presence of strong emitter-phonon coupling, which leads to the formation of polarons. We show that, while for single-emitter emission into free space this formation has no impact on its radiative lifetime, the same is not true for superradiant emission. Considering the case of two indistinguishable quantum emitters, we analyse how polaron dressing affects collective photon emission by mixing bright and dark Dicke states. Our numerical simulations show that this mixing crucially depends on the circumstances of the excitation of the system: Depending on the pulse length of an exciting laser, one can choose to either prepare polaronic Dicke states, or bare electronic Dicke states, changing the superradiant decay characteristics of the system. Additionally, we derive analytic expressions for these limiting cases, which match the results of numerically exact calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate single-shot and \textit{in situ} absorption imaging of individual Rydberg superatoms. This level of resolution is achieved using an electromagnetically induced transparency scheme involving a Rydberg energy level that is highly sensitive to the presence of Rydberg superatoms due to F\"{o}rster-resonance-enhanced dipole couplings. Spectroscopic measurements illustrate the existence of the F\"{o}rster resonance and underscore the state-selectivity of the technique. With an imaging exposure time as short as 3 $\mu$s, we successfully resolve linear chains of Rydberg superatoms excited in a one-dimensional configuration. The extracted second-order correlation shows strong anti-bunching due to excitation blockade, and a Fourier analysis reveals the long-range order in the chains of Rydberg superatoms. This imaging technique, with minimal destruction, will be of great interest for leveraging ensemble-encoded qubits in quantum computation and quantum simulation applications.</description>

      <title>Localization with non-Hermitian off-diagonal disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss a non-Hermitian system described via a one-dimensional single-particle tight-binding model, where the non-Hermiticity is governed by random nearest-neighbour tunnellings, such that the left-to-right and right-to-left hopping strengths are unequal. A physical situation of completely real eigenspectrum arises owing to the Hamiltonian's tridiagonal matrix structure under a simple sign conservation of the product of the conjugate nearest-neighbour tunnelling terms. The off-diagonal disorder leads the non-Hermitian system to a delocalization-localization crossover in finite systems. The emergent nature of the crossover is recognized through a finite-size spectral analysis. The system enters into a localized phase for infinitesimal disorder strength in the thermodynamic limit. We perform a careful scaling analysis of localization length, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and energy splitting and report the corresponding scaling exponents. Noticeably, in contrast to the diagonal disorder, the density of states (DOS) has a singularity at E=0 in the presence of the off-diagonal disorder and the corresponding wavefunction remains delocalized for any given disorder strength.</description>

      <title>Single-shot characterization of photon indistinguishability with dielectric metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the indistinguishability of photons is a key task in quantum photonics, underpinning the tuning and stabilization of the photon sources and thereby increasing the accuracy of quantum operations. The protocols for measuring the degree of indistinguishability conventionally require photon-coincidence measurements at several different time or phase delays, which is a fundamental bottleneck towards the fast measurements and real-time monitoring of indistinguishability. Here, we develop a static dielectric metasurface grating without any reconfigurable elements that realizes a tailored multiport transformation in the free-space configuration without the need for phase locking and enables single-shot characterization of the indistinguishability between two photons in multiple degrees of freedom including time, spectrum, spatial modes, and polarization. Topology optimization is employed to design a silicon metasurface with polarization independence, high transmission, and high tolerance to measurement noise. We fabricate the metasurface and experimentally quantify the indistinguishability of photons in the time domain with fidelity over 98.4\%. We anticipate that the developed framework based on ultrathin metasurfaces can be further extended for multi-photon states and additional degrees of freedom associated with spatial modalities.</description>

      <title>Background independent tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional holographic tensor networks can be described as toy holographic maps constructed from many small linear maps acting in a spatially local way, all connected together with ``background entanglement'', i.e. links of a fixed state, often the maximally entangled state. However, these constructions fall short of modeling real holographic maps. One reason is that their ``areas'' are trivial, taking the same value for all states, unlike in gravity where the geometry is dynamical. Recently, new constructions have ameliorated this issue by adding degrees of freedom that ``live on the links''. This makes areas non-trivial, equal to the background entanglement piece plus a new positive piece that depends on the state of the link degrees of freedom. Nevertheless, this still has the downside that there is background entanglement, and hence it only models relatively limited code subspaces in which every area has a definite minimum value given by the background entanglement. In this note, we simply point out that a version of these constructions goes one step further: they can be background independent, with no background entanglement in the holographic map. This is advantageous because it allows tensor networks to model holographic maps for larger code subspaces. In addition to pointing this out, we address some subtleties involved in making it work and point out a nice connection it offers to recent discussions of random CFT data.</description>

      <title>Continuum limit of the Green function in scaled affine $\varphi^4_4$ quantum Euclidean covariant relativistic field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove through path integral Monte Carlo computer experiments that the affine quantization of the $\varphi_4^4$ scaled Euclidean covariant relativistic scalar field theory is a valid quantum field theory with a well defined continuum limit of the one- and two-point-function. Affine quantization leads to a completely satisfactory quantization of field theories using situations that involve scaled behavior leading to an unexpected, $\hbar^2/\varphi^2$ which arises only in the quantum aspects.</description>

      <title>Complete equational theories for classical and quantum Gaussian relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give generators and relations for the hypergraph props of Gaussian relations and positive affine Lagrangian relations. The former extends Gaussian probabilistic processes by completely-uninformative priors, and the latter extends Gaussian quantum mechanics with infinitely-squeezed states. These presentations are given by adding a generator to the presentation of real affine relations and of real affine Lagrangian relations which freely codiscards effects, as well as certain rotations.
  The presentation of positive affine Lagrangian relations provides a rigorous justification for many common yet informal calculations in the quantum physics literature involving infinite-squeezing. Our presentation naturally extends Menicucci et al.'s graph-theoretic representation of Gaussian quantum states with a representation for Gaussian transformations. Using this graphical calculus, we also give a graphical proof of Braunstein and Kimble's continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol. We also interpret the LOv-calculus, a diagrammatic calculus for reasoning about passive linear-optical quantum circuits in our graphical calculus. Moreover, we show how our presentation allows for additional optical operations such as active squeezing.</description>

      <title>Analyticity and the Unruh effect: a study of local modular flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Unruh effect can be formulated as the statement that the Minkowski vacuum in a Rindler wedge has a boost as its modular flow. In recent years, other examples of states with geometrically local modular flow have played important roles in understanding energy and entropy in quantum field theory and quantum gravity. Here I initiate a general study of the settings in which geometric modular flow can arise, showing (i) that any geometric modular flow must be a conformal symmetry of the background spacetime, and (ii) that in a well behaved class of "weakly analytic" states, geometric modular flow must be future-directed. I further argue that if a geometric transformation is conformal but not isometric, then it can only be realized as modular flow in a conformal field theory. Finally, I discuss a few settings in which converse results can be shown -- i.e., settings in which a state can be constructed whose modular flow reproduces a given vector field.</description>

      <title>A new method for the solution of the two-body Dirac equation: Estimation of the weights of $C$, $P$ and $CP$ symmetry violating terms in positronium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new theoretical method is developed for the solution of the two-body bound-state Dirac equation for positronium. Only Coulomb potential was included in the Dirac Hamiltonian. It is shown that the two-body Dirac Hamiltonian can be written in the Hermitian matrix form of the $4\times 4$ size and contains terms, responsible for the violation of the $P$, $C$, and $CP$ symmetries. Numerical results for the energy spectrum of the para- and ortho-positronium ground states performed within the variational method using the harmonic oscillator basis functions are in good agreement with a high-precision finite-element method of T.C. Scott et al. The weights of the $P$ and $CP$ symmetry-violating components in the para-positronium ground state are identical to the weight of the $P$ symmetry-violating component of the ortho-Ps and are estimated to be 6.6E-6. The weights of the $C$ and $CP$ symmetry-violating components of the ortho-Ps are equal to the 2/3 and 1/3 parts of this value, respectively. These numbers are less by two orders of magnitude than the precision limit of current experimental facilities.</description>

      <title>Integrated electro-optics on thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electro-optics serves as the crucial bridge between electronics and photonics, unlocking a wide array of applications ranging from communications and computing to sensing and quantum information. Integrated electro-optics approaches in particular enable essential electronic high-speed control for photonics while offering substantial photonic parallelism for electronics. Recent strides in thin-film lithium niobate photonics have ushered revolutionary advancements in electro-optics. This technology not only offers the requisite strong electro-optic coupling but also boasts ultra-low optical loss and high microwave bandwidth. Further, its tight confinement and compatibility with nanofabrication allow for unprecedented reconfigurability and scalability, facilitating the creation of novel and intricate devices and systems that were once deemed nearly impossible in bulk systems. Building upon this platform, the field has witnessed the emergence of various groundbreaking electro-optic devices surpassing the current state of the art, and introducing functionalities that were previously non-existent. This technological leap forward provides a unique framework to explore various realms of physics as well, including photonic non-Hermitian synthetic dimensions, active topological physics, and quantum electro-optics. In this review, we present the fundamental principles of electro-optics, drawing connections between fundamental science and the forefront of technology. We discuss the accomplishments and future prospects of integrated electro-optics, enabled by thin-film lithium niobate platform.</description>
