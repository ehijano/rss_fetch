      <title>Information Theory in a Darwinian Evolution Population Dynamics Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using information theory, we propose an estimation method for traits parameters in a Darwinian evolution model for species with on trait or multiple traits. We use the Fisher's information to obtain the errors on the estimation for one species with one or multiple traits. We perform simulations to illustrate the method.</description>

      <title>Les Houches Lectures on Community Ecology: From Niche Theory to Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ecosystems are among the most interesting and well-studied examples of self-organized complex systems. Community ecology, the study of how species interact with each other and the environment, has a rich tradition. Over the last few years, there has been a growing theoretical and experimental interest in these problems from the physics and quantitative biology communities. Here, we give an overview of community ecology, highlighting the deep connections between ecology and statistical physics. We start by introducing the two classes of mathematical models that have served as the workhorses of community ecology: Consumer Resource Models (CRM) and the generalized Lotka-Volterra models (GLV). We place a special emphasis on graphical methods and general principles. We then review recent works showing a deep and surprising connection between ecological dynamics and constrained optimization. We then shift our focus by analyzing these same models in "high-dimensions" (i.e. in the limit where the number of species and resources in the ecosystem becomes large) and discuss how such complex ecosystems can be analyzed using methods from the statistical physics of disordered systems such as the cavity method and Random Matrix Theory.</description>

      <title>The Expected Sample Allele Frequencies from Populations of Changing Size via Orthogonal Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, discrete and stochastic changes in (effective) population size are incorporated into the spectral representation of a biallelic diffusion process for drift and small mutation rates. A forward algorithm inspired by Hidden-Markov-Model (HMM) literature is used to compute exact sample allele frequency spectra for three demographic scenarios: single changes in (effective) population size, boom-bust dynamics, and stochastic fluctuations in (effective) population size. An approach for fully agnostic demographic inference from these sample allele spectra is explored, and sufficient statistics for step-wise changes in population size are found. Further, convergence behaviours of the polymorphic sample spectra for population size changes on different time scales are examined and discussed within the context of inference of the effective population size. Joint visual assessment of the sample spectra and the temporal coefficients of the spectral decomposition of the forward diffusion process is found to be important in determining departure from equilibrium. Stochastic changes in (effective) population size are shown to shape sample spectra particularly strongly.</description>

      <title>Movement bias in asymmetric landscapes and its impact on population distribution and critical habitat size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ecologists have long investigated how demographic and movement parameters determine the spatial distribution and critical habitat size of a population. However, most models oversimplify movement behavior, neglecting how landscape heterogeneity influences individual movement. We relax this assumption and introduce a reaction-advection-diffusion equation that describes population dynamics when individuals exhibit space-dependent movement bias toward preferred regions. Our model incorporates two types of these preferred regions: a high-quality habitat patch, termed `habitat', which is included to model avoidance of degraded habitats like deforested regions; and a preferred location, such as a chemoattractant source or a watering hole, that we allow to be asymmetrically located with respect to habitat edges. In this scenario, the critical habitat size depends on both the relative position of the preferred location and the movement bias intensities. When preferred locations are near habitat edges, the critical habitat size can decrease when diffusion increases, a phenomenon called the drift paradox. Also, ecological traps arise when the habitat overcrowds due to excessive attractiveness or the preferred location is near a low-quality region. Our results highlight the importance of species-specific movement behavior and habitat preference as drivers of population dynamics in fragmented landscapes and, therefore, in the design of protected areas.</description>
