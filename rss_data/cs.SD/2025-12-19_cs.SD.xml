      <title>From Minutes to Days: Scaling Intracranial Speech Decoding with Supervised Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding speech from brain activity has typically relied on limited neural recordings collected during short and highly controlled experiments. Here, we introduce a framework to leverage week-long intracranial and audio recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, effectively increasing the training dataset size by over two orders of magnitude. With this pretraining, our contrastive learning model substantially outperforms models trained solely on classic experimental data, with gains that scale log-linearly with dataset size. Analysis of the learned representations reveals that, while brain activity represents speech features, its global structure largely drifts across days, highlighting the need for models that explicitly account for cross-day variability. Overall, our approach opens a scalable path toward decoding and modeling brain representations in both real-life and controlled task settings.</description>

      <title>Domain-Agnostic Causal-Aware Audio Transformer for Infant Cry Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and interpretable classification of infant cry paralinguistics is essential for early detection of neonatal distress and clinical decision support. However, many existing deep learning methods rely on correlation-driven acoustic representations, which makes them vulnerable to noise, spurious cues, and domain shifts across recording environments. We propose DACH-TIC, a Domain-Agnostic Causal-Aware Hierarchical Audio Transformer for robust infant cry classification. The model integrates causal attention, hierarchical representation learning, multi-task supervision, and adversarial domain generalization within a unified framework.
  DACH-TIC employs a structured transformer backbone with local token-level and global semantic encoders, augmented by causal attention masking and controlled perturbation training to approximate counterfactual acoustic variations. A domain-adversarial objective promotes environment-invariant representations, while multi-task learning jointly optimizes cry type recognition, distress intensity estimation, and causal relevance prediction. The model is evaluated on the Baby Chillanto and Donate-a-Cry datasets, with ESC-50 environmental noise overlays for domain augmentation.
  Experimental results show that DACH-TIC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including HTS-AT and SE-ResNet Transformer, achieving improvements of 2.6 percent in accuracy and 2.2 points in macro-F1 score, alongside enhanced causal fidelity. The model generalizes effectively to unseen acoustic environments, with a domain performance gap of only 2.4 percent, demonstrating its suitability for real-world neonatal acoustic monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>CogSR: Semantic-Aware Speech Super-Resolution via Chain-of-Thought Guided Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying speech super-resolution (SR) to recordings with severely low sampling rates is a critical challenge in digital archiving and investigative audio recovery. In these scenarios, the input lacks essential acoustic cues. Consequently, existing generative models often fail; without sufficient context, they hallucinate phonetic content, guessing words based on probability rather than meaning.
  To address this, we propose CogSR, a framework designed specifically for high-precision, offline restoration. Our approach shifts the focus from simple signal mapping to cognitive reconstruction. By integrating a Large Audio-Language Model, we employ Chain-of-Thought reasoning to act as a semantic anchor, while explicit acoustic priors ensure the speaker's identity remains consistent. This guides a Rectified Flow backbone to synthesize high-frequency details that are not only realistic but linguistically accurate. Evaluations show that CogSR effectively eliminates ambiguity in severe degradation regimes, making it a robust solution for restoring high-value legacy and surveillance audio.</description>

      <title>DPDFNet: Boosting DeepFilterNet2 via Dual-Path RNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DPDFNet, a causal single-channel speech enhancement model that extends DeepFilterNet2 architecture with dual-path blocks in the encoder, strengthening long-range temporal and cross-band modeling while preserving the original enhancement framework. In addition, we demonstrate that adding a loss component to mitigate over-attenuation in the enhanced speech, combined with a fine-tuning phase tailored for "always-on" applications, leads to substantial improvements in overall model performance. To compare our proposed architecture with a variety of causal open-source models, we created a new evaluation set comprising long, low-SNR recordings in 12 languages across everyday noise scenarios, better reflecting real-world conditions than commonly used benchmarks. On this evaluation set, DPDFNet delivers superior performance to other causal open-source models, including some that are substantially larger and more computationally demanding. We also propose an holistic metric named PRISM, a composite, scale-normalized aggregate of intrusive and non-intrusive metrics, which demonstrates clear scalability with the number of dual-path blocks. We further demonstrate on-device feasibility by deploying DPDFNet on Ceva-NeuPro-Nano edge NPUs. Results indicate that DPDFNet-4, our second-largest model, achieves real-time performance on NPN32 and runs even faster on NPN64, confirming that state-of-the-art quality can be sustained within strict embedded power and latency constraints.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Cepstrum: Pitch Modification for Mel-Based Neural Vocoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a cepstrum-based pitch modification method that can be applied to any mel-spectrogram representation. As a result, this method is compatible with any mel-based vocoder without requiring any additional training or changes to the model. This is achieved by directly modifying the cepstrum feature space in order to shift the harmonic structure to the desired target. The spectrogram magnitude is computed via the pseudo-inverse mel transform, then converted to the cepstrum by applying DCT. In this domain, the cepstral peak is shifted without having to estimate its position and the modified mel is recomputed by applying IDCT and mel-filterbank. These pitch-shifted mel-spectrogram features can be converted to speech with any compatible vocoder. The proposed method is validated experimentally with objective and subjective metrics on various state-of-the-art neural vocoders as well as in comparison with traditional pitch modification methods.</description>

      <title>Hearing to Translate: The Effectiveness of Speech Modality Integration into LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) expand beyond text, integrating speech as a native modality has given rise to SpeechLLMs, which aim to translate spoken language directly, thereby bypassing traditional transcription-based pipelines. Whether this integration improves speech-to-text translation quality over established cascaded architectures, however, remains an open question. We present Hearing to Translate, the first comprehensive test suite rigorously benchmarking 5 state-of-the-art SpeechLLMs against 16 strong direct and cascade systems that couple leading speech foundation models (SFM), with multilingual LLMs. Our analysis spans 16 benchmarks, 13 language pairs, and 9 challenging conditions, including disfluent, noisy, and long-form speech. Across this extensive evaluation, we find that cascaded systems remain the most reliable overall, while current SpeechLLMs only match cascades in selected settings and SFMs lag behind both, highlighting that integrating an LLM, either within the model or in a pipeline, is essential for high-quality speech translation.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Edge-Cloud Inference for Speech-to-Action Systems Using ASR and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Voice-based interaction has emerged as a natural and intuitive modality for controlling IoT devices. However, speech-driven edge devices face a fundamental trade-off between cloud-based solutions, which offer stronger language understanding capabilities at the cost of latency, connectivity dependence, and privacy concerns, and edge-based solutions, which provide low latency and improved privacy but are limited by computational constraints. This paper presents ASTA, an adaptive speech-to-action solution that dynamically routes voice commands between edge and cloud inference to balance performance and system resource utilization. ASTA integrates on-device automatic speech recognition and lightweight offline language-model inference with cloud-based LLM processing, guided by real-time system metrics such as CPU workload, device temperature, and network latency. A metric-aware routing mechanism selects the inference path at runtime, while a rule-based command validation and repair component ensures successful end-to-end command execution. We implemented our solution on an NVIDIA Jetson-based edge platform and evaluated it using a diverse dataset of 80 spoken commands. Experimental results show that ASTA successfully routes all input commands for execution, achieving a balanced distribution between online and offline inference. The system attains an ASR accuracy of 62.5% and generates executable commands without repair for only 47.5% of inputs, highlighting the importance of the repair mechanism in improving robustness. These results suggest that adaptive edge-cloud orchestration is a viable approach for resilient and resource-aware voice-controlled IoT systems.</description>

      <title>DisCo-Speech: Controllable Zero-Shot Speech Generation with A Disentangled Speech Codec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent codec-based language models~(LMs) have revolutionized text-to-speech~(TTS). However, since standard codecs tightly couple timbre and prosody, continuation-based LMs inevitably replicate this entanglement, hindering independent control. Recent efforts attempt to break this entanglement via codec design, but insufficient decoupling remains a critical bottleneck. To tackle this challenge, we propose DisCo-Speech, a zero-shot controllable TTS framework that enables prosody control and voice cloning via a disentangled speech codec (DisCodec) and an LM-based generator. The core component, DisCodec, contains two core stages: 1) Tri-factor disentanglement, which explicitly factorizes speech into content, prosody, and timbre subspaces via parallel encoders and hybrid losses; and 2) Fusion and reconstruction, which fuses content and prosody into unified content-prosody tokens suitable for LM prediction, while jointly optimizing reconstruction quality to resolve the disentanglement-reconstruction trade-off. With this design, the LM performs prosodic continuation from a style prompt while the decoder handles target timbre injection, enabling flexible zero-shot control. Experiments show that DisCo-Speech matches state-of-the-art voice cloning performance while outperforming baselines in zero-shot prosody control. By resolving the core entanglement at the codec level, DisCo-Speech provides a robust foundation for controllable speech synthesis. Audio samples are available at https://github.com/disco-speech/DisCo-Speech, and the code and weights will be released at the same link.</description>

      <title>Optimizing tiny colorless feedback delay networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11216v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common bane of artificial reverberation algorithms is spectral coloration in the synthesized sound, typically manifesting as metallic ringing, leading to a degradation in the perceived sound quality. In delay network methods, coloration is more pronounced when fewer delay lines are used. This paper presents an optimization framework in which a tiny differentiable feedback delay network, with as few as four delay lines, is used to learn a set of parameters to iteratively reduce coloration. The parameters under optimization include the feedback matrix, as well as the input and output gains. The optimization objective is twofold: to maximize spectral flatness through a spectral loss while maintaining temporal density by penalizing sparseness in the parameter values. A favorable narrow distribution of modal excitation is achieved while maintaining the desired impulse response density. In a subjective assessment, the new method proves effective in reducing perceptual coloration of late reverberation. Compared to the author's previous work, which serves as the baseline and utilizes a sparsity loss in the time domain, the proposed method achieves computational savings while maintaining performance. The effectiveness of this work is demonstrated through two application scenarios where smooth-sounding synthetic room impulse responses are obtained via the introduction of attenuation filters and an optimizable scattering feedback matrix.</description>
