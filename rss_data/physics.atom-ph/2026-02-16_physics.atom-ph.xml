      <title>Measurements of diffusion coefficients for rubidium--inert gas mixtures using coherent scattering from optically pumped population gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present comprehensive determinations of the diffusion coefficients $D$ at $T=24\,\degree$C for trace amounts of naturally abundant Rb atoms in inert, naturally abundant He, Ne, N$_2$, Ar, Kr, and Xe buffer gases using a single measurement technique. We establish a spatially periodic population grating in the Rb sample using two laser beams that intersect at a small angle $\theta$ of a few milliradians. The atomic population grating decays exponentially in time due to diffusive motion induced by momentum-changing elastic collisions between Rb and buffer gas atoms or molecules, and is monitored by observing the scattered field from a read-out beam. We distinguish the contribution of diffusion from other collisional processes by measuring the characteristic $\theta^2$ dependence of the decay rate. We also measure the systematic dependence of the decay rate on the buffer gas pressure over a range of $7\,000$ Pa to $90\,000$ Pa. In this manner, we obtain diffusion coefficients at standard atmospheric pressure of $101\,325$ Pa and at a temperature of 24.0(5)~$^\circ$C. We obtain weighted averages of $0.33(5)$ cm$^2$/s, $0.214(14)$ cm$^2$/s, $0.132(7)$ cm$^2$/s, $0.123(9)$ cm$^2$/s, $0.093(9)$ cm$^2$/s, and $0.073(4)$ cm$^2$/s for Rb in He, Ne, N$_2$, Ar, Kr, and Xe, respectively. We compare this data with diffusion coefficients obtained using quantum, classical, and semi-classical theoretical methods based on the most accurate interatomic interaction potentials from the literature. Our computed diffusion coefficients based on the quantum theory agree with the experimental determinations when systematic effects are taken into account. Our measurements and modeling are relevant to the optimization of magnetometers, imaging using spin-polarized noble gases, tests of collision models based on interatomic potentials, and the development of pressure sensors.</description>

      <title>Sympathetic cooling of charged particles in Penning traps using electron cyclotron radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new technique for cooling arbitrary charged particles in a Penning trap by utilizing self-cooled electrons stored in a separate, macroscopically distant Penning trap as the cooling medium. The electrons decay predominantly to their motional ground state by emission of cyclotron radiation, which results in extremely low temperatures in the realm of single-digit quantum numbers in the motional degrees of freedom of the sympathetically cooled particle species. This opens up an exciting new frontier of tests of fundamental physics in Penning traps. This article provides a conceptual overview as well as a quantum-mechanical description of the involved cooling dynamics. The first implementation of this technique is currently being realized at the dedicated ELCOTRAP experiment at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics, which introduces special features for a quick iterative technical development cycle. Its current status, first results from commissioning, and future prospects will be presented.</description>

      <title>Towards Trapped-Ion Thermometry Using Cavity-Based EIT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a technique for measuring ion temperature using cavity-based electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) applicable for cavity-qed systems in the strong coupling regime. This method enables efficient extraction of the ion's phonon occupation number following sub-Doppler cooling close to the motional ground state. The proposed method relies on monitoring the cavity probe transmission while scanning the probe laser frequency once cavity EIT is established using the control beam, significantly simplifying the measurement procedure. We theoretically establish a model that demonstrates influence of thermal state of the trapped ion vis a vis the EIT linewidth measured. We show how the cavity EIT transmission may be used as a thermometry tool to deduce the ion temperature as well as the motional state for an ion in the sub-Doppler cooling regime. The current method can only be used for operation in the resolved-sideband regime, where individual motional states can be selectively addressed for all relevant transitions either by selecting appropriate energy levels for the three-level system or by employing strong confinement with high secular frequencies ($\sim 10 MHz$).</description>

      <title>Shift of the Bose-Einstein condensation transition in the presence of a second atomic species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic interactions play an important role in the properties of ultracold atomic gases. In single component bosonic systems, its effect is already present at the critical point for the Bose-Einstein condensate phase transition by shifting it to lower temperatures as a consequence of effective repulsion between the atoms. When considering atomic bosonic mixtures, interesting effects arise from the competition between intra- and interspecies interactions such as the miscible-immiscible phase transition and the particular case of self-bounded quantum droplets. In such a scenario, it is natural to expect that these interactions will also affect the critical point of each species composing the mixture. In this paper, we obtain analytical expressions for the critical temperature shift of the phase transition to a Bose-Einstein condensate in the presence of a second species. We treat differently the cases in with the second species is above or below its own critical temperature and apply the obtained relations to the case of a $^{23}$Na-$^{39}$K bosonic mixture which can be realized in current running experimental setups. Our findings can be easily extended to other atomic mixtures trapped by arbitrary conservative traps.</description>

      <title>Quantum logic control and entanglement in hybrid atom-molecule arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polar molecules, with their rich internal structure, offer immense potential for fundamental physics, quantum technology, and controlled chemistry. However, their utilization is currently limited because of slow and imperfect state detection and weak dipolar interaction, limiting fast and large-scale entanglement generation. We propose and analyze a scheme for quantum logic control and measurement-based state preparation in a hybrid platform of polar molecules and neutral atoms. The method leverages fast, high-fidelity atom-molecule gates and high-fidelity atomic ancilla measurements to overcome the common challenges in molecule-only platforms, while preserving their diverse structural advantages. The proposed atom-molecule controlled-phase gate is based on resonant dipole-dipole exchange between a molecular rotational transition and an atomic Rydberg transition, rendering it three orders of magnitude faster than any direct molecule-molecule entangling gate. We further study several applications of our scheme including the preparation of molecular GHZ states for quantum enhanced precision measurements, the preparation of exotic molecular qudit states with topological order, and measurement-altered criticality. Our scheme is applicable to any polar molecule. It expands the paradigm of quantum logic control and paves the way to large-scale molecular entangled states. More generally, it highlights a concrete hybrid quantum system in which each qubit is utilized in an optimal way and where the measurement-based approach can yield a significant advantage in near-term devices.</description>

Consolidated atomic data is essential for the planning, execution, and evaluation of experiments. In this reference, we present physical and optical properties of neutral $^{171}$Yb relevant to these applications. We emphasize experimental results and supplement these with theoretical estimates. We present equations to convert values and derive important parameters.

      <title>Low-SWaP Magneto-optical Trap using both Planar Optical and Magnetic Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact, lightweight, and energy-efficient cold atom systems are crucial for advancing quantum technologies, yet their realization remains constrained by the bulky optical and magnetic components required in current atom trapping architectures. Here, we demonstrate a low-SWaP magneto-optical trap that seamlessly integrates planar optical and magnetic components into a unified platform. A monolithic dual-functional metasurface simultaneously polarized and shapes the cooling beam, replacing traditional lens-waveplate assemblies and converting a linearly polarized Gaussian beam into a circularly polarized flat-top beam. In parallel, a planar coil chip substitutes bulky anti-Helmholtz cols and generated the required quadrupole magnetic field with drastically reduced power consumption. Under D2 line cooling of 87Rb atoms, the fully planar system delivers nearly an order-of-magnitude improvement in trapping performance while operating at a fraction of the size, weight, and power of traditional systems. This compact, bulky-component-free approach offers a scalable, energy-efficient pathway toward chip-scale cold atom platforms.</description>
