      <title>The Large Deviation Principle for Stochastic Flow of Stochastic Slow-Fast Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a kind of fully coupled slow fast motion, in which the slow variable satisfies the non Lipschitz condition. We prove that the stochastic flow of the slow variable exists and moreover, satisfies the large deviation principle. The argument is mainly based on Khasminskii's averaging principle, the variational representation of the exponential functional of the Brownian motion, and the weak convergence framework proposed by Budhiraja and Dupuis.</description>

      <title>Percolation at the uniqueness threshold via subgroup relativization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study percolation on nonamenable groups at the uniqueness threshold $p_u$, the critical value that separates the phase in which there are infinitely many infinite clusters from the phase in which there is a unique infinite cluster. The number of infinite clusters at $p_u$ itself is a subtle question, depending on the choice of group, with only a relatively small number of examples understood. In this paper, we do the following:
  1. Prove non-uniqueness at $p_u$ in a new class of examples, namely those groups that contain an amenable, $wq$-normal subgroup of exponential growth. Concrete new examples to which this result applies include lamplighters over nonamenable base groups.
  2. Prove a co-heredity property of a certain strong form of non-uniqueness at $p_u$, stating that this property is inherited from a $wq$-normal subgroup to the entire group. Remarkably, this co-heredity property is the same as that proven for the vanishing of the first $\ell^2$ Betti number by Peterson and Thom (Invent. Math. 2011), supporting the conjecture that the two properties are equivalent.
  Our proof is based on the method of subgroup relativization, and relies in particular on relativized versions of uniqueness monotonicity, the equivalence of non-uniqueness and connectivity decay, the sharpness of the phase transition, and the Burton-Keane theorem. As a further application of the relative Burton-Keane theorem, we resolve a question of Lyons and Schramm (Ann. Probab. 1999) concerning intersections of random walks with percolation clusters.</description>

      <title>Series expansions for SPDEs with symmetric $\alpha$-stable L\'evy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we examine a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven by a symmetric $\alpha$-stable (S$\alpha$S) L\'evy noise, that is multiplied by a linear function $\sigma(u)=u$ of the solution. The solution is interpreted in the mild sense. For this models, in the case of the Gaussian noise, the solution has an explicit Wiener chaos expansion, and is studied using tools from Malliavin calculus. These tools cannot be used for an infinite-variance L\'evy noise. In this article, we provide sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution, and we give an explicit series expansion of this solution. To achieve this, we use the multiple stable integrals, which were developed in Samorodnitsky and Taqqu (1990, 1991), and originate from the LePage series representation of the noise. To give a meaning to the stochastic integral which appears in the definition of solution, we embed the space-time L\'evy noise into a L\'evy basis, and use the stochastic integration theory (Bichteler and Jacod 1983, Bichteler 2002) with respect to this object, as in other studies of SPDEs with heavy-tailed noise: Chong (2017a), Chong (2017b), Chong, Dalang and Humeau (2019). As applications, we consider the heat and wave equations with linear multiplicative noise, also called the parabolic/hyperbolic Anderson models.</description>

      <title>Alternate definitions of Gini, Hoover and Lorenz measures of inequalities and convergence with respect to the Wasserstein W$_1$ metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on some properties of three tools used to measure economic inequalities with respect to a distribution of wealth $\mu$: Gini coefficient $G$, Hoover coefficient or Robin Hood coefficient $H$, and the Lorenz concentration curve $L$. To express the distributions of resources, we use the framework of random variables and abstract Borel measures, rather than discrete samples or probability densities. This allows us to consider arbitrary distributions of wealth, e.g. mixtures between discrete and continuous distributions.
  In the first part (sections~\ref{section_altdefs_lorenz}--\ref{section_altdefs_gini_hoover_application}), we discuss alternate definitions of $G$, $H$ and $L$ that can be found in economics literature. The Lorenz curve is defined as the normalized integral of the quantile function (\cite{gastwirth1971}), which is not the same as saying "$L(p)$ is the share of wealth owned by the $100p$ first centiles of the population" (proposition~\ref{lorenz_definition_match_condition}). The Gini and Hoover coefficients are introduced in terms of expectation of random variables. In section~\ref{section_altdefs_gini_hoover}, we interpret Gini and Hoover as geometrical properties of the Lorenz curve (theorem \ref{theorem_alternate_def_gini} and corollary \ref{theorem_alternate_def_hoover_max}). In particular, we give a more general and straightforward proof of the main result of \cite{dorfman1979}. Section~\ref{section_altdefs_gini_hoover_application} gives two direct applications. We \emph{en route} prove the (not trivial) fact that the Lorenz curve fully characterizes a distribution, up to a rescaling (proposition~\ref{bijection_M_Lorspace_R}).
  The second part of the article (section~\ref{section_convergence_results}--\ref{section_weaker_asumptions_cv}) focuses on the consistency of $G(\mu)$, $H(\mu)$ and $L_\mu$ as $\mu$ is approximated or perturbated. The relevant tool to use is the Wasserstein metric $\Wone$, i.e. the $\Lone$ metric between quantile functions. $\Wone(\mu_n, \mu_\infty) \to 0$ if and only if underlying random variables converge in distribution and the total amount of wealth converges. In theorem~\ref{characterization_lorenz_convergence} and proposition~\ref{convergence_indicators}, we show that if $\Wone(\mu_n, \mu_\infty) \to 0$, then $G(\mu_n) \to G(\mu_\infty)$, $H(\mu_n) \to H(\mu_\infty)$ and $L_{\mu_n} \to L_{\mu_\infty}$ uniformly. Subsection~\ref{subsection_topo} discusses topological implications of this fact. Thus, applications \ref{convergence_corollary_noise}, \ref{convergence_corollary_sampling}, \ref{convergence_corollary_quantiles}, \ref{convergence_corollary_quantiles_and_sampling} and \ref{convergence_corollary_sampling_kernel} justify that the empirical Gini, Hoover indexes and Lorenz curves computed on a sample or rebuilt with partial information converge to the real Gini, Hoover indexes and Lorenz curve as information increases. Eventually, in section~\ref{section_weaker_asumptions_cv}, we discuss the situations where the $\Wone$ convergence is not ensured, but weaker asumptions can be made (convergence in distribution in~\ref{subsection_weak_convergence}, convergence of means in~\ref{subsection_convergence_means} or uniform integrability in~\ref{subsection_ui})</description>

      <title>Random Markov property for random walks in random environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random walks in dynamic random environments and propose a criterion which, if satisfied, allows to decompose the random walk trajectory into i.i.d. increments, and ultimately to prove limit theorems. The criterion involves the construction of a random field built from the environment, that has to satisfy a certain random Markov property along with some mixing estimates. We apply this criterion to correlated environments such as Boolean percolation and renewal chains featuring polynomial decay of correlations.</description>

      <title>Necessary and sufficient condition for CLT of linear spectral statistics of sample correlation matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the central limit theorem (CLT) for the linear spectral statistics (LSS) of sample correlation matrix $R$, constructed from a $p\times n$ data matrix $X$ with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) entries having mean zero, variance one, and infinite fourth moments in the high-dimensional regime $n/p\rightarrow \phi\in \mathbb{R}_+\backslash \{1\}$. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the CLT. More precisely, under the assumption that the identical distribution $\xi$ of the entries in $X$ satisfies $\mathbb{P}(|\xi|&gt;x)\sim l(x)x^{-\alpha}$ when $x\rightarrow \infty$ for $\alpha \in (2,4]$, where $l(x)$ is a slowly varying function, we conclude that: (i). When $\alpha\in(3,4]$, the universal asymptotic normality for the LSS of sample correlation matrix holds, with the same asymptotic mean and variance as in the finite fourth moment scenario; (ii) We identify a necessary and sufficient condition $\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}x^3\mathbb{P}(|\xi|&gt;x)=0$ for the universal CLT; (iii) We establish a local law for $\alpha \in (2, 4]$. Overall, our proof strategy follows the routine of the matrix resampling, intermediate local law, Green function comparison, and characteristic function estimation. In various parts of the proof, we are required to come up with new approaches and ideas to solve the challenges posed by the special structure of sample correlation matrix. Our results also demonstrate that the symmetry condition is unnecessary for the CLT of LSS for sample correlation matrix, but the tail index $\alpha$ plays a crucial role in determining the asymptotic behaviors of LSS for $\alpha \in (2, 3)$.</description>

      <title>q--exchangeable Measures and Transformations in Interacting Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides unified calculations regarding certain measures and transformations in interacting particle systems. More specifically, we provide certain general conditions under which an interacting particle system will have a reversible measure, gauge transformation, or ground state transformation. Additionally, we provide a method to prove that these conditions hold. This method uses certain quantum groups, and in that context the general conditions specialize to a \(q\)--exchangeable property.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of trees with vertices of fixed degrees and heights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider large uniform random trees where we fix for each vertex its degree and height. We prove, under natural conditions of convergence for the profile, that those trees properly renormalized converge. To this end, we study the paths from random vertices to the root using coalescent processes. As an application, we obtain scaling limits of Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson trees in varying environment.</description>

      <title>Cone Types and Spectral Radius of Hyperbolic Triangle Groups and Hyperbolic Tessellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of tessellations of the hyperbolic plane, especially the ones associated to hyperbolic triangle groups $\Delta(l,m,n)$. We give a full description of the cone types of these graphs and show that their number depends only on the defining parameters of the group. We then use the cone types structure to provide estimates of the spectral radius for the simple random walk on these tessellations, from above and from below.</description>

      <title>Residual Diffusivity for Noisy Bernoulli Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a discrete time Markov process $X^\varepsilon$ on $\mathbb R^d$ that makes a deterministic jump prescribed by a map $\varphi \colon \mathbb R^d \to \mathbb R^d$, and then takes a small Gaussian step of variance $\varepsilon^2$. For certain chaotic maps $\varphi$, the effective diffusivity of $X^\varepsilon$ may be bounded away from $0$ as $\varepsilon \to 0$. This is known as residual diffusivity, and in this paper we prove residual diffusivity occurs for a class of maps $\varphi$ obtained from piecewise affine expanding Bernoulli maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on the application of the Heston model to option pricing, employing both theoretical derivations and empirical validations. The Heston model, known for its ability to incorporate stochastic volatility, is derived and analyzed to evaluate its effectiveness in pricing options. For practical application, we utilize Monte Carlo simulations alongside market data from the Crude Oil WTI market to test the model's accuracy. Machine learning based optimization methods are also applied for the estimation of the five Heston parameters. By calibrating the model with real-world data, we assess its robustness and relevance in current financial markets, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical finance models and their practical implementations.</description>

      <title>A dynamic optimal reinsurance strategy with capital injections in the Cramer-Lundberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we consider the surplus process of an insurance company within the CramerLundberg framework. We study the optimal reinsurance strategy and dividend distribution of an insurance company under proportional reinsurance, in which capital injections are allowed. Our aim is to find a general dynamic reinsurance strategy that maximizes the expected discounted cumulative dividends until the time of passage below a given level, called ruin. These policies consist in stopping at the first time when the size of the overshoot below 0 exceeds a certain limit, and only pay dividends when the reserve reaches an upper barrier. Using analytical methods, we identify the value function as a particular solution to the associated Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equation. This approach leads to an exhaustive and explicit characterization of optimal policy. The proportional reinsurance is given via comprehensive structure equations. Furthermore we give some examples illustrating the applicability of this method for proportional reinsurance treaties.</description>

      <title>Minimal Representation of General Phase-type Distributions: A Non-convex Optimization Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a continuous-time phase-type distribution, starting with its Laplace-Stieltjes transform, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for its minimal phase-type representation to have the same order as the algebraic degree of the Laplace-Stieltjes transform. To facilitate finding this minimal representation, we transform this condition equivalently into a quadratic nonconvex optimization problem, which can be effectively addressed using an alternating minimization algorithm. The algorithm convergence is also proved. Moreover, the method we develop for the continuous-time phase-type distributions can be directly used to the discrete-time phase-type distributions after establishing an equivalence between the minimal representation problems for continuous-time and discrete-times phase-type distributions.</description>

      <title>Trust in society: A stochastic compartmental model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a novel stochastic compartmental model that describes the dynamics of trust in society. The population is split into three compartments representing levels of trust in society: trusters, skeptics and doubters. The focus lies on assessing the long-term dynamics, under `bounded confidence' i.e., trusters and doubters do not communicate). We state and classify the stationary points of the system's mean behavior. We find that an increase in life-expectancy, and a greater population may increase the proportion of individuals who lose their trust completely. In addition, the relationship between the rate at which doubters convince skeptics to join their cause and the expected number of doubters is not monotonic -- it does not always help to be more convincing to ensure the survival of your group. We numerically illustrate the workings of our analysis. Because the study of stochastic compartmental models for social dynamics is not common, we in particular shed light on the limitations of deterministic compartmental models.
  In our experiments we make use of fluid and diffusion approximation techniques as well as Gillespie simulation.</description>

      <title>Averaging principle for SDEs with singular drifts driven by $\alpha$-stable processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence rate of the averaging principle for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with $\beta$-H\"older drift driven by $\alpha$-stable processes. More specifically, we first derive the Schauder estimate for nonlocal partial differential equations (PDEs) associated with the aforementioned SDEs, within the framework of Besov-H\"older spaces. Then we consider the case where $(\alpha,\beta)\in(0,2)\times(1-\tfrac{\alpha}{2},1)$. Using the Schauder estimate, we establish the strong convergence rate for the averaging principle. In particular, under suitable conditions we obtain the optimal rate of strong convergence when $(\alpha,\beta)\in(\tfrac{2}{3},1]\times(2-\tfrac{3\alpha}{2},1)\cup(1,2)\times(\tfrac{\alpha}{2},1)$. Furthermore, when $(\alpha,\beta)\in(0,1]\times(1-\alpha,1-\tfrac{\alpha}{2}]\cup(1,2)\times(\tfrac{1-\alpha}{2},1-\tfrac{\alpha}{2}]$, we show the convergence of the martingale solutions of original systems to that of the averaged equation.

      <title>Age of gossip from connective properties via first passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In gossip networks, a source node forwards time-stamped updates to a network of observers according to a Poisson process. The observers then update each other on this information according to Poisson processes as well. The Age of Information (AoI) of a given node is the difference between the current time and the most recent time-stamp of source information that the node has received.
  We provide a method for evaluating the AoI of a node in terms of first passage percolation. We then use this distributional identity to prove matching upper and lower bounds on the AoI in terms of connectivity properties of the underlying network. In particular, if one sets $X_v$ to be the AoI of node $v$ on a finite graph $G$ with $n$ nodes, then we define $m_\ast = \min\{m : m \cdot |B_m(v)| \geq n\}$ where $B_m(v)$ is the ball of radius $m$ in $G$. In the case when the maximum degree of $G$ is bounded by $\Delta$ we prove $\mathbb{E} X_v = \Theta_\Delta(m_\ast)$.
  As corollaries, we solve multiple open problems in the literature such as showing the age of information on a subset of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is $\Theta(n^{1/(d+1)})$.
  We also demonstrate examples of graphs with AoI scaling like $n^{\alpha}$ for each $\alpha \in (0,1/2)$. These graphs are not vertex-transitive and in fact we show that if one considers the AoI on a graph coming from a vertex-transitive infinite graph then either $\mathbb{E} X_v = \Theta(n^{1/k})$ for some integer $k \geq 2$ or $\mathbb{E} X_v = n^{o(1)}$.</description>

      <title>Competitive Hele-Shaw flow and quadratic differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate a generalization of the Hele-Shaw flow with injection where several droplets compete for space as they try to expand due to internal pressure while still preserving their topology. Droplets are described by their closed non-crossing interface curves in $\mathbb{C}$ or more generally in a Riemann surface of finite type. Our main focus is on stationary solutions which we show correspond to the critical vertical trajectories of a particular quadratic differential with second order poles at the source points. The quadratic differentials that arise in this way have a simple description in terms of their associated half-translation surfaces. Existence of stationary solutions is proved in some generality by solving an extremal problem involving an electrostatic energy functional, generalizing a classic problem studied by Teichm\"uller, Jenkins, Strebel and others. We study several special cases, including stationary Jordan curves on the Riemann sphere. We also introduce a discrete random version of the dynamics closely related to Propp's competitive erosion model, and conjecture that realizations of the lattice model will converge towards a corresponding solution to the competitive Hele-Shaw problem as the mesh size tends to zero.</description>

      <title>The number of minima in random landscapes generated by constrained random walk and L\'evy flights: universal properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a uniform framework to compute the exact distribution of the number of minima/maxima in three different random walk landscape models in one dimension. The landscape is generated by the trajectory of a discrete-time continuous space random walk with arbitrary symmetric and continuous jump distribution at each step. In model I, we consider a ``free'' random walk of $N$ steps. In model II, we consider a ``meander landscape'' where the random walk, starting at the origin, stays non-negative up to $N$ steps. In model III, we study a ``first-passage landscape'' which is generated by the trajectory of a random walk that starts at the origin and stops when it crosses the origin for the first time. We demonstrate that while the exact distribution of the number of minima is different in the three models, for each model it is universal for all $N$, in the sense that it does not depend on the jump distribution as long as it is symmetric and continuous. In the last two cases we show that this universality follows from a non trivial mapping to the Sparre Andersen theorem known for the first-passage probability of discrete-time random walks with symmetric and continuous jump distribution. Our analytical results are in excellent agreement with our numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale McKean-Vlasov SDEs: Moderate Deviation Principle in Different Regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to study the moderate deviation principle for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations with multiple scales. Specifically, we are interested in the asymptotic estimates of the deviation processes $\frac{X^{\delta}-\bar{X}}{\lambda(\delta)}$ as $\delta\to 0$ in different regimes (i.e. $\varepsilon=o(\delta)$ and $\varepsilon=O(\delta)$), where $\delta$ stands for the intensity of the noise and $\varepsilon:=\varepsilon(\delta)$ stands for the time scale separation. The rate functions in two regimes are different, in particular, we show that it is strongly affected by the noise of the fast component in latter regime, which is essentially different from the former one and the case of large deviations (cf. \cite{HLLS}). As a by-product, the explicit representation formulas of the rate functions in all of regimes are also given. The main techniques are based on the weak convergence approach and the functional occupation measure approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00678v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gradient drift-diffusion processes on a probability simplex set with finite state Wasserstein metrics, namely finite state Wasserstein common noises. A fact is that the Kolmogorov transition equation of finite reversible Markov processes satisfies the gradient flow of entropy in finite state Wasserstein space. This paper proposes to perturb finite state Markov processes with Wasserstein common noises. In this way, we introduce a class of stochastic reversible Markov processes. We also define stochastic transition rate matrices, namely Wasserstein Q-matrices, for the proposed stochastic Markov processes. We then derive the functional Fokker-Planck equation in the probability simplex, whose stationary distribution is a Gibbs distribution of entropy functional in a simplex set. Several examples of Wasserstein drift-diffusion processes on a two-point state space are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note studies monotone Markov chains, a subclass of Markov chains with extensive applications in operations research and economics. While the properties that ensure the global stability of these chains are well studied, their establishment often relies on the fulfillment of a certain splitting condition. We address the challenges of verifying the splitting condition by introducing simple, applicable conditions that ensure global stability. The simplicity of these conditions is demonstrated through various examples including autoregressive processes, portfolio allocation problems and resource allocation dynamics.</description>

Abstract: For general non-Hermitian random matrices $X$ and deterministic deformation matrices $A$, we prove that the local eigenvalue statistics of $A+X$ close to the typical edge points of its spectrum are universal. Furthermore, we show that under natural assumptions on $A$ the spectrum of $A+X$ does not have outliers at a distance larger than the natural fluctuation scale of the eigenvalues. As a consequence, the number of eigenvalues in each component of $\mathrm{Spec}(A+X)$ is deterministic.</description>

      <title>Gibbs scheme in the theory of random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to expand and clarify the concept of the class of Gibbs random fields and give its structure the form accepted in the theory of random processes. It is possible thanks to the proposed purely probabilistic definition of the Gibbs random field without refereing to any physical notion. However, we do not oppose to each other the physical and probabilistic points of view on mathematical statistical physics; on the contrary, we show their natural compatibility within the framework of the suggested Gibbs scheme. The outlines of the corresponding theory are presented. In this theory, the DLR--definition is not used. At the same time, the related existence theorem provides one of adequate ways to construct Gibbs random fields (in the sense of probabilistic definition). The results of mathematical statistical physics are embedded in the theory of Gibbs random fields under development as its important (if not the most important) part. We describe in general terms the range of those problems that are more natural to solve using our definition. For example, the problem of the Gibbsian description of known classes of random fields as well as questions of validity of limit theorems of probability theory.</description>

Abstract: We consider a null-recurrent randomly biased walk $\mathbb{X}$ on a Galton-Watson tree in the (sub)-diffusive regime and we prove that properly renormalized, the local time in a critical generation converges in law towards some function of a stable continuous-state branching process. We also provide an explicit equivalent of the probability that critical generations are reached by the random walk $\mathbb{X}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Texas hold'em, after an all-in bet is made and called before the flop, the turn, or the river, the two players sometimes agree to run it $n$ times, meaning that the remaining five, two, or one cards are dealt out not just once but $n$ times successively without replacement, with $1/n$ of the pot attached to each run. In $n$-play video poker, five cards are dealt exactly as in the conventional single-play game. After the player chooses which cards to hold, new cards are drawn to replace the discards, not just once but $n$ times independently, with $1/n$ of the bet attached to each draw. In both scenarios the players are attempting to reduce the variance of the return without changing the mean. We quantify the extent to which the variance is reduced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The clique chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors in a vertex coloring so that no maximal clique is monochromatic. In this paper, we determine the order of magnitude of the clique chromatic number of the random graph G_{n,p} for most edge-probabilities p in the range n^{-2/5} \ll p \ll 1. This resolves open problems and questions of Lichev, Mitsche and Warnke as well as Alon and Krievelevich.
  One major proof difficulty stems from high-degree vertices, which prevent maximal cliques in their neighborhoods: we deal with these vertices by an intricate union bound argument, that combines the probabilistic method with new degree counting arguments in order to enable Janson's inequality. This way we determine the asymptotics of the clique chromatic number of G_{n,p} in some ranges, and discover a surprising new phenomenon that contradicts earlier predictions for edge-probabilities p close to n^{-2/5}.</description>

      <title>Efficient Two-Stage Gaussian Process Regression Via Automatic Kernel Search and Subsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is widely used in statistics and machine learning for prediction tasks requiring uncertainty measures. Its efficacy depends on the appropriate specification of the mean function, covariance kernel function, and associated hyperparameters. Severe misspecifications can lead to inaccurate results and problematic consequences, especially in safety-critical applications. However, a systematic approach to handle these misspecifications is lacking in the literature. In this work, we propose a general framework to address these issues. Firstly, we introduce a flexible two-stage GPR framework that separates mean prediction and uncertainty quantification (UQ) to prevent mean misspecification, which can introduce bias into the model. Secondly, kernel function misspecification is addressed through a novel automatic kernel search algorithm, supported by theoretical analysis, that selects the optimal kernel from a candidate set. Additionally, we propose a subsampling-based warm-start strategy for hyperparameter initialization to improve efficiency and avoid hyperparameter misspecification. With much lower computational cost, our subsampling-based strategy can yield competitive or better performance than training exclusively on the full dataset. Combining all these components, we recommend two GPR methods-exact and scalable-designed to match available computational resources and specific UQ requirements. Extensive evaluation on real-world datasets, including UCI benchmarks and a safety-critical medical case study, demonstrates the robustness and precision of our methods.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotics of Wide Remedians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remedian uses a $k\times b$ matrix to approximate the median of $n\leq b^{k}$ streaming input values by recursively replacing buffers of $b$ values with their medians, thereby ignoring its $200(\lceil b/2\rceil / b)^{k}%$ most extreme inputs. Rousseeuw &amp; Bassett (1990) and Chao &amp; Lin (1993); Chen &amp; Chen (2005) study the remedian's distribution as $k\rightarrow\infty$ and as $k,b\rightarrow\infty$. The remedian's breakdown point vanishes as $k\rightarrow\infty$, but approaches $(1/2)^{k}$ as $b\rightarrow\infty$. We study the remedian's robust-regime distribution as $b\rightarrow\infty$, deriving a normal distribution for standardized (mean, median, remedian, remedian rank) as $b\rightarrow\infty$, thereby illuminating the remedian's accuracy in approximating the sample median. We derive the asymptotic efficiency of the remedian relative to the mean and the median. Finally, we discuss the estimation of more than one quantile at once, proposing an asymptotic distribution for the random vector that results when we apply remedian estimation in parallel to the components of i.i.d. random vectors.</description>
