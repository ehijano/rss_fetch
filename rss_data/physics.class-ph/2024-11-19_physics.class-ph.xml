      <title>Degrees of Freedom of New General Relativity 2: Type 4, Type 7, and Type 9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the degrees of freedom of New General Relativity. This theory is a three-parameter theory and is classified into nine irreducible types according to the rotation symmetry of $SO(3)$ on each leaf of ADM-foliation. In the previous work~[{\it 2410.15056[gr-qc]}], we investigated the degrees of freedom in types of NGR that are interests for describing gravity: Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8. In this work, we focus on unveiling those numbers in all other types to complete the analysis of NGR. After providing the Hamiltonian formulation of NGR, we perform the analysis on Type 4, Type 7, and Type 9 according to the method that is provided in the previous work~[{\it 2410.15056[gr-qc]}]. Then we unveil that the degrees of freedom of Type 4, Type 7, and Type 9 are five, null, and three, respectively. Type 4 and Type 9 have second-class constraint densities only. Type 7 has first-class constraint densities only, but which is over constraint. In every type, no bifurcation occurs unlikely to Type 8 in the previous work~[2410.15056[gr-qc]]. Finally, we summarize this work and give a concluding remark for this series of works.</description>

      <title>Radiative-Conductive Heat Transfer Dynamics in Dissipative Dispersive Anisotropic Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a self-consistent theoretical formalism to model the dynamics of heat transfer in dissipative, dispersive, anisotropic nanoscale media, such as metamaterials. We employ our envelope dyadic Green's function method to solve Maxwell's macroscopic equations for the propagation of fluctuating electromagnetic fields in these media. We assume that the photonic radiative heat transfer mechanism in these media is complemented by dynamic phononic mechanisms of heat storage and conduction, accounting for effects of local heat generation. By employing the Poynting theorem and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, we derive novel closed-form expressions for the radiative heat flux and the coupling term of photonic and phononic subsystems, which contains the heating rate and the radiative heat power contributions. We apply our formalism to the paraxial heat transfer in uniaxial media and present relevant closed-form expressions. By considering a Gaussian transverse temperature profile, we also obtain and solve a system of integro-differential heat diffusion equations to model the paraxial heat transfer in uniaxial reciprocal media. By applying the developed analytical model to radiative-conductive heat tranfer in nanolayered media constructed by layers of silica and germanium, we compute the temperature profiles for the three first orders of expansion and the total temperature profile as well. The results of this research can be of interest in areas of science and technology related to thermophotovoltaics, energy harvesting, radiative cooling, and thermal management at micro- and nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Polarization and energy ellipsoids for an introductory visualization of tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In ``The Feynman Lectures on Physics'' is discussed an introduction to tensors by means of the polarization tensor, including a way of ``visualizing'' this tensor via the energy ellipsoid, which is drawn by the electric fields which produce the same polarization energy density in an anisotropic crystal. Here, we discuss an alternative way of visualizing the polarization tensor, by means of the polarization ellipsoid, which is based on the ideas of Lam\'e's stress ellipsoid and is drawn by the polarization vectors produced by electric fields having the same magnitude. We compare both ellipsoids as a first introductory way of visualizing the polarization tensor.</description>
