      <title>Theoretical Framework for Temporal Changes in Interactions among Adaptive Components of Living Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In living systems, each component adaptively changes its internal states in response to its interactions with other components. These interactions, in turn, undergo temporal changes as a result of this adaptive behavior, which plays a crucial role in the emergence of system-level functions. Thus, to understand how changes in interactions influence the emergence of functions by employing models of adaptive behavior, it is essential to incorporate these interaction changes into these models. In this study, we developed a theoretical framework for modeling adaptive behavior of components under temporally changing interactions by formulating these interaction changes as dynamics of energy landscapes associated with that behavior. To represent this component-level adaptive behavior, internal state changes of each component were formulated based on the generalized gradient flow of an energy landscape and its associated energy rate landscape. We expressed dynamics of these landscapes by treating environmental states surrounding each component as temporal changes related to the interaction, which were then coupled to internal state changes of the component. Through case studies using simplified models of living systems under multiple mechanical interaction conditions among components, we demonstrated that our proposed theoretical framework can represent the emergence of functions of living systems. Even without explicitly defining adaptive behavior at the system level, these functions are specified based on the dynamics of the energy and energy rate landscapes of each component.</description>

      <title>Binding of native DNA to MoS$_{2}$ nanoflakes: the role of defects and edge atoms of MoS$_{2}$ nanostructures in their biofunctionalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the binding of native DNA to MoS$_{2}$ nanoflakes (FLs) was studied by using UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, thermal denaturation method, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-dependent dynamic light scattering (DLS), and the DFT computational-chemistry method. Analysis of the experimental data: TEM images and thermal denaturation measurements showed the binding of the biopolymer with MoS$_{2}$ FLs. An increase in the melting temperature of DNA and a decrease in the hyperchromic coefficient at binding with MoS$_{2}$ FLs indicates the formation of the DNA:MoS$_{2}$ FL nanoassemblies due primarily to the covalent interaction of the oxygen atoms of the phosphate groups of DNA with the MoS$_{2}$ FLs. Possible complexes of a nucleotide fragment (ribose-phosphate group) with MoS$_{2}$ nanolayer are considered and calculated employing the DFT method. Different structures of these complexes are optimized and the interaction energies between components are determined. Special attention in calculations is focused on the binding of this nucleotide fragment with Mo atoms located at the edge of the MoS$_{2}$ nanolayer and with point structural defects of the MoS$_{2}$ surface containing the S vacancy. Based on this calculation and experimental observation, a mechanism of binding of native DNA to MoS$_{2}$ FLs has been proposed, in which their conjugation begins with point contacts of DNA phosphate groups with Mo atoms (at the edge or/and in defects) through the formation of a strong coordination bond. The results indicate the critical role of defects and edge atoms of MoS$_{2}$ FLs in their biofunctionalization.</description>

      <title>The Dual Nature of Body-Axis Formation in Hydra Regeneration: Polarity-Morphology Concurrency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of a body-axis is central to animal development and involves both polarity and morphology. While polarity is traditionally associated with biochemical patterning, the morphological aspect of axis formation remains elusive. In regenerating Hydra tissues, we find that morphological evolution in all tissue samples depends on inherited positional information from the donor axis, and a foot precursor emerges early in the process. The Ca excitations that drive actomyosin forces for tissue reshaping follow a polarity-aligned gradient from the onset of regeneration. We conclude that polarity and morphological axis progression occur concurrently through interlinked processes, and that the foot plays a dominant role in this process, a role usually attributed to the head organizer. These insights from Hydra likely extend to broader developmental systems.</description>

      <title>Brain pulsations enhance cerebrospinal fluid flow in perivascular spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel approach to modelling cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow in arterial perivascular spaces (PVS) is adopted by proposing that the outer PVS boundary oscillates due to brain pulsations in addition to arterial wall motion driven by a blood pressure wave. Lubrication theory is employed to derive a mathematical model for the CSF flow, which is then solved numerically. A parametric analysis is undertaken to investigate the effect of the brain pulsations, which shows that pulsations magnify the net axial CSF flows created by the arterial wall motion. The findings suggest that net axial CSF flows are almost entirely positive (deeper into the brain), with arterial wall motion highly dependent on PVS-perforating artery configurations. Given the glymphatic hypothesis, the findings support the clinical practice of treating dilated PVS as indicators of an increased likelihood of neurodegenerative conditions, such as dementia.</description>

      <title>The two-clock problem in population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological time can be measured in two ways: in generations and in physical time. When generation intervals differ between individuals, these two clocks diverge, which impedes our ability to relate mathematical models to real populations. In this paper we show that nevertheless, these disparate clocks become equivalent in the long run via a simple identity relating generational and physical time. This equivalence allows us to directly translate statements from mathematical models to the physical world and vice versa. As an application, we obtain a generalized Euler-Lotka equation linking the basic reproduction number $R_0$ to the growth rate, and derive several information-theoretic bounds on these quantities. We also show how the fitness of a lineage can be defined consistently in population models, with applications to microbial growth, epidemiology and population biology.</description>

      <title>E. coli bacterium tumbling in bulk and close to surfaces: A simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motility is fundamental to the survival and proliferation of microorganisms. The E. coli bacterium propels itself using a bundle of rotating helical flagella. If one flagellum reverses its rotational direction, it leaves the bundle, performs a polymorphic transformation, and the bacterium tumbles. The E. coli bacterium is hydrodynamically attracted to surfaces. This prolongs its residence time, while tumbling facilitates surface detachment. We develop a model of E. coli that uses an extended Kirchhoff rod theory to implement flagellar flexibility as well as different polymorphic conformations and perform hydrodynamic simulations with the method of multiparticle collision dynamics (MPCD). To establish a reference case, we determine the distribution of tumble angles in the bulk fluid, which shows good agreement with experiments for a fixed tumble time. Increasing the hook stiffness, narrows the tumble angle distribution and reduces the flagellar dispersion during tumbling. Close to a bounding surface, the tumble angle distribution is shifted to smaller angles, while flagellar dispersion is reduced. Reorientation within the plane favors the forward direction, which might be an explanation for prolonged run times observed in experiments</description>

      <title>Chemotactic aggregation dynamics of micro-swimmers in Brinkman flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study through analysis and simulations of a continuum model the collective chemotactic dynamics of micro-swimmers immersed in viscous Brinkman flows. The Brinkman viscous flow approximates with a resistance or friction term the presence of inert impurities or stationary obstacles immersed in the fluid, an environment that can be regarded as a wet porous medium. Analysis of the linearized system reveals that resistance primarily affects the development of collective swimming instabilities and barely affects chemotactic instabilities. We present a parameter phase space for the distinct types of dynamics we can expect in the case of auto-chemotactic bacteria-like pusher swimmers for varying medium resistance, chemotactic response strength, and hydrodynamic coupling strength values. Simulations of the full nonlinear system show that resistance impacts the collective dynamics for each of these states because it inhibits the hydrodynamic interactions and the emergence of the collective swimmer. Surprisingly, and not expected from the linear analysis predictions, we find that resistance also hampers the chemotactic aggregation of the swimmers because it impedes their ability to navigate efficiently and collectively towards chemical cues and assemble into clusters. We show simulations of the complex system for parameters sets from each of the phase-space regions and quantify the observed behavior. Lastly, we discuss the experimental values of the parameters and discuss possible future experimental realizations of this system.</description>

      <title>Separation of ionic timescales explains dynamics of cellular volume regulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Living cells actively regulate their volume in response to changes in the extra-cellular environment, such as osmolarity and chemo-attractant concentration. While the basic physical mechanisms of volume regulation are understood from the classic "pump-leak" model, it does not provide an explicit expression for the volume during dynamic regulation and can benefit from further insight into the volume dynamics. Here, we propose a simple explanation of volume dynamics in terms of two phases: fast volume adjustment to membrane potential, largely determined by Cl$^-$ leakage, and slow potential adaptation after shock, constrained by Na$^+$ leakage. The volume change may predominantly occur in either of these two phases, as we demonstrate for the scenarios of regulatory volume decrease and increase. Our theoretical predictions are validated by two recent independent shock experiments: osmotic shocks in HeLa cells and neutrophil activation upon sudden exposure to chemoattractants. Our theory aims to elucidate cellular volume dynamics on the scale of tens of minutes in various biological contexts.</description>

      <title>Turing pattern theory on homogeneous and heterogeneous higher-order temporal network system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes on networked systems have received mounting attention in the past two decades, and the corresponding theory of network dynamics has been continuously enriched with the advancement of network science. Recently, time-varying features and many-body interactions have been discovered on various and numerous real-world networks, such as biological and social systems, and the study of contemporary network science has gradually moved away from historically static network frameworks that are based on pairwise interactions. We aim to propose a general and rudimentary framework for Turing instability of reaction-diffusion processes on higher-order temporal networks. Firstly, we define a brand Laplacian to depict higher-order temporal diffusion behaviors on networks. Furthermore, the general form of higher-order temporal reaction-diffusion systems with frequency of oscillation is defined, and a time-independent and concise form is obtained by equivalent substitution and method of averaging. Next, we discuss the two cases of homogeneous and heterogeneous network systems and give equivalent conditions of Turing instability through linear stability analysis. Finally, in the numerical simulation part, we verify and discuss the validity of the above theoretical framework and study the effect of the frequency of oscillation of higher-order temporal networks on reaction-diffusion processes. Our study has revealed that higher-order temporal reaction-diffusion, which takes into account both time-varying feature and many-body interactions, can formulate innovative and diverse patterns. Moreover, there are significant differences between patterns in continuous space and patterns on traditional networks.</description>

      <title>Mind the memory: Consistent time reversal removes artefactual scaling of energy dissipation rate and provides more accurate and reliable thermodynamic inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been proposed that an observed inverse power-law dependence of the Markovian estimate for the steady-state dissipation rate on the coarse-graining scale in self-similar networks reflects a scale-dependent energy dissipation. By explicit examples, it is demonstrated here that there are in general no relations between such an apparent power-law dependence and the actual dissipation on different length scales. We construct fractal networks with a single dissipative scale and networks with a true inverse energy-dissipation cascade, and show that they display the same scaling behavior. Moreover, we show that a self-similar network structure does not imply an inverse power-law scaling but may be mistaken for one in practice. When no dissipative cycles become hidden by the coarse graining, any scale dependence of the dissipation estimate vanishes if the memory is correctly accounted for in the time-reversal operation. A $k$-th order estimator is derived and necessary and sufficient conditions are proved for a guaranteed lower bound on dissipation. These higher-order estimators saturated in the order are proved to provide sharper lower bounds on dissipation and their scale dependence signifies hidden dissipative cycles. It is shown that estimators not saturated in the order may erroneously overestimate the microscopic dissipation. Our results underscore the still underappreciated importance of correctly accounting for memory in analyzing coarse observations.</description>
