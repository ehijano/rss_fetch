      <title>Binary Galton-Watson trees with mutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a family of marked binary Galton-Watson trees that can model individual types in population genetics, by allowing for mutation and reversion in discrete and continuous time. We derive a recursive formula for the computation of the joint distribution of types conditional to the value of the total progeny. This allows us to compute the evolution of various expected quantities, such as the mean proportions of different types as the tree size or time increases. Some generating functions are determined in explicit forms using generalized Catalan numbers, and integrability criteria are obtained as a consequence.</description>

      <title>WinPCA: A package for windowed principal component analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is routinely used in population genetics to assess genetic structure. With chromosomal reference genomes and population-scale whole genome-sequencing becoming increasingly accessible, contemporary studies often include characterizations of the genomic landscape as it varies along chromosomes, commonly termed genome scans. While traditional summary statistics like FST and dXY remain integral to characterizing the genomic divergence profile, PCA fundamentally differs by providing single-sample resolution, thereby making results intuitively interpretable to help identify polymorphic inversions, introgression and other types of divergent sequence. Here, we introduce WinPCA, a user-friendly package to compute, polarize and visualize genetic principal components in windows along the genome. To accommodate low-coverage whole genome-sequencing datasets, WinPCA can optionally make use of PCAngsd methods to compute principal components in a genotype likelihood framework. WinPCA accepts variant data in either VCF or BEAGLE format and can generate rich plots for interactive data exploration and downstream presentation.</description>

      <title>Tikhonov-Fenichel Reductions and their Application to a Novel Modelling Approach for Mutualism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When formulating a model there is a trade-off between model complexity and (biological) realism. In the present paper we demonstrate how model reduction from a precise mechanistic "super model" to simpler conceptual models using Tikhonov-Fenichel reductions, an algebraic approach to singular perturbation theory, can mitigate this problem. Compared to traditional methods for time scale separations (Tikhonov's theorem, quasi-steady state assumption), Tikhonov-Fenichel reductions have the advantage that we can compute a reduction directly for a separation of rates into slow and fast ones instead of a separation of components of the system. Moreover, we can find all such reductions algorithmically.
  In the present paper we use Tikhonov-Fenichel reductions to analyse a mutualism model tailored towards lichens with an explicit description of the interaction. We find that (1) the implicit description of the interaction given in the reductions by interaction terms (functional responses) varies depending on the scenario, (2) there is a tendency for the mycobiont, an obligate mutualist, to always benefit from the interaction while it can be detrimental for the photobiont, a facultative mutualist, depending on the parameters, (3) our model is capable of describing the shift from mutualism to parasitism, (4) our model can produce bistability with multiple stable fixed points in the interior of the first orthant. To analyse the reductions we formalize and discuss a mathematical criterion that categorizes two-species interactions. Throughout the paper we focus on the relation between the mathematics behind Tikhonov-Fenichel reductions and their biological interpretation.</description>

      <title>Making mathematical online resources FAIR: at the example of small phylogenetic trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the process of taking an early 2000's mathematical library, the Small Phylogenetic Trees, and transforming it into a FAIR, modern, and sustainable repository for data from algebraic phylogenetics. This process is based on a three-fold strategy: (1) writing a software package which enables the user to reproduce results of the database; (2) setting up a user-friendly new website with cross links to theoretical publications, code snippets, and serialized output of computations; and (3) all-the-while documenting the steps we take in order to derive lessons learned which may be generalised to other such projects. This paper addresses (3). (1) is found in https://docs.oscar-system.org/dev/Experimental/AlgebraicStatistics/phylogenetics, and (2) is located at https://algebraicphylogenetics.org.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous spatial sorting by cell shape in growing colonies of rod-like bacteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical interactions among cells in a growing microbial colony can significantly influence the colony's spatial genetic structure and, thus, evolutionary outcomes such as the fates of rare mutations. Here, we computationally investigate how this spatial genetic structure changes as a result of heritable phenotypic variations in cell shape. By modeling rod-like bacterial cells as lengthening and dividing circo-rectangles in a 2D Brownian dynamics framework, we simulate the growth of a colony containing two populations with different aspect ratios. Compared to monodisperse colonies, such bidisperse colonies exhibit diminished intermixing between sub-populations when the less elongated cells are too short to nematically order, instead forming large clusters. We find that the cells with longer aspect ratio gradually segregate to the colony periphery. We present evidence that this demixing is related to nematic order in the bulk and to active nematic mixing dynamics near the periphery. These findings are qualitatively robust across different growth rate protocols and initial conditions. Because the periphery is often an advantageous position when nutrients are limited, our results suggest a possible evolutionary selective pressure of mechanical origin that favors large cell aspect ratio.</description>

      <title>Influence of density-dependent diffusion on pattern formation in a refuge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11638v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a nonlocal generalization of the Fisher-KPP equation, which incorporates logistic growth and diffusion, for a single species population in a viable patch (refuge). In this framework, diffusion plays an homogenizing role, while nonlocal interactions can destabilize the spatially uniform state, leading to the emergence of spontaneous patterns. Notably, even when the uniform state is stable, spatial perturbations, such as the presence of a refuge, can still induce patterns. These phenomena are well known for environments with constant diffusivity. Our goal is to investigate how the formation of winkles in the population distribution is affected when the diffusivity is density-dependent. Then, we explore scenarios in which diffusivity is sensitive to either rarefaction or overcrowding. We find that state-dependent diffusivity affects the shape and stability of the patterns, potentially leading to either explosive growth or fragmentation of the population distribution, depending on how diffusion reacts to changes in density.</description>

      <title>SIR-Model for Households</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Households play an important role in disease dynamics. Many infections happening there due to the close contact, while mitigation measures mainly target the transmission between households. Therefore, one can see households as boosting the transmission depending on household size. To study the effect of household size and size distribution, we differentiated the within and between household reproduction rate. There are basically no preventive measures, and thus the close contacts can boost the spread. We explicitly incorporated that typically only a fraction of all household members are infected. Thus, viewing the infection of a household of a given size as a splitting process generating a new, small fully infected sub-household and a remaining still susceptible sub-household we derive a compartmental ODE-model for the dynamics of the sub-households. In this setting, the basic reproduction number as well as prevalence and the peak of an infection wave in a population with given households size distribution can be computed analytically. We compare numerical simulation results of this novel household-ODE model with results from an agent--based model using data for realistic household size distributions of different countries. We find good agreement of both models showing the catalytic effect of large households on the overall disease dynamics.</description>

      <title>Annealed mean-field epidemiological model on scale-free networks with a mitigating factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An annealed version of the quenched mean-field model for epidemic spread is introduced and investigated analytically and assisted by numerical calculations. The interaction between individuals follows a prescription that is used to generate a scale-free network, and we have adjusted the number of connections to produce a sparse network. Specifically, the model's behavior near the infection threshold is examined, as well as the behavior of the stationary prevalence and the probability that a connection between individuals encounters an infected one. We found that these functions display a monotonically increasing dependence on the infection rate. Subsequently, a modification that mimics the mitigation in the probability of encountering an infected individual is introduced, following an old idea rooted in the Malthus-Verhulst model. We found that this modification drastically changes the probability that a connection meets an infected individual. However, despite this change, it does not alter the monotonically increasing behavior of the stationary prevalence.</description>

      <title>Predicting the depth of the most recent common ancestor of a random sample of $k$ species: the impact of phylogenetic tree shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the following question: how close to the ancestral root of a phylogenetic tree is the most recent common ancestor of $k$ species randomly sampled from the tips of the tree? For trees having shapes predicted by the Yule-Harding model, it is known that the most recent common ancestor is likely to be close to (or equal to) the root of the full tree, even as $n$ becomes large (for $k$ fixed). However, this result does not extend to models of tree shape that more closely describe phylogenies encountered in evolutionary biology. We investigate the impact of tree shape (via the Aldous $\beta-$splitting model) to predict the number of edges that separate the most recent common ancestor of a random sample of $k$ tip species and the root of the parent tree they are sampled from. Both exact and asymptotic results are presented. We also briefly consider a variation of the process in which a random number of tip species are sampled.</description>

      <title>Formulating human risk response in epidemic models: exogenous vs endogenous approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15535v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent pandemic emphasized the need to consider the role of human behavior in shaping epidemic dynamics. In particular, it is necessary to extend beyond the classical epidemiological structures to fully capture the interplay between the spread of disease and how people respond. Here, we focus on the challenge of incorporating change in human behavior in the form of "risk response" into compartmental epidemiological models, where humans adapt their actions in response to their perceived risk of becoming infected. The review examines 37 papers containing over 40 compartmental models, categorizing them into two fundamentally distinct classes: exogenous and endogenous approaches to modeling risk response. While in exogenous approaches, human behavior is often included using different fixed parameter values for certain time periods, endogenous approaches seek for a mechanism internal to the model to explain changes in human behavior as a function of the state of disease. We further discuss two different formulations within endogenous models as implicit versus explicit representation of information diffusion. This analysis provides insights for modelers in selecting an appropriate framework for epidemic modeling.</description>

      <title>Decoding Dmrt1: Insights into vertebrate sex determination and gonadal sex differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dmrt1 is pivotal in testis formation and function by interacting with genes crucial for Sertoli cell differentiation. Dmrt1, or Sox9, forms a conserved antagonistic interaction with Foxl2 across mammals. Across 128 vertebrate species, Dmrt1 exhibits sexually dimorphic expression, implicating its role in master regulation of sex determination and gonadal sex differentiation. Dmrt1 emerges as a master/upstream sex-determining gene in one fish, frog, chicken and turtle. Recent studies suggest epigenetic regulation of Dmrt1 in its promoter methylation, and transposable element insertion introducing epigenetic modification to cis-regulatory elements of Dmrt1, alongside non-coding RNA involvement, in a wide spectrum of sex-determining mechanisms ranging from genetic factors, to interactions between genetic factors with the environment, to solely environmental factors. Additionally, alternative splicing of Dmrt1 was found in all major vertebrate groups except amphibians. Dmrt1 has evolved many lineage-specific isoforms (ranging from 2 to 10), and various isoforms showed sex, tissue or development-specific expression, which is in contrast to the highly conserved sex-specific splicing of its homolog Dsx across insects. Future research should focus on understanding the molecular basis of environmental sex determination from a broader taxon, and the molecular basis of epigenetic regulation. It is also essential to understand why and how multiple alternative splicing variants of Dmrt1 evolve in vertebrates, the specific roles each isoform plays in sex determination and gonadal sex differentiation, as well as the significant differences in the molecular mechanisms and functions of alternative splicing between Dmrt1 in vertebrates and Dsx in insects. Understanding the differences could provide deeper insights into the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms between vertebrates and insects.</description>
