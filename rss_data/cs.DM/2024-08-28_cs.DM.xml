      <title>Channel allocation revisited through 1-extendability of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of channel allocation for Wi-Fi access points (AP). Using mechanisms such as the CSMA/CA protocol, Wi-Fi access points which are in conflict within a same channel are still able to communicate to terminals. In graph theoretical terms, it means that it is not mandatory for the channel allocation to correspond to a proper coloring of the conflict graph. However, recent studies suggest that the structure -- rather than the number -- of conflicts plays a crucial role in the performance of each AP. More precisely, the graph induced by each channel must satisfy the so-called $1$-extendability property, which requires each vertex to be contained in an independent set of maximum cardinality. In this paper we introduce the 1-extendable chromatic number, which is the minimum size of a partition of the vertex set of a graph such that each part induces a 1-extendable graph. We study this parameter and the related optimization problem through different perspectives: algorithms and complexity, structure, and extremal properties. We first show how to compute this number using modular decompositions of graphs, and analyze the running time with respect to the modular width of the input graph. We also focus on the special case of cographs, and prove that the 1-extendable chromatic number can be computed in quasi-polynomial time in this class. Concerning extremal results, we show that the 1-extendable chromatic number of a graph with $n$ vertices is at most $2\sqrt{n}$, whereas the classical chromatic number can be as large as $n$. We are also able to construct graphs whose 1-extendable chromatic number is at least logarithmic in the number of vertices.</description>

      <title>Pushing Tree Decompositions Forward Along Graph Homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15184v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is folklore that tree-width is monotone under taking subgraphs (i.e. injective graph homomorphisms) and contractions (certain kinds of surjective graph homomorphisms). However, although tree-width is obviously not monotone under any surjective graph homomorphism, it is not clear whether contractions are canonically the only class of surjections with respect to which it is monotone. We prove that this is indeed the case: we show that - up to isomorphism - contractions are the only surjective graph homomorphisms that preserve tree decompositions and the shape of the decomposition tree. Furthermore, our results provide a framework for answering questions of this sort for many other kinds of combinatorial data structures (such as directed multigraphs, hypergraphs, Petri nets, circular port graphs, half-edge graphs, databases, simplicial complexes etc.) for which natural analogues of tree decompositions can be defined.</description>

      <title>Tracking Truth with Liquid Democracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.11868v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of random transitive delegations on a graph are of particular interest when viewed through the lens of an emerging voting paradigm, liquid democracy. This paradigm allows voters to choose between directly voting and transitively delegating their votes to other voters, so that those selected cast a vote weighted by the number of delegations they received. In the epistemic setting, where voters decide on a binary issue for which there is a ground truth, previous work showed that a few voters may amass such a large amount of influence that liquid democracy is less likely to identify the ground truth than direct voting. We quantify the amount of permissible concentration of power and examine more realistic delegation models, showing they behave well by ensuring that (with high probability) there is a permissible limit on the maximum number of delegations received. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the delegation process is similar to well-known processes on random graphs that are sufficiently bounded for our purposes. Along the way, we prove new bounds on the size of the largest component in an infinite P\'olya urn process, which may be of independent interest. In addition, we empirically validate the theoretical results, running six experiments (for a total of $N=168$ participants, $62$ delegation graphs and over $11k$ votes collected). We find that empirical delegation behaviors meet the conditions for our positive theoretical guarantees. Overall, our work alleviates concerns raised about liquid democracy and bolsters the case for the applicability of this emerging paradigm.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear fourth order Taylor expansion of lattice Boltzmann schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.12417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a formal expansion of multiple relaxation times lattice Boltzmann schemes in terms of a single infinitesimal numerical variable. The result is a system of partial differential equations for the conserved moments of the lattice Boltzmann scheme. The expansion is presented  in the nonlinear case up to fourth order accuracy. The asymptotic corrections of  the nonconserved moments  are developed in terms of  equilibrium values and  partial differentials of the conserved moments. Both expansions are coupled and conduct to explicit compact formulas. The new algebraic expressions are validated with previous results obtained with this approach. The example of isothermal D2Q9 lattice Boltzmann scheme illustrates the theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Efficient polynomial-time approximation scheme for the genus of dense graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.08049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main results of this paper provide an Efficient Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (EPTAS) for approximating the genus (and non-orientable genus) of dense graphs. By dense we mean that $|E(G)|\ge \alpha |V(G)|^2$ for some fixed $\alpha&gt;0$. While a constant factor approximation is trivial for this class of graphs, approximations with factor arbitrarily close to 1 need a sophisticated algorithm and complicated mathematical justification. More precisely, we provide an algorithm that for a given (dense) graph $G$ of order $n$ and given $\varepsilon&gt;0$, returns an integer $g$ such that $G$ has an embedding into a surface of genus $g$, and this is $\varepsilon$-close to a minimum genus embedding in the sense that the minimum genus $\mathsf{g}(G)$ of $G$ satisfies: $\mathsf{g}(G)\le g\le (1+\varepsilon)\mathsf{g}(G)$. The running time of the algorithm is $O(f(\varepsilon)\,n^2)$, where $f(\cdot)$ is an explicit function. Next, we extend this algorithm to also output an embedding (rotation system) whose genus is $g$. This second algorithm is an Efficient Polynomial-time Randomized Approximation Scheme (EPRAS) and runs in time $O(f_1(\varepsilon)\,n^2)$.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Quantum Walks, with Application to $k$-Distinctness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13492v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the quantum query complexity of $k$-distinctness is known to be $O\left(n^{3/4-1/4(2^k-1)}\right)$ for any constant $k \geq 4$, the best previous upper bound on the time complexity was $\widetilde{O}\left(n^{1-1/k}\right)$. We give a new upper bound of $\widetilde{O}\left(n^{3/4-1/4(2^k-1)}\right)$ on the time complexity, matching the query complexity up to polylogarithmic factors. In order to achieve this upper bound, we give a new technique for designing quantum walk search algorithms, which is an extension of the electric network framework. We also show how to solve the welded trees problem in $O(n)$ queries and $O(n^2)$ time using this new technique, showing that the new quantum walk framework can achieve exponential speedups.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Random Walks: A Fast Method to Compute Node Distances on Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph that arises naturally when attribute-sharing among entities is considered. Compared to graphs, hypergraphs have the distinct advantage that they contain explicit communities and are more convenient to manipulate. An open problem in hypergraph research is how to accurately and efficiently calculate node distances on hypergraphs. Estimating node distances enables us to find a node's nearest neighbors, which has important applications in such areas as recommender system, targeted advertising, etc. In this paper, we propose using expected hitting times of random walks to compute hypergraph node distances. We note that simple random walks (SRW) cannot accurately compute node distances on highly complex real-world hypergraphs, which motivates us to introduce frustrated random walks (FRW) for this task. We further benchmark our method against DeepWalk, and show that while the latter can achieve comparable results, FRW has a distinct computational advantage in cases where the number of targets is fairly small. For such cases, we show that FRW runs in significantly shorter time than DeepWalk. Finally, we analyze the time complexity of our method, and show that for large and sparse hypergraphs, the complexity is approximately linear, rendering it superior to the DeepWalk alternative.</description>
