      <title>Noetherian Conservation Laws for Photons in Curved Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a Lorentz-covariant bispinorial wave function and wave equation for a single photon on a curved background with no symmetries. We show the existence of a 10-dimensional set of conservation laws for this equation, and prove that on an asymptotically flat background 8 of these conservation laws yield global, gauge-invariant, ADM-like quantities that together define a covariantly constant self-dual bispinor.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and Noether's theorem for multicontact field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A geometric framework, called multicontact geometry, has recently been developed to study action-dependent field theories. In this work, we use this framework to analyze symmetries in action-dependent Lagrangian and Hamiltonian field theories, as well as their associated dissipation laws. Specifically, we establish the definitions of conserved and dissipated quantities, define the general symmetries of the field equations and the geometric structure, and examine their properties. The latter ones, referred to as Noether symmetries, lead to the formulation of a version of Noether's Theorem in this setting, which associates each of these symmetries with the corresponding dissipated quantity and the resulting conservation law.</description>

      <title>On the construction of polynomial Poisson algebras: a novel grading approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we refine recent results on the explicit construction of polynomial algebras associated with commutants of subalgebras in enveloping algebras of Lie algebras by considering an additional grading with respect to the subalgebra. It is shown that such an approach simplifies and systematizes the explicit derivation of the Lie--Poisson brackets of elements in the commutant, and several fundamental properties of the grading are given. The procedure is illustrated by revisiting three relevant reduction chains associated with the rank-two complex simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}(3,\mathbb{C})$. Specifically, we analyze the reduction chains $\mathfrak{so}(3) \subset \mathfrak{su}(3)$, corresponding to the Elliott model in nuclear physics, the chain $\mathfrak{o}(3) \subset \mathfrak{sl}(3,\mathbb{C})$ associated with the decomposition of the enveloping algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}(3,\mathbb{C})$ as a sum of modules, and the reduction chain $\mathfrak{h} \subset \mathfrak{sl}(3,\mathbb{C})$ connected to the Racah algebra $R(3)$. In addition, a description of the classification of the centralizer with respect to the Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ associated with the classical series $A_n$ in connection with its root system is reconsidered. As an illustration of the procedure, the case of $S(A_3)^\mathfrak{h}$ is considered in detail, which is connected with the rank-two Racah algebra for specific realizations of the generators as vector fields. This case has attracted interest with regard to orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>On the Lee-Yang property of some ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the Lieb-Sokal theorem, the partition function, $Z$, of a ferromagnetic spin model has the Lee-Yang property if the single-spin partition function has it. In this note, it is shown that for some spin models a ferromagnetic interaction can induce the Lee-Yang property of $Z$ even if the single-spin partition function fails to have it. In particular, this holds for the Blume-Capel model and for the annealed states of the $s=\pm 1$ site dilute Ising model with a neares-neighbor interaction on $\mathds{Z}^d$, as well as with interactions defined by a hierarchical structure similar to that of Dyson's hierarchical model.</description>

      <title>Extensions from within</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inclusions and extensions lie at the heart of physics and mathematics. The most relevant kind of inclusion in quantum systems is that of a von Neumann subalgebra, which is the focus of this work. We propose an object intrinsic to a given algebra that indexes its potential extensions into larger algebras. We refer to this object as a spatial Q-system, since it is inspired by the Q-system construction of Longo and others that has been used to categorify finite index inclusions for properly infinite algebras. The spatial Q-system broadens the usefulness of the Q-system by extending its applicability to the context of possibly infinite index inclusions admitting only operator valued weights rather than conditional expectations. An immediate physical motivation for the spatial Q-system arises in the form of the crossed product, which is a method for extending a given algebra by the generators of a locally compact group which acts upon it. If the group in question is not finite, the inclusion of the original algebra into its crossed product will be of infinite index and admit only an operator valued weight. Such an extension cannot be described by a standard Q-system. The spatial Q-system covers this case and, in fact, may be regarded as a far reaching generalization of the crossed product in which an algebra is extended by a collection of operators that possess a closed product structure compatible with the original algebra, but need not generate a symmetry object. We comment upon the categorical interpretation of the spatial Q-system, and describe how it may be interpreted as instantiating a protocol for approximate, or non-isometric, quantum error correction or in terms of quantum reference frames. We conclude by identifying a series of physical applications including the study of generalized symmetries, non-perturbative quantum gravity, black hole evaporation and interiors, and holography.</description>

      <title>Configurational Information Measures, Phase Transitions, and an Upper Bound on Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Configurational entropy (CE) and configurational complexity (CC) are recently popularized information theoretic measures used to study the stability of solitons. This paper examines their behavior for 2D and 3D lattice Ising Models, where the quasi-stability of fluctuating domains is controlled by proximity to the critical temperature. Scaling analysis lends support to an unproven conjecture that these configurational information measures (CIMs) can detect (in)stability in field theories. The primary results herein are the derivation of a model dependent CC-CE relationship, as well as a model independent upper bound on CC. CIM phenomenology in the Ising universality class reveals multiple avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Large $N$ Vertex Algebras via Deligne Category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new construction of vertex algebras using the Deligne category. This approach provides a rigorous framework for defining the so-called large $N$ vertex algebra, which has appeared in recent physics literatures. We first define the notion of a vertex algebra in a symmetric monoidal category and extend familiar constructions in ordinary vertex algebras to this broader categorical context. As an application, we consider a $\beta\gamma$ vertex algebra in the Deligne category and construct the large N vertex algebra from it. We study some simple properties of this vertex algebra and analyze a certain vertex Poisson algebra limit.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of gauge covariant renormalisation of stochastic 3D Yang-Mills-Higgs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local solutions to the 3D stochastic quantisation equations of Yang-Mills-Higgs were constructed in (arXiv:2201.03487), and it was shown that, in the limit of smooth mollifications, there exists a mass renormalisation of the Yang-Mills field such that the solution is gauge covariant. In this paper we prove uniqueness of the mass renormalisation that leads to gauge covariant solutions. This strengthens the main result of (arXiv:2201.03487), and is potentially important for the identification of the limit of other approximations, such as lattice dynamics. Our proof relies on systematic short-time expansions of singular stochastic PDEs and of regularised Wilson loops. We also strengthen the recently introduced state spaces to allow finer control on line integrals appearing in expansions of Wilson loops.</description>

      <title>A class of anisotropic diffusion-transport equations in non-divergence form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize Einstein's probabilistic method for the Brownian motion to study compressible fluids in porous media. The multi-dimensional case is considered with general probability distribution functions. By relating the expected displacement per unit time with the velocity of the fluid, we derive an anisotropic diffusion equation in non-divergence form that contains a transport term. Under the Darcy law assumption, a corresponding nonlinear partial differential equations for the density function is obtained. The classical solutions of this equation are studied, and the maximum and strong maximum principles are established. We also obtain exponential decay estimates for the solutions for all time, and particularly, their exponential convergence as time tends to infinity. Our analysis uses some transformations of the Bernstein-Cole--Hopf type which are explicitly constructed even for very general equation of state. Moreover, the Lemma of Growth in time is proved and utilized in order to achieve the above decaying estimates.</description>

      <title>Non-resonant Hopf Links Near a Hamiltonian Equilibrium Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is about the existence of periodic orbits near an equilibrium point of a two-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian system. The equilibrium is supposed to be a nondegenerate minimum of the Hamiltonian. Every sphere-like component of the energy surface sufficiently close to the equilibrium contains at least two periodic orbits forming a Hopf link (A. Weinstein [19]). A theorem by Hofer, Wysocki, and Zehnder [9] implies that there are either precisely two or infinitely many periodic orbits on such a component of the energy surface. This multiplicity result follows from the existence of a disk-like global surface of section. If a certain non-resonance condition on the rotation numbers of the orbits of the Hopf link is satisfied [8], then infinitely many periodic orbits follow. This paper aims to present explicit conditions on the Birkhoff-Gustavson normal forms of the Hamiltonian function at the equilibrium point that ensure the existence of infinitely many periodic orbits on the energy surface by checking the non-resonance condition as in [8] and not making use of any global surface of section. The main results focus on strongly resonant equilibrium points and apply to the Spatial Isosceles Three-Body Problem, Hill's Lunar Problem, and the H\'enon-Heiles System.</description>

      <title>Loop vs. Bernoulli percolation on trees: strict inequality of critical values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider loop ensembles on random trees. The loops are induced by a Poisson process of links sampled on the underlying tree interpreted as a metric graph. We allow two types of links, crosses and double bars. The crosses-only case corresponds to the random-interchange process, the inclusion of double bars is motivated by representations of models arising in mathematical physics. For a large class of random trees, including all Galton-Watson trees with mean offspring number in $(1,\infty)$, we show that the threshold Poisson intensity at which an infinite loop arises is strictly larger than the corresponding quantity for percolation of the untyped links. The latter model is equivalent to i.i.d. Bernoulli bond percolation. An important ingredient in our argument is a sensitivity result for the bond percolation threshold under downward perturbation of the underlying tree by a general finite range percolation. We also provide a partial converse to the strict-inequality result in the case of Galton-Watson trees and improve previously established criteria for the existence of an infinite loop in the case were the Galton-Watson tree has Poisson offspring.</description>

      <title>On the classification of centralizers of ODOs: An effective differential algebra approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correspondence between commutative rings of ordinary differential operators and algebraic curves has been extensively and deeply studied since the seminal works of Burchnall-Chaundy in 1923. This paper is an overview of recent developments to make this correspondence computationally effective, by means of differential algebra and symbolic computation.
  The centralizer of an ordinary differential operator $L$ is a maximal commutative ring, the affine ring of a spectral curve $\Gamma$. The defining ideal of $\Gamma$ is described, assuming that a finite set of generators of the centralizer is known. In addition, the factorization problem of $L-\lambda$ over a new coefficient field, defined by the coefficient field of $L$ and $\Gamma$, allows the computation of spectral sheaves on $\Gamma$. The ultimate goal is to develop Picard-Vessiot theory for spectral problems $L(y)=\lambda y$, for a generic $\lambda$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of random matrices where correlations between matrix elements are induced via interaction-derived Boltzmann factors. Varying these yields access to different ensembles. We find a universal scaling behavior of the finite-size statistics characterized by a heavy-tailed eigenvalue distribution whose extremes are governed by the Fr\'echet extreme value distribution for the case corresponding to a ferromagnetic Ising transition. The introduction of a finite density of nonlocal interactions restores standard random-matrix behavior. Suitably rescaled average extremes, playing a physical role as an order parameter, can thus discriminate aspects of the interaction structure; they also yield further nonuniversal information. In particular, the link between maximum eigenvalues and order parameters offers a potential route to resolving long-standing problems in statistical physics, such as deriving the exact magnetization scaling function in the two-dimensional Ising model at criticality.</description>

      <title>F-theory with hyperelliptic fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the role of hyperelliptic fibrations in F-theory. For each even integer $n$ we give a noncompact Calabi--Yau threefold $X$ containing a hyperelliptically fibered surface $Y$, such that $X$ and $Y$ are homotopy equivalent and $c_2(X) = n$. We investigate two distinct cases depending on the position of the hyperelliptic fibration. First, we propose to extend F-theory considering hyperelliptic fibrations, giving an identification between the determinant of the period matrix and the axio-dilaton. Such an identification requires that the curve satisfies an appropriate criterium which we describe. Our explicit examples have split Jacobian, preserve the same number of degrees of freedom of usual F-theory, while allowing for the appearance of a greater variety of singularities. Second, when the hyperelliptic fibration is contained in the base of a Calabi--Yau fourfold, we show that tadpole cancellation conditions are satisfied for arbitrarily large values of $c_2(X)$.</description>

      <title>Free cumulants and freeness for unitarily invariant random tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the question of the asymptotic description of random tensors that are local-unitary invariant, that is, invariant by conjugation by tensor products of independent unitary matrices. We consider both the mixed case of a tensor with $D$ inputs and $D$ outputs, and the case where there is a factorization between the inputs and outputs, called pure, which includes the random tensor models extensively studied in the physics literature.
  The finite size and asymptotic moments are defined using correlations of certain invariant polynomials encoded by $D$-tuples of permutations, up to relabeling equivalence. Finite size free cumulants associated to the expectations of these invariants are defined through invertible finite size moment-cumulants formulas.
  Two important cases are considered asymptotically: pure random tensors that scale like a complex Gaussian, and mixed random tensors that scale like a Wishart tensor. In both cases, we derive a notion of tensorial free cumulants associated to first order invariants, through moment-cumulant formulas involving summations over non-crossing permutations. The pure and mixed cases involve the same combinatorics, but differ by the invariants that define the distribution at first order. In both cases, the tensorial free-cumulants of a sum of two independent tensors are shown to be additive. A preliminary discussion of higher orders is provided.
  Tensor freeness is then defined as the vanishing of mixed first order tensorial free cumulants. The equivalent formulation at the level of asymptotic moments is derived in the pure and mixed cases, and we provide an algebraic construction of tensorial probability spaces, which generalize non-commutative probability spaces: random tensors converge in distribution to elements of these spaces, and tensor freeness of random variables corresponds to tensor freeness of the subspaces they generate.</description>

      <title>Path Integral for Multiplicative Noise: Generalized Fokker-Planck Equation and Entropy Production Rate in Stochastic Processes With Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive extension of the path integral formalism to model stochastic processes with arbitrary multiplicative noise. To do so, It\^o diffusive process is generalized by incorporating a multiplicative noise term $(\eta(t))$ that affects the diffusive coefficient in the stochastic differential equation. Then, using the Parisi-Sourlas method, we estimate the transition probability between states of a stochastic variable $(X(t))$ based on the cumulant generating function $(\mathcal{K}_{\eta})$ of the noise. A parameter $\gamma\in[0,1]$ is introduced to account for the type of stochastic calculation used and its effect on the Jacobian of the path integral formalism. Next, the Feynman-Kac functional is then employed to derive the Fokker-Planck equation for generalized It\^o diffusive processes, addressing issues with higher-order derivatives and ensuring compatibility with known functionals such as Onsager-Machlup and Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-De Dominicis in the white noise case. The general solution for the Fokker-Planck equation is provided when the stochastic drift is proportional to the diffusive coefficient and $\mathcal{K}_{\eta}$ is scale-invariant. Finally, the Brownian motion ($BM$), the geometric Brownian motion ($GBM$), the Levy $\alpha$-stable flight ($LF(\alpha)$), and the geometric Levy $\alpha$-stable flight ($GLF(\alpha)$) are simulated with thresholds, providing analytical comparisons for the probability density, Shannon entropy, and entropy production rate. It is found that restricted $BM$ and restricted $GBM$ exhibit quasi-steady states since the rate of entropy production never vanishes. It is also worth mentioning that in this work the $GLF(\alpha)$ is defined for the first time in the literature and it is shown that its solution is found without the need for It\^o's lemma.</description>

      <title>On the structure of trans-series in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many observables in quantum field theory can be expressed in terms of trans-series, in which one adds to the perturbative series a typically infinite sum of exponentially small corrections, due to instantons or to renormalons. Even after Borel resummation of the series in the coupling constant, one has to sum this infinite series of small exponential corrections. It has been argued that this leads to a new divergence, which is sometimes called the divergence of the OPE. We show that, in some interesting examples in quantum field theory, the series of small exponential corrections is convergent, order by order in the coupling constant. In particular, we give numerical evidence for this convergence property in the case of the free energy of integrable asymptotically free theories, which has been intensively studied recently in the framework of resurgence. Our results indicate that, in these examples, the Borel resummed trans-series leads to a well defined function, and there are no further divergences.</description>

      <title>Structured Input-Output Modeling and Robust Stability Analysis of Compressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently introduced structured input-output analysis is a powerful method for capturing nonlinear phenomena associated with incompressible flows, and this paper extends that method to the compressible regime. The proposed method relies upon a reformulation of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, which allows for an exact quadratic formulation of the dynamics of perturbations about a steady base flow. To facilitate the structured input-output analysis, a pseudo-linear model for the quadratic nonlinearity is proposed and the structural information of the nonlinearity is embedded into a structured uncertainty comprising unknown `perturbations'. The structured singular value framework is employed to compute the input-output gain, which provides an estimate of the robust stability margin of the flow perturbations, as well as the forcing and response modes that are consistent with the nonlinearity structure. The analysis is then carried out on a plane, laminar compressible Couette flow over a range of Mach numbers. The structured input-output gains identify an instability mechanism, characterized by a spanwise elongated structure in the streamwise-spanwise wavenumber space at a subsonic Mach number, that takes the form of an oblique structure at sonic and supersonic Mach numbers. In addition, the structured input-output forcing and response modes provide insight into the thermodynamic and momentum characteristics associated with a source of instability. Comparisons with a resolvent/unstructured analysis reveal discrepancies in the distribution of input-output gains over the wavenumber space as well as in the modal behavior of an instability, thus highlighting the strong correlation between the structural information of the nonlinearity and the underlying flow physics.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study plasmonic time crystals, an extension of dielectric-based photonic time crystals to plasmonic media. Remarkably, we demonstrate that such systems may amplify both longitudinal and transverse modes. In particular, we show that plasmonic time crystals support \emph{collective resonances} of longitudinal modes, which occur independently of the wave vector $k$, even in the presence of significant dissipation. These resonances originate from the coupling between the positive- and negative-frequency branches of the plasmonic dispersion relation of the unmodulated system and from the divergence of the density of states near the plasma ($\varepsilon$-near zero) frequency $\omega_p$. The strongest resonance arises at a modulation frequency $\Omega = 2 \omega_p$, corresponding to a direct interband transition. We demonstrate these resonances for various periodic modulation profiles and provide a generic perturbative formula for resonance widths in the weak modulation limit. Furthermore, we propose transparent conducting oxides as promising platforms for realizing plasmonic time crystals, as they enable significant modulation of the electron effective mass while maintaining moderate dissipation levels. Our findings provide new insights into leveraging time-modulated plasmonic media to enhance optical gain and control wave dynamics at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Emptiness Instanton in Quantum Polytropic Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11686v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emptiness formation problem is addressed for a one-dimensional quantum polytropic gas characterized by an arbitrary polytropic index $\gamma$, which defines the equation of state $P \sim \rho^\gamma$, where $P$ is the pressure and $\rho$ is the density. The problem involves determining the probability of the spontaneous formation of an empty interval in the ground state of the gas. In the limit of a macroscopically large interval, this probability is dominated by an instanton configuration. By solving the hydrodynamic equations in imaginary time, we derive the analytic form of the emptiness instanton. This solution is expressed as an integral representation analogous to those used for correlation functions in Conformal Field Theory. Prominent features of the spatiotemporal profile of the instanton are obtained directly from this representation.</description>

      <title>Counterdiabatic Driving with Performance Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Counterdiabatic (CD) driving has the potential to speed up adiabatic quantum state preparation by suppressing unwanted excitations. However, existing approaches either require intractable classical computations or are based on approximations which do not have performance guarantees. We propose and analyze a non-variational, system-agnostic CD expansion method and analytically show that it converges exponentially quickly in the expansion order. In finite systems, the required resources scale inversely with the spectral gap, which we argue is asymptotically optimal. To extend our method to the thermodynamic limit and suppress errors stemming from high-frequency transitions, we leverage finite-time adiabatic protocols. In particular, we show that a time determined by the quantum speed limit is sufficient to prepare the desired ground state, without the need to optimize the adiabatic trajectory. Numerical tests of our method on the quantum Ising chain show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art variational CD approaches.</description>
