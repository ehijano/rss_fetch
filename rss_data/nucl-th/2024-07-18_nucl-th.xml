      <title>Breakup dynamics of a neutron-halo projectile on heavy target at deep sub-barrier energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By studying the total fusion and breakup cross-sections in the interaction of the neutron-halo $^{11}{\rm Be}$ projectile on the lead target $^{208}$Pb, it is shown that, even for the neutron-halo projectile, the breakup channel remains the most dominant reaction channel at sub-barrier energies, following a characteristic behavior that was also previously verified for the case of the proton-halo projectile $^8{\rm B}$. This feature is found to emanate from the enhancement of the breakup cross-section, due to the continuum-continuum couplings coming exclusively from its Coulomb component. We further speculate that the enhancement of the Coulomb breakup cross-section at sub-barrier incident energies by the continuum-continuum couplings could be associated with the projectile breaking up on the outgoing trajectory, provided these couplings can be proven to delay the breakup process.</description>

      <title>On a possible $^{3}_{\phi}$H hypernucleus with HAL QCD interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the Faddeev formalism in configuration space, we investigate bound states in the $\phi NN$ system with total isospin $T=0$ and $T=1$. The recently proposed lattice HAL QCD $\phi N$ potential in the $^{4}S_{3/2}$ channel does not support either $\phi N$ or $\phi NN$ bound states. The HAL QCD $\phi N$ potential in the $^{2}S_{1/2}$ channel suggests the bound states for $\phi N$ and $\phi NN (S=0)$ systems. However, the binding energies are highly sensitive to variations of the enhancement factor $\beta$, and the $\phi NN$ system is extremely strongly bound in the state $S=0$. Considering a spin-averaged potential %$(\frac{1}{3}V_{\phi N}^{1/2}+\frac{2}{3}V_{\phi N}^{3/2})$ for the state $S=1$ yields a bound state for $^3_\phi$H $(S=1)$ hypernucleus with the binding energy (BE) 14.9 MeV when $\beta = 6.9$. The evaluation of the BE for the $S=1$, $T=1$ three-body state results in 5.47 MeV. %Also, We evaluated the BE for the $S=1$, $T=1$ three-body state as 5.47 MeV. Additionally, calculations using our approach confirm the bound states for the $\phi NN$ ($S=2,T=0$ and $S=1, T=1$) system previously predicted with the Yukawa-type potential motivated by the QCD van der Waals attractive force, mediated by multi-gluon exchanges.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscosity of 2SC quark matter in neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the bulk viscosity of moderately hot and dense, neutrino-transparent color superconducting quark matter arising from weak-interaction-driven direct Urca processes. The quark matter is modeled using Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model improved to account for vector and t'Hooft interactions as well as antisymmetric pairing among the red/green up and down quarks. The unpaired excitations are the strange quarks and the blue up or down quarks. We compute the relaxation rates associated with $d$ and $s$-quark decay and electron capture processes on $u$ quark for blue color. The resulting bulk viscosity for density oscillations in the 1 to 10\,kHz range shows a resonant peak at $T\sim 5\,\MeV$, and the damping time may drop below 10 ms. This is short enough to affect the post-merger evolution and is very similar to the damping predicted in nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>BCS-BEC crossover of the strongly interacting $^6$Li--$^{40}$K mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the properties of a two--component mass imbalanced Fermi gas, corresponding to the $^6$Li--$^{40}$K mixture. We compute the equation of state of the unpolarized system as a function of the scattering length with particular attention paid to the unitary limit, where the effect of the effective range of the interaction is explored. We have also computed the pair distribution function and the momentum distribution over a range of interaction strengths to provide information about the structure of the system. Finally, we have computed the heavy/light quasiparticle spectrum. Our theoretical predictions, based on Quantum Monte Carlo calculations, can be tested by future experiments with ultracold fermionic gases.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization of fermions at local equilibrium: Second-order gradient expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the spin polarization of spin-1/2 fermions in a relativistic fluid at local thermodynamic equilibrium at the second order in the gradient expansion, including second-order derivatives. The second-order derivative terms vanish if the local equilibrium hypersurface is the hyperplane $t=const$ in the collision center-of-mass frame. However, since the freeze-out hypersurface has a non-trivial space-time structure, these terms may result in a non-vanishing contribution to the spin polarization, whose magnitude needs to be assessed with numerical computations.</description>

      <title>Review of nonflow estimation methods and uncertainties in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective anisotropic flow, where particles are correlated over the entire event, is a prominent phenomenon in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and is sensitive to the properties of the matter created in those collisions. It is often measured by two- and multi-particle correlations and is therefore contaminated by nonflow, those genuine few-body correlations unrelated to the global event-wise correlations. Many methods have been devised to estimate nonflow contamination with various degrees of successes and difficulties. Here, we review those methods pedagogically, discussing the pros and cons of each method, and give examples of ballpark estimate of nonflow contamination and associated uncertainties in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We hope such a review of the various nonflow estimation methods in a single place would prove helpful to future researches.</description>

      <title>Infinite Order Hydrodynamics: An Analytical Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a kinetic model for matter-radiation interactions whose hydrodynamic gradient expansion can be computed analytically up to infinite order in derivatives, in the fully nonlinear regime, and for arbitrary flows. The frequency dependence of the opacity of matter is chosen to mimic the relaxation time of a self-interacting scalar field. In this way, the transient sector simulates that of a realistic quantum field theory. The gradient series is found to diverge for most flows, in agreement with previous findings. We identify, for the model at hand, the mechanism at the origin of the divergence, and we provide a successful regularization scheme. Additionally, we propose a universal qualitative framework for predicting the breakdown of the gradient expansion of an arbitrary microscopic system undergoing a given flow. This framework correctly recovers all previously known instances of gradient expansion divergence. As a new prediction, we show that the gradient expansion diverges when the energy-dependent mean free path is unbounded above.</description>

      <title>Softening of the Hypertriton Transverse Momentum Spectrum in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02701v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of hypernuclei helps to constrain the interaction between hyperon and nucleon, which is known to play an essential role in determining the properties of neutron stars. Experimental measurements have suggested that the hypertriton ($^3_\Lambda \text{H}$), the lightest hypernucleus, exhibits a halo structure with a deuteron core encircled by a $\Lambda$ hyperon at a distance of about 10 fm. This large $\Lambda-d$ distance in $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ wave function is found to cause a suppressed $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ yield and a softening of its transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectrum in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Within the coalescence model based on nucleons and $\Lambda$ hyperons from a microscopic hybrid hydro model with a hadronic afterburner for nuclear cluster production in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 5.02 TeV, we show how this softening of the hypertriton $p_T$ spectrum appears and leads to a smaller mean $p_T$ for $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ than for helium-3 ($^3$He). The latter is opposite to the predictions from the blast-wave model which assumes that $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ and $^3$He are thermally produced at the kinetic freeze-out of heavy-ion collisions. The discovered quantum mechanical softening of the (anti-)hypertriton spectrum can be experimentally tested in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at different collision energies and centralities and used to obtain valuable insights into the mechanisms for light (hyper-)nuclei production in these collisions.</description>

      <title>Significance of the refraction effect on the $p$-$d$ elementary process in the ($p$,$pd$) reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proton-induced deuteron knockout reaction, ($p$,$pd$), is one of the interests in the studies for probing the deuteron-like $p$-$n$ correlation in nuclei. According to a recent study of the inclusive deuteron-induced reaction, $(d,d'x)$, the refraction effect of the deuteron has a significant effect on the elementary process, nucleon-deuteron ($N$-$d$) binary scattering inside a nucleus, of the reaction. In the paper, it is shown that proper treatment of the local $N$-$d$ relative momentum in the elementary process is crucial in $(d,d'x)$ reactions at $100$ MeV and below. In the present work, we investigate the deuteron refraction effect in the exclusive ($p$,$pd$) reactions. We also discuss the incident energy dependence of the refraction effect. The refraction effect on the $p$-$d$ elementary process is taken into account by the local semiclassical approximation to the distorted waves. The results are compared with those obtained with the asymptotic momentum approximation, which is standardly applied to the distorted wave impulse approximation framework. It is shown that the refraction effect drastically changes the energy sharing distribution of the $^{16}$O($p$,$pd$)$^{14}$N reaction at 101.3 MeV and gives a better agreement with experimental data. In contrast, it is confirmed that the effect is negligibly small at 250 MeV. We have clarified that the deuteron refraction effect is significant in the $^{16}$O($p$,$pd$)$^{14}$N reaction at 101.3 MeV and the experimental data are well reproduced. The refraction effect plays a significant role in both the shape and magnitude of the ($p$,$pd$) cross section, while the effect is negligible at 250 MeV.</description>

      <title>Transverse momentum balance of dijets in Xe+Xe collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the medium modifications of the $p_T$ balance ($x_J$) of dijets in Xe+Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.44$ TeV. The initial production of dijets was carried out using the POWHEG+PYTHIA8 prescription, which matches the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD matrix elements with the parton shower (PS) effect. The SHELL model described the in-medium evolution of nucleus-nucleus collisions using a transport approach. The theoretical results of the dijet $x_J$ in the Xe+Xe collisions exhibit more imbalanced distributions than those in the p+p collisions, consistent with recently reported ATLAS data. By utilizing the Interleaved Flavor Neutralisation, an infrared-and-collinear-safe jet flavor algorithm, to identify the flavor of the reconstructed jets, we classify dijets processes into three categories: gluon-gluon ($gg$), quark-gluon ($qg$), and quark-quark ($qq$), and investigated the respective medium modification patterns and fraction changes of the $gg$, $qg$, and $qq$ components of the dijet sample in Xe+Xe collisions. It is shown that the increased fraction of $qg$ component at a small $x_J$ contributes to the imbalance of the dijet; in particular, the $q_1g_2$ (quark-jet-leading) dijets experience more significant asymmetric energy loss than the $g_1q_2$ (gluon-jet-leading) dijets traversing the QGP. By comparing the $\Delta \langle x_J\rangle = \langle x_J \rangle_{pp} - \langle x_J \rangle_{AA}$ of inclusive, $c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$ dijets in Xe+Xe collisions, we observe $\Delta\langle x_J \rangle_{incl.}&gt;\Delta \langle x_J \rangle_{c\bar{c}}&gt;\Delta \langle x_J \rangle_{b\bar{b}}$. Moreover, $\rho_{Xe, Pb}$, the ratios of the nuclear modification factors of dijets in Xe+Xe to those in Pb+Pb, were calculated, which indicates that the yield suppression of dijets in Pb+Pb is more pronounced than that in Xe+Xe owing to the larger radius of the lead nucleus.</description>
