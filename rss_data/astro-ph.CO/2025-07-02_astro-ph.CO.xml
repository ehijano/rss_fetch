      <title>Symmetry-protected conservation of superhorizon inflationary perturbations to all loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrates that the single-field inflation field system exhibits a symmetry that constrains its evolution via the Ward identity even for non-attractor inflation. By analyzing loop diagram structures, we derive a superhorizon conserved quantity directly related to the two-point correlation function of curvature perturbations, generalizing previous one-loop results to arbitrary loop orders. This symmetry-based approach provides a framework for understanding quantum conservation laws beyond the leading perturbative order.</description>

      <title>Constraining the magnetic field in the galaxy cluster Abell 2142 using MeerKAT L-band polarisation data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields permeate the Universe, including galaxy clusters, and affect the thermodynamical properties of the intra-cluster medium (ICM). Cosmological simulations predict that seed magnetic fields are amplified up to the $\mu$G-level in the ICM, but the magnetic field strength and structure have been studied in only a few clusters. Abell 2142 is a local massive cluster that shows evidence of a post-merger dynamical state. In this work, we aim to constrain the magnetic field intensity, radial profile and power spectrum within its ICM, providing key insights into the nature of this non-thermal component in galaxy clusters. We present MeerKAT observations of Abell 2142 in the L-band (872-1712 MHz), imaged in polarisation for the first time with this purpose. We derive the Rotation Measure (RM) from the radio galaxies' polarised emission by applying the RM synthesis technique and analyse both the RM and fractional polarisation ($\mathrm{F_p}$). To investigate the magnetic field distribution within the ICM, we compare our results with mock RM maps generated from 3D simulations of the cluster. We find that the RM dispersion, $\sigma_{\mathrm{RM}}$, decreases with projected radius, whereas the $\mathrm{F_p}$ increases. Both trends suggest that the magnetic field intensity decreases at larger distances from the cluster center, in agreement with studies on other clusters. Assuming that the magnetic field energy density scales with the gas thermal energy ($B \propto n_e^{0.5}$), a magnetic field with a power spectrum ranging from scales between 7 and 470 kpc, with peak at $\sim 140$ kpc and mean central strength of $9.5 \pm 1.0 \ \mu$G, provides the best fit to our data. The high central magnetic field lies at the upper end of the range observed in other systems and supports the possibility of an hadronic contribution to the diffuse radio emission previously detected at the cluster center.</description>

      <title>Quantum stress-energy at timelike boundaries: testing a new beyond-$\Lambda$CDM parameter with cosmological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the basic cosmological effects of a population of timelike boundaries -- a form of nontrivial spacetime topology -- containing a boundary layer of quantum stress energy. This accumulation of vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields can be consistently negative and UV sensitive, providing an additional source of cosmic energy density strong enough to compete with matter and dark energy. For boundary conditions enabling a solution with fixed comoving boundary size, this effect contributes a qualitatively new term to the Friedmann equation determining the expansion history, scaling like $-1/a$ for scale factor $a$. It naturally dominates at relatively late times ($a\approx1/2$), while leaving intact well-measured early universe physics such as big bang nucleosynthesis and recombination. For a wide window of parameters, the boundaries can be larger than the Planck length throughout their history, back through the start of inflation at any viable scale. We analyze CMB and BAO data sets (Planck, ACT, and DESI) allowing for this component, finding a slight preference ($\sim 2\sigma$) and a relaxation of current tensions in the data (including the neutrino mass) in a physical manner. This novel parameter fits into a larger space of physical parameters beyond-$\Lambda$CDM that may serve this role, including negative spatial curvature, which may also be motivated by topological considerations and chaotic dynamics. Finally, we comment on additional phenomenological prospects for testing for this form of topology in the universe.</description>

      <title>Constraining Dynamical Dark Energy from Galaxy Clustering with Simulation-Based Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective-field theory based full-shape analysis with simulation-based priors (EFT-SBP) is the novel analysis of galaxy clustering data that allows one to combine merits of perturbation theory and simulation-based modeling in a unified framework. In this paper we use EFT-SBP with the galaxy clustering power spectrum and bispectrum data from BOSS in order to test the recent preference for dynamical dark energy reported by the DESI collaboration. While dynamical dark energy is preferred by the combination of DESI baryon acoustic oscillation, \textit{Planck} Cosmic Microwave Background, and Pantheon+ supernovae data, we show that this preference disappears once these data sets are combined with the usual BOSS EFT galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum likelihood. The use of the simulation-based priors in this analysis further weakens the case for dynamical dark energy by additionally shrinking the parameter posterior around the cosmological constant region. Specifically, the figure of merit of the dynamical dark energy constraints from the combined data set improves by $\approx 20\%$ over the usual EFT-full-shape analysis with the conservative priors. These results are made possible with a novel modeling approach to the EFT prior distribution with the Gaussian mixture models, which allows us to both accurately capture the EFT priors and retain the ability to analytically marginalize the likelihood over most of the EFT nuisance parameters. Our results challenge the dynamical dark energy interpretation of the DESI data and enable future EFT-SBP analyses of BOSS and DESI in the context of non-minimal cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Lya2pcf: an efficient pipeline to estimate two- and three-point correlation functions of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the matter distribution in the universe through the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest allows us to constrain small-scale physics in the high-redshift regime. Spectroscopic quasar surveys are generating increasingly large datasets that require efficient algorithms to compute correlation functions. Moreover, cosmological analyses based on Lyman-$\alpha$ forests can significantly benefit from incorporating higher-order statistics alongside traditional two-point correlations. In this work, we present Lya2pcf, a pipeline designed to compute three-dimensional two-point and three-point correlation functions using Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data. The code implements standard algorithms widely used in current spectroscopic surveys for computing the two-point correlation function with its distortion matrix, covariance matrices; and it naturally extends the two-point estimator to three-point correlations. Thanks to GPU optimization, Lya2pcf achieves a substantial reduction in computational time for both the two-point correlation function and its distortion matrix when compared to the widely used PICCA code. We apply Lya2pcf to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) sixteenth data release (DR16) and a Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Year-5 (DESI Y5) mock dataset, demonstrating overall performance gains over PICCA, especially on GPUs. We show the first measurement of the anisotropic three-point correlation function on a large spectroscopic sample for all possible triangles with scales up to 80 Mpc/h. The estimator's fast computation and the resulting signal-to-noise ratio -- above one for many triangle configurations -- demonstrate the viability of incorporating three-point statistics into future cosmological inference analyses, particularly with the larger datasets expected from Stage IV spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>CHEX-MATE: New detections and properties of the radio diffuse emission in massive clusters with MeerKAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern radio telescopes are revolutionising our understanding of non-thermal phenomena within galaxy clusters, collecting large samples of extended sources with unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution. In this work, we present novel MeerKAT observations for a sample of 21 galaxy clusters being part of the CHEX-MATE project. These systems were selected based on their high mass and displaying signs of dynamical activity. Thanks to the high-quality data in hand, we detect extended radio emission in every target considered. We report two new halos, three new relics and confirm a previous candidate halo and two candidate radio relics. When investigating the scaling relations with the cluster properties, we confirm the presence of a radio halo power-mass correlation and relate it to a higher radio halo emissivity in more massive clusters. For radio relics, we highlight the MeerKAT capabilities to significantly extend the depth of radio observations to a new, unexplored field of low radio power sources ($\lesssim 10^{23} ~ {\rm W~Hz^{-1}} $ at 1.28 GHz). Thanks to such high-sensitivity data, we show that the radio relic power can display a wide range of values for a given cluster mass and relic size. Ultimately, we discuss how current radio observations, in combination with large radio surveys, are becoming capable of testing numerical simulation predictions and being close to perform direct comparison with them, in order to gain new insights on the evolution of radio relics.</description>

      <title>DeepCHART: Mapping the 3D dark matter density field from Ly$\alpha$ forest surveys using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DeepCHART (Deep learning for Cosmological Heterogeneity and Astrophysical Reconstruction via Tomography), a deep learning framework designed to reconstruct the three-dimensional dark matter density field at redshift $z=2.5$ from Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra. Leveraging a 3D variational autoencoder with a U-Net architecture, DeepCHART performs fast, likelihood-free inference, accurately capturing the non-linear gravitational dynamics and baryonic processes embedded in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. When applied to joint datasets combining Ly$\alpha$ forest absorption and coeval galaxy positions, the reconstruction quality improves further. For current surveys, such as Subaru/PFS, CLAMATO, and LATIS, with an average transverse sightline spacing of $d_\perp=2.4h^{-1}$cMpc, DeepCHART achieves high-fidelity reconstructions over the density range $0.4&lt;\Delta_{\rm DM}&lt;15$, with a voxel-wise Pearson correlation coefficient of $\rho\simeq 0.77$. These reconstructions are obtained using Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra with signal-to-noise ratios as low as 2 and instrumental resolution $R=2500$, matching Subaru/PFS specifications. For future high-density surveys enabled by instruments such as ELT/MOSAIC and WST/IFS with $d_\perp\simeq 1h^{-1}\mathrm{cMpc}$, the correlation improves to $\rho\simeq 0.90$ across a wider dynamic range ($0.25&lt;\Delta_{\rm DM}&lt;40$). The framework reliably recovers the dark matter density PDF as well as the power spectrum, with only mild suppression at intermediate scales. In terms of cosmic web classification, DeepCHART successfully identifies 81% of voids, 75% of sheets, 63% of filaments, and 43% of nodes. We propose DeepCHART as a powerful and scalable framework for field-level cosmological inference, readily generalisable to other observables, and offering a robust, efficient means of maximising the scientific return of upcoming spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Forecast for growth-rate measurement using peculiar velocities from LSST supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the feasibility of measuring the cosmic growth-rate parameter, $f\sigma_8$, using peculiar velocities (PVs) derived from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We produce simulations of different SN types using a realistic LSST observing strategy, incorporating noise, photometric detection from the Difference Image Analysis (DIA) pipeline, and a PV field modeled from the Uchuu UniverseMachine simulations. We test three observational scenarios, ranging from ideal conditions with spectroscopic host-galaxy redshifts and spectroscopic SN classification, to more realistic settings involving photometric classification and contamination from non-Ia supernovae. Using a maximum-likelihood technique, we show that LSST can measure $f\sigma_8$ with a precision of $10\%$ in the redshift range $ 0.02 &lt; z &lt; 0.14 $ in the most realistic case. Using three tomographic bins, LSST can constrain the growth-rate parameter with errors below $18\%$ up to $z = 0.14$. We also test the impact of contamination on the maximum likelihood method and find that for contamination fractions below $\sim 2\%$, the measurement remains unbiased. These results highlight the potential of the LSST SN Ia sample to complement redshift-space distortion measurements at high redshift, providing a novel avenue for testing general relativity and dark energy models.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Cosmological Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest at the Field Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars, called the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly-$\alpha$) forest, is a unique probe of cosmology and the intergalactic medium at high redshifts and small scales. The statistical power of ongoing redshift surveys demands precise theoretical tools to model the Ly-$\alpha$ forest. We address this challenge by developing an analytic, perturbative forward model to predict the Ly-$\alpha$ forest at the field level for a given set of cosmological initial conditions. Our model shows a remarkable performance when compared with the Sherwood hydrodynamic simulations: it reproduces the flux distribution, the Ly-$\alpha$ - dark matter halo cross-correlations, and the count-in-cell statistics at the percent level down to scales of a few Mpc. Our work provides crucial tools that bridge analytic modeling on large scales with simulations on small-scales, enabling field-level inference from Ly-$\alpha$ forest data and simulation-based priors for cosmological analyses. This is especially timely for realizing the full scientific potential of the Ly-$\alpha$ forest measurements by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy dark matter halos with repulsive self-interactions: coherent soliton and halo vortex network with moderate self-coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the impact of repulsive self-interactions of moderate strength on fuzzy dark matter halos focusing on the core and granule size, the spatial dependence of the field's coherence, the turbulent vortex tangle and the oscillation frequency of the central soliton. Our analysis extends across the range from quantum-pressure-dominated to self-interaction-dominated stabilisation of the gravitationally bound solitonic core. Within this examined range of self-coupling strengths, we find that mergers with a given initial spatial configuration and an increasing self-interaction strength $g$, result in cores with increased size that exhibit a reduced central density and oscillate with decreased frequency. All of these features are in accordance with expectations from the study of isolated Self-interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter (SFDM) solitons. The characteristic size of the granules in the surrounding halo also grows but by a much smaller amount relative to the core; accordingly, typical inter-vortex distances are also only mildly affected. We also measure the total length of the vortex network which, although less robust, shows no clear dependence on increasing $g$ and no signs of decay over the timescales of our simulations. Measures of coherence of the field behave as in the non-interacting case, again clearly separating the coherent core form the quasi-coherent halo. Interestingly, we observe a relative increase of incoherent fluctuations coexisting with the coherent mode at the centre of the halo with increasing self-coupling strength, a phenomenon also observed in laboratory condensates at non-zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Dark from light (DfL): Inferring halo properties from luminous tracers with machine learning trained on cosmological simulations. I. Method, proof of concept &amp; preliminary testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Dark from Light (DfL) - a novel method to infer the dark sector in wide-field galaxy surveys, leveraging a machine learning approach trained on contemporary cosmological simulations. The aim of this algorithm is to provide a fast, straightforward, and accurate route to estimating dark matter halo masses and group membership in wide-field spectroscopic galaxy surveys. This approach requires a highly limited number of input parameters and yields full probability distribution functions for the output halo masses. To achieve this, we train a series of Random Forest (RF) regression models on the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations at z=0-3, which provide model-dependent mappings from luminous tracers to dark matter halo properties. We incorporate the individual regression models into a virial group-finding algorithm (DfL), which outputs halo properties for observational-like input data. We test the method at z=0-2 for both the EAGLE and IllustrisTNG models, as well as in a cross-validation mode. We demonstrate that known halo masses can be recovered with a mean systematic bias of $\langle b \rangle = \pm 0.10\,$dex (resulting from simulation choice), a mean statistical uncertainty of $\langle \sigma \rangle = 0.12 \,$dex across epochs, and a central - (core) satellite classification accuracy of 96%. We establish that this approach yields superior halo mass recovery to standard abundance matching applied to groups identified through a friends-of-friends algorithm. Additionally, we compare the outputs of DfL to observational constraints on the $M_* - M_{\rm Halo}$ relation from strong gravitational lensing at $z \sim 0$, demonstrating the promise of this novel approach. Finally, we systematically quantify how DfL performs on observational-like input data with varying stellar mass uncertainty and spectroscopic incompleteness, enabling robust error calibration.</description>

      <title>The Density Profile of Dynamical Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the most fundamental properties of a dark matter halo is its density profile. Motivated by the recent proposal by Garc\'ia et al. [R. Garc\'ia et. al., MNRAS 521, 2464 (2023)] to define a dynamical halo as the collection of orbiting particles in a gravitationally bound structure, we characterize the mean and scatter of the orbiting profile of dynamical halos as a function of their orbiting mass. We demonstrate that the orbiting profile of individual halos at fixed mass depends on a single dynamical variable -- the halo radius $r_{\rm h}$ -- which characterizes the spatial extent of the profile. The scatter in halo radius at fixed orbiting mass is $\approx 16\%$. Only a small fraction of this scatter arises due to differences in halo formation time, with late-forming halos being more compact (smaller halo radii). Accounting for this additional correlation results in an $\approx 11\%$ scatter in halo radius at fixed mass and halo formation time.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a cosmological model termed $\Lambda w$DM, in which a cosmological constant play the role of dark energy and dark matter is barotropic and has a constant equation of state parameter ($w_{\rm dm}$), to address the $S_8$ tension between early- and late- universe observations. By incorporating the latest cosmological datasets -- including Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), Redshift Space Distortions (RSD), and weak lensing (WL) -- we constrain the $\Lambda w$DM compared to $\Lambda$CDM. Our analysis reveals a marginal preference for a non-zero $w_{\rm dm}=2.7^{+2.0}_{-1.9}\times10^{-7}$( at 95\% confidence level) when combining CMB, SDSS BAO, SNe Ia, RSD, and WL data, and a marginal preference for a non-zero $w_{\rm dm} = 2.29^{+1.9}_{-2.0} \times 10^{-7}$( at 95\% confidence level) when combining CMB, DESI Y1 BAO, SNe Ia, RSD, and WL data. In addition, we find that, compared to $\Lambda$CDM, $\Lambda w$DM can alleviate the $S_8$ tension from $&gt;3\sigma$ to $&lt;1\sigma$. Furthermore, we find that, for CMB+SDSS+PP+RSD+WL datasets, the $\Lambda w$DM model is close to being positively preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation cost for cosmological simulation-based inference can be decreased by combining simulation sets of varying fidelity. We propose an approach to such multi-fidelity inference based on feature matching and knowledge distillation. Our method results in improved posterior quality, particularly for small simulation budgets and difficult inference problems.</description>

      <title>Testing Nambu-Goto approximation of cosmic string by lattice field simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise calculation of gravitational wave (GW) and particle emissions from cosmic string networks is of significant theoretical and experimental interest. In this Letter, we perform numerical simulations of near-global and local string networks, comparing the GW spectra predictions from both lattice field simulation and the Nambu-Goto (NG) approximation methods. We find the discrepancy between the GW spectra computed via the NG approximation and the lattice field simulation is negligible for near-global string and grow with increasing gauge coupling. Additionally, we confirm that particle emission significantly dominates energy emission, with the ratio of GW energy to particle energy approximately $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ for both near-global and local string scenarios.</description>

      <title>Ultralight fuzzy dark matter review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter refers to the lightest potential dark matter candidates. We will focus on the mass range that has been studied using astrophysical and cosmological observations, corresponding to a mass $10^{-24} \, \mathrm{eV} \lesssim m \lesssim 10^{-18} \, \mathrm{eV}$. We will discuss the motivations for this mass range. The most studied model in this range corresponds to a minimally coupled, single, classical, spin-0 field comprising all dark matter. However, the work exploring extensions of this model (for example, higher spin, self-coupled, multiple field, and mixed models) will be one of the focuses of this review. The phenomenology associated with ultralight dark matter is rich and includes linear effects on the primordial power spectrum, core structures forming at the center of halos, nonlinear effects resulting in heating of stellar distributions, and non-relativistic effects relating to pulsar signals and black hole superradiance, to name a few. This set of effects has been studied using an equally extensive set of numerical tools. We will summarize the most common ones and discuss their applications and limitations. Ultralight dark matter also has a wide variety of observational constraints, including halo mass functions, the Lyman-alpha forest, halo density profiles, stellar dynamics, and black hole spins. We will review them focusing on the observations made, the method of study, and the major systematics. We will end with a discussion of the current status of the field and future work needed.</description>

      <title>Is $\omega_0 \omega_a$CDM a good model for the clumpy Universe?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DESI collaboration just obtained a set of precise BAO measurements, that combined with CMB and SNIa datasets show that the $\omega_0 \omega_a$CDM model is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM, at more than $4\,\sigma$, to describe the dynamics of the expanding Universe. This raises the question whether this model also suitably describes the clumpy Universe. Also lately, detailed analyses of diverse cosmic tracers resulted in a new dataset of measurements of an observable from the clumpy Universe: $\sigma_8(z)$, spanning a high-redshift data $z \in [0.013, 3.8]$. In this work we use this dataset of 15 $\sigma_8(z_i)$ measurements to study the viability of the $\omega_0 \omega_a$CDM cosmological model to explain the clustered Universe. Our analyses compare the $\omega_0 \omega_a$CDM model with the $\sigma_8(z)$ function reconstructed from the data points using Gaussian Process. Moreover, we perform a similar evaluation of the $\Lambda$CDM model considering Planck and~DESI best-fit parameters. In addition, we implemented robustness tests regarding Gaussian Process reconstruction to support our results.</description>

      <title>Probing Generalized Emergent Dark Energy with DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an update on the initial findings of DESI, the new results provide the first hint of potential deviations from a cosmological constant ($w=-1$), which, if confirmed with significance $&gt;5\sigma$, will falsify the $\Lambda$CDM model. We consider a novel generalised form of an emergent dark energy model and confront this through various data sets (Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release (DESI DR2), Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) compilation, and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors) and simultaneously constrain the dark energy (DE) equation of state and energy density $f_{DE}(z)$. The results for the joint posteriors of cosmological parameters and the reconstructed dark energy EoS $w(z)$ with the energy density $f_{DE}(z)$ for various combinations of data sets are discussed, which favors quintessence nature. Specifically, $w(0) = -0.820$ with DESI DR2 + CMB, $-0.845$ with DESI DR2 + CMB + PP$^+$, $-0.828$ with DESI DR2 + CMB + Union3, and $-0.804$ with DESI DR2 + CMB + DESY5. We adopted a novel method to probe shifts in the generalized emergent dark energy (GEDE) parameter ($\Delta$) by mapping 2D marginalized posterior distributions in the $\Delta-\Omega_{m0}$ plane. Our analysis consistently reveals a preference for negative $\Delta$ across multiple combinations of observational datasets. Incorporating these values into the matter power spectrum further supports the GEDE framework's viability. We quantify the model's performance using the Bayes factor.</description>

      <title>New Agegraphic Dark Energy Driven Reconstruction of \boldmath{$f(Q)$} Gravity and its Cosmological Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform reconstruction of \( f(Q) \) gravity inspired by the New Agegraphic Dark Energy (NADE) model, aiming to account for the Universe's late time acceleration without invoking a cosmological constant. Utilizing a power law scale factor \( a(t) = a_0 t^h \), we derive an analytic form for \( f(Q) \) based on a correspondence with NADE, where the conformal time serves as the infrared cutoff. The resulting model naturally recovers General Relativity in the limit and exhibits a geometrically motivated dark energy component. We constrain the model parameters using recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from DESI DR2 BAO and previous BAO observations through the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. The reconstructed Hubble parameter \( H(z) \) demonstrates excellent agreement with observational data, achieving high \( R^2 \) values and low \(\chi^2_{\min}\), AIC, and BIC scores, outperforming the standard \( \Lambda \)CDM model. Further, we investigate the cosmological evolution using the deceleration parameter \( q(z) \), effective equation of state \( \omega_{\mathrm{eff}}(z) \), and Om diagnostics. The model exhibits a clear transition from deceleration to acceleration with a present value \( q(0) \in \left[-0.5879, -0.3333\right] \) and transition redshift $z_{\mathrm{tr}} \sim 0.5209-0.8126$, while maintaining \( -1 &lt; \omega_{\mathrm{eff}}(z) &lt; -1/3 \), indicating quintessence like behavior. Om diagnostics consistently show a negative slope, further confirming deviation from \( \Lambda \)CDM. Energy condition analysis reveals that WEC, DEC, and NEC are satisfied, while SEC is violated only at low redshifts which is consistent with cosmic acceleration. Overall, the reconstructed \( f(Q) \) model provides a viable, observationally consistent, and theoretically motivated alternative to standard dark energy scenarios.</description>

      <title>The formation and evolution of Supermassive disks in IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive disks are outstanding galaxies whose formation and evolution are still poorly understood. They comprise a large variety of objects, ranging from large, low-surface-brightness galaxies, such as Malin 1, to the most spectacular superluminous spirals. However, we still do not know the physical mechanisms behind its formation, and whether they will be long-lived objects or whether their mass could destroy them in time. We aim to investigate the formation and evolution of these galaxies using the magnetohydrodynamical state-of-the-art simulation IllustrisTNG-100. We defined supermassive disks as galaxies with $\lambda / \sqrt{\varepsilon} \geq 0.31$ or 0.71, and with stellar mass log$_{10}M_\star/M_\odot &gt; 10^{11}$. We studied the color, merging history, AGN history, and environment in which these galaxies reside. Supermassive disk galaxies typically experience a quiescent merging history, with $48\%$ experiencing no significant mergers at $z \leq 1$. Their stellar mass growth is driven mainly by star formation, unlike spheroidal galaxies, which require a significant number of mergers to form. Moreover, the mergers experienced by disk galaxies are generally rich in gas content, irrespective of whether they are minor or major events. Supermassive disks exist across various environments, from isolation to clusters, with $\sim 60\%$ inhabiting in isolation or low-mass groups, $\sim 25\%$ residing in massive groups, and $\sim15\%$ residing within galaxy clusters. When studying the evolution of supermassive disks selected at $z=0.5$, we show that when they gain sufficient mass, the probability of them maintaining their disk-like structure up to $z=0$ is relatively high ($\sim 60\%$). Lastly, while AGN significantly influences the regulation of star formation in galaxies, it does not directly alter their morphological structure.</description>

      <title>Power-Law Bounces in $f(R)$ Gravity: Analysis of the Ekpyrosis and Accelerating Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetime within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity using a compact, model-independent dynamical systems approach. By assuming a power-law scale factor, we explore ekpyrotic and accelerating solutions to address the big bang singularity. Our analysis demonstrates that a cosmological bounce, characterized by a transition from contraction to expansion, possibly avoids the singularity without directly using the Raychaudhuri equation, unlike previous approaches using specific $f(R) \simeq R^n$ forms. We identify a key fixed point in the phase space corresponding to the bounce, supported by perturbation analysis and qualitative description of trajectories in the phase space. The results suggest that $f(R)$ gravity provides a robust framework for non-singular cosmologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of thin shell wormholes and black holes to linearized spherically symmetric perturbations about a static equilibrium is analyzed. Thin shell formalism is explored and junctions formed from combinations of Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild - de Sitter, and Schwarzschild - anti-de Sitter, as well as Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetimes are considered. The regions of stability for these different combinations are thoroughly described and plotted as a function of mass ratios of the Schwarzschild masses and radii of the wormhole throats. A taxonomy of the qualitative features of the various configurations and parameter spaces is developed, illustrating the stability regions when present. The considered wormholes are all found to be unstable in the causal region.</description>

      <title>Earth-Scattering Induced Modulation in Low-Threshold Dark Matter Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter particles with sufficiently large interactions with ordinary matter can scatter in the Earth before reaching and scattering in a detector. This induces a modulation in the signal rate with a period of one sidereal day. We calculate this modulation for sub-GeV dark matter particles that interact either with a heavy or an ultralight dark-photon mediator and investigate the resulting signal in low-threshold detectors consisting of silicon, xenon, or argon targets. The scattering in the Earth is dominated by dark matter scatters off nuclei, while the signal in the detector is easiest to observe from dark matter scattering off electrons. We investigate the properties of the modulation signal and provide projections of the sensitivity of future experiments. We find that a search for a modulation signal can probe new regions of parameter space near the energy thresholds of current experiments, where the data are typically dominated by backgrounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present uniform rate inflation in a modified $f(T, \mathcal{T}) $ gravity. It is found that early inflation can be realized even with a scalar field field with a quadratic potential and a negative cosmological constant. We construct inflationary model for the inflaton field without slow-roll approximation. The inflaton field rolling at a constant speed permits a universe with sufficient inflation which encompasses the present universe fairly well. The initial value of the scalar satisfies a lower limit which is sufficiently large compared to the field required for chaotic inflation. The Planck prediction for cosmological perturbations are estimated. It is found that the cosmological model is stable.</description>

      <title>Head-on collisions of fuzzy/cold dark matter subhalos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform head-on collision simulations of compact dark matter subhalos using distinct numerical methods for fuzzy dark matter (FDM) and cold dark matter (CDM) models. For FDM, we solve the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equations with a pseudospectral solver, while for CDM, we utilize a smoothed particle hydrodynamics N-body code. Our results show that velocity decrease of subhalos is significantly greater in FDM model than in CDM, particularly at lower initial velocities, attributed to gravitational cooling-a unique mechanism of stabilizing in FDM with dissipating kinetic energy. This stark contrast in energy dissipation between two DM models suggests that FDM may offer valuable insights into understanding the dynamic behaviors of DM during galaxy cluster collisions, such as those observed in the Bullet cluster and Abell 520. These findings strongly suggest that FDM is not only capable of explaining these complex astrophysical phenomena but also serves as a compelling alternative to the traditional CDM model, offering resolutions to longstanding discrepancies in DM behavior.</description>

      <title>Microlensing of dark matter models in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter (DM) candidates using five years of microlensing data from the OGLE survey. While the majority of OGLE's $\sim 2000$ microlensing events are well-explained by stellar populations such as brown dwarfs, main-sequence stars, and compact remnants, a subset of six ultrashort-timescale events ($t_E \sim 0.1 - 0.3$ days) may signal the presence of PBHs. Building upon prior work that adopted the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) DM profile, we examine how alternative DM halo models -- specifically the Einasto and Burkert profiles -- affect microlensing predictions and the constraints on PBH abundance. We computed differential microlensing event rates for both profiles, using the main-sequence star rate as an observational benchmark. Our results show that neither the Einasto nor Burkert profiles reproduce the distribution of main-sequence star events, yet both allow for viable explanations of the ultrashort-timescale events with PBH masses $M_{\mathrm{PBH}} \sim 10^{-5} M_\odot$. Using a Poisson likelihood analysis under the null hypothesis that no PBH is observed in OGLE dataset, we derive 95\% C.L. upper bounds on $f_{\mathrm{PBH}}$, finding that the constraints are significantly relaxed under the Einasto and Burkert profiles compared to the NFW case. These results underscore the sensitivity of PBH constraints to the assumed DM halo structure and highlight the importance of accurately modeling the inner Galactic density profile to robustly assess PBH dark matter scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Based on considerations of quantum gravity, global symmetries which lead to axions as pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons after low scale symmetry breaking cannot be exact at the Planck scale. Here, we show that Planck-suppressed terms which yield this symmetry breaking may provide a non-inflationary misalignment mechanism which can generate coherent oscillations of the axion and axion-like particle (ALP) fields at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Perturbative unitarity bounds on field-space curvature in de Sitter spacetime: purity vs scattering amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study perturbative unitarity bounds on the field-space curvature in de Sitter spacetime, using the momentum-space entanglement approach recently proposed by Pueyo, Goodhew, McCulloch, and Pajer. As an illustration, we perform a perturbative computation of the purity in two-scalar models and compare the resulting unitarity bounds with those obtained via a flat space approximation. In particular, we find that perturbative unitarity imposes an upper bound on the field-space curvature of the Hubble scale order, in addition to a bound analogous to the flat space result. This reflects the thermal nature of de Sitter spacetime. We also discuss generalizations to higher-dimensional field spaces.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signatures of Periodic Motion near Higher-Derivative Einstein-\AE ther Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-derivative modifications of general relativity are generically expected from effective field theory approaches to quantum gravity, and they arise naturally in Lorentz-violating theories such as Einstein-Ether gravity. In this work, we investigate black hole spacetimes within Einstein-Ether theory supplemented by quadratic curvature corrections, including terms proportional to $R^2$, $R_{\mu\nu} R^{\mu\nu}$, and $R_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho} R^{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}$. We derive the corrected static, spherically symmetric metric perturbatively and examine its effects on the geodesic structure and gravitational wave emission. In particular, we analyze periodic timelike orbits in this background and compute the associated tensor-mode gravitational waveforms using the quadrupole approximation. Our results demonstrate that even small higher-derivative corrections can induce distinguishable shifts in the orbital dynamics and imprint characteristic phase modulations and harmonic deformations in the gravitational wave signal. These effects modify the frequency spectrum and amplitude envelope of $h_{+}$ and $h_{\times}$ in a manner sensitive to the coupling constants $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$, and the Ether parameter $c_{13}$. The resulting signatures provide a potential observational window into ultraviolet deviations from general relativity and Lorentz symmetry in the strong-field regime.</description>

Abstract: We propose an alternative scalar-tensor theory based on the Khronon scalar field labeling a family of space-like three-dimensional hypersurfaces. This theory leads to modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) at galactic scales for stationary systems, recovers GR plus a cosmological constant in the strong field regime, and is in agreement with the standard cosmological model and the observed cosmic microwave background anisotropies.</description>

      <title>New Constraints on Neutrino-Dark Matter Interactions: A Comprehensive Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the interactions of neutrinos with the dark sector within the simplified model framework. We first derive the exact analytic formulas for the differential scattering cross sections of neutrinos with scalar, fermion, and vector dark matter (DM) for light dark sector models with mediators of different types. We then implement the full catalog of constraints on the parameter space of the neutrino-DM and neutrino-mediator couplings and masses, including cosmological and astrophysical bounds coming from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, Cosmic Microwave Background, DM and neutrino self-interactions, DM collisional damping, and astrophysical neutrino sources, as well as laboratory constraints from 3-body meson decays and invisible $Z$ decays. We find that most of the benchmarks in the DM mass-coupling plane adopted in previous studies to get an observable neutrino-DM interaction effect are actually ruled out by a combination of the above-mentioned constraints, especially the laboratory ones which are robust against astrophysical uncertainties and independent of the cosmological history. To illustrate the consequences of our new results, we take the galactic supernova neutrinos in the MeV energy range as a concrete example and highlight the difficulties in finding any observable effect of neutrino-DM interactions. Finally, we identify new benchmark points potentially promising for future observational prospects of the attenuation of the galactic supernova neutrino flux and comment on their implications for the detection prospects in future large-volume neutrino experiments such as JUNO, Hyper-K, and DUNE. We also comment on the ultraviolet-embedding of the effective neutrino-DM couplings.</description>

      <title>Distinguish dark matter theories with the cosmic web and next-generation surveys I: an alternative theory of gravity</title>

Abstract: In the context of future large surveys like the Euclid mission, extracting the cosmic web from galaxies at higher redshifts with more statistical power will become feasible, particularly within the group-cluster mass regime. Therefore, it is imperative to enlarge the number of metrics that can used to constrain our cosmological models at these large scales. The number of cosmic filaments surrounding galaxies, groups and clusters, namely the connectivity, has recently emerged as a compelling probe of the large-scale structures, and has been investigated in various observational and numerical analyses. In this first paper, we examine dark matter-only cosmological simulations using the widely used DisPerSE filament finder code under two theories of gravity: the Poisson ($\Lambda$CDM) and the Monge-Amp\`ere models, in order to quantify how alternative models of gravity alter the properties of the cosmic skeleton. We specifically focused on this alternative gravity theory due to its propensity to enhance the formation of anisotropic structures such as filaments, but it also makes them more resistant to collapse, which consequently reduces the formation of halos. Indeed, our findings reveal that replacing the Poisson equation has a significant impact on the hierarchical formation scenario. This is evidenced by examining the redshift evolution of both the slope and the offset of the connectivity. Additionally, we demonstrated that current observations are generally in better agreement with our well-established gravity model. Finally, our study suggests that filament connectivity in the group-cluster regime could serve as a probe of our gravity model at cosmological scales. We also emphasize that our approach could be extended to alternative theories of dark matter, such as warm or fuzzy dark matter, given the extraordinary datasets provided by next-generation surveys.</description>

      <title>Limits on Early Matter Domination from the Isotropic Gamma-Ray Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cosmologies with hidden sector dark matter, the lightest hidden sector species can come to dominate the energy budget of the universe and cause an early matter-dominated era (EMDE). EMDEs amplify the matter power spectrum on small scales, leading to dense, early-forming microhalos which massively boost the dark matter annihilation signal. We use the Fermi-LAT measurement of the isotropic gamma-ray background to place limits on the parameter space of hidden sector models with EMDEs. We calculate the amplified annihilation signal by sampling the properties of prompt cusps, which reside at the centers of these microhalos and dominate the signal on account of their steep $\rho\propto r^{-3/2}$ density profiles. We also include the portions of the parameter space affected by the gravitational heating that arises from the formation and subsequent destruction of nonlinear structure during the EMDE. We are able to rule out significant portions of the parameter space, particularly at high reheat temperatures. Long EMDEs remain poorly constrained despite large structure-induced boosts to the annihilation signal.</description>

Abstract: We explore the potential for improving constraints on gravity by leveraging correlations in the dispersion measure derived from Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) in combination with cosmic shear. Specifically, we focus on Horndeski gravity, inferring the kinetic braiding and Planck mass run rate from a stage-4 cosmic shear mock survey alongside a survey comprising $10^4$ FRBs. For the inference pipeline, we utilise the Boltzmann code hi_class to predict the linear matter power spectrum in modified gravity scenarios, while non-linear corrections are obtained from the halo-model employed in HMcode, including feedback mechanisms. Our findings indicate that FRBs can disentangle degeneracies between baryonic feedback and cosmological parameters, as well as the mass of massive neutrinos. Since these parameters are also degenerate with modified gravity parameters, the inclusion of FRBs can enhance constraints on Horndeski parameters by up to $40$ percent, despite being a less significant measurement. Additionally, we apply our model to current FRB data and use the uncertainty in the $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation to impose limits on gravity. However, due to the limited sample size of current data, constraints are predominantly influenced by theoretical priors. Despite this, our study demonstrates that FRBs will significantly augment the limited set of cosmological probes available, playing a critical role in providing alternative tests of feedback, cosmology, and gravity. All codes used in this work are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>On the universality of the halo mass function beyond ${\Lambda}$CDM cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical frameworks based on Press-Schechter formalism and excursion set arguments suggest that the abundance of dark matter haloes exhibits universal behaviour when expressed in terms of peak height. If true, this implies that a single high-accuracy cosmological simulation could serve as a basis for constructing an emulator applicable to any other cosmology of interest. This tantalising possibility has inspired numerous studies over the years. However, in practice, different ways of defining haloes have led to mixed results concerning this issue. In this work, we utilise a suite of high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulations, to revisit this question for friends-of-friends haloes under the flat, time-evolving $w$CDM model, with simple modifications of the primordial physics via variations in the scalar spectral index and its running. We construct a reference locus of $\nu f(\nu)$ from our fiducial ${\Lambda}$CDM simulation and compare it against measurements from alternative models. We find that deviations from the locus remain within $5 \%$ when varying each of the parameters within the ranges: ${w_0} = -1.0 \pm 0.1$, $w_a = 0\pm0.2$, $\Omega_{\rm DE} = 0.693\pm0.050$, $\omega_{\rm c} = 0.119\pm0.006$, $\omega_{\rm b} =0.0222\pm0.0011$, $A_{\rm s} = (2.15\pm0.22) \times {10^{-9}}$, $n_{\rm s} =0.961\pm0.048$, $\alpha_{\rm s}\ = 0\pm0.01$, for redshift $z &lt; 7$.</description>

      <title>Fast Generation of Weak Lensing Maps in Modified Gravity with COLA</title>

Abstract: Accurate predictions of weak lensing observables are essential for understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe and probing the nature of gravity. In this work, we present a lightcone implementation to generate maps of the weak lensing convergence field using the COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) method. The lightcone is constructed in spherical shells from the source to the observer following an onion representation of the Universe. We validate the COLA-generated convergence maps in General Relativity by comparing five statistics to those of maps obtained with publically available high-resolution $N$-body simulations: the power spectrum, bispectrum, probability distribution function, peak counts and Minkowski functionals. The convergence power spectrum is accurate to within $5\%$ up to $\ell\sim500$ and to within $10\%$ up to $\ell\sim750$, confirming the accuracy of this method on both linear and non-linear scales. For the probability distribution function, peak counts and Minkowski functionals, we determine the map pixel resolution required for COLA to capture the statistical features of the $N$-body convergence maps. Our validation tests provide a baseline for the convergence map specifications at which we can trust COLA for each statistic considered. Using these map specifications, we extend our analyses to two representative theories of Modified Gravity, and demonstrate their imprints on the five convergence statistics considered. This work represents a step towards precise weak lensing predictions under both General Relativity and Modified Gravity with reduced computational cost, providing a robust framework to explore the nature of gravity using field-level inference.</description>

      <title>Analytic Model for Covariance Matrices of the 2-, 3-, and 4-Point Correlation Functions in the Gaussian Random Field Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyses of the galaxy N-Point Correlation Functions (NPCFs) have a large number of degrees of freedom, meaning one cannot directly estimate an invertible covariance matrix purely from mock catalogs, as has been the standard approach for the 2PCF and power spectrum. Instead, templates are used based on assuming a Gaussian Random Field density with the true, Boltzmann-solver-computed power spectrum. The resulting covariance matrices are sparse but have notable internal structure. To understand this structure better, we seek a fully analytic, closed-form covariance matrix template, using a power law power spectrum $P(k) \propto 1/k$ and including shot noise. We obtain a simple closed-form solution for the covariance of the 2PCF, as well as closed-form solutions for the fundamental building blocks (termed ``$f$-integrals'') of the covariance matrices for the 3PCF, 4PCF, and beyond. We achieve single-digit percent level accuracy for the $f$-integrals, confirming that our power spectrum model is a suitable alternative to the true power spectrum. In the $f$-integrals, we find that the greatest contributions arise when closed triangles may be formed. When $f$-integrals are multiplied together, as needed for the covariance, the number of non-vanishing configurations reduces. We use these results to present a clearer picture of the covariance matrices' structure and sparsity, which correspond to triangular and non-triangular regions. This will be useful in guiding future NPCF analyses with spectroscopic galaxy surveys such as DESI, Euclid, Roman, and SPHEREx.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09682v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The latest results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Collaboration have moved the preferred perturbation spectral index $n_{\rm s}$ towards one. We reanalyse constraints on the simplest version of the curvaton model, using $n_{\rm s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We show that in the massless curvaton case the model gives the same locus of $n_{\rm s}$-$r$ predictions as the power-law model $V(\phi) \propto \phi^p$, but with a different and more elegant physical interpretation. The model gives an excellent account of current observational data, both in the regime where the curvaton dominates the observed perturbations and with an admixture of inflaton-originated perturbations of up to about one-third of the total. Addition of the newest South Pole Telescope SPT-3G D1 dataset maintains this conclusion in favor of the curvaton model. Forthcoming large-scale structure surveys, such as that of the recently-launched SPHEREx probe, could discriminate between curvaton and single-field inflation models using the bispectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the power spectrum of cosmological perturbations originated from quantum vacuum fluctuations in bouncing scenarios proposed in Ref.~\cite{chamseddine2014cosmology} in the framework of mimetic cosmology. We show that all physically relevant models produce scale invariant spectral indices, and amplitudes compatible with observations provided that the bounce occurs at length scales $t_0$ inside the physically reasonable interval $10^5 l_p &lt; t_0 &lt; 10^9 l_p$. We also show that by slightly modifying the scalar field potential proposed in Ref.~\cite{chamseddine2014cosmology}, we can also obtain the observed red-tilted spectral index, with the same amplitude constraints. Hence, mimetic cosmology provides reasonable bouncing cosmological models without the need of any background quantum effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use late Universe probes - Type Ia Supernovae from the PantheonPlus compilation, Quasars, and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 (DR1) BAO data - along with Cosmic Chronometers or Megamasers to constrain various dark energy parameterizations. These include the standard $\Lambda$CDM model ($w_0=-1,w_a=0$), as well as the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Exponential (EXP), and Transitional Dark Energy (TDE) parameterizations. We find that across all parameterizations, the constrained values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ remain within $(1-2)\sigma$ of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, irrespective of spatial curvature, dataset combinations, or prior choices. We find from Bayesian model comparison that $\Lambda$CDM remains the most favored model for both flat and non-flat cases, with results remaining robust under different priors. Across all dataset combinations, we reaffirm the fact that LRG1 and LRG2 data points from the DESI BAO dataset are responsible for driving the preference for dynamical dark energy.</description>

Abstract: A self-interacting dark-matter (SIDM) density spike around merging supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may be able to supply the dynamical friction needed to shrink binaries from $\sim 1\, \mathrm{pc}$ to $\sim 10^{-2} \,\mathrm{pc}$, thereby resolving the long-standing "final-parsec problem". Embedding the binary-halo system in a cosmological population model, we evolve the inspiral under the combined influence of gravitational-wave (GW) emission and SIDM drag, compute the resulting nanohertz GW background, and confront it with the NANOGrav 15 year pulsar-timing data. A six-parameter Bayesian analysis, performed with a Gaussian-process-accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo, yields posterior constraints on the cross-section per unit mass and maximum circular velocity values that were consistent with independent galaxy-rotation and cluster-lensing limits. Within this parameter space, the SIDM spike remains intact, supplies sufficient friction to overcome the stellar depletion barrier, and produces a characteristic-strain spectrum that matches the NANOGrav signal as well as phenomenological astrophysical models.</description>

      <title>Dynamical analysis of logarithmic energy-momentum squared gravity</title>

Abstract: We perform the dynamical system analysis of a cosmological model in the energy-momentum squared gravity (EMSG) of the form $f(T_{\mu\nu} T^{\mu\nu})=\alpha\ln({\lambda}T_{\mu\nu} T^{\mu\nu})$, which is known as energy-momentum log gravity (EMLG). In particular, we show that the analytical cosmological solution of EMLG presented by Akarsu {\it et al.} (Eur. Phys. J. C 79:846, 2019) is a future attractor. It includes new terms in the right-hand side of the Einstein field equations, which yield constant inertial mass density and provide a dynamical dark energy with a density passing below zero at large redshifts, accommodating a mechanism for screening $\Lambda$ in the past for $\alpha&lt;0$, suggested for alleviating some cosmological tensions. We show that the second law of thermodynamics requires $\alpha\leq0$ that allows the screening mechanism to take place. We also show that the model gives rise to an entire class of new stable late-time solutions with $H\rightarrow\sqrt{(\Lambda+2\alpha)/3}$ as $a\rightarrow\infty$, where the new term is due to the constant effective inertial mass density that arises from EMLG contribution of dust, whereas $H\rightarrow\sqrt{\Lambda/3}$ as $a\rightarrow\infty$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also show the existence of new interesting features and trajectories that are absent in $\Lambda$CDM with or without spatial curvature.</description>

      <title>Cosmological scaling of precursor domain walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain wall (DW) networks have a large impact on cosmology and present interesting dynamics that can be controlled by various scaling regimes. In the first stage after spontaneous breaking of the discrete symmetry, the network is seeded with `DW precursors', the zeros of a tachyonic field. At sufficiently weak coupling, this stage can be quite long. The network is then driven to a non-relativistic scaling regime: in flat spacetime the correlation length grows like $L\sim t^{\kappa}$ with $\kappa=1/2$. We focus on the precursor regime in cosmology, assuming a power-law scale factor $a\propto t^\alpha$. We obtain the scaling exponent as a function of the external parameter, $\kappa(\alpha)$, by explicit computation in $1+1$ and $2+1$ dimensions, and find a smooth transition from nonrelativistic scaling with $\kappa\simeq 1/2$ for $\alpha\lesssim1/2$ to DW gas regime $\kappa \simeq \alpha$ for $\alpha\gtrsim1/2$, confirming previous arguments. The precise form of the transition $\kappa(\alpha)$ is surprisingly independent of dimension, suggesting that similar results should also be valid in $3+1$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Role of internal space correlations in the dynamics of a higher-dimensional Bianchi type-I universe: shear scalar and Hubble parameter perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate exact solutions of the Einstein field equations in higher-dimensional, spatially homogeneous Bianchi type-I spacetimes, introducing a real parameter $\lambda$ that correlates the expansion rates of external and internal spaces. Extending beyond Robertson--Walker spacetime, our approach includes positive and negative correlations, suggesting a broader and isotropic/anisotropic cosmological model space. Positively correlated dimensions manifest as a cosmological constant at late times, while at early times, they mimic stiff-fluid-like dark energy that dilutes faster than radiation, paralleling early dark energy models. This suggests a pathway for alleviating the Hubble tension by tailoring higher-dimensional dynamics to reduce the sound horizon. When anisotropic expansion is allowed, these models achieve isotropization more efficiently than predicted by Wald's cosmic no-hair theorem. Negative correlations, in contrast, yield a higher-dimensional steady-state universe where the shear scalar remains constant, effectively emulating a negative cosmological constant. These distinct behaviors arise from a simple signature change: positive correlation accelerates shear scalar decay, while negative correlation stabilizes it. We demonstrate that the solutions admit analytic continuation from the Lorentzian to Euclidean regime ($t \to -i\tau$), revealing a wormhole-like topology that connects two asymptotic regions via a throat, with $\lambda \to -\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Central Cluster Galaxies: A Hotspot for Detectable Gravitational Waves from Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) have announced the evidence for a low-frequency gravitational wave background (GWB), the continuous waves (CWs) are the next anticipated gravitational wave (GW) signals. In this work, we model CW sources detectable by PTAs based on the massive black hole (MBH) merger population in the ASTRID cosmological simulation. We evolve MBH binaries, simulate their GW emissions, and calculate their detection probability (DP) for PTAs. The most detectable CW sources are produced by MBH mergers with masses M_BH &gt; 10^10 solarmass in the lowest frequency bins with f&lt;10 nHz. Remarkably, these mergers occur within massive galaxies with the stellar mass larger than 10^12 solarmass located at the center of galaxy clusters. Particularly striking in ASTRID is a triple merger event, wherein two consecutive mergers occur within 500 Myr interval in the same cluster core, generating high-DP CW signals at ~ 2nHz and ~ 10nHz. We also investigate the electromagnetic (EM) signatures associated with these events: either single or dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the massive host galaxies that are undergoing star formation. This research provides new insights into the low-frequency GW sky and informs future multi-messenger searches for PTA CW sources.</description>

      <title>Filtered cogenesis of PBH dark matter and baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel cogenesis of baryon and dark matter (DM) in the Universe by utilising a first-order phase transition (FOPT) in the dark sector containing an asymmetric Dirac fermion $\chi$. Due to the mass difference of $\chi$ across the bubble walls, it is energetically favourable for $\chi$ to get trapped in the false vacuum leading to the formation of Fermi-ball, which can self-collapse to form primordial black hole (PBH) if $\chi$ has a sufficiently large Yukawa interaction. While such PBH formed out of false vacuum collapse can give rise to the DM in the Universe, a tiny amount of asymmetric $\chi$ leaking into the true vacuum through the bubble walls can transfer the dark asymmetry into the visible sector via decay. The same mass difference of $\chi$ across the two minima which decides the amount of trapping or filtering of $\chi$, also allows $\chi$ decay into visible sector in the true minima while keeping it stable in the false vacuum. Our filtered cogenesis scenario can be probed via FOPT generated stochastic gravitational waves (GW) at near future detectors in addition to the well-known detection aspects of asteroid mass PBH constituting DM in the Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the classical and quantum dynamics of $f(R)$ gravity's rainbow in the presence of a perfect fluid, employing Schutz's formalism to establish a well-defined notion of time. In the classical regime, we derive and solve the equations of motion, obtaining both analytical and numerical solutions. Through canonical quantisation, we formulate the Schr\"{o}dinger-Wheeler-DeWitt (SWD) equation for the quantum model. By solving its eigenfunctions, we construct the wave function of the Universe and obtain analytical solutions in scenarios dominated by stiff matter. Our results highlight the impact of rainbow gravity on quantum evolution, particularly in modifying the structure of the wave function and shaping the transition from the quantum to the classical regime.</description>

      <title>Gas outflows in two recently quenched galaxies at z = 4 and 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Outflows are a key element in the baryon cycle of galaxies, and their properties provide a fundamental test for our models of how star formation quenches in galaxies. Here we report the detection of outflowing gas in two recently quenched, massive ($M_\star\sim10^{10.2}M_\odot$) galaxies at z=4.106 (NS_274) and z=7.276 (RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7) observed with JWST/NIRSpec. The outflows are traced by blue-shifted MgII absorption lines, and in the case of the z=4.1 system, also by FeII and NaI features. The spectra of the two sources are similar to those of local post-starburst galaxies, showing deep Balmer features and minimal star formation on 10 Myr timescales as traced by the lack of bright emission lines, also suggesting the absence of a strong and radiatively efficient AGN. The galaxies' SFHs are consistent with an abrupt quenching of star formation, which continued at rates of $\sim15\,M_\odot$/yr averaged over 100 Myr timescales. Dedicated millimeter observations of NS_274 constrain its dust obscured SFR to $&lt;12\,M_\odot$/yr. Under simple geometrical assumptions, we derive mass loading factors $\lesssim1$ and $&gt;10$ for the z=4.1 and z=7.3 systems, respectively, and similarly different energies carried by the outflows. Supernova feedback can account for the mass and energy of the outflow in NS_274. However, the low mass loading factor and average gas velocity suggest that the observed outflow is likely not the primary factor behind its quenching. SF-related processes seem to be insufficient to explain the extreme mass outflow rate of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7, which would require an additional ejective mechanism such as an undetected AGN. Finally, the average outflow velocities per unit $M_\star$, SFR, or its surface area are consistent with those of lower-redshift post-starburst galaxies, suggesting that outflows in rapidly quenched galaxies might occur similarly across cosmic time.

      <description>arXiv:2503.03808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $1+1$ flat spacetime dynamics of a classical field configuration corresponding to an ensemble of sine-Gordon kinks and antikinks, semi-classically coupled to a quantum field. This coupling breaks the integrability of the sine-Gordon model resulting in the background's decay into quantum radiation as kink-antikink pairs annihilate. We find evidence that, on average, the energy of the ensemble scales as $t^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha&lt;1$ and independent of the coupling strength or the mass of the quantum field. The generalization of this result to domain wall networks in higher spacetime dimensions could be relevant to particle production in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Fast detection and reconstruction of merging Massive Black Hole Binary signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect gravitational waves from the population of merging massive black holes binaries (MBHBs) throughout the Universe. The LISA data stream will feature many superposed signals from different astrophysical sources, requiring a global fit procedure. Most of the MBHB signals will be loud enough to be detected days or even weeks before the merger; and for those sources LISA will be able to predict the time of the merger well in advance of the coalescence, as well as an approximate position in the sky. In this paper, we present a fast detection and signal reconstruction scheme for massive black hole binaries in the LISA observation band. We propose: (i) a detection scheme for MBHB mergers allowing a first subtraction of these signals for the purpose of a global fit, and (ii) an efficient early detection scheme providing a time-of-merger estimate for a pre-merger signal, that will allow to trigger a protection period, placing LISA in ``do not disturb'' mode and enabling more detailed analysis that will facilitate multi-messenger observations. We highlight the effect of confusion of several overlapping in time MBHB signals in the pre-merger detection.</description>

      <title>On the Probability of the Initial Conditions for Inflation and Slow Contraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some recent studies based on numerical relativity simulations claim that slow contraction/ekpyrosis is strongly preferred over inflation as the smoothing mechanism that brought the universe into the homogeneous, isotropic and flat state we observe today on large scales. In this paper, we evaluate the likelihood of the initial conditions employed in the aforementioned simulations by estimating the probability that a free scalar field dominating the universe at the beginning of inflation or ekpyrosis will be sufficiently homogeneous on scales comparable to the Hubble radius at that time. We explore the space of parameters that characterize the initial power spectrum of the scalar field, finding that either can be more likely than the other for a fixed choice of parameters. On the other hand, when we extremize over these parameters, we find that the maximal probability for inflation is much higher than that of ekpyrosis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The influence of a possible low gravity scale, concretely through the presence of extra dimensions or additional species, on radiation properties of micro black holes is investigated. In particular, the suppression of evaporation through the so-called memory-burden effect is shown to be stronger, occurs earlier and with sharper transition compared to the canonical Planck-scale regime. It is furthermore shown how this affects the possibility of light primordial black hole dark matter, constraints on which may weaken substantially and allow them to be as light as $10^{-5}\,M_{\rm P}$, thereby lying in the particle regime.</description>

      <title>Detectability of dark matter density distribution via gravitational waves from binary black holes in the Galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fundamental nature of dark matter (DM) remains unknown, with significant uncertainties in its density profile. DM environments surrounding massive binary black holes (BBHs) modify their orbital dynamics, thereby altering gravitational wave (GW) emissions. For BBH systems at the Galactic Center, dynamical friction induced by DM spikes could produce detectable deviations in GW spectra, potentially observable by future space-based detectors. To address the uncertainties in the Galactic Center's DM profile, we systematically examine two scenarios: the generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (gNFW) profile and its post-spike modification. We investigate the evolutionary effects of DM dynamical friction and accretion on the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum of secondary black holes (BHs) in elliptical orbits. By constructing orbital models with varying initial eccentricities across the mass-semi-latus rectum parameter space and utilizing 30 years of simulated pulsar timing array data from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), we identify detectable parameter regimes of DM effects and employ these GW observational signatures to constrain different DM density profiles. Our analysis reveals that among gNFW profiles ($\gamma=2,1.5,1,0.5$), only $\gamma=2$ produces significant detectable signatures. The formation of DM spikes further enhances these observable waveform deviations for all gNFW slopes.</description>
