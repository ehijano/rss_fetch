      <title>A Stochastic Lattice Model for Convective Self-aggregation Incorporating Longwave Radiative Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-aggregation of tropical convection is a universal feature observed in a diverse range of atmospheric environments. Several preceding models conceptualized the self-aggregation of convection as a phase transition driven by collisions between cold pool gust fronts. However, self-aggregation may also be influenced by various physical processes, such as surface fluxes, radiation, and moisture perturbations in the planetary boundary layer, and it remains unclear which process plays a dominant role. In this study, we develop a simple stochastic lattice model for the pattern formation of deep convection, inspired by the two-dimensional Ising model. Here, in addition to the process of cold pool collisions, which have an effect of triggering new convection, we incorporate the process of clear-sky radiative cooling that has an effect of suppressing deep convection as an interaction between clouds. Our results show that by amplifying the intensity of the clear-sky radiative cooling effect, the transition from a quasi-uniform to an inhomogeneous cloud field can be reproduced. The model also successfully explains the dependence of self-aggregation on several model parameters, such as the experimental domain size and the characteristic size of cold pools. Furthermore, by varying the distance over which the subsidence induced by radiative cooling extends, we succeed in capturing a pattern formation that closely resembles the convective clusters observed in the real atmosphere and three-dimensional numerical model simulations.</description>

      <title>EnsAI: An Emulator for Atmospheric Chemical Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensemble-based methods for data assimilation and emission inversions are a popular way to encode flow-dependency within the model error covariance. While most ensemble methods do not require the use of an adjoint model, the need to repeatedly run a geophysical model to generate the ensemble can be a significant computational burden. In this paper, we introduce EnsAI, a new AI-based ensemble generation system for atmospheric chemical constituents. When trained on an existing ensemble for ammonia generated by the GEM-MACH air quality model, it was shown that the ensembles produced by EnsAI can accurately reproduce the meteorology-dependent features of the original ensemble, while generating the ensemble 3,300 times faster than the original GEM-MACH ensemble. While EnsAI requires an upfront cost for generating an ensemble used for training, as well as the training itself, the long term computational savings can greatly exceed these initial computational costs. When used in an emissions inversion system, EnsAI produced similar inversion results to those in which the original GEM-MACH ensemble was used while using significantly less computational resources.</description>

      <title>How to systematically develop an effective AI-based bias correction model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces ReSA-ConvLSTM, an artificial intelligence (AI) framework for systematic bias correction in numerical weather prediction (NWP). We propose three innovations by integrating dynamic climatological normalization, ConvLSTM with temporal causality constraints, and residual self-attention mechanisms. The model establishes a physics-aware nonlinear mapping between ECMWF forecasts and ERA5 reanalysis data. Using 41 years (1981-2021) of global atmospheric data, the framework reduces systematic biases in 2-m air temperature (T2m), 10-m winds (U10/V10), and sea-level pressure (SLP), achieving up to 20% RMSE reduction over 1-7 day forecasts compared to operational ECMWF outputs. The lightweight architecture (10.6M parameters) enables efficient generalization to multiple variables and downstream applications, reducing retraining time by 85% for cross-variable correction while improving ocean model skill through bias-corrected boundary conditions. The ablation experiments demonstrate that our innovations significantly improve the model's correction performance, suggesting that incorporating variable characteristics into the model helps enhance forecasting skills.</description>

      <title>Fourier analysis of the physics of transfer learning for data-driven subgrid-scale models of ocean turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning (TL) is a powerful tool for enhancing the performance of neural networks (NNs) in applications such as weather and climate prediction and turbulence modeling. TL enables models to generalize to out-of-distribution data with minimal training data from the new system. In this study, we employ a 9-layer convolutional NN to predict the subgrid forcing in a two-layer ocean quasi-geostrophic system and examine which metrics best describe its performance and generalizability to unseen dynamical regimes. Fourier analysis of the NN kernels reveals that they learn low-pass, Gabor, and high-pass filters, regardless of whether the training data are isotropic or anisotropic. By analyzing the activation spectra, we identify why NNs fail to generalize without TL and how TL can overcome these limitations: the learned weights and biases from one dataset underestimate the out-of-distribution sample spectra as they pass through the network, leading to an underestimation of output spectra. By re-training only one layer with data from the target system, this underestimation is corrected, enabling the NN to produce predictions that match the target spectra. These findings are broadly applicable to data-driven parameterization of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>A Mechanism-Learning Deeply Coupled Model for Remote Sensing Retrieval of Global Land Surface Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Land surface temperature (LST) retrieval from remote sensing data is pivotal for analyzing climate processes and surface energy budgets. However, LST retrieval is an ill-posed inverse problem, which becomes particularly severe when only a single band is available. In this paper, we propose a deeply coupled framework integrating mechanistic modeling and machine learning to enhance the accuracy and generalizability of single-channel LST retrieval. Training samples are generated using a physically-based radiative transfer model and a global collection of 5810 atmospheric profiles. A physics-informed machine learning framework is proposed to systematically incorporate the first principles from classical physical inversion models into the learning workflow, with optimization constrained by radiative transfer equations. Global validation demonstrated a 30% reduction in root-mean-square error versus standalone methods. Under extreme humidity, the mean absolute error decreased from 4.87 K to 2.29 K (53% improvement). Continental-scale tests across five continents confirmed the superior generalizability of this model.</description>
