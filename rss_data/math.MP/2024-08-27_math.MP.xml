      <title>The General Three-Body Problem in Conformal-Euclidean Space: Hidden Symmetries and New Properties of a Low-Dimensional Syste</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the huge number of research into the three-body problem in physics and mathematics, the study of this problem still remains relevant both from the point of view of its broad application and taking into account its fundamental significance for the theory of dynamical systems. In addition, to solve the problem of quantum-to-classical transition, it is important to answer the question: is irreversibility fundamental to the description of the classical world? To answer this question, we considered a reference classical dynamical system, the general three-body problem, formulating it in conformal Euclidean space and rigorously proving its equivalence to the Newtonian three-body problem. It is shown that a curved configuration space with a local coordinate system reveals new hidden symmetries of the internal motion of a dynamical system, which makes it possible to reduce the problem to a 6th order system instead of the known 8th order. The most important consequence of this consideration is that the chronologizing parameter of the motion of a system of particles, which we call internal time, is in the general case irreversible, which is characteristic of the general three-body problem. An equation is derived that describes the evolution of the flow of geodesic trajectories, with the help of which the entropy of the system is constructed. New criteria for assessing the complexity of a low-dimensional dynamic system and the dimension of stochastic fractal structures arising in three-dimensional space are obtained. An effective mathematical algorithm has been developed for the numerical simulation of the general three-body problem, which is traditionally a difficult-to-solve system of stiff ordinary differential equations.</description>

      <title>The free energy of dilute Bose gases at low temperatures interacting via strong potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a dilute Bose gas in the thermodynamic limit and prove a lower bound on the free energy for low temperatures which is in agreement with the conjecture of Lee-Huang-Yang on the excitation spectrum of the system. Combining techniques of \cite{FS2} and \cite{HHNST}, we give a simpler and shorter proof resolving the case of strong interactions, including the hard-core potential.</description>

      <title>A New Paradigm For Scattering Theory of Linear And Nonlinear Waves: Review And Open Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a review of the recent advancements in scattering theory, which provides a unified approach to studying dispersive and hyperbolic equations with general interaction terms and data. These equations encompass time-dependent potentials, as well as NLS, NLKG, and NLW equations. Additionally, I discuss a series of open problems, along with their significance and potential future applications in scattering and inverse scattering.</description>

      <title>Even More Generalized Hamiltonian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the procedure to derive from an action-based variational principle the classical equations of motion in Hamiltonian phase space of a particle subject to general position and velocity dependent non-holonomic equality constraints. Key to the procedure is our introduction of Flannery brackets, which generalize Poisson brackets. We conjecture on some implications, including the possibility of replacing Poisson brackets with Flannery brackets in Dirac's brackets to provide the quantization procedure for general non-holonomic equality constraint systems.</description>

      <title>Strict area law entanglement versus chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality is a property of a gapped phase of matter in two spatial dimensions that can be manifested through non-zero thermal or electrical Hall conductance. In this paper, we prove two no-go theorems that forbid such chirality for a quantum state in a finite dimensional local Hilbert space with strict area law entanglement entropies. As a crucial ingredient in the proofs, we introduce a new quantum information-theoretic primitive called instantaneous modular flow, which has many other potential applications.</description>

      <title>Teleparallel Geometry with Spherical Symmetry: The diagonal and proper frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the proper co-frame and its corresponding (diagonal) co-frame/spin connection pair for spherically symmetric geometries which can be used as an initial ansatz in any theory of teleparallel gravity. The Lorentz transformation facilitating the move from one co-frame to the other is also presented in factored form. The factored form also illustrates the nature of the two degrees of freedom found in the spin connection. The choice of coordinates in restricting the number of arbitrary functions is also presented. Beginning with a thorough presentation of teleparallel gravity using the metric affine gauge theory approach and concentrating on f(T) teleparallel gravity, we express the field equations in the diagonal co-frame. We argue that the choice of diagonal co-frame may be more advantageous over the proper co-frame choice. Finally, assuming one additional symmetry, we restrict ourselves to the Kantowski-Sachs tele-parallel geometries, and determine some solutions.</description>

      <title>On the Hamiltonian structure of the intrinsic evolution of a closed vortex sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of previous authors on vortex sheets and their applications, the inviscid evolution equations of a closed vortex sheet in a plane, separating two piecewise constant density fluids, and their Hamiltonian form are investigated. The model has potential applications to bubble dynamics. A Poisson bracket is obtained containing the curve-tangential derivative. A Lagrangian invariant of the sheet motion by its self-induced velocity--the Cauchy principal value of the Biot-Savart integral--is derived.</description>

      <title>The St\v{r}eda Formula for Floquet Systems: Topological Invariants and Quantized Anomalies from Ces\`aro Summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a general theoretical framework, which expresses the topological invariants of two-dimensional Floquet systems in terms of tractable response functions: Building on the Sambe representation of periodically-driven systems, and inspired by the St\v{r}eda formula for static systems, we evaluate the flow of the unbounded Floquet density of states in response to a magnetic perturbation. This Floquet-St\v{r}eda response, which is a priori mathematically ill-defined, is regularized by means of a Ces\`aro summation method. As a key outcome of this approach, we relate all relevant Floquet winding numbers to simple band properties of the Floquet-Bloch Hamiltonian. These general relations indicate how the topological characterization of Floquet systems can be entirely deduced from the stroboscopic time-evolution of the driven system. Importantly, we identify two physically distinguishable contributions to the Floquet-St\v{r}eda response: a quantized flow of charge between the edge and the bulk of the system, and an 'anomalous' quantized flow of energy between the system and the driving field, which provides new insight on the physical origin of the anomalous edge states. As byproducts, our theory provides: a general relation between Floquet winding numbers and the orbital magnetization of Floquet-Bloch bands; a local marker for Floquet winding numbers, which allows to access Floquet topology in inhomogeneous samples; an experimental protocol to extract these Floquet winding numbers from density-measurements in the presence of an engineered bath; as well as general expressions for these topological invariants in terms of the magnetic response of the Floquet density of states, opening a route for the topological characterization of interacting Floquet systems.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional wave kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although wave kinetic equations have been rigorously derived in dimension $d \geq 2$, both the physical and mathematical theory of wave turbulence in dimension $d = 1$ is less understood. Here, we look at the one-dimensional MMT (Majda, McLaughlin, and Tabak) model on a large interval of length $L$ with nonlinearity of size $\alpha$, restricting to the case where there are no derivatives in the nonlinearity. The dispersion relation here is $|k|^\sigma$ for $0 &lt; \sigma \leq 2$ and $\sigma \neq 1$, and when $\sigma = 2$, the MMT model specializes to the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation. In the range of $1 &lt; \sigma \leq 2$, the proposed collision kernel in the kinetic equation is trivial, begging the question of what is the appropriate kinetic theory in that setting. In this paper we study the kinetic limit $L \to \infty$ and $\alpha \to 0$ under various scaling laws $\alpha \sim L^{-\gamma}$ and exhibit the wave kinetic equation up to timescales $T \sim L^{-\epsilon}\alpha^{-\frac{5}{4}}$ (or $T \sim L^{-\epsilon} T_{\mathrm{kin}}^{\frac{5}{8}}$). In the case of a trivial collision kernel, our result implies there can be no nontrivial dynamics of the second moment up to timescales $T_{\mathrm{kin}}$.</description>

      <title>Approximation of the thermodynamic limit of finite-gap solutions of the focusing NLS hierarchy by multisoliton solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we approximate the thermodynamic limit of finite-gap solutions to any integrable equations in the focusing NLS hierarchy (fNLS, mKdV, ...) with an associated multisoliton solutions using the Riemann-Hilbert Problem approach. Moreover, we show that both the finite-gap and multisoliton solutions are approximated in the thermodynamic limit by a generalization of the primitive potentials introduced by V. Zakharov and his collaborators in the KdV context. Under certain assumptions on the spectral data for the finite gap potentials, we provide error estimates for the approximation on compact subsets of the $(x,t)$-plane.</description>

Abstract: We prove the free energy and ground state energy of spherical spin glasses are universal under the minimal moment assumptions. Previously such universality was known only for Ising spin glasses and random symmetric matrices, the latter being a celebrated result of Bai--Yin. Our methods extend to $\ell^q$ balls for $q&gt;2$, thus resolving a conjecture of Chen-Sen, and to tensor PCA.</description>

      <title>Criterion of singularity formation for radial solutions of the pressureless Euler-Poisson equations in exceptional dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial dimensions 1 and 4 play an exceptional role for radial solutions of the pressureless repulsive Euler-Poisson equations. Namely, for any spatial dimension except 1 and 4, any nontrivial solution of the Cauchy problem blows up in a finite time (except in special cases), whereas for dimensions 1 and 4 there exists a neighborhood of trivial initial data in the $C^1$ - norm such that the respective solution preserves the initial smoothness globally. For dimension 1, the criterion of the singularity formation in terms of initial data was known, i.e. this neighborhood can be found exactly.
  For the case of dimension 4, there was no similar result. In this paper, we close this gap and obtain such a criterion for the case of a more technically complicated case of dimension 4.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define twisted versions of the classical and quantum double ramification hierarchy construction based on intersection theory of the strata of meromorphic differentials in the moduli space of stable curves and $k$-twisted double ramification cycles for $k=1$, respectively, we prove their integrability and tau symmetry and study their connection. We apply the construction to the case of the trivial cohomological field theory to find it produces the KdV hierarchy, although its relation to the untwisted case is nontrivial. The key role of the KdV hierarchy in controlling the intersection theory of several natural tautological classes translates this relation into a series of remarkable identities between intersection numbers involving psi-classes, Hodge classes, Norbury's theta class and the strata of meromorphic differentials.</description>

Abstract: We propose a fully discrete analog of the massive Thirring model in light-cone coordinates by constructing its Lax-pair representation. This Lax-pair representation can also be used to define a new Yang-Baxter map, so we obtain a Yang-Baxter map that admits a continuous limit. We present most of the results for the general case where the dependent variables are matrix-valued.</description>

      <title>Numerical method for abstract Cauchy problem with nonlinear nonlocal condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Problem for the first order differential equation with an unbounded operator coefficient in Banach space and nonlinear nonlocal condition is considered. A numerical method is proposed and justified for the solution of this problem under assumptions that the mentioned operator coefficient $A$ is strongly positive and some existence and uniqueness conditions are fulfilled. The method is based on the reduction of the given problem to an abstract Hammerstein equation. The later one is discretized by collocation and then solved via the fixed-point iteration method. Each iteration of the method involves Sinc-based numerical evaluation of the operator exponential represented by a Dunford-Cauchy integral along hyperbola enveloping the spectrum of $A$.</description>

      <title>On Symmetries of Finite Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The isospectral set of the Dirac matrix D=d+d* consists of orthogonal Q for which Q* D Q is an equivalent Dirac matrix. It can serve as the symmetry of a finite geometry G. The symmetry is a subset of the orthogonal group or unitary group and isospectral Lax deformations produce commuting flows d/dt D=[B(g(D)),D] on this symmetry space. In this note, we remark that like in the Toda case, D_t=Q_t* D_0 Q_t with exp(-t g(D))=Q_t R_t solves the Lax system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of a multiplicative unimodularity for a coisotropic Poisson homogeneous space. Then, we discuss the unimodularity and the multiplicative unimodularity for these spaces and the existence of an invariant volume form for explicit Hamiltonian systems on such spaces. Several interesting examples illustrating the theoretical results are also presented.</description>

      <title>Radial 3D Focusing Energy Critical INLS equation with a sub-critical perturbation: Ground states, Blow-up, and scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a 3D nonlinear focusing Schr\"odinger equations with perturbed energy critical inhomogeneous non-linearity in the radial regime,
  $$
  i \partial_t u +\Delta u =|x|^{-a} |u|^{p-2} u - |x|^{-b} |u|^{4-2b}u \quad \mbox{in} \,\, \mathbb{R}_t \times \mathbb{R}_x^3, $$ where $0&lt;a$, $b&lt;2$ and $2+\frac{4-2a}{3}\leq p\leq 6-2a$. First, we prove the existence/nonexistence of ground states. Subsequently, we establish the scattering versus blowup below the ground-state energy threshold. Our methodology hinges on Tao's scattering criterion and Dodson-Murphy's Virial/Morawetz inequalities.
  An intriguing aspect of our study is the absence of scaling invariance within the equation, attributed to the interplay of competing nonlinearities. Moreover, the presence of singular weights serves as a barrier to translation invariance in the spatial variable, adding more complexity to the analysis.
  To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the inaugural exploration of the inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a leading-order focusing energy critical nonlinearity and a defocusing perturbation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent progress on the study of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in a periodic setting, which describes the random growth of an interface in a cylindrical geometry. The main results include central limit theorems for the height of the interface and the winding number of the directed polymer in a periodic random environment. We present two different approaches for each result, utilizing either a homogenization argument or tools from Malliavin calculus. A surprising finding in the case of a $1+1$ spacetime white noise is that the effective variances for both the height and the winding number can be expressed in terms of independent Brownian bridges.
  Additionally, we present two new results: (i) the explicit expression of the corrector used in the homogenization argument, and (ii) the law of the iterated logarithm for the height function.</description>

      <title>Bounds in partition functions of the continuous random field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the critical properties of continuous random field Ising model (RFIM). Using the distributional zeta-function method, we obtain a series representation for the quenched free energy. It is possible to show that for each moment of the partition function, the multiplet of $k$-fields the Gaussian contribution has one field with the contribution of the disorder and $(k-1)$-fields with the usual propagator. Although the non-gaussian contribution is non-perturbative we are able to show that the model is confined between two $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathcal{O}(k-1)$-symmetric models. Using arguments of lower critical dimension alongside with monotone operators, we show that the phase of the continuous RFIM can be restricted by an $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathcal{O}(k-1) \to \mathcal{O}(k-2)$ phase transition.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Quantum-Mechanical Evolutions from Probability Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of both time-optimal and time sub-optimal quantum Hamiltonian evolutions connecting arbitrary source and a target states on the Bloch sphere equipped with the Fubini-Study metric. This investigation is performed in a number of steps. First, we describe each unitary Schr\"odinger quantum evolution by means of the path length, the geodesic efficiency, the speed efficiency, and the curvature coefficient of its corresponding dynamical trajectory linking the source state to the target state. Second, starting from a classical probabilistic setting where the so-called information geometric complexity can be employed to describe the complexity of entropic motion on curved statistical manifolds underlying the physics of systems when only partial knowledge about them is available, we transition into a deterministic quantum setting. In this context, after proposing a definition of the complexity of a quantum evolution, we present a notion of quantum complexity length scale. In particular, we discuss the physical significance of both quantities in terms of the accessed (i.e., partial) and accessible (i.e., total) parametric volumes of the regions on the Bloch sphere that specify the quantum mechanical evolution from the source to the target states. Fourth, after calculating the complexity measure and the complexity length scale for each one of the two quantum evolutions, we compare the behavior of our measures with that of the path length, the geodesic efficiency, the speed efficiency, and the curvature coefficient. We find that, in general, efficient quantum evolutions are less complex than inefficient evolutions. However, we also observe that complexity is more than length. Indeed, longer paths that are sufficiently bent can exhibit a behavior that is less complex than that of shorter paths with a smaller curvature coefficient.</description>

      <title>Relaxation-based schemes for on-the-fly parameter estimation in dissipative dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article studies two particular algorithms, a Relaxation Least Squares (RLS) algorithm and a Relaxation Newton Iteration (RNI) scheme , for reconstructing unknown parameters in dissipative dynamical systems. Both algorithms are based on a continuous data assimilation (CDA) algorithm for state reconstruction of A. Azouani, E. Olson, and E.S. Titi \cite{Azouani_Olson_Titi_2014}. Due to the CDA origins of these parameter recovery algorithms, these schemes provide on-the-fly reconstruction, that is, as data is collected, of unknown state and parameters simultaneously. It is shown how both algorithms give way to a robust general framework for simultaneous state and parameter estimation. In particular, we develop a general theory, applicable to a large class of dissipative dynamical systems, which identifies structural and algorithmic conditions under which the proposed algorithms achieve reconstruction of the true parameters. The algorithms are implemented on a high-dimensional two-layer Lorenz 96 model, where the theoretical conditions of the general framework are explicitly verifiable. They are also implemented on the two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection system to demonstrate the applicability of the algorithms beyond the finite-dimensional setting. In each case, systematic numerical experiments are carried out probing the efficacy of the proposed algorithms, in addition to the apparent benefits and drawbacks between them.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic Hopf Algebra of Feynman Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The method of regions is an approach for developing asymptotic expansions of Feynman Integrals. We focus on expansions in Euclidean signature, where the method of regions can also be formulated as an expansion by subgraph. We show that for such expansions valid around small/large masses and momenta the graph combinatorial operations can be formulated in terms of what we call the asymptotic Hopf algebra. This Hopf algebra is closely related to the motic Hopf algebra underlying the $R^*$ operation, an extension of Bogoliubov's $R$ operation, to subtract both IR and UV divergences of Feynman integrals in the Euclidean. We focus mostly on the leading power, for which the Hopf algebra formulation is simpler. We uncover a close connection between Bogoliubov's $R$ operation in the Connes-Kreimer formulation and the remainder $\mathcal{R}$ of the series expansion, whose Hopf algebraic structure is identically formalised in the corresponding group of characters. While in the Connes-Kreimer formulation the UV counterterm is formalised in terms of a twisted antipode, we show that in the expansion by subgraph a similar role is played by the integrand Taylor operator. To discuss the structure of higher power expansions we introduce a novel Hopf monoid formulation.</description>

      <title>Towards celestial chiral algebras of self-dual black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we show that several self-dual spacetimes previously studied in the context of celestial and twisted holography arise as limits of a certain Taub-NUT AdS$_4$ metric, the Pedersen metric, in which their Mass, NUT charge and cosmological constant obey a self-duality relation. In particular, self-dual Taub-NUT, a singular double cover of Eguchi-Hanson space, Euclidean AdS$_4$, and non-compact $\mathbb{CP}^2$, which is conformally equivalent to Burns space, arise as special limits of the Pedersen metric. The Pedersen metric can be derived from a curved twistor space which we conjecture to arise from a backreaction of self-dual gravity in the presence of a cosmological constant when coupled to a defect operator wrapping a certain $\mathbb{CP}^1$ at infinity. The curved twistor space gives rise to a $2$-parameter deformation of the celestial symmetry algebra $Lw_\wedge$ which reduces to previously studied algebras in various limits. A companion paper will discuss additional details and relations to previously studied self-dual black holes.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and criticality of supersymmetric spin chains of Haldane-Shastry type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the thermodynamics and criticality properties of four families of su$(m|n)$ supersymmetric spin chains of Haldane-Shastry (HS) type, related to both the $A_{N-1}$ and the $BC_N$ classical root systems. Using a known formula expressing the thermodynamic free energy per spin of these models in terms of the Perron (largest in modulus) eigenvalue of a suitable inhomogeneous transfer matrix, we prove a general result relating the su$(kp|kq)$ free energy with arbitrary $k=1,2,\dots$ to the su$(p|q)$ free energy. In this way we are able to evaluate the thermodynamic free energy per spin of several infinite families of supersymmetric HS-type chains, and study their thermodynamics. In particular, we show that in all cases the specific heat at constant volume features a single marked Schottky peak, which in some cases can be heuristically explained by approximating the model with a suitable multi-level system with equally spaced energies. We also study the critical behavior of the models under consideration, showing that the low-temperature behavior of their thermodynamic free energy per spin is the same as that of a $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theory with central charge $c=m+n/2-1$. However, using a motif-based description of the spectrum we prove that only the three families of su$(1|n)$ chains of type $A_{N-1}$ and the su$(m|n)$ HS chain of $BC_N$ type with $m=1,2,3$ (when the sign $\varepsilon_B$ in the Hamiltonian takes the value $-1$ in the latter case) are truly critical.</description>

      <title>Unitary Designs from Random Symmetric Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study distributions of unitaries generated by random quantum circuits that contain only gates respecting a symmetry. We develop a unified approach applicable to all symmetry groups and obtain an equation that determines the exact design properties of such distributions. It has been recently shown that the locality of gates imposes various constraints on the set of realizable unitaries, which in general, significantly depend on the symmetry under consideration. Generically, such constraints include restrictions on the relative phases between sectors with inequivalent irreducible representations of the symmetry. We call a set of symmetric gates semi-universal if they realize all unitaries that respect the symmetry, up to such restrictions. For instance, while in the case of Z_2, U(1), and SU(2) symmetries, 2-qubit gates are semi-universal on qubit systems, in the case of SU(d) symmetry with d\ge 3, semi-universality can be achieved only with 3-qudit gates. The failure of semi-universality implies that the distribution generated by the circuit is not even a 2-design for the Haar (uniform) distribution over the group of all unitaries respecting the symmetry. On the other hand, when semi-universality holds, under mild conditions on the gate set, which hold, e.g., in the case of U(1) and SU(2), the distribution of unitaries generated by the random circuit becomes a t-design for t growing polynomially with the number of qudits with a degree that is determined by the locality of gates. More generally, we present a simple linear equation that determines the maximum value of the integer t, for which the uniform distribution of unitaries generated by the circuits is a t-design, and solve this equation for various examples.</description>

Abstract: Both acoustics and electromagnetism represent measurable fields in terms of dynamical potential fields. Electromagnetic force-fields form a spacetime bivector that is represented by a dynamical energy-momentum 4-vector potential field. Acoustic pressure and velocity fields form an energy-momentum density 4-vector field that is represented by a dynamical action scalar potential field. Surprisingly, standard field theory analyses of spin angular momentum based on these traditional potential representations contradict recent experiments, which motivates a careful reassessment of both theories. We analyze extensions of both theories that use the full geometric structure of spacetime to respect essential symmetries enforced by vacuum wave propagation. The resulting extensions are geometrically complete and phase-invariant (i.e., dual-symmetric) formulations that span all five grades of spacetime, with dynamical potentials and measurable fields spanning complementary grades that are related by a spacetime vector derivative (i.e., the quantum Dirac operator). These complete representations correct the equations of motion, energy-momentum tensors, forces experienced by probes, Lagrangian densities, and allowed gauge freedoms, while making manifest the deep structural connections to relativistic quantum field theories. Finally, we discuss the implications of these corrections to experimental tests.</description>

Abstract: We derive differential equations for multiplicative statistics of the Bessel determinantal point process depending on two parameters. In particular, we prove that such statistics are solutions to an integrable nonlinear partial differential equation describing isospectral deformations of a Sturm-Liouville equation. We also derive identities relating solutions to the integrable partial differential equation and to the Sturm-Liouville equation which imply an analogue for Painlev\'e V of Amir-Corwin-Quastel "integro-differential Painlev\'e II equation". This equation reduces, in a degenerate limit, to the system of coupled Painlev\'e V equations derived by Charlier and Doeraene for the generating function of the Bessel process, and to the Painlev\'e V equation derived by Tracy and Widom for the gap probability of the Bessel process. Finally, we study an initial value problem for the integrable partial differential equation. The approach is based on Its-Izergin-Korepin-Slavnov theory of integrable operators and their associated Riemann-Hilbert problems.</description>

      <title>Mourre theory and spectral analysis of energy-momentum operators in relativistic quantum field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central task of theoretical physics is to analyse spectral properties of quantum mechanical observables. In this endeavour, Mourre's conjugate operator method emerged as an effective tool in the spectral theory of Schr\"odinger operators. This paper introduces a novel class of examples from relativistic quantum field theory that are amenable to Mourre's method. By assuming Lorentz covariance and the spectrum condition, we derive a limiting absorption principle for the energy-momentum operators and provide new proofs of the absolute continuity of the energy-momentum spectra. Moreover, under the assumption of dilation covariance, we show that the spectrum of the relativistic mass operator is purely absolutely continuous in $(0,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Dynamical localization for random scattering zippers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article establishes a proof of dynamical localization for a random scattering zipper model. The scattering zipper operator is the product of two unitary by blocks operators, multiplicatively perturbed on the left and right by random unitary phases. One of the operator is shifted so that this configuration produces a random 5-diagonal unitary operator per blocks. To prove the dynamical localization for this operator, we use the method of fractional moments. We first prove the continuity and strict positivity of the Lyapunov exponents in an annulus around the unit circle, which leads to the exponential decay of a power of the norm of the products of transfer matrices. We then establish an explicit formula of the coefficients of the finite resolvent in terms of the coefficients of the transfer matrices using Schur's complement. From this we deduce, through two reduction results, the exponential decay of the resolvent, from which we get the dynamical localization.</description>

      <title>Integrals of Products of Bessel Functions: An Insight from the Physics of Bloch Electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrals of products of Bessel functions exhibit an intriguing feature: under certain conditions on the parameters specifying the integrand, they vanish identically. We provide a physical interpretation of this feature in the context of both single-particle and many-body properties of electrons on a lattice ("Bloch electrons"), namely, in terms of their density of states and umklapp scattering rate. (In an umklapp event, the change in the momentum of two colliding electrons is equal to a reciprocal lattice vector, which gives rise to a finite resistivity due to electron-electron interaction.) In this context, the vanishing of an integral follows simply from the condition that either the density of states vanishes due to the electron energy lying outside the band in which free propagation of electron waves is allowed, or that an umklapp process is kinematically forbidden due to the Fermi surface being smaller than a critical value.</description>

      <title>Lauricella hypergeometric functions, unipotent fundamental groups of the punctured Riemann sphere, and their motivic coactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06603</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.06603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to raise the possibility that there exists a meaningful theory of `motives' associated to certain hypergeometric integrals, viewed as functions of their parameters. It goes beyond the classical theory of motives, but should be compatible with it. Such a theory would explain a recent and surprising conjecture arising in the context of scattering amplitudes for a motivic Galois group action on Gauss' ${}_2F_1$ hypergeometric function, which we prove in this paper by direct means. More generally, we consider Lauricella hypergeometric functions and show on the one hand how the coefficients in their Taylor expansions can be promoted, via the theory of motivic fundamental groups, to motivic multiple polylogarithms. The latter are periods of ordinary motives and admit an action of the usual motivic Galois group, which we call the `local' action. On the other hand, we define lifts of the full Lauricella functions as matrix coefficients in a Tannakian category of twisted cohomology, which inherit an action of the corresponding Tannaka group. We call this the `global' action. We prove that these two actions, local and global, are compatible with each other, even though they are defined in completely different ways. The main technical tool is to prove that metabelian quotients of generalised Drinfeld associators on the punctured Riemann sphere are hypergeometric functions. We also study single-valued versions of these hypergeometric functions, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.09345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on the one-dimensional finite lattice $\{1,2,\ldots,N\}$. The particles can be created/annihilated at the boundaries with given rates. These rates are $L^\infty$ functions of time and are independent of the jump rates in the bulk. The boundary dynamics is modified by a factor $N^\theta$ with $\theta&gt;0$. We study the hydrodynamic limit for the particle density profile under the hyperbolic space-time scale. The macroscopic equation is given by (inviscid) Burgers equation with Dirichlet type boundaries that is characterized by the boundary entropy. A grading scheme is developed to control the formulation of boundary layers on the microscopic level.</description>

      <title>Violent nonlinear collapse in the interior of charged hairy black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.10932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new one-parameter family indexed by $\epsilon$ of two-ended, spatially-homogeneous black hole interiors solving the Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon equations with a (possibly zero) cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and bifurcating off a Reissner-Nordstr\"om-(dS/AdS) interior ($\epsilon = 0$). For all small $\epsilon \neq 0$, we prove that, although the black hole is charged, its terminal boundary is an everywhere-spacelike Kasner singularity foliated by spheres of zero radius $r$.
  Moreover, smaller perturbations (i.e. smaller $|\epsilon|$) are more singular than larger one, in the sense that the Hawking mass and the curvature blow up following a power law of the form $r^{-O(\epsilon^{-2})}$ at the singularity $\{r=0\}$. This unusual property originates from a dynamical phenomenon -- violent nonlinear collapse -- caused by the almost formation of a Cauchy horizon to the past of the spacelike singularity $\{r=0\}$. This phenomenon was previously described numerically in the physics literature and referred to as "the collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge".
  While we cover all values of $\Lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, the case $\Lambda&lt; 0$ is of particular significance to the AdS/CFT correspondence. Our result can also be viewed in general as a first step towards the understanding of the interior of hairy black holes.</description>

      <title>Kontsevich's star-product up to order 7 for affine Poisson brackets: where are the Riemann zeta values?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kontsevich star-product admits a well-defined restriction to the class of affine -- in particular, linear -- Poisson brackets; its graph expansion consists only of Kontsevich's graphs with in-degree $\leqslant 1$ for aerial vertices. We obtain the formula $\star_{\text{aff}}\text{ mod }\bar{o}(\hbar^7)$ with harmonic propagators for the graph weights (over $n\leqslant 7$ aerial vertices); we verify that all these weights satisfy the cyclic weight relations by Shoikhet--Felder--Willwacher, that they match the computations using the $\textsf{kontsevint}$ software by Panzer, and the resulting affine star-product is associative modulo $\bar{o}(\hbar^7)$.
  We discover that the Riemann zeta value $\zeta(3)^2/\pi^6$, which enters the harmonic graph weights (up to rationals), actually disappears from the analytic formula of $\star_{\text{aff}}\text{ mod }\bar{o}(\hbar^7)$ \textit{because} all the $\mathbb{Q}$-linear combinations of Kontsevich graphs near $\zeta(3)^2/\pi^6$ represent differential consequences of the Jacobi identity for the affine Poisson bracket, hence their contribution vanishes. We thus derive a ready-to-use shorter formula $\star_{\text{aff}}^{\text{red}}$ mod~$\bar{o}(\hbar^7)$ with only rational coefficients.</description>

Abstract: We present a method to construct infinite families of entangling $2$-qudit gates, and amongst them entangling $2$-qudit gates which satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. We show that, given $2$-qudit gates $c$ and $d$, if $c$ or $d$ is entangling, then their Tracy-Singh product $c \boxtimes d$ is also entangling and we can provide non-entangled states which become entangled after the application of $c \boxtimes d$.</description>

      <title>Operational Quantum Reference Frame Transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14002v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum reference frames are needed in quantum theory for much the same reasons that reference frames are in classical theories: to manifest invariance in line with fundamental relativity principles and to provide a basis for the definition of observable quantities. Though around since the 1960s, and used in a wide range of applications, only recently has the means for transforming descriptions between different quantum reference frames been tackled in detail. In this work, we provide a general, operationally motivated framework for quantum reference frames and their transformations, holding for locally compact groups. The work is built around the notion of operational equivalence, in which quantum states that cannot be physically distinguished are identified. For example, we describe the collection of relative observables as a subspace of the algebra of invariants on the composite of system and frame, and from here the set of relative states is constructed through the identification of states which cannot be distinguished by relative observables. Through the notion of framed observables -- the formation of joint observables of system and frame -- of which the relative observables can be understood as examples, quantum reference frame transformations are then maps between equivalence classes of relative states which respect the framing. We give an explicit realisation in the setting that the initial frame admits a highly localized state with respect to the frame observable. The transformations are invertible exactly when the final frame also has such a localizability property. The procedure we present is in operational agreement with other recent inequivalent constructions on the domain of common applicability, but extends them in a number of ways, and weakens claims of entanglement generation through frame changes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following Parisi \&amp; Wu's paradigm of stochastic quantization, we constructed in \cite{BDFT} a $\Phi^4$ measure on an arbitrary closed, compact Riemannian manifold of dimension $3$ as an invariant measure of a singular stochastic partial differential equation. This solves a longstanding open problem in quantum fields on curved backgrounds. In the present work, we build all the harmonic and microlocal analysis tools that are needed in \cite{BDFT}. In particular, we extend the approach of Jagannath--Perkowski to the vectorial $\Phi^4_3$ model by introducing a new Cole-Hopf transform involving random bundle maps.</description>

      <title>Gaussian deconvolution and the lace expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give conditions on a real-valued function $F$ on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, for $d&gt;2$, which ensure that the solution $G$ to the convolution equation $(F*G)(x) = \delta_{0,x}$ has Gaussian decay $|x|^{-(d-2)}$ for large $|x|$. Precursors of our results were obtained in the 2000s, using intricate Fourier analysis. In 2022, a very simple deconvolution theorem was proved, but its applicability was limited. We extend the 2022 theorem to remove its limitations while maintaining its simplicity -- our main tools are H\"older's inequality, weak derivatives, and basic Fourier theory in $L^p$ space. Our motivation comes from critical phenomena in equilibrium statistical mechanics, where the convolution equation is provided by the lace expansion and $G$ is a critical two-point function. Our results significantly simplify existing proofs of critical $|x|^{-(d-2)}$ decay in high dimensions for self-avoiding walk, Ising and $\varphi^4$ models, percolation, and lattice trees and lattice animals. We also improve previous error estimates.</description>

      <title>Extracting topological orders of generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for extracting topological data from translation invariant generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two-dimensional systems, focusing on the analysis of anyon excitations and string operators. The algorithm applies to $\mathbb{Z}_d$ qudits, including instances where $d$ is a nonprime number. This capability allows the identification of topological orders that differ from the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric codes. It extends our understanding beyond the established theorem that Pauli stabilizer codes for $\mathbb{Z}_p$ qudits (with $p$ being a prime) are equivalent to finite copies of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric codes and trivial stabilizers. The algorithm is designed to determine all anyons and their string operators, enabling the computation of their fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics. The method converts the identification of topological orders into computational tasks, including Gaussian elimination, the Hermite normal form, and the Smith normal form of truncated Laurent polynomials. Furthermore, the algorithm provides a systematic approach for studying quantum error-correcting codes. We apply it to various codes, such as self-dual CSS quantum codes modified from the 2d honeycomb color code and non-CSS quantum codes that contain the double semion topological order or the six-semion topological order.</description>

      <title>Kazhdan-Lusztig Correspondence for Vertex Operator Superalgebras from Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the Kazhdan-Lusztig correspondence for a class of vertex operator superalgebras which, via the work of Costello-Gaiotto, arise as boundary VOAs of topological B twist of 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ abelian gauge theories. This means that we show equivalences of braided tensor categories of modules of certain affine vertex superalgebras and corresponding quantum supergroups.
  We build on the work of Creutzig-Lentner-Rupert to this large class of VOAs and extend it since in our case the categories don't have projective objectives and objects can have arbitrary Jordan H\"older length.
  Our correspondence significantly improves the understanding of the braided tensor category of line defects associated to this class of TQFT, by realizing line defects as modules of a Hopf algebra. In the process, we prove a case of the conjecture of Semikhatov-Tipunin, relating logarithmic CFTs to Nichols algebras of screening operators.</description>

      <title>Geometric quantum discord of an arbitrary two-qudit state: the exact value and general upper bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09342v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometric quantum discord of a two-qudit state has been studied in many papers, however, its exact analytical value in the explicit form is known only for a general two-qubit state, a general qubit-qudit state and some special families of two-qudit states. Based on the general Bloch vectors formalism [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 54 195301 (2021)], we find the explicit exact analytical value of the geometric quantum discord for a general two-qudit state of an arbitrary dimension via the parameters of its correlation matrix and the Bloch vectors of its reduced states. This new general analytical result includes all the known exact results on the geometric quantum discord only as particular cases and proves rigorously that the lower bound on the geometric discord presented in [Phys. Rev. A 85, 024102 (2012)] constitutes its exact value for each two-qudit state. Moreover, our new general result allows us to find for an arbitrary two-qudit state, pure or mixed, the novel upper and lower bounds on its geometric quantum discord, expressed via the Hilbert space characteristics of this state.</description>

      <title>A Note on Centralizers and Twisted Centralizers in Clifford Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates centralizers and twisted centralizers in degenerate and non-degenerate Clifford (geometric) algebras. We provide an explicit form of the centralizers and twisted centralizers of the subspaces of fixed grades, subspaces determined by the grade involution and the reversion, and their direct sums. The results can be useful for applications of Clifford algebras in computer science, physics, and engineering.</description>

      <title>Polyadic supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a polyadic analog of supersymmetry by considering the polyadization procedure (proposed by the author) applied to the toy model of one-dimensional supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The supercharges are generalized to polyadic ones using the $n$-ary sigma matrices defined in earlier work. In this way, polyadic analogs of supercharges and Hamiltonians take the cyclic shift block matrix form, and they can describe multidegenerated quantum states in a way that is different from the $N$-extended and multigraded SQM. While constructing the corresponding supersymmetry as an $n$-ary Lie superalgebra ($n$ is the arity of the initial associative multiplication), we have found new brackets with a reduced arity of $2\leq m&lt;n$ and a related series of $m$-ary superalgebras (which is impossible for binary superalgebras). In the case of even reduced arity $m$ we obtain a tower of higher order (as differential operators) even Hamiltonians, while for $m$ odd we get a tower of higher order odd supercharges, and the corresponding algebra consists of the odd sector only.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the index and nullity for minimal submanifolds of some complex Einstein spaces. We investigate the stability of these minimal submanifolds and suggest a criterion for instability for some cases. We also compute some higher eigenvalues for the Laplacian of the Berger spheres and provide with an algorithm.</description>

      <title>Solution of some tiling open problems of Propp, Lai, and some related results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new version of the second author's factorization theorem for perfect matchings of symmetric graphs. We then use our result to solve four open problems of Propp on the enumeration of trimer tilings on the hexagonal lattice.
  As another application, we obtain a semi-factorization result for the number of lozenge tilings of a large class of hexagonal regions with holes (obtained by starting with an arbitrary symmetric hexagon with holes, and translating all the holes one unit lattice segment in the same direction). This in turn leads to the solution of two open problems posed by Lai, to an extension of a result due to Fulmek and Krattenthaler, and to exact enumeration formulas for some new families of hexagonal regions with holes.
  Our result also allows us to find new, simpler proofs (and in one case, a new, simpler form) of some formulas due to Krattenthaler for the number of perfect matchings of Aztec rectangles with unit holes along a lattice diagonal.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of a 2x2 Keyfitz-Kranzer Type Balance System with Varying Generalized Chaplygin Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of two balance laws of Keyfitz-Kranzer type with varying generalized Chaplygin gas, which exhibits negative pressure and is a product of a function of time and the inverse of a power of the density. The Chaplygin gas is a fluid designed to accommodate measurements for the early universe and late-time universal expansion while obeying the pressure-density-time relation. We produce an explanation and description of the non-self-similar Riemann solutions, including the non-classical singular solutions. We also find that due to a direct dependence on time, a change in the regions allowing for combinations of classical and non-classical singular solutions occurs, therefore a Riemann solution can have different solutions over several time intervals. Our findings are confirmed numerically using the local Lax-Friederichs scheme.</description>

      <title>ISDE with logarithmic interaction and characteristic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider certain random matrix eigenvalue dynamics, akin to Dyson Brownian motion, introduced by Rider and Valko. We show that from every initial condition, including ones involving coinciding coordinates, the dynamics, enhanced with more information, converge on path-space to a new infinite-dimensional Feller-continuous diffusion process. We show that the limiting diffusion solves an infinite-dimensional system of stochastic differential equations (ISDE) with logarithmic interaction. Moreover, we show convergence in the long-time limit of the infinite-dimensional dynamics starting from any initial condition to the equilibrium measure, given by the inverse points of the Bessel determinantal point process. As far as we can tell, this is: (a) the first path-space convergence result of random matrix dynamics starting from every initial condition to an infinite-dimensional Feller diffusion, (b) the first construction of solutions to an ISDE with logarithmic interaction from every initial condition for which the singular drift term can be defined at time $0$, (c) the first convergence to equilibrium result from every initial condition for an ISDE of this kind. The argument splits into two parts. The first part builds on the method of intertwiners introduced and developed by Borodin and Olshanski. The main new ingredients are a uniform, in a certain sense, approximation theorem of the spectrum of a family of random matrices indexed by an infinite-dimensional space and an extension of the method of intertwiners to deal with convergence to equilibrium. The second part introduces a new approach towards convergence of the singular drift term in the dynamics and for showing non-intersection of the limiting paths via certain ``characteristic polynomials" associated to the process. We believe variations of it will be applicable to other infinite-dimensional dynamics coming from random matrices.</description>

      <title>Generalized dessin partition function, cut-and-join type representation, and polynomiality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the enumeration problem of a special kind of branched coverings of the Riemann sphere, whose partition function can be regarded as a generalization of the dessin partition function. First we derive a cut-and-join type representation for the generalized dessin partition function using the actions of $W$-type operators on Schur functions. Then we study the polynomial structures of the generalized dessin partition function. We prove a polynomial structure for the disconnected correlators which generalizes a result of Stanley, and then propose a conjectural polynomial structure for the connected correlators. We prove the $1$-point case of this conjecture using the KP integrability of this partition function.</description>
