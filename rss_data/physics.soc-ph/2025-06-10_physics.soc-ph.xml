      <title>Dynamic Social Networks in Dairy Cows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social relations have been shown to impact individual and group success in farm animal populations. Fundamental to addressing these relationships is an understanding of the social network structure resulting from the co-habitation and co-movement of relationships between individuals in a group. Here, we investigate the social network of a group of around 210 lactating dairy cows on a dutch farm during a 14 days period. A positioning system called \emph{Cowview} collected positional data for the whole period. We make the assumption that spatial proximity can be used as a proxy for social interaction. The data is processed to get adjacency matrices. Then social networks are identified based on these matrices. Community detection techniques are applied to the networks. We measure metrics of different dimensions to test community structure, centralization, and similarity of network structure over time. Our study show that there is no evidence that cows are subdivided into stable social communities when looking at interaction in the whole barn. We, however, notice relatively clear communities when dividing the barn into areas with different activities. The social network is characterized by significant centralization, low connectivity, and a hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Powers of Magnetic Graph Matrix: Fourier Spectrum, Walk Compression, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic graphs, originally developed to model quantum systems under magnetic fields, have recently emerged as a powerful framework for analyzing complex directed networks. Existing research has primarily used the spectral properties of the magnetic graph matrix to study global and stationary network features. However, their capacity to model local, non-equilibrium behaviors, often described by matrix powers, remains largely unexplored. We present a novel combinatorial interpretation of the magnetic graph matrix powers through directed walk profiles -- counts of graph walks indexed by the number of edge reversals. Crucially, we establish that walk profiles correspond to a Fourier transform of magnetic matrix powers. The connection allows exact reconstruction of walk profiles from magnetic matrix powers at multiple discrete potentials, and more importantly, an even smaller number of potentials often suffices for accurate approximate reconstruction in real networks. This shows the empirical compressibility of the information captured by the magnetic matrix. This fresh perspective suggests new applications; for example, we illustrate how powers of the magnetic matrix can identify frustrated directed cycles (e.g., feedforward loops) and can be effectively employed for link prediction by encoding local structural details in directed graphs.</description>

      <title>Refugees' path to legal stability is long and systematically unequal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legal systems shape not only the recognition of migrants and refugees but also the pace and stability of their integration. Refugees often shift between multiple legal classifications, a process we refer to as the "legal journey". This journey is frequently prolonged and uncertain. Using a network-based approach, we analyze legal transitions for over 350,000 migrants in Austria (2022 to 2024). Refugees face highly unequal pathways to stability, ranging from two months for Ukrainians to nine months for Syrians and 20 months for Afghans. Women, especially from these regions, are more likely to gain protection; Afghan men wait up to 30 months on average. We also find that those who cross the border without going through official border controls face higher exit rates and lower chances of securing stable status. We show that legal integration is not a uniform process, but one structured by institutional design, procedural entry points, and unequal timelines.</description>

      <title>An elementary method to determine the critical mass of a sphere of fissile material based on a separation of neutron transport and nuclear reaction processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simplified method to calculate the critical mass of a fissile material sphere is presented. This is a purely pedagogical study, in part to elucidate the historical evolution of criticality calculations. This method employs only elementary calculus and straightforward statistical arguments by formulating the problem in terms of the threshold condition that the number of neutrons in the sphere does not change with time; the average neutron path length in the material must be long enough to produce enough fission neutrons to balance losses by absorption due to nuclear reactions and leakage through the surface. This separates the nuclear reaction part of the problem from the geometry and mechanics of neutron transport, the only connection being the total path length which together with the distance between scatterings determines the sphere radius. This leads to an expression for the critical radius without the need to solve the diffusion equation. Comparison with known critical masses shows agreement at the few-percent level. The analysis can also be applied to impure materials, isotopically or otherwise, and can be extended to general neutronics estimations as a design guide or for order-of-magnitude checking of Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) simulations. A comparison is made with the Oppenheimer-Bethe criticality formula, with the results of other calculations, and with the diffusion equation approach via a new treatment of the boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Noise Interplay in a Coupled Model of Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a coupled system mimicking opinion formation under the influence of a group of $q$ neighbors ($q$-lobby) that consists of an Ising part governed by temperature-like parameter $T$ and a voter dynamics parameterized by noise probability $p$ (independence of choice). Using rigorous analytical calculations backed by extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the interplay between these two quantities. Based on the theory of phase transitions, we derive the relation between $T$ and $p$ at the critical line dividing the ordered and disordered phases, which takes a very simple and generic form $T(p-a)=b$ in the high temperature limit. For specific lobby sizes, we show where the temperature are noise are balanced, and we hint that for large $q$, the temperature-like dynamics prevails.</description>

      <title>Control strategies and trends to equilibrium for kinetic models of opinion dynamics driven by social activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce new kinetic equations modeling opinion dynamics inside a population of individuals, whose propensity to interact with each other is described by their level of social activity. We show that opinion polarization can arise among agents with a low activity level, while active ones develop a consensus, highlighting the importance of social interactions to prevent the formation of extreme opinions. Moreover, we present a realistic control strategy aimed at reducing the number of inactive agents and increasing the number of socially active ones. At last, we prove several (weak and strong) convergence to equilibrium results for such controlled model. In particular, by considering additional interactions between individuals and opinion leaders capable of steering the average opinion of the population, we use entropy method-like techniques to estimate the relaxation toward equilibrium of solutions to a Fokker-Planck equation with adjoint given by a Wright-Fisher-type model with time-dependent coefficients.</description>

      <title>A Formal Definition of Scale-dependent Complexity and the Multi-scale Law of Requisite Variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.04896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ashby's law of requisite variety allows a comparison of systems with their environments, providing a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for system efficacy: a system must possess at least as much complexity as any set of environmental behaviors that require distinct responses from the system. However, to account for the dependence of a system's complexity on the level of detail -- or scale -- of its description, a multi-scale generalization of Ashby's law is needed. We define a class of complexity profiles (complexity as a function of scale) that is the first, to our knowledge, to exhibit a multi-scale law of requisite variety. This formalism provides a characterization of multi-scale complexity and generalizes the law of requisite variety's single constraint on system behaviors to a class of multi-scale constraints. We show that these complexity profiles satisfy a sum rule, which reflects a tradeoff between smaller- and larger-scale degrees of freedom, and we extend our results to subdivided systems and systems with a continuum of components.</description>

      <title>Fast and exact simulations of stochastic epidemics on static and temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epidemic models on complex networks have been widely used to study how the social structure of a population affect the spreading of epidemics. However, their numerical simulation can be computationally heavy, especially for large networks. In this paper, we introduce NEXT-Net: a flexible implementation of the next reaction method for epidemic spreading on both static and temporal networks. By systematic tests on artificial and real-world networks, we find that NEXT-Net is substantially faster than alternative algorithms, while being exact. It permits, in particular, to efficiently simulate epidemics on networks with million of nodes on a standard computer. It is also versatile enough to simulate a broad range of epidemic models of temporal networks, including cases in which the network structure changes in response to the epidemic. Our code is implemented in C++ and accessible from Python and R, thus combining speed with user friendliness. Because of these features, our algorithm constitutes an ideal tool for a broad range of applications.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey on Artificial Intelligence for Complex Network: Potential, Methodology and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex networks pervade various real-world systems, from the natural environment to human societies. The essence of these networks is in their ability to transition and evolve from microscopic disorder-where network topology and node dynamics intertwine-to a macroscopic order characterized by certain collective behaviors. Over the past two decades, complex network science has significantly enhanced our understanding of the statistical mechanics, structures, and dynamics underlying real-world networks. Despite these advancements, there remain considerable challenges in exploring more realistic systems and enhancing practical applications. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, coupled with the abundance of diverse real-world network data, has heralded a new era in complex network science research. This survey aims to systematically address the potential advantages of AI in overcoming the lingering challenges of complex network research. It endeavors to summarize the pivotal research problems and provide an exhaustive review of the corresponding methodologies and applications. Through this comprehensive survey-the first of its kind on AI for complex networks-we expect to provide valuable insights that will drive further research and advancement in this interdisciplinary field.</description>

      <title>Two-step dimensionality reduction of human mobility data: From potential landscapes to spatiotemporal insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of human mobility is crucial for addressing societal challenges, such as epidemic control and urban transportation optimization. Despite advancements in data collection, the complexity and scale of mobility data continue to pose significant analytical challenges. Existing methods often result in losing location-specific details and fail to fully capture the intricacies of human movement. This study proposes a two-step dimensionality reduction framework to overcome existing limitations. First, we construct a potential landscape of human flow from origin-destination (OD) matrices using combinatorial Hodge theory, preserving essential spatial and structural information while enabling an intuitive visualization of flow patterns. Second, we apply principal component analysis (PCA) to the potential landscape, systematically identifying major spatiotemporal patterns. By implementing this two-step reduction method, we reveal significant shifts during a pandemic, characterized by an overall declines in mobility and stark contrasts between weekdays and holidays. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our framework in uncovering complex mobility patterns and provide valuable insights into urban planning and public health interventions.</description>
