      <title>Cross-Modal Alignment between Visual Stimuli and Neural Responses in the Visual Cortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the mapping between visual stimuli and neural responses in the visual cortex contributes to a deeper understanding of biological visual processing mechanisms. Most existing studies characterize this mapping by training models to directly encode visual stimuli into neural responses or decode neural responses into visual stimuli. However, due to neural response variability and limited neural recording techniques, these studies suffer from overfitting and lack generalizability. Motivated by this challenge, in this paper we shift the tasks from conventional direct encoding and decoding to discriminative encoding and decoding, which are more reasonable. And on top of this we propose a cross-modal alignment approach, named Visual-Neural Alignment (VNA). To thoroughly test the performance of the three methods (direct encoding, direct decoding, and our proposed VNA) on discriminative encoding and decoding tasks, we conduct extensive experiments on three invasive visual cortex datasets, involving two types of subject mammals (mice and macaques). The results demonstrate that our VNA generally outperforms direct encoding and direct decoding, indicating our VNA can most precisely characterize the above visual-neural mapping among the three methods.</description>

      <title>Fitting Reinforcement Learning Model to Behavioral Data under Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of fitting a reinforcement learning (RL) model to some given behavioral data under a multi-armed bandit environment. These models have received much attention in recent years for characterizing human and animal decision making behavior. We provide a generic mathematical optimization problem formulation for the fitting problem of a wide range of RL models that appear frequently in scientific research applications, followed by a detailed theoretical analysis of its convexity properties. Based on the theoretical results, we introduce a novel solution method for the fitting problem of RL models based on convex relaxation and optimization. Our method is then evaluated in several simulated bandit environments to compare with some benchmark methods that appear in the literature. Numerical results indicate that our method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, while significantly reducing computation time. We also provide an open-source Python package for our proposed method to empower researchers to apply it in the analysis of their datasets directly, without prior knowledge of convex optimization.</description>

      <title>InvSim algorithm for pre-computing airplane flight controls in limited-range autonomous missions, and demonstration via double-roll maneuver of Mirage III fighters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we start with a generic mathematical framework for the equations of motion (EOM) in flight mechanics with six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) for a general (not necessarily symmetric) fixed-wing aircraft. This mathematical framework incorporates (1) body axes (fixed in the airplane at its center of gravity), (2) inertial axes (fixed in the earth/ground at the take-off point), wind axes (aligned with the flight path/course), (3) spherical flight path angles (azimuth angle measured clockwise from the geographic north, and elevation angle measured above the horizon plane), and (4) spherical flight angles (angle of attack and sideslip angle). We then manipulate these equations of motion to derive a customized version suitable for inverse simulation flight mechanics, where a target flight trajectory is specified while a set of corresponding necessary flight controls to achieve that maneuver are predicted. We then present a numerical procedure for integrating the developed inverse simulation (InvSim) system in time; utilizing (1) symbolic mathematics, (2) explicit fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) numerical integration technique, and (3) expressions based on the finite difference method (FDM); such that the four necessary control variables (engine thrust force, ailerons' deflection angle, elevators' deflection angle, and rudder's deflection angle) are computed as discrete values over the entire maneuver time, and these calculated control values enable the airplane to achieve the desired flight trajectory, which is specified by three inertial Cartesian coordinates of the airplane, in addition to the Euler's roll angle. We finally demonstrate the proposed numerical procedure of flight mechanics inverse simulation (InvSim).</description>

      <title>Federated Learning with Gramian Angular Fields for Privacy-Preserving ECG Classification on Heterogeneous IoT Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a federated learning (FL) framework for privacy-preserving electrocardiogram (ECG) classification in Internet of Things (IoT) healthcare environments. By transforming 1D ECG signals into 2D Gramian Angular Field (GAF) images, the proposed approach enables efficient feature extraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while ensuring that sensitive medical data remain local to each device. This work is among the first to experimentally validate GAF-based federated ECG classification across heterogeneous IoT devices, quantifying both performance and communication efficiency. To evaluate feasibility in realistic IoT settings, we deployed the framework across a server, a laptop, and a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi 4, reflecting edge-cloud integration in IoT ecosystems. Experimental results demonstrate that the FL-GAF model achieves a high classification accuracy of 95.18% in a multi-client setup, significantly outperforming a single-client baseline in both accuracy and training time. Despite the added computational complexity of GAF transformations, the framework maintains efficient resource utilization and communication overhead. These findings highlight the potential of lightweight, privacy-preserving AI for IoT-based healthcare monitoring, supporting scalable and secure edge deployments in smart health systems.</description>

      <title>Secure Code Generation at Scale with Reflexion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now widely used to draft and refactor code, but code that works is not necessarily secure. We evaluate secure code generation using the Instruct Prime, which eliminated compliance-required prompts and cue contamination, and evaluate five instruction-tuned code LLMs using a zero-shot baseline and a three-round reflexion prompting approach. Security is measured using the Insecure Code Detector (ICD), and results are reported by measuring Repair, Regression, and NetGain metrics, considering the programming language and CWE family. Our findings show that insecurity remains common at the first round: roughly 25-33% of programs are insecure at a zero-shot baseline (t0 ). Weak cryptography/config-dependent bugs are the hardest to avoid while templated ones like XSS, code injection, and hard-coded secrets are handled more reliably. Python yields the highest secure rates; C and C# are the lowest, with Java, JS, PHP, and C++ in the middle. Reflexion prompting improves security for all models, improving average accuracy from 70.74% at t0 to 79.43% at t3 , with the largest gains in the first round followed by diminishing returns. The trends with Repair, Regression, and NetGain metrics show that applying one to two rounds produces most of the benefits.

      <title>Accelerating scientific discovery with the common task framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are transforming and empowering the characterization and control of dynamic systems in the engineering, physical, and biological sciences. These emerging modeling paradigms require comparative metrics to evaluate a diverse set of scientific objectives, including forecasting, state reconstruction, generalization, and control, while also considering limited data scenarios and noisy measurements. We introduce a common task framework (CTF) for science and engineering, which features a growing collection of challenge data sets with a diverse set of practical and common objectives. The CTF is a critically enabling technology that has contributed to the rapid advance of ML/AI algorithms in traditional applications such as speech recognition, language processing, and computer vision. There is a critical need for the objective metrics of a CTF to compare the diverse algorithms being rapidly developed and deployed in practice today across science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Shared Spatial Memory Through Predictive Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sharing and reconstructing a consistent spatial memory is a critical challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information bottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization, emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode partners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells (SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to 64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social collective intelligence.</description>

      <title>On the relationship between MESP and 0/1 D-Opt and their upper bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish strong connections between two fundamental nonlinear 0/1 optimization problems coming from the area of experimental design, namely maximum entropy sampling and 0/1 D-Optimality. The connections are based on maps between instances, and we analyze the behavior of these maps. Using these maps, we transport basic upper-bounding methods between these two problems, and we are able to establish new domination results and other inequalities relating various basic upper bounds. Further, we establish results relating how different branch-and-bound schemes based on these maps compare. Additionally, we observe some surprising numerical results, where bounding methods that did not seem promising in their direct application to real-data MESP instances, are now useful for MESP instances that come from 0/1 D-Optimality.</description>

      <title>Data-driven uncertainty-aware seakeeping prediction of the Delft 372 catamaran using ensemble Hankel dynamic mode decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present and validate an ensemble-based Hankel Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (HDMDc) for uncertainty-aware seakeeping predictions of a high-speed catamaran, namely the Delft 372 model. Experimental measurements (time histories) of wave elevation at the longitudinal center of gravity, heave, pitch, notional flight-deck velocity, notional bridge acceleration, and total resistance were collected from irregular wave basin tests on a 1:33.3 scale replica of the Delft 372 model under sea state 5 conditions at Fr = 0.425, and organized into training, validation, and test sets. The HDMDc algorithm constructs an equation-free linear reduced-order model of the seakeeping vessel by augmenting states and inputs with their time-lagged copies to capture nonlinear and memory effects. Two ensembling strategies, namely Bayesian HDMDc (BHDMDc), which samples hyperparameters considered stochastic variables with prior distribution to produce posterior mean forecasts with confidence intervals, and Frequentist HDMDc (FHDMDc), which aggregates multiple model obtained over data subsets, are compared in providing seakeeping prediction and uncertainty quantification. The FHDMDc approach is found to improve the accuracy of the predictions compared to the deterministic counterpart, also providing robust uncertainty estimation; whereas the application of BHDMDc to the present test case is not found beneficial in comparison to the deterministic model. FHDMDc-derived probability density functions for the motions closely match both experimental data and URANS results, demonstrating reliable and computationally efficient seakeeping prediction for design and operational support.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Sensor Placement in Urban Storm Sewers: A Data-Driven Sparse Sensing Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban surface water flooding, triggered by intense rainfall overwhelming drainage systems, is increasingly frequent and widespread. While flood prediction and monitoring in high spatial-temporal resolution are desired, practical constraints in time, budget, and technology hinder its full implementation. How to monitor urban drainage networks and predict flow conditions under constrained resource is a major challenge. This study presents a data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with EPA-SWMM, to optimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in a stormwater system, using the Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota, as a case study. We utilized a SWMM model to generate a training dataset of peak flowrate profiles across the stormwater network. Furthermore, we applied DSS - leveraging singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR factorization for sensor allocation - to identify the optimal monitoring nodes based on the simulated training dataset. We then validated the representativeness of these identified monitoring nodes by comparing the DSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles with those obtained from SWMM. Three optimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction performance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92-0.95 (25th to 75th percentiles). In addition, the model showed good robustness to uncertainty in measurements. Its robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and improves with the number of sensors deployed. The framework balances computational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling high-accuracy flow reconstruction with minimal sensors. This DSS framework can be further integrated with predictive models to realize flood early warning and real-time control under limited sensing and monitoring resource.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Electron-Scale Turbulence Modeling in W7-X</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constructing reduced models for turbulent transport is essential for accelerating profile predictions and enabling many-query tasks such as uncertainty quantification, parameter scans, and design optimization. This paper presents machine-learning-driven reduced models for Electron Temperature Gradient (ETG) turbulence in the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator. Each model predicts the ETG heat flux as a function of three plasma parameters: the normalized electron temperature radial gradient ($\omega_{T_e}$), the ratio of normalized electron temperature and density radial gradients ($\eta_e$), and the electron-to-ion temperature ratio ($\tau$). We first construct models across seven radial locations using regression and an active machine-learning-based procedure. This process initializes models using low-cardinality sparse-grid training data and then iteratively refines their training sets by selecting the most informative points from a pre-existing simulation database. We evaluate the prediction capabilities of our models using out-of-sample datasets with over $393$ points per location, and $95\%$ prediction intervals are estimated via bootstrapping to assess prediction uncertainty. We then investigate the construction of generalized reduced models, including a generic, position-independent model, and assess their heat flux prediction capabilities at three additional locations. Our models demonstrate robust performance and predictive accuracy comparable to the original reference simulations, even when applied beyond the training domain.</description>

      <title>Dynamic causal discovery in Alzheimer's disease through latent pseudotime modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of causal discovery to diseases like Alzheimer's (AD) is limited by the static graph assumptions of most methods; such models cannot account for an evolving pathophysiology, modulated by a latent disease pseudotime. We propose to apply an existing latent variable model to real-world AD data, inferring a pseudotime that orders patients along a data-driven disease trajectory independent of chronological age, then learning how causal relationships evolve. Pseudotime outperformed age in predicting diagnosis (AUC 0.82 vs 0.59). Incorporating minimal, disease-agnostic background knowledge substantially improved graph accuracy and orientation. Our framework reveals dynamic interactions between novel (NfL, GFAP) and established AD markers, enabling practical causal discovery despite violated assumptions.</description>

      <title>Universal Fourier Neural Operators for periodic homogenization problems in linear elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving cell problems in homogenization is hard, and available deep-learning frameworks fail to match the speed and generality of traditional computational frameworks. More to the point, it is generally unclear what to expect of machine-learning approaches, let alone single out which approaches are promising. In the work at hand, we advocate Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for micromechanics, empowering them by insights from computational micromechanics methods based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT). We construct an FNO surrogate mimicking the basic scheme foundational for FFT-based methods and show that the resulting operator predicts solutions to cell problems with arbitrary stiffness distribution only subject to a material-contrast constraint up to a desired accuracy. In particular, there are no restrictions on the material symmetry like isotropy, on the number of phases and on the geometry of the interfaces between materials. Also, the provided fidelity is sharp and uniform, providing explicit guarantees leveraging our physical empowerment of FNOs. To show the desired universal approximation property, we construct an FNO explicitly that requires no training to begin with. Still, the obtained neural operator complies with the same memory requirements as the basic scheme and comes with runtimes proportional to classical FFT solvers. In particular, large-scale problems with more than 100 million voxels are readily handled. The goal of this work is to underline the potential of FNOs for solving micromechanical problems, linking FFT-based methods to FNOs. This connection is expected to provide a fruitful exchange between both worlds.</description>

      <title>Symmetries in stochastic homogenization and adjustments for the RVE method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of a given symmetry of a random microstructure on the obtained effective tensor and its fluctuation in the context of thermal conductivity, and study strategies for enforcing these symmetries in postprocessing via orthogonal projectors. Within the framework of the representative volume element (RVE) method, we establish the invariance conditions for the effective tensor and its fluctuation under different symmetry groups of the microstructure. Interestingly, the symmetry of the considered cell type in the RVE method may break the ensemble symmetry and compromise the approximation of the effective properties. To rectify this issue, we introduce dedicated techniques which permit to enforce the expected symmetries in postprocessing and study the implications on the bounds for the effective properties as well as the total, the random and the systematic errors. We provide theoretical arguments that suitable projections lead to unbiased variance-reduction strategies which furthermore enforce the expected symmetries exactly. Through large-scale FFT-based homogenization simulations, we study the symmetry structure of the estimated effective conductivities and their fluctuations. Moreover, we demonstrate the power of the symmetry-projection techniques for fiber-reinforced composite microstructures of industrial scale.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Framework for Environmental Similarity and Vessel Mobility as Coupled Predictors of Marine Invasive Species Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Marine invasive species spread through global shipping and generate substantial ecological and economic impacts. Traditional risk assessments require detailed records of ballast water and traffic patterns, which are often incomplete, limiting global coverage. This work advances a theoretical framework that quantifies invasion risk by combining environmental similarity across ports with observed and forecasted maritime mobility. Climate-based feature representations characterize each port's marine conditions, while mobility networks derived from Automatic Identification System data capture vessel flows and potential transfer pathways. Clustering and metric learning reveal climate analogues and enable the estimation of species survival likelihood along shipping routes. A temporal link prediction model captures how traffic patterns may change under shifting environmental conditions. The resulting fusion of environmental similarity and predicted mobility provides exposure estimates at the port and voyage levels, supporting targeted monitoring, routing adjustments, and management interventions.</description>

      <title>Collaboration Dynamics and Reliability Challenges of Multi-Agent LLM Systems in Finite Element Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems are increasingly applied to automate computational workflows in science and engineering. However, how inter-agent dynamics influence reasoning quality and verification reliability remains unclear. We study these mechanisms using an AutoGen-based multi-agent framework for linear-elastic Finite Element Analysis (FEA), evaluating seven role configurations across four tasks under a fixed 12-turn conversation limit. From 1,120 controlled trials, we find that collaboration effectiveness depends more on functional complementarity than team size: the three-agent Coder-Executor-Critic configuration uniquely produced physically and visually correct solutions, while adding redundant reviewers reduced success rates. Yet three systematic failure modes persist: (1) affirmation bias, where the Rebuttal agent endorsed rather than challenged outputs (85-92% agreement, including errors); (2) premature consensus caused by redundant reviewers; and (3) a verification-validation gap where executable but physically incorrect code passed undetected. No agent combination successfully validated constitutive relations in complex tasks. Building on theories of functional diversity, role differentiation, and computational validation, we propose actionable design principles: (i) assign complementary agent roles, (ii) enforce multi-level validation (execution, specification, physics), and (iii) prevent early consensus through adversarial or trigger-based interaction control. These findings establish a principled foundation for designing trustworthy LLM collaborations in engineering workflows.</description>

      <title>OceanAI: A Conversational Platform for Accurate, Transparent, Near-Real-Time Oceanographic Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming the sciences, yet general conversational AI systems often generate unverified "hallucinations" undermining scientific rigor. We present OceanAI, a conversational platform that integrates the natural-language fluency of open-source large language models (LLMs) with real-time, parameterized access to authoritative oceanographic data streams hosted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Each query such as "What was Boston Harbor's highest water level in 2024?" triggers real-time API calls that identify, parse, and synthesize relevant datasets into reproducible natural-language responses and data visualizations. In a blind comparison with three widely used AI chat-interface products, only OceanAI produced NOAA-sourced values with original data references; others either declined to answer or provided unsupported results. Designed for extensibility, OceanAI connects to multiple NOAA data products and variables, supporting applications in marine hazard forecasting, ecosystem assessment, and water-quality monitoring. By grounding outputs and verifiable observations, OceanAI advances transparency, reproducibility, and trust, offering a scalable framework for AI-enabled decision support within the oceans. A public demonstration is available at https://oceanai.ai4ocean.xyz.</description>
