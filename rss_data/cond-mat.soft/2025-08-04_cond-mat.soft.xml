      <title>Contactless indentation of a soft boundary by a rigid particle in shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of a rigid particle above a fluid-fluid interface in shear flow is studied here numerically and analytically as a function of the downward force applied on the particle. It is found here that the particle goes below the equilibrium level of the interface for a strong enough downward force. Such states remain stable under flow, with a fluid film of a well-defined thickness separating the particle from the indented interface. This result contradicts the classical lubrication theory, which predicts an infinitely large downward force being necessary for the particle to approach the equilibrium level of the interface. It is found that the classical lubrication approximation is only valid in a narrow range of shear rates, which shrinks to a point when the particle approaches the equilibrium level of the interface. The gap renormalization model, proposed here, cures this limitation of the classical lubrication theory, showing quantitative agreement with the numerical results when the particle touches the equilibrium level of the interface. It is found that the gap renormalization model provides a quantitative interpretation of the recent experimental results, including the range of particle heights above the interface for which the classical lubrication approximation breaks down.</description>

      <title>Scale dependence of segregation patterns in the filling of silos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Size segregation in granular flows is a well-known phenomenon: laboratory experiments consistently show that large particles migrate toward silo walls during filling, while smaller particles concentrate near the center. Paradoxically, field observations in large-scale industrial silos often report the opposite pattern, challenging these findings. We demarcate these patterns through a systematic experimental study spanning a range of dimensionless numbers relevant to bidisperse granular flows in quasi-2D silos under both dry and immersed conditions, varying container geometry and fluid viscosity. Image analysis reveals that the observed patterns are governed by two key dimensionless parameters: the slenderness of the silo and the Stokes number, which encapsulates the balance between particle inertia and viscous drag. Our results demonstrate the role of fluids on segregation dynamics and provide a unified scaling framework that reconciles laboratory- and field-scale observations in air.</description>

      <title>Multivalent linkers mediated ultra-sensitive bio-detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In biosensing and diagnostic applications, a key objective is to design detection systems capable of identifying targets at very low concentrations, i.e., achieving high sensitivity. Here, we propose a linker-mediated detection scheme in which the presence of target molecules (linkers) facilitates the adsorption of ligand-coated guest nanoparticles onto a receptor-coated host substrate. Through a combination of computer simulations and mean-field theory, we demonstrate that, at fixed overall binding strength, increasing the valency of linkers exponentially lowers the concentration threshold for detection. This enables the identification of targets at extremely low concentrations, which is critical for early-stage disease and pathogen diagnostics. Furthermore, superselectivity with respect to binding strength is preserved for multivalent linkers, allowing for effective discrimination between targets and non-targets. Our findings highlight multivalency engineering of linkers as a powerful strategy to dramatically enhance the sensitivity of biodetection systems.</description>

      <title>Screw Symmetry, Chiral Hydrodynamics and Odd Instability in Active Cholesterics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active cholesterics are chiral in both their structure, which has continuous screw symmetry, and their active stresses, which include contributions from torque dipoles. Both expressions of chirality give rise to curl forces in the hydrodynamics, which we derive from the active Ericksen-Leslie equations using a geometric approach. This clarifies the hydrodynamics of continuous screw symmetry and provides an example of generalised odd elastic forces that originate from an equilibrium free energy. We discuss also the nonlinear structure of the active hydrodynamics in terms of the Eulerian displacement field of the cholesteric pseudolayers. For the active instability, screw symmetry generates a contribution of chiral activity to the linearised pseudolayer hydrodynamics that is absent in materials with chiral activity but achiral structure. When the two forms are sufficiently antagonistic, this term produces a new active instability with threshold and characteristic wavevector distinct from those of the active Helfrich-Hurault instability in chiral active smectics. Finally, we comment on the isotropic chiral hydrodynamics of materials with three-dimensional screw symmetry.</description>

      <title>Rigid body rotation and chiral reorientation combine in filamentous E. coli swimming in low-Re flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antibiotic doses below a minimum inhibitory concentration turn off bacteria cell division, but not cell growth. As a result, rod-like bacteria including E. coli can elongate many times their original length without increasing their width. The swimming behavior of these filamentous bacteria through small channels may provide insights into how antibiotic-resistant bacteria swim to channel walls. Such swimming behaviors in settings like hospital tubing may facilitate adhesion, biofilm formation and infection. Despite the importance of understanding the behavior of bacteria not killed by antibiotics, the swimming of filamentous bacteria in external flows has not received much attention. We study the swimming of stressed, filamentous E. coli. In quiescence, highly elongated E. coli swim with a sinusoidal undulation, suggesting rigid body rotation of the long, slightly segmented cell bodies. In low Reynolds number pressure-driven flows through a microchannel, undulation becomes irregular and may stop and start within a particular bacteria trajectory. We refer to this behavior in flow as `wiggling.' Rigid body rotation persists in flow, appearing as a high frequency change in body orientation on top of a slower frequency of reorientation. Chiral reorientation can explain the slower reorientation. We quantify swimming in two flow rates and observe both rheotaxis and preferential orientation of bacteria bodies. We find that the faster flow constrains wiggling bacteria trajectories and orientations more than slower flow does. Interestingly, not all bacteria in flow wiggle. Populations of `non-wiggling' filamentous E. coli follow streamlines, without preferential orientation, flowing faster than wigglers. Non-wigglers do not behave like chiral rods propelled by flagellar bundles, but like rigid rods. Differentiating these populations may have important implications for understanding motility loss.</description>

      <title>On the interaction of dilatancy and friction in the behavior of fluid-saturated sheared granular materials: a coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics--Discrete Element Method study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frictional instabilities in fluid-saturated granular materials underlie critical natural hazards such as submarine landslides and earthquake initiation. Distinct failure behaviors emerge under subaerial and subaqueous conditions due to the coupled effects of mechanical deformation, interparticle friction, and fluid interactions. This study employs three-dimensional coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics-Discrete Element Method (CFD-DEM) simulations to investigate the collapse and runout dynamics of dense and loose granular assemblies across these settings. Parametric analyses reveal that pore pressure evolution plays a central role in governing failure mechanisms: dense assemblies stabilize through dilation, while loose assemblies undergo rapid compaction and fluidization, particularly under subaqueous conditions. Spatiotemporal analyses of coarse-grained fields further highlight strain-rate-dependent behavior driven by evolving porosity and effective stress. Both environments exhibit rate-strengthening behavior that scales with the inertial number (In) and viscous number (Iv), though driven by distinct mechanisms: subaerial systems are dominated by interparticle contact networks, whereas subaqueous systems are influenced by fluid drag, pore-pressure buildup, and lubrication. An analytical solution for excess pore pressure is compared with breaching-induced pressure distributions from CFD-DEM simulations, using input parameters derived from numerical triaxial DEM tests. The model captures fluid-particle coupling effectively, reproducing comparable excess pore pressures at steady state, while early-time discrepancies underscore the complexities of transient interactions. These findings advance the understanding of failure mechanics in saturated granular media and support the development of physics-based models for mitigating hazards associated with subaqueous granular flows.</description>

      <title>Athermal creep deformation of ultrastable amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the athermal creep deformation of amorphous materials having a wide range of stability. The imposed shear stress serves as the control parameter, allowing us to examine the time-dependent transient response through both the macroscopic strain and microscopic observables. Least stable samples exhibit monotonicity in the transient strain rate versus time, while more stable samples display a pronounced non-monotonic S-shaped curve, corresponding to failure by sharp shear band formation. We identify a diverging timescale associated with the fluidization process and extract the corresponding critical exponents. Our results are compared with predictions from existing scaling theories relevant to soft matter systems. The numerical findings for stable, brittle-like materials represent a challenge for theoretical descriptions. We monitor the microscopic initiation of shear bands during creep responses. Our study encompasses creep deformation across a variety of materials ranging from ductile soft matter to brittle metallic and oxide glasses, all within the same numerical framework.</description>
