      <title>Parity anomalies in 2+1-dimensional Aharonov-Bohm type configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Dirac fermions in 2+1 dimensions, coupled to Abelian gauge fields in multiply-connected regions, exhibit a parity anomaly that directly manifests as Aharonov-Bohm (AB) type topological phases. Using the Fujikawa method, we show that this anomaly reproduces both the AB phase and the spin-dependent Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase. We explicitly calculate the induced topological currents, establishing that their characteristic divergence-free form provides a direct signature of this parity-anomalous topological phase.</description>

      <title>Spinning Fields in Lorentzian AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the higher spin wave functions in the embedding space of anti-de Sitter Lorentzian spacetime. These wave functions are built from a primary wave functions that has a simple structure expressed in terms of the special conformal generator vector fields in AdS. We compute the eigenvalue of the quadratic Casimir for the symmetric traceless states, and show explicitly that these satisfy the higher spin wave equation. We also demonstrate that these wave functions have the right structure in the flat space limit for massive higher spin fields, and can be used to construct $in$ and $out$ states for scattering processes. Spinning states that become massless in the flat limit are extremely subtle. The problem can be isolated to longitudinal polarizations.</description>

      <title>Symplectic structure in open string field theory II: Sliding lump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a new formula for symplectic structure to compute the momentum of an analytic lump solution moving at constant velocity in Witten's open string field theory. The computation gives a new way to determine the D-brane tension in string field theory. Using homotopy algebra technology, we prove that this tension must agree with the value implied by the on-shell action.</description>

      <title>Holographic Constraints on the String Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that holography imposes strong and general constraints on scalar field potentials in the string landscape, determined by the asymptotic structure of the underlying spacetime. Applying these holographic consistency conditions, we identify broad classes of scalar potentials that are incompatible with a well-defined dual description. These include potentials with extended plateaus, excessively steep or shallow asymptotics, certain zero crossings, and specific alignments of stable AdS minima in moduli space. In particular, making the standard assumption that the CFT dual to a stable AdS vacuum must be realized as a worldvolume theory of a brane in string theory, we show that the brane selects an infinite-distance limit in moduli space where parametric scale separation is forbidden. Furthermore, the steepness and positivity of the potential are restricted in that infinite distance direction. We also find that requiring the validity of the effective theory in the future vacuum, a natural holographic criterion, automatically enforces the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) for classical cosmological solutions with positive potentials. Taken together, these constraints exclude the leading proposals to realize scale-separated AdS vacua and metastable de Sitter vacua in the string theory landscape such as DGKT and KKLT.</description>

      <title>A scattering perspective on gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves propagating across gravitational potentials undergo lensing effects that, in the wave-optics regime, manifest as frequency-dependent amplitude and phase modulations. In this work, we revisit the diffraction integral formalism of gravitational lensing and demonstrate that it admits a natural and transparent interpretation within the framework of scattering theory. We establish a direct correspondence between the lensing amplification factor and the scattering amplitude of waves propagating in curved spacetime, clarifying how familiar lensing limits map onto distinct scattering regimes. In particular, we show that the diffraction integral matches exactly the eikonal limit of the scattering amplitude at lowest post-Minkowskian order, after a change in coordinates and the inclusion of finite-distance effects. We further extend the standard formalism by including subleading corrections to the post-Minkowskian and eikonal approximations. Our results provide a unified theoretical framework for the interpretation of lensed gravitational-wave signals and open the way to more accurate waveform modeling for future lensed observations.</description>

      <title>Explicit Connections Between Krylov and Nielsen Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a direct correspondence between Krylov and Nielsen complexity by choosing the Krylov basis to be part of the elementary gate set of Nielsen geometry and selecting a Nielsen complexity metric compatible with the Krylov metric. Up to normalization, the Krylov complexity of a Hermitian operator then equals the length squared of a straight-line trajectory on the manifold of unitaries that connects the identity operator with a precursor operator. The corresponding length provides an upper bound on Nielsen complexity that saturates whenever the straight line is a minimal geodesic. While for general systems we can only establish saturation in the limit of small precursors, we provide evidence that in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model there is a precise correspondence between Krylov complexity and (the square of) Nielsen complexity for a finite range of precursors.</description>

      <title>Streamlined Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The textbook N=1 supergravity has an F-term potential depending on a superpotential $W(z_i)$ and a Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$, with the scalar potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})=e^K (|DW|^2 - 3 |W|^2)$. In this approach, it is not always easy to find the potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$ with the required properties. We show that in supergravity with a nilpotent superfield and with any Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i} )$ one can obtain any desired potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$ by a proper choice of the Kahler metric of the nilpotent superfield. This construction is particularly suitable for cosmological and particle physics applications, which may require maximal freedom in the choice of kinetic terms and scalar potentials.</description>

      <title>Elliptic modular graph forms, equivariant iterated integrals and single-valued elliptic polylogarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-energy expansion of genus-one string amplitudes produces infinite families of non-holomorphic modular forms after each step of integrating over a point on the torus worldsheet which are known as elliptic modular graph forms (eMGFs). We solve the differential equations of eMGFs depending on a single point $z$ and the modular parameter $\tau$ via iterated integrals over holomorphic modular forms which individually transform inhomogeneously under ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$. Suitable generating series of these iterated integrals over $\tau$, their complex conjugates and single-valued multiple zeta values (svMZVs) are combined to attain equivariant transformations under ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ such that their components are modular forms.
  Our generating series of equivariant iterated integrals for eMGFs is related to elliptic multiple polylogarithms (eMPLs) through a gauge transform of the flat Calaque-Enriquez-Etingof connection. By converting iterated $\tau$-integrals to iterated integrals over points on a torus, we arrive at an explicit construction of single-valued eMPLs where all the monodromies in the points cancel. Each single-valued eMPL depending on a single point $z$ is found to be a finite combination of meromorphic eMPLs, their complex conjugates, svMZVs and equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals. Our generating series determines the latter two admixtures via so-called zeta generators and Tsunogai derivations which act on the two generators $x$, $y$ of a free Lie algebra and where the coefficients of words in $x,y$ define the single-valued eMPLs.</description>

      <title>Consistent subsectors of maximal supergravity and wrapped M5-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new family of $D=4$ $\mathcal{N}=8$ gauged supergravities is introduced, consisting in a mixture of Scherk-Schwarz and dyonic CSO gaugings that involves the trombone scaling symmetry. A specific theory in this class is shown to admit supersymmetric anti-de Sitter vacua, argued to be related to various wrapped M5-brane configurations. The mass spectrum of these vacua within our maximal theory is computed, extending previous results in smaller gauged supergravity models, and shown to exhibit some exotic features due to the trombone gauging. These vacua are obtained as solutions of certain subsectors of our $\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity. Such subsectors in turn arise by consistent truncation of the parent maximal supergravity to the invariant fields under specific groups that are not contained in the $\mathcal{N}=8$ gauge group. Prompted by these and other similar subtruncations recently considered, we formalise the conditions that allow any maximal supergravity to be truncated consistently to invariant subsectors thereof when the invariance group is not necessarily contained in the $\mathcal{N}=8$ gauge group.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Tomonaga-Schwinger (TS) formulation of quantum field theory to determine when state-dependent additions to the local Hamiltonian density (i.e., modifications to linear Schrodinger evolution) violate relativistic covariance. We derive new operator integrability conditions required for foliation independence, including the Frechet derivative terms that arise from state-dependence. Nonlinear modifications of quantum mechanics affect operator relations at spacelike separation, leading to violation of the integrability conditions.</description>

      <title>Topological 5d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ Gauge Theories: Mirror Symmetry and Langlands Duality of $A_\infty$-categories of Floer Homologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explain why on certain five-manifolds, topological 5d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ gauge theory of Haydys-Witten twist with gauge group $G$, is dual to that of Geyer-M\"{u}lsch twist with gauge group $^LG$, where $G$ is a real, compact Lie group with Langlands dual $^LG$. In turn, via their 2d and 3d gauged A/B-twisted Landau-Ginzburg model interpretations, we can show that (i) a Fukaya-Seidel-type $A_\infty$-1-category of an HW$_4$-instanton Floer homology of three-manifolds and (ii) a Fueter-type $A_\infty$-2-category of an HW$_3$-instanton Floer homology of two-manifolds, are dual to (i) an Orlov-type $A_\infty$-1-category of a novel $^LG_{\mathbb{H}}$-flat Floer homology of three-manifolds and (ii) a Rozansky-Witten-type $A_\infty$-2-category of a novel $^LG_{\mathbb{O}}$-flat Floer homology of two-manifolds, respectively. We also derive their Atiyah-Floer-type correspondences to symplectic categories. Our work, which demonstrates a mirror symmetry and Langlands duality of (higher) $A_\infty$-categories of Floer homologies, therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and gauge-theoretic generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Bousseau [1] and Doan-Rezchikov [2], and more.</description>

      <title>Toward a Unified de Sitter Holography: A Composite $T\bar{T}$ and $T\bar{T}+\Lambda_2$ Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In de Sitter (dS) holography, both the dS/CFT correspondence and the dS static patch holography have been extensively studied. In these two holographic frameworks, the dual field theories are defined on spacelike and timelike boundaries, respectively, where the inward motion of the holographic boundary into the bulk corresponds to the $T\bar{T}$ and $T\bar{T}+\Lambda_2$ deformations in the respective dual field theories. In this work, we develop a unified framework for these two dS holographic models by introducing a composite flow that incorporates both $T\bar{T}$ and $T\bar{T}+\Lambda_2$ deformations. We propose that this composite flow corresponds to the inward motion of a spacelike boundary from the asymptotic infinity of dS spacetime, traversing the cosmological horizon and approaching the worldline of a static observer. This proposal is supported by the computation of the quasi-local energy and the holographic entanglement entropy within the dS static spacetime and its extened geometry.</description>

      <title>Scattering of massive spin-2 field via graviton exchanges with different spin fields and the gravitational potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we compute the graviton mediated scattering amplitude of a massive spin-2 Fierz-Pauli field with various other massive spin fields, and in the non-relativistic limit, find out the corresponding two-body gravitational potentials. The massive spin-2 field does not represent gravity here. Instead, the theory of gravity is taken to be the usual massless general relativity, and the massive spin-2 field is taken as a test quantum field coupled to gravity via the standard minimal prescription. We first compute the tree level 2-2 scattering of a massive spin-2 field with massive scalar, spin-1, and spin-1/2 fields with one graviton exchanges. Leading Newton potential, as well as the subleading spin or polarisation dependent terms at ${\cal O}(G)$ have been computed. We also consider the next to the leading order (${\cal O}(G^2)$) scattering of the massive spin-2 field with a massive scalar, and demonstrate the spin independent, spherically symmetric leading part of the two body gravitational potential. The present paper could be considered as an attempt to compute the gravitational potential in the context of a higher spin field theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study planar non-topological solitons in models with nonlinear potentials that are bounded from below. These models provide consistent completion for the classical consideration at any energy scale. The properties of our solutions indicate the kinematical stability, which is unachievable in the previously studied model with negative quartic self-interaction. Remarkably, our generalization preserves restoration of the full Schr\"{o}dinger symmetry at low energies, including scale invariance (dilatation) and special conformal symmetry. Our numerical calculations and analytical approximations demonstrate that the details of non-relativistic regime are defined by the lowest nonlinear $U(1)$-invariant term.</description>

      <title>Linearized $\mathcal{N}=2$ conformal supergravity in the harmonic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the harmonic superspace approach we construct the superconformal harmonic action for $\mathcal{N}=2$ Weyl supermultiplet. The fundamental objects of the theory are unconstrained analytic potentials $h^{++\alpha\dot{\alpha}}, h^{++\alpha+}, h^{++\dot{\alpha}+}, h^{(+4)}$, which distinguishes our construction among the previously known ones. An important role is played by the ``half-analyticity'' conditions introduced in arxiv:2407.08524 [hep-th]. The structure of the harmonic linearized $\mathcal{N}=2$ Weyl action to large extent repeats the structure of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ Maxwell action, which suggests a conjecture on the possible structure of the complete nonlinear $\mathcal{N}=2$ Weyl theory action in the harmonic superspace. We also provide a detailed study of the rigid superconformal properties of the proposed action and prove its invariance in both harmonic and chiral superspaces.</description>

      <title>Comparing the elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider model to the finite volume sine-Gordon theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the spectrum of the elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider model with the finite-size spectrum of the sine-Gordon model, highlighting both their similarities and differences. Our analysis focuses on the two-particle sector in the center-of-mass frame. At the free point, we carry out an analytic comparison, while at generic couplings we employ non-perturbative numerical calculations based on the truncated Hilbert space method adapted to difference operators. To benchmark this numerical approach, we first study the trigonometric limit, where analytic results are available. We then examine in detail the non-relativistic limit, which encompasses the rational, trigonometric, hyperbolic, and elliptic Calogero-Moser-Sutherland models. Finally, we compare the Bethe-Yang momentum quantization conditions, derived from infinite-volume scattering phases, with the exact finite-volume solutions. We find that these conditions hold exactly in the rational and trigonometric cases, but acquire finite-size corrections in the hyperbolic and elliptic cases, both for the relativistic model and its non-relativistic limit, however, these corrections are different in quantum field theories and in many body systems.</description>

      <title>On the resolution of categorical symmetries in (Non-) Unitary Rational CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore several aspects of the categorical symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy (SREE) in two-dimensional Rational Conformal Field Theories (RCFTs) and express it directly in terms of the modular data of the theory. Motivated by the SymTFT construction of arXiv:2409.02806, we provide a general formula for SREE that applies to symmetric (weakly/strongly) and cloaking boundary conditions as well as for fusion rings with multiplicities. We check the formula against several explicit examples. Additionally, we study symmetry resolution for both categorical and invertible symmetries in (non-)diagonal RCFTs and comment on the subtleties that arise in these cases. Finally, we extend our analysis to diagonal non-unitary RCFTs, focusing on theories with generalized Haagerup-Izumi modular data, and find full agreement with the given formula.</description>

      <title>QFT Realization of Non-Unitary $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ WRT Invariants and Their Galois Conjugations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a field theoretic realization of the non-unitary $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev Topological Quantum Field Theory(WRT TQFT). The WRT TQFT at the principal root of unity is unitary. It is known to be realized by $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Chern-Simons theory. However, the WRT TQFT at a non-principal root of unity is non-unitary. Its field theoretic realization has remained unclear. We propose that such a non-unitary TQFT arises from the topological twist of the 3-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-0 theory constructed by joining multiple $T[\mathrm{SU}(2)]$ theories. We construct its modular matrices and identify them with those of the WRT TQFT, establishing a concrete relation between the parameters, up to a decoupled unitary TQFT.</description>

      <title>Subleading soft radiation during scattering of dressed states in QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study soft photon emission during scattering of Faddeev-Kulish charged states in QED, at leading order in perturbation theory. The charged asymptotic particles are accompanied by clouds of an infinite number of soft photons of energy less than a characteristic infrared scale $E_d$. When the corresponding ``dressing'' functions are suitably corrected to subleading order in the soft momentum expansion, as advocated in recent work by Choi and Akhoury, we show explicitly that the emission of additional radiative soft photons with energy less than $E_d$ is completely suppressed. Moreover, the dressing renders the elastic amplitudes infrared-finite, order by order in perturbation theory, regulating the infrared divergences due to virtual soft photons, at the energy scale $E_d$. Therefore, the characteristic energy scale of the soft photons in the clouds provides an effective infrared cutoff, allowing for the formulation of an infrared finite S-matrix.</description>

      <title>Generalized Three-Family Supersymmetric Pati-Salam Models from Type IIA Intersecting D6-Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing three-family chiral fermion conditions to $I_{ac}=-(3+h)$ and $I_{ac'}=h$, with positive integer $h$, we extend the landscape of three-family ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models in a broader region. Differing from the former investigation with $I_{ac}=-3$ and $I_{ac'}=0$, we do not restrict that the $a$ stack of D6-branes must be parallel to the orientifold image of the $c$-stack along one of the three two-tori. In this investigation, without the simple parallel construction, we find four new classes of supersymmetric Pati-Salam models that are allowed by the extended three generation condition with $I_{ac}=3, I_{ac'}=-6$ and $I_{ac}=-1, I_{ac'}=-2$ through the intersections of $a$- and $c/c'$-branes. Moreover, with the $SU(2)'_{L}$ gauge coupling realized from $SU(2)_{L_1}\times SU(2)_{L_2}$ symmetry breaking, the canonical normalization requirement of the gauge kinetic term provides an alternative approach that can be imposed before the renormalization group equation evolution for $SU(2)'_L$ gauge coupling. This turns out to be an effective mechanism to realize the string-scale gauge coupling relation, especially for the new supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with large $g_b/g_a$ ratio. We show that this symmetry-breaking modified renormalization group evolution can highly suppress $g_b/g_a$, and finally realizes string-scale gauge coupling relations for the extended supersymmetric Pati-Salam models as well.</description>

      <title>Towards a worldsheet theory of entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new action for entanglement entropy in the framework of the AdS$_{3}$/CFT$_{2}$ correspondence. This action is constructed directly from the entanglement entropy of the CFT$_{2}$, and we show that the Einstein equations of AdS$_{3}$ gravity can be derived from it. In the near-coincidence limit, using Riemann normal coordinates, the action reduces to a string worldsheet action in a curved background that naturally includes the symmetric spacetime metric, an antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond field, and a dilaton. The Kalb-Ramond field gives rise to a string charge density, from which we demonstrate that bit threads can be exactly reproduced. This correspondence provides a clear physical interpretation of bit threads. Exploiting this correspondence, we establish explicit relations between the emergent string worldsheet and the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surface, providing new insights into entanglement entropy. In particular, entanglement entropy can be computed from open string charge, while Bekenstein-Hawking entropy arises from closed string charge through open-closed string duality. These results suggest a unified picture in which the Susskind-Uglum conjecture, open-closed string duality, and the ER=EPR proposal emerge as equivalent manifestations of the same underlying principle. Finally, we propose a quantization of the RT surface, pointing to a possible connection with loop quantum gravity that refines Wall's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Worldline Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that two elementary worldline path integrals-the thermal partition function of the harmonic oscillator and the one-loop effective action of scalar QED in a constant field strength-exhibit a natural form of supersymmetric localization. The mechanism relies on hidden fermionic symmetries of the worldline BRST formulation, rather than on standard BRST structure or physical supersymmetry. These symmetries localize the target-space trajectory. For the harmonic oscillator this yields an alternative localization derivation of the Jacobi-Poisson formula. Moreover, after the trajectory is localized, the remaining proper-time integral exhibits an emergent zero-dimensional supersymmetry generated by modular invariance, allowing the modulus T itself to be localized. For scalar QED the same structure provides a controlled computation of both the real and imaginary parts of the Euler-Heisenberg effective action. In particular, the imaginary part arises from a moduli space of circular worldline instantons, offering a localization perspective on the semiclassical exactness of the Schwinger pair-production result observed by Affleck-Alvarez-Manton.</description>

      <title>Automorphism in Gauge Theories: Higher Symmetries and Transversal Non-Clifford Logical Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories are important descriptions for many physical phenomena and systems in quantum computation. Automorphism of gauge group naturally gives global symmetries of gauge theories. In this work we study such symmetries in gauge theories induced by automorphisms of the gauge group, when the gauge theories have nontrivial topological actions in different spacetime dimensions. We discover the automorphism symmetry can be extended, become a higher group symmetry, and/or become a non-invertible symmetry. We illustrate the discussion with various models in field theory and on the lattice. In particular, we use automorphism symmetry to construct new transversal non-Clifford logical gates in topological quantum codes. In particular, we show that 2+1d $\mathbb{Z}_N$ qudit Clifford stabilizer models can implement non-Clifford transversal logical gate in the 4th level $\mathbb{Z}_N$ qudit Clifford hierarchy for $N\geq 3$, extending the generalized Bravyi-K\"onig bound proposed in the companion paper [arXiv:2511.02900] for qubits.</description>

      <title>DESI-Like Hubble Expansion From Staged Symmetry Breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) second data release shows a moderate preference for dark energy with a time-varying equation of state parameter, suggesting that the standard $\Lambda$CDM model may need to be revised. In particular, DESI favors dark energy whose equation of state parameter can drop below $-1$, violating the null energy condition. Chen and Loeb have recently suggested that this violation may be avoided if a subcomponent of the dark matter possesses a time-dependent equation of state. In this work, we present a renormalizable realization of that idea, which can be regarded as a more natural effective field theory. We show that such a construction not only yields dark matter with a time-varying equation of state parameter, but also naturally produces a self-interacting dark matter candidate with a velocity-dependent cross section as a consequence of gauge invariance. The second feature is relevant for addressing tensions between $\Lambda$CDM and observations of small-scale structure, particularly the diversity of galactic rotation curves. Even if further study ultimately finds our fiducial model to be disfavored, this work is valuable for constraining the space of renormalizable, natural models that have the potential to realize the behavior desired by Chen and Loeb.</description>

      <title>Friedmann equations from GUP-modified equipartition law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, combining the thermodynamical arguments of the horizon with the quadratic generalised uncertainty principle (GUP), we heuristically obtain the modified equipartition law of energy. Employing this modified equipartition law of energy, we derive the Friedmann equations in Verlinde's entropic gravity. We find a maximum energy density at the beginning of the Universe. Remarkably, this feature emerges not only for positive GUP parameter but also for negative GUP parameter. From the initial acceleration, we deduce that the negative GUP parameter is more preferable. We also obtain maximum Hubble parameter from the first Friedmann equation, indicating a universe without initial singularity. Moreover, we compute the Kretschmann curvature scalar, again indicating a non-singular universe. Interestingly, we find that GUP-modified Friedmann equations share some similarities with braneworld cosmolgy where the quadratic term in energy density appears. We also compute the deceleration parameter. Finally, we revisit the gravitational baryogenesis and show that the GUP-modified equipartition law of energy provides a mechanism for generating baryon asymmetry. Moreover, we constrain the GUP parameter from observations.</description>

      <title>Effects of New Forces on Scalar Dark Matter Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New long range forces acting on ordinary matter are highly constrained. However it is possible such forces act on dark matter, as it is less constrained observationally. In this work, we consider dark matter to be made of light bosons, such as axions. We introduce a mediator that communicates a new force between dark matter particles, in addition to gravity. The mediator is taken to be light, but not massless, so that it can affect small scale galactic behavior, but not current cosmological behavior. As a concrete application of this idea, we analyze the effects on scalar dark matter solitons bound by gravitation, i.e., boson stars, which have been claimed to potentially provide cores of galaxies. We numerically determine the soliton's profiles in the presence of this new force. We also extend the analysis to multiple mediators. We show that this new force alters the relation between core density and core radius in a way that can provide improvement in fitting data to observed galactic cores, but for couplings of order the gravitational strength, the improvement is only modest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates neutrino propagation in the spacetime of a newly introduced black hole arising from spontaneous Lorentz-symmetry breaking in bumblebee gravity. The analysis focuses on three independent components: the rate at which neutrino-antineutrino annihilation deposits energy in the surrounding region, the geometric contribution to the phase accumulated by neutrino mass eigenstates, and the modifications to flavor conversion produced by weak gravitational lensing. Working with a two-flavor system, both mass orderings are examined, and the calculation incorporates the interference between distinct trajectories reaching the detector. The numerical results show that the Lorentz-violating deformation substantially increases the efficiency of the annihilation channel, produces characteristic shifts in the oscillation phase not present in earlier bumblebee configurations, and reshapes the angular dependence of the lensing-induced flavor transition pattern.</description>

      <title>High-frequency Gravitational Waves from Superstring Phases in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When moduli roll in the early universe, all physical scales - including string tensions - simultaneously evolve. The dynamics of cosmic string loops with time-varying tension can produce cosmic string loop trackers in which most of the energy density of the universe lies in the form of string loops. This solution can exist as an attractor until the rolling modulus reaches its minimum, when the loops ultimately decay through gravitational wave emission. We explore the spectrum of gravitational waves produced by such string loop trackers. The resulting spectrum is high-frequency and peaks in the GHz regime today. The amplitude of the signal is diluted by any subsequent matter-dominated epochs, and thus the potential observability of the signal crucially depends on the duration of the moduli-dominated epoch that follows once the moduli settle down and oscillate about their minimum.</description>

      <title>$c=-2$ conformal field theory in quadratic band touching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadratic band touching in fermionic systems defines a universality class distinct from that of linear Dirac points, yet its characterization as a quantum critical point remains incomplete. In this work, I show that a $(d+1)$-dimensional free-fermion model with quadratic band touching exhibits spatial conformal invariance, and that its equal-time ground-state correlation functions are exactly captured by the $d$-dimensional symplectic fermion theory. I establish this correspondence by constructing explicit mappings between physical fermionic operators and the fields of the symplectic fermion theory. I further explore the implications of this correspondence in two spatial dimensions, where the symplectic fermion theory is a logarithmic conformal field theory with central charge $c=-2$. In the corresponding $(2+1)$-dimensional systems, I identify anyonic excitations originating from the underlying symplectic fermion theory, even though the Hamiltonian is gapless. Transporting these excitations along non-contractible loops generates transitions among topologically degenerate ground states, in close analogy with those in topologically ordered phases. Moreover, the action of a $2\pi$ rotation on these excitations is represented by a Jordan block, reflecting the logarithmic character of the associated conformal field theory.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a non-separable subset of $k$-essence in which the kinetic and potential sectors interact through an $X^{\rho}V(\phi)$ coupling, implemented via a potential-dependent prefactor $f(\phi)=1+2\mathcal{K}V$. In slow roll, this structure preserves a constant sound speed $c_s^2=1/(2\rho-1)$ while modifying the Hubble flow in a controlled way, thereby shifting the inflationary observables relative to the separable template. For monomial potentials $V=A\phi^n$ (with $n=2$ and $n=2/3$ as representative cases) we derive closed analytic expressions for $n_s(N_\ast)$ and $r(N_\ast)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon_{\rm mix}^2)$, where $\epsilon_{\rm mix}\propto\mathcal{K}$ encodes the non-separable $X^\rho V$ mixing, and we validate them against exact background integrations. The analytic and numerical predictions agree at the sub-per-mille level for $n_s$ and at the percent level for $r$, confirming the accuracy of the small-mixing expansion. For $\mathcal{K}&lt;0$ the mixing systematically lowers both $n_s$ and $r$ at fixed $N_\ast$, allowing otherwise marginal monomials to fall within the region favored by recent ACT+{\it Planck}+BAO constraints (P--ACT--LB). All solutions shown satisfy the health conditions $f(\phi)&gt;0$, $\rho&gt;\tfrac12$, and the positivity bound $V&lt;1/(2|\mathcal K|)$ (from $f&gt;0$). We also discuss parameter dependence and the expected equilateral-type non-Gaussianity, which remains comfortably within current bounds for the benchmarks considered.</description>

      <title>Strained hyperbolic Dirac fermions: Zero modes, flat bands, and competing orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the nearest-neighbor tight-binding model on {10,3} and {14,3} hyperbolic lattices that, for a uniform hopping amplitude, gives rise to emergent Dirac fermions on a curved space with a constant negative curvature, displaying a vanishing density of states, we propose spatially modulated hopping pattern therein that preserve the underlying 5- and 7-fold rotational symmetries, respectively, and effectively couples fermions to time-reversal symmetric axial magnetic fields. Such strain-induced axial fields produce a flat band near zero-energy, triggering nucleation of a charge density-wave, featuring a staggered pattern of fermionic density between two sublattices, and the Haldane phase fostering intra-sublattice circulating currents with a net zero magnetic flux for weak nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. Sufficiently weak on-site Hubbard repulsion destabilizes such flat bands toward the formation of a magnetic phase that simultaneously supports antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic orders in the whole system. While the magnetization in the bulk and boundary cancel each other, the Ne\'el order is of the same sign everywhere, thereby yielding a global antiferromagnet. Throughout, we draw parallels between these findings and the well-studied qualitatively similar results on a 3-fold rotational symmetric strained honeycomb lattice, thereby unifying the phenomenon of axial magnetic catalysis for Dirac fermions, encompassing the ones living on the Euclidean plane. Finally, we show that with a specific class of non-Hermiticity, manifesting via an imbalance in the hopping amplitudes between two sublattices in the opposite directions, magnitudes of all these orders can be boosted substantially when all the eigenvalues in the noninteracting systems are real, staging a non-Hermitian amplification of axial magnetic catalysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider type IIB string theory with $N$ D3 branes and various configurations of sevenbranes, such that the string coupling $g_s$ is fixed to a constant finite value. These are the simplest realizations of F-theory, and are holographically dual to rank $N$ Argyres-Douglas conformal field theories (CFTs) with $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ flavor groups, and Minahan-Nemeschansky CFTs with $E_6, E_7$ and $E_8$ flavor groups. We use the Seiberg-Witten curves of these theories to compute the mass deformed sphere free energy $F(m)$ at large $N$ in terms of novel matrix models with non-polynomial potentials. We show how $F(m)$ can be used along with the analytic bootstrap to fix the large $N$ expansion of flavor multiplet correlators in these CFTs, which are dual to scattering of gluons on $AdS_5\times S^3$, and in the flat space limit determine the effective theory of sevenbranes in F-theory. As a first step in this program, we use the matrix models to compute the $\log N$ term in $F(m)$ and thereby fix the logarithmic threshold in the $AdS_5\times S^3$ holographic correlator, which matches the flat space prediction.</description>

      <title>A geometric phase approach to quark confinement from stochastic gauge-geometry flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15986v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply a stochastic version of the geometric (Ricci) flow, complemented with the stochastic flow of the gauge Yang--Mills sector, in order to seed the chromo-magnetic and chromo-electric vortices that source the area-law for QCD confinement. The area-law is the key signature of quark confinement in Yang--Mills gauge theories with a non-trivial center symmetry. In particular, chromo-magnetic vortices enclosed within the chromo-electric Wilson loops instantiate the area-law asymptotic behaviour of the Wilson loop vacuum expectation values. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow is responsible for the topology changes that induce the appearance of the vortices. When vortices vanish, due to topology changes in the manifolds associated to the hadronic ground states, the evaluation of the Wilson loop yields a dependence on the length of the path, hence reproducing the perimeter law of the hadronic (Higgs) phase of real QCD. Confinement, instead, is naturally achieved within this context as a by-product of the topology change of the manifold over which the dynamics of the Yang--Mills fields is defined. It is then provided by the Aharonov--Bohm effect induced by the concatenation of the compact chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic fluxes originated by the topology changes. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow naturally accomplishes a treatment of the emergence of the vortices and the generation of turbulence effects. Braiding and knotting, resulting from topology changes, namely stochastic fluctuations, stabilize the chromo-magnetic vortices. Finally, we observe that dimensional transmutation for the Yang-Mills fields can be derived from the scaling property of the geometric part of the stochastic flow. Specifically, a relation that involves the infrared equilibrium limit of the Planck constant can be derived that yields the correct order of magnitude for $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of information scrambling and decoherence in the integrable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growth of information scrambling, captured by out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs), is a central indicator of the nature of many-body quantum dynamics. Here, we compute analytically the complete time dependence of the OTOC for an integrable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, $N$ Majoranas with random two-body interactions of infinite range, coupled to a Markovian bath at finite temperature. In the limit of no coupling to the bath, the time evolution of scrambling experiences different stages. For $t \lesssim \sqrt{N}$, after an initial polynomial growth, the OTOC approaches saturation in a power-law fashion with oscillations superimposed. At $t \sim \sqrt{N}$, the OTOC reverses trend and starts to decrease linearly in time. The reason for this linear decrease is that, despite being a subleading $1/N$ effect, the OTOC in this region is governed by the spectral form factor of the antisymmetric couplings of the SYK model. The linear decrease stops at $t \sim 2N$, the Heisenberg time, where saturation occurs. The effect of the environment is an overall exponential decay of the OTOC for times longer than the inverse of the coupling strength to the bath. The oscillations at $t \lesssim \sqrt{N}$ indicate lack of thermalization -- a desired feature for a better performance of quantum information devices.</description>

      <title>Sakai-Sugimoto Model in an Off-Shell: Chiral Lagrangian to All Orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sakai-Sugimoto holographic model is famous for implementing the approximate chiral symmetry of QCD and reproducing the Chiral Lagrangian in a top-down approach. In this manuscript, we revisit the model in a formalism that is somewhat different from the original work by Sakai and Sugimoto: We start by identifying boundary degrees of freedom and splitting the bulk equations of motion into dynamical ones and constraints. The former are then solved to all orders in derivatives of the boundary fields. The constraints are left unsolved, leaving the dynamical degrees of freedom off-shell. This approach enables us to systematically derive the effective action of the boundary theory. The derived effective action is very rich in physics: it contains an $U(N_f)$ multiplet of massless pseudoscalars interacting (via trilinear and higher terms) with towers of massive (axial-)vector mesons. In contrast to the previous studies, our effective action is non-local. The original Chiral Lagrangian is recovered as its local expansion in small $\pi$-meson momenta (derivative expansion). We particularly zoom in on the values of four derivative terms couplings, the low energy constants, and compare those with the ones reported in the literature.</description>

Abstract: We construct a consistent three-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory as a vector-tensor theory within the generalized Proca class by employing a regularization procedure based on the Weyl geometry, which was introduced recently in \link{2504.13084}. We then obtain an asymptotically AdS$_3$, static, and circularly symmetric black hole solution with primary Proca hair. Afterward, we investigate the effect of the scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonnet coupling constructed previously by different regularization schemes. We further generalize these solutions by incorporating an electric charge. As special cases, we find a regular black hole solution in addition to charged and uncharged stealth BTZ black hole solutions.</description>

Abstract: We analyze an alternative prescription for computing tree level scattering amplitudes in the pure spinor superstring. Proposed by Berkovits, and inspired by an earlier work by Lee and Siegel, it bypasses the traditional ghost number three measure of the pure spinor ghosts, $\langle\lambda^3 \theta^5\rangle$=1, arguably simplifying the calculation. However, direct computations using the free field OPEs of the target superspace CFT fail to reproduce the expected $\textrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ invariance of tree level correlators. This persistent mismatch, confirmed through independent methods, is not compatible with the gauge invariance of the amplitude. We also discuss possible implications for the B-RNS-GSS formalism of the superstring.</description>

Abstract: We study the inverse problem of holographic entanglement entropy in AdS$_3$ using a data-driven generative model. Training data consist of randomly generated geometries and their holographic entanglement entropies using the Ryu--Takayanagi formula. After training, the Transformer reconstructs the blackening function within our metric ansatz from previously unseen inputs. The Transformer achieves accurate reconstructions on smooth black hole geometries and extrapolates to horizonless backgrounds. We describe the architecture and data generation process, and we quantify accuracy on both $f(z)$ and the reconstructed $S(\ell)$.

Abstract: We clarify the status of gauge-invariant entire-function regulators in NonLocal Quantum Field Theory. The regulator is implemented as an entire function of the covariant Laplace--Beltrami operator. Working in the background-field formalism and expanding around flat, trivial backgrounds, we show that plane waves diagonalize the d'Alembertian, so that the entire function reduces to a multiplicative form factor in Minkowski momentum space. After Wick rotation, to the Euclidean axis, producing exponential ultraviolet damping in loop integrals without introducing additional poles or branch cuts. Our analysis provides a concise, gauge-covariant justification for the use of entire-function regulators in nonlocal quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2006.02761v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the differential and Riemannian geometry of algebras $A$ endowed with an action of a triangular Hopf algebra $H$ and noncommutativity compatible with the associated braiding. The modules of one forms and of braided derivations are modules in a compact closed category of $H$-equivariant $A$-bimodules, whose internal morphisms correspond to tensor fields. Vector fields and forms approaches to curvature and torsion are proven to be equivalent by extending the Cartan calculus to left (right) $A$-module (not necessarily $A$-bimodule) connections. The Cartan structure equations and the Bianchi identities are derived. Existence and uniqueness of the Levi-Civita connection for arbitrary pseudo-Riemannian metrics is proven via a Koszul formula. The general theory includes Drinfeld twists of commutative geometries and also cotriangular Hopf algebras. It is illustrated with the example of the tensor square of Sweedler Hopf algebra which becomes a noncommutative Einstein manifold via a non-central metric.</description>

Abstract: M{\o}ller maps are identifications between the observables of a perturbatively interacting physical system and the observables of its underlying free (i.e. non-interacting) system. This work studies and characterizes obstructions to the existence of such identifications. The main results are existence and importantly also non-existence theorems, which in particular imply that M{\o}ller maps do not exist for non-Abelian Chern-Simons and Yang-Mills theories on globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds. These results are obtained through homological algebra techniques which are of independent interest in the analysis of classical field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores modifications to General Relativity (GR) by considering higher-order curvature terms in the gravitational action, specifically focusing on the quadratic Ricci scalar and a particular cubic contraction of the Riemann tensor. These modifications introduce new interactions at short distances, potentially altering the dynamics of compact objects. We calculate the effective two-body binding potential energy for these modified theories to quantify these effects using the worldline effective field theory (WEFT) formalism. This approach allows us to systematically integrate out short-distance gravitational effects, capturing the modifications to the binding potential. Our results demonstrate how the quadratic Ricci scalar and cubic Riemann tensor terms contribute to the two-body interaction at the leading order, highlighting deviations from classical GR predictions. These findings offer insight into the potential observational signatures of modified gravity theories in binary systems and other astrophysical settings.</description>

      <title>Leading bounds on micro- to picometer fifth forces from neutron star cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equivalence principle and the inverse-square law of gravity could be violated at short distances ($10^{-6}$ to $10^{-12}$ meters) by scalars sporting a coupling $g_N$ to nucleons and mass $\mathrm{eV}\lesssim m_\phi\lesssim\rm MeV$. We show for the first time that stringent bounds on the existence of these scalars can be derived from the observed cooling of nearby isolated neutron stars (NSs). Although NSs can only be used to set limits comparable to the classic SN 1987A cooling bound in the case of pseudoscalars such as the QCD axion, the shallow temperature dependence of the scalar emissivity results in a huge enhancement in the effect of $\phi$ on the cooling of cold NSs. As we do not find evidence of exotic energy losses, we can exclude couplings down to $g_N\lesssim 5 \times 10^{-14}$. Our new bound supersedes all existing limits on scalars across six orders of magnitude in $m_\phi$. These conclusions also extend to Higgs-portal models, for which the bound on the scalar-Higgs mixing angle is $\sin\theta\lesssim 6\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Creating a Universe from Nothing as an Alternative to the Cosmological Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the cosmological Robertson-Walker geometry required of the cosmological principle both the Weyl tensor $C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ and the Bach tensor $W^{\mu\nu}=[2\nabla_{\kappa}\nabla_{\lambda}-R_{\lambda\kappa}]C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ vanish. In general, in perturbations around the cosmological background neither of the fluctuating $\delta C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ or $\delta W^{\mu\nu}$ would vanish. However, it is possible for $\delta W^{\mu\nu}$ to vanish even as $\delta C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ does not. In this paper we construct an explicit model in which this is the case. The model consists of a 3-tensor gravitational wave
  fluctuating around a background with a constant negative 3-curvature. The model is exactly solvable and consists purely of geometric quantities with no matter fields at all (i.e., $G^{\mu\nu}=0$, $\delta G^{\mu\nu}=0$, $W^{\mu\nu}=0$, $\delta W^{\mu\nu}=0$, where $G^{\mu\nu}$ is the Einstein tensor). The model can thus be created out of nothing, with creating a universe from nothing thus being an alternative principle to the cosmological principle. The fluctuating gravitational wave contributes to the temperature anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background and its $B$ mode polarization in a calculable manner, one for which we provide a simple analytic way of treating spatial modes that is based on the use of a spatial mode addition theorem. In addition, we provide a treatment of the anisotropy that is based on properties of bandwidth limited functions. Classically by ``nothing" we mean that there are no $T^{\mu\nu}$ or $\delta T^{\mu\nu}$ matter field terms. Quantum-mechanically by ``nothing" we mean that all fields other than the gravitational field are in a negative energy mode vacuum state, with the only occupied positive energy modes being graviton modes. As well as use the Bach tensor as a diagnostic, we consider dynamics based on it.</description>

      <title>Heat propagation in rotating relativistic bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate heat propagation in rigidly rotating bodies within the theory of general relativity. Using a first-order gradient expansion, we derive a universal partial differential equation governing the temperature evolution. This equation is hyperbolic, causal, and stable, and it naturally accounts for both rotational and gravitational Tolman-Ehrenfest effects. Any other first-order theory consistent with established physics (including the parabolic theories used in neutron star cooling models) must be equivalent to our formulation within an error that is of higher order in gradients. As a case study, we analyze heat transfer in solid cylinders rotating around their symmetry axis, so that the tangential speed approaches the speed of light on the surface. We also compute the relativistic rotational corrections to the cooling law of black bodies.</description>

      <title>Probing the Critical Point (CritPt) of AI Reasoning: a Frontier Physics Research Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26574v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt (Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced "critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular &amp; optical physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics. CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to 190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research. Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best average accuracy among base models is only 5.7%, achieved by GPT-5 (high), moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically grounded AI tools.</description>

      <title>Mass and Decay-Constant Evolution of Heavy Quarkonia and $B_c$ States from Thermal QCD Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the thermal behavior of heavy vector and axial-vector mesons ($J/\psi$, $\Upsilon$, and $B_c$) within the finite-temperature QCD sum-rule framework. Using updated PDG-2024 quark masses, modern lattice-informed gluon condensates, and a temperature-dependent continuum threshold constrained by vacuum stability, we compute the evolution of the masses $m(T)$ and decay constants $f(T)$ up to $T/T_c \lesssim 0.9$. At $T=0$ the sum rules are calibrated to reproduce the experimental and LHCb masses and reference decay constants within the expected $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ accuracy of a leading-order $+$ $D{=}4$ analysis, and we interpret the subsequent finite-temperature evolution as a genuine prediction of the framework.
  Near the critical temperature, the relative suppression follows a clear hierarchy $\Upsilon &lt; J/\psi &lt; B_c$, consistent with their binding energies and lattice spectral trends. The predicted $1P$--$1S$ splitting for the $B_c$ system, $0.477~\mathrm{GeV}$, matches the LHCb observation of orbitally excited $B_c^{+}$ states. The results provide a coherent finite-temperature baseline for future extensions including radiative, higher-dimensional, and width effects.</description>

      <title>Morphology of Inflationary Gravitational Wave Spectra imprinted by a Sequence of Post-Inflationary Epochs $via$ ${\rm GWInSpect}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The expansion history of the Universe prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) remains largely unconstrained. The high-energy post-inflationary era may involve multiple distinct epochs, each characterized by a different equation of state (EoS). A key prediction of inflation is the generation of tensor perturbations that later manifest as a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The large-scale amplitude and small-scale spectral tilt ($n_{\rm GW}$) of these GWs encode the inflationary energy scale and the subsequent expansion history, respectively. A soft post-inflationary EoS ($w&lt;1/3$) yields red-tilted GW spectra ($n_{\rm GW}&lt;0$), while a stiff EoS ($w&gt;1/3$) results in a blue-tilt ($n_{\rm GW}&gt;0$). In our previous work [arXiv:2407.07956], we developed an analytical framework for computing the GW spectral energy density, $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)$, for multiple post-inflationary transitions ($w_1 \to w_2 \to \cdots \to w_n \to 1/3$), focusing on the parameter space relevant for future GW observations. In this paper, we extend that framework to systematically investigate the $morphological~diversity$ of inflationary GW spectra generated by multi-epoch post-inflationary histories. Remaining model agnostic, we demonstrate that a wide variety of spectral shapes, ranging from convex and concave monotonic profiles to multi-peaked non-monotonic spectra, can naturally emerge depending on the sequence and duration of these epochs. We also introduce GWInSpect, a publicly available Python package that computes $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)$ for arbitrary sequences of EoS transitions, providing a practical tool to study the pre-BBN expansion history of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Chiral Anomaly of Kogut-Susskind Fermion in (3+1)-dimensional Hamiltonian formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Kogut-Susskind fermions (also known as staggered fermions) in a $(3+1)$-dimensional Hamiltonian formalism and examine a chiral transformation and its associated chiral anomaly. The Hamiltonian of the massless Kogut-Susskind fermion has symmetry under the shift transformations in each space direction $S_k \, (k=1,2,3)$, and the product of the three shift transformations in particular (the odd shifts in general) may be regarded as a unitary discrete chiral transformation, modulo two-site translations. The hermitian part of the transformation kernel $\Gamma = i S_1 S_2 S_3$ can define an axial charge as $Q_A = (1/2)\sum_x \chi^\dagger(x) \left(\Gamma+\Gamma^\dagger \right)\chi(x)$, which is non-onsite, nonquantized, and commutative with the vector charge, analogous to $\tilde{Q}_A = (1/2) \sum_n ( \chi^\dagger_n \chi_{n+1} + \chi^\dagger_{n+1} \chi_{n} )$ for the $(1+1)$ dimensional Kogut-Susskind fermion. However, our $Q_A$ cannot be expressed in terms of any quantized charges in a generalized Onsager algebra. Although $Q_A$ does not commute with the fermion Hamiltonian in general when coupled to background link gauge fields, we show that they become commutative for a class of $U(1)$ link configurations carrying nontrivial magnetic and electric fields. We then verify numerically that the vacuum expectation value of $Q_A$ satisfies the anomalous conservation law of axial charge in the continuum two-flavor theory under an adiabatic evolution of the link gauge field.</description>
