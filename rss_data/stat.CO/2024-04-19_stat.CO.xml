      <title>Debiased Distribution Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern compression methods can summarize a target distribution $\mathbb{P}$ more succinctly than i.i.d. sampling but require access to a low-bias input sequence like a Markov chain converging quickly to $\mathbb{P}$. We introduce a new suite of compression methods suitable for compression with biased input sequences. Given $n$ points targeting the wrong distribution and quadratic time, Stein Kernel Thinning (SKT) returns $\sqrt{n}$ equal-weighted points with $\widetilde{O}(n^{-1/2})$ maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to $\mathbb {P}$. For larger-scale compression tasks, Low-rank SKT achieves the same feat in sub-quadratic time using an adaptive low-rank debiasing procedure that may be of independent interest. For downstream tasks that support simplex or constant-preserving weights, Stein Recombination and Stein Cholesky achieve even greater parsimony, matching the guarantees of SKT with as few as $\operatorname{poly-log}(n)$ weighted points. Underlying these advances are new guarantees for the quality of simplex-weighted coresets, the spectral decay of kernel matrices, and the covering numbers of Stein kernel Hilbert spaces. In our experiments, our techniques provide succinct and accurate posterior summaries while overcoming biases due to burn-in, approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo, and tempering.</description>

      <title>R-VGAL: A Sequential Variational Bayes Algorithm for Generalised Linear Mixed Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models with random effects, such as generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs), are often used for analysing clustered data. Parameter inference with these models is difficult because of the presence of cluster-specific random effects, which must be integrated out when evaluating the likelihood function. Here, we propose a sequential variational Bayes algorithm, called Recursive Variational Gaussian Approximation for Latent variable models (R-VGAL), for estimating parameters in GLMMs. The R-VGAL algorithm operates on the data sequentially, requires only a single pass through the data, and can provide parameter updates as new data are collected without the need of re-processing the previous data. At each update, the R-VGAL algorithm requires the gradient and Hessian of a "partial" log-likelihood function evaluated at the new observation, which are generally not available in closed form for GLMMs. To circumvent this issue, we propose using an importance-sampling-based approach for estimating the gradient and Hessian via Fisher's and Louis' identities. We find that R-VGAL can be unstable when traversing the first few data points, but that this issue can be mitigated by using a variant of variational tempering in the initial steps of the algorithm. Through illustrations on both simulated and real datasets, we show that R-VGAL provides good approximations to the exact posterior distributions, that it can be made robust through tempering, and that it is computationally efficient.</description>

      <title>Composite likelihood inference for the Poisson log-normal model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inferring parameters of a latent variable model can be a daunting task when the conditional distribution of the latent variables given the observed ones is intractable. Variational approaches prove to be computationally efficient but, possibly, lack theoretical guarantees on the estimates, while sampling based solutions are quite the opposite. Starting from already available variational approximations, we define a first Monte Carlo EM algorithm to obtain maximum likelihood estimators, focusing on the Poisson log-normal model which provides a generic framework for the analysis of multivariate count data. We then extend this algorithm to the case of a composite likelihood in order to be able to handle higher dimensional count data.</description>

      <title>DimVis: Interpreting Visual Clusters in Dimensionality Reduction With Explainable Boosting Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) techniques such as t-SNE and UMAP are popular for transforming complex datasets into simpler visual representations. However, while effective in uncovering general dataset patterns, these methods may introduce artifacts and suffer from interpretability issues. This paper presents DimVis, a visualization tool that employs supervised Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) models (trained on user-selected data of interest) as an interpretation assistant for DR projections. Our tool facilitates high-dimensional data analysis by providing an interpretation of feature relevance in visual clusters through interactive exploration of UMAP projections. Specifically, DimVis uses a contrastive EBM model that is trained in real time to differentiate between the data inside and outside a cluster of interest. Taking advantage of the inherent explainable nature of the EBM, we then use this model to interpret the cluster itself via single and pairwise feature comparisons in a ranking based on the EBM model's feature importance. The applicability and effectiveness of DimVis are demonstrated via a use case and a usage scenario with real-world data. We also discuss the limitations and potential directions for future research.</description>
