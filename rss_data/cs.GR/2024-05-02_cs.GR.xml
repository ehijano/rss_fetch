      <title>GPU-friendly Stroke Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector graphics includes both filled and stroked paths as the main primitives. While there are many techniques for rendering filled paths on GPU, stroked paths have proved more elusive. This paper presents a technique for performing stroke expansion, namely the generation of the outline representing the stroke of the given input path. Stroke expansion is a global problem, with challenging constraints on continuity and correctness. Nonetheless, we implement it using a fully parallel algorithm suitable for execution in a GPU compute shader, with minimal preprocessing. The output of our method can be either line or circular arc segments, both of which are well suited to GPU rendering, and the number of segments is minimal. We introduce several novel techniques, including an encoding of vector graphics primitives suitable for parallel processing, and an Euler spiral based method for computing approximations to parallel curves and evolutes.</description>

      <title>TexSliders: Diffusion-Based Texture Editing in CLIP Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models have enabled intuitive image creation and manipulation using natural language. In particular, diffusion models have recently shown remarkable results for natural image editing. In this work, we propose to apply diffusion techniques to edit textures, a specific class of images that are an essential part of 3D content creation pipelines. We analyze existing editing methods and show that they are not directly applicable to textures, since their common underlying approach, manipulating attention maps, is unsuitable for the texture domain. To address this, we propose a novel approach that instead manipulates CLIP image embeddings to condition the diffusion generation. We define editing directions using simple text prompts (e.g., "aged wood" to "new wood") and map these to CLIP image embedding space using a texture prior, with a sampling-based approach that gives us identity-preserving directions in CLIP space. To further improve identity preservation, we project these directions to a CLIP subspace that minimizes identity variations resulting from entangled texture attributes. Our editing pipeline facilitates the creation of arbitrary sliders using natural language prompts only, with no ground-truth annotated data necessary.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Compressed Sensing for Spectral Light Field Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a compressive multi-spectral light field camera model that utilizes a one-hot spectralcoded mask and a microlens array to capture spatial, angular, and spectral information using a single monochrome sensor. We propose a model that employs compressed sensing techniques to reconstruct the complete multi-spectral light field from undersampled measurements. Unlike previous work where a light field is vectorized to a 1D signal, our method employs a 5D basis and a novel 5D measurement model, hence, matching the intrinsic dimensionality of multispectral light fields. We mathematically and empirically show the equivalence of 5D and 1D sensing models, and most importantly that the 5D framework achieves orders of magnitude faster reconstruction while requiring a small fraction of the memory. Moreover, our new multidimensional sensing model opens new research directions for designing efficient visual data acquisition algorithms and hardware.</description>

      <title>Implicit Swept Volume SDF: Enabling Continuous Collision-Free Trajectory Generation for Arbitrary Shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of trajectory generation for objects, ensuring continuous collision-free motion remains a huge challenge, especially for non-convex geometries and complex environments. Previous methods either oversimplify object shapes, which results in a sacrifice of feasible space or rely on discrete sampling, which suffers from the "tunnel effect". To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical trajectory generation pipeline, which utilizes the Swept Volume Signed Distance Field (SVSDF) to guide trajectory optimization for Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA). Our interdisciplinary approach, blending techniques from graphics and robotics, exhibits outstanding effectiveness in solving this problem. We formulate the computation of the SVSDF as a Generalized Semi-Infinite Programming model, and we solve for the numerical solutions at query points implicitly, thereby eliminating the need for explicit reconstruction of the surface. Our algorithm has been validated in a variety of complex scenarios and applies to robots of various dynamics, including both rigid and deformable shapes. It demonstrates exceptional universality and superior CCA performance compared to typical algorithms. The code will be released at https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/Implicit-SVSDF-Planner for the benefit of the community.</description>

      <title>RGB$\leftrightarrow$X: Image decomposition and synthesis using material- and lighting-aware diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The three areas of realistic forward rendering, per-pixel inverse rendering, and generative image synthesis may seem like separate and unrelated sub-fields of graphics and vision. However, recent work has demonstrated improved estimation of per-pixel intrinsic channels (albedo, roughness, metallicity) based on a diffusion architecture; we call this the RGB$\rightarrow$X problem. We further show that the reverse problem of synthesizing realistic images given intrinsic channels, X$\rightarrow$RGB, can also be addressed in a diffusion framework.
  Focusing on the image domain of interior scenes, we introduce an improved diffusion model for RGB$\rightarrow$X, which also estimates lighting, as well as the first diffusion X$\rightarrow$RGB model capable of synthesizing realistic images from (full or partial) intrinsic channels. Our X$\rightarrow$RGB model explores a middle ground between traditional rendering and generative models: we can specify only certain appearance properties that should be followed, and give freedom to the model to hallucinate a plausible version of the rest.
  This flexibility makes it possible to use a mix of heterogeneous training datasets, which differ in the available channels. We use multiple existing datasets and extend them with our own synthetic and real data, resulting in a model capable of extracting scene properties better than previous work and of generating highly realistic images of interior scenes.</description>

      <title>DressCode: Autoregressively Sewing and Generating Garments from Text Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Apparel's significant role in human appearance underscores the importance of garment digitalization for digital human creation. Recent advances in 3D content creation are pivotal for digital human creation. Nonetheless, garment generation from text guidance is still nascent. We introduce a text-driven 3D garment generation framework, DressCode, which aims to democratize design for novices and offer immense potential in fashion design, virtual try-on, and digital human creation. We first introduce SewingGPT, a GPT-based architecture integrating cross-attention with text-conditioned embedding to generate sewing patterns with text guidance. We then tailor a pre-trained Stable Diffusion to generate tile-based Physically-based Rendering (PBR) textures for the garments. By leveraging a large language model, our framework generates CG-friendly garments through natural language interaction. It also facilitates pattern completion and texture editing, streamlining the design process through user-friendly interaction. This framework fosters innovation by allowing creators to freely experiment with designs and incorporate unique elements into their work. With comprehensive evaluations and comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods, our method showcases superior quality and alignment with input prompts. User studies further validate our high-quality rendering results, highlighting its practical utility and potential in production settings.

      <title>NeRF as a Non-Distant Environment Emitter in Physics-based Inverse Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-based inverse rendering enables joint optimization of shape, material, and lighting based on captured 2D images. To ensure accurate reconstruction, using a light model that closely resembles the captured environment is essential. Although the widely adopted distant environmental lighting model is adequate in many cases, we demonstrate that its inability to capture spatially varying illumination can lead to inaccurate reconstructions in many real-world inverse rendering scenarios. To address this limitation, we incorporate NeRF as a non-distant environment emitter into the inverse rendering pipeline. Additionally, we introduce an emitter importance sampling technique for NeRF to reduce the rendering variance. Through comparisons on both real and synthetic datasets, our results demonstrate that our NeRF-based emitter offers a more precise representation of scene lighting, thereby improving the accuracy of inverse rendering.</description>

      <title>Holographic Phase Retrieval via Wirtinger Flow: Cartesian Form with Auxiliary Amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new gradient method for holography, where a phase-only hologram is parameterized by not only the phase but also amplitude. The key idea of our approach is the formulation of a phase-only hologram using an auxiliary amplitude. We optimize the parameters using the so-called Wirtinger flow algorithm in the Cartesian domain, which is a gradient method defined on the basis of the Wirtinger calculus. At the early stage of optimization, each element of the hologram exists inside a complex circle, and it can take a large gradient while diverging from the origin. This characteristic contributes to accelerating the gradient descent. Meanwhile, at the final stage of optimization, each element evolves along a complex circle, similar to previous state-of-the-art gradient methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods, primarily due to the optimization of the amplitude.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein: A Scalable Metric for Heterogeneous Joint Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sliced Wasserstein (SW) and Generalized Sliced Wasserstein (GSW) have been widely used in applications due to their computational and statistical scalability. However, the SW and the GSW are only defined between distributions supported on a homogeneous domain. This limitation prevents their usage in applications with heterogeneous joint distributions with marginal distributions supported on multiple different domains. Using SW and GSW directly on the joint domains cannot make a meaningful comparison since their homogeneous slicing operator i.e., Radon Transform (RT) and Generalized Radon Transform (GRT) are not expressive enough to capture the structure of the joint supports set. To address the issue, we propose two new slicing operators i.e., Partial Generalized Radon Transform (PGRT) and Hierarchical Hybrid Radon Transform (HHRT). In greater detail, PGRT is the generalization of Partial Radon Transform (PRT), which transforms a subset of function arguments non-linearly while HHRT is the composition of PRT and multiple domain-specific PGRT on marginal domain arguments. By using HHRT, we extend the SW into Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein (H2SW) distance which is designed specifically for comparing heterogeneous joint distributions. We then discuss the topological, statistical, and computational properties of H2SW. Finally, we demonstrate the favorable performance of H2SW in 3D mesh deformation, deep 3D mesh autoencoders, and datasets comparison.</description>
