      <title>Ontological States in Non-Interacting Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a paper in the field of ontological deterministic theories behind Quantum Field Theories, like for example the cellular automaton theories proposed by 't Hooft. In these theories one has ontological states in which the state of reality is exactly known and no uncertainties are present. Also these states evolve in time deterministically. A first step in finding the ontological deterministic theory behind the Standard Model is to find in Quantum Field Theory the states that behave as ontological states. We present the ontological states for all non-interacting (3+1-dimensional) Quantum Field Theories occurring in the Standard Model. We summarize the ontological states for free scalar bosons and for free masless Dirac fermions, which are known from the literature. We construct the ontological states for vector bosons, in analogy to the scalar boson case. With this we have a set of ontological states for all particles that are known to occur in reality and in the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Machine Learning: The Power of Non-Linear Optical Reproducing Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amidst the array of quantum machine learning algorithms, the quantum kernel method has emerged as a focal point, primarily owing to its compatibility with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and its promise to achieve quantum advantage. This method operates by nonlinearly transforming data into feature space constructed with quantum states, enabling classification and regression tasks. In this study, we present a novel feature space constructed using Kerr coherent states, which generalize su(2), su(1, 1) coherent states, and squeezed states. Notably, the feature space exhibits constant curvature, comprising both spherical and hyperbolic geometries, depending on the sign of the Kerr parameter. Remarkably, the physical parameters associated with the coherent states, enable control over the curvature of the feature space. Our study employs Kerr kernels derived from encoding data into the phase and amplitude of Kerr coherent states. We analyze various datasets ranging from Moon to breast cancer diagnostics. Our findings demonstrate the robustness of Kerr coherent states, attributed to their flexibility in accommodating different hyperparameters, thereby offering superior performance across noisy datasets and hardware setups.</description>

      <title>Optimized Quantum Simulation Algorithms for Scalar Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide practical simulation methods for scalar field theories on a quantum computer that yield improved asymptotics as well as concrete gate estimates for the simulation and physical qubit estimates using the surface code. We achieve these improvements through two optimizations. First, we consider a different approach for estimating the elements of the S-matrix. This approach is appropriate in general for 1+1D and for certain low-energy elastic collisions in higher dimensions. Second, we implement our approach using a series of different fault-tolerant simulation algorithms for Hamiltonians formulated both in the field occupation basis and field amplitude basis. Our algorithms are based on either second-order Trotterization or qubitization. The cost of Trotterization in occupation basis scales as $\widetilde{O}(\lambda N^7 |\Omega|^3/(M^{5/2} \epsilon^{3/2})$ where $\lambda$ is the coupling strength, $N$ is the occupation cutoff $|\Omega|$ is the volume of the spatial lattice, $M$ is the mass of the particles and $\epsilon$ is the uncertainty in the energy calculation used for the $S$-matrix determination. Qubitization in the field basis scales as $\widetilde{O}(|\Omega|^2 (k^2 \Lambda +kM^2)/\epsilon)$ where $k$ is the cutoff in the field and $\Lambda$ is a scaled coupling constant. We find in both cases that the bounds suggest physically meaningful simulations can be performed using on the order of $4\times 10^6$ physical qubits and $10^{12}$ $T$-gates which corresponds to roughly one day on a superconducting quantum computer with surface code and a cycle time of 100 ns, placing simulation of scalar field theory within striking distance of the gate counts for the best available chemistry simulation results.</description>

      <title>Designing fault-tolerant circuits using detector error models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes, such as subspace, subsystem, and Floquet codes, are typically constructed within the stabilizer formalism, which does not fully capture the idea of fault-tolerance needed for practical quantum computing applications. In this work, we explore the remarkably powerful formalism of detector error models, which fully captures fault-tolerance at the circuit level. We introduce the detector error model formalism in a pedagogical manner and provide several examples. Additionally, we apply the formalism to three different levels of abstraction in the engineering cycle of fault-tolerant circuit designs: finding robust syndrome extraction circuits, identifying efficient measurement schedules, and constructing fault-tolerant procedures. We enhance the surface code's resistance to measurement errors, devise short measurement schedules for color codes, and implement a more efficient fault-tolerant method for measuring logical operators.</description>

      <title>Non-native Quantum Generative Optimization with Adversarial Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale optimization problems are prevalent in several fields, including engineering, finance, and logistics. However, most optimization problems cannot be efficiently encoded onto a physical system because the existing quantum samplers have too few qubits. Another typical limiting factor is that the optimization constraints are not compatible with the native cost Hamiltonian. This work presents a new approach to address these challenges. We introduce the adversarial quantum autoencoder model (AQAM) that can be used to map large-scale optimization problems onto existing quantum samplers while simultaneously optimizing the problem through latent quantum-enhanced Boltzmann sampling. We demonstrate the AQAM on a neutral atom sampler, and showcase the model by optimizing 64px by 64px unit cells that represent a broad-angle filter metasurface applicable to improving the coherence of neutral atom devices. Using 12-atom simulations, we demonstrate that the AQAM achieves a lower Renyi divergence and a larger spectral gap when compared to classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers. Our work paves the way to more efficient mapping of conventional optimization problems into existing quantum samplers.</description>

      <title>Sequency Hierarchy Truncation (SeqHT) for Adiabatic State Preparation and Time Evolution in Quantum Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Sequency Hierarchy Truncation (SeqHT) scheme for reducing the resources required for state preparation and time evolution in quantum simulations, based upon a truncation in sequency. For the $\lambda\phi^4$ interaction in scalar field theory, or any interaction with a polynomial expansion, upper bounds on the contributions of operators of a given sequency are derived. For the systems we have examined, observables computed in sequency-truncated wavefunctions, including quantum correlations as measured by magic, are found to step-wise converge to their exact values with increasing cutoff sequency. The utility of SeqHT is demonstrated in the adiabatic state preparation of the $\lambda\phi^4$ anharmonic oscillator ground state using IBM's quantum computer ${\textit ibm\_sherbrooke}$. Using SeqHT, the depth of the required quantum circuits is reduced by $\sim 30\%$, leading to significantly improved determinations of observables in the quantum simulations. More generally, SeqHT is expected to lead to a reduction in required resources for quantum simulations of systems with a hierarchy of length scales.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions Under Information Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of a quantum-many body system subject to measurements is naturally described by an ensemble of quantum trajectories, which can feature measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs). This phenomenon cannot be revealed through ensemble-averaged observables, but it requires the ability to discriminate each trajectory separately, making its experimental observation extremely challenging. We explore the fate of MIPTs under an observer's reduced ability to discriminate each measurement outcome. This introduces uncertainty in the state of the system, causing observables to probe a restricted subset of trajectories rather than a single one. By introducing an exactly-solvable Liouvillian model, we examine how long-time spatial correlations are influenced by varying degrees of trajectory averaging. We compute exactly the correlation matrix, Liouvillian gap, and entanglement negativity to demonstrate that averaging over multiple realizations introduces an effective finite lengthscale, beyond which long-range correlations are suppressed. This suggests that partial averaging over trajectories conceals the critical features of individual realizations, thereby blurring away the signatures of distinct measurement-induced phases.</description>

      <title>Quantum Natural Stochastic Pairwise Coordinate Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning through variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) has gained substantial attention in recent years. VQAs employ parameterized quantum circuits, which are typically optimized using gradient-based methods. However, these methods often exhibit sub-optimal convergence performance due to their dependence on Euclidean geometry. The quantum natural gradient descent (QNGD) optimization method, which considers the geometry of the quantum state space via a quantum information (Riemannian) metric tensor, provides a more effective optimization strategy. Despite its advantages, QNGD encounters notable challenges for learning from quantum data, including the no-cloning principle, which prohibits the replication of quantum data, state collapse, and the measurement postulate, which leads to the stochastic loss function. This paper introduces the quantum natural stochastic pairwise coordinate descent (2-QNSCD) optimization method. This method leverages the curved geometry of the quantum state space through a novel ensemble-based quantum information metric tensor, offering a more physically realizable optimization strategy for learning from quantum data. To improve computational efficiency and reduce sample complexity, we develop a highly sparse unbiased estimator of the novel metric tensor using a quantum circuit with gate complexity $\Theta(1)$ times that of the parameterized quantum circuit and single-shot quantum measurements. Our approach avoids the need for multiple copies of quantum data, thus adhering to the no-cloning principle. We provide a detailed theoretical foundation for our optimization method, along with an exponential convergence analysis. Additionally, we validate the utility of our method through a series of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimal high-precision shadow estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give the first tight sample complexity bounds for shadow tomography and classical shadows in the regime where the target error is below some sufficiently small inverse polynomial in the dimension of the Hilbert space. Formally we give a protocol that, given any $m\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\epsilon \le O(d^{-12})$, measures $O(\log(m)/\epsilon^2)$ copies of an unknown mixed state $\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{d\times d}$ and outputs a classical description of $\rho$ which can then be used to estimate any collection of $m$ observables to within additive accuracy $\epsilon$. Previously, even for the simpler task of shadow tomography -- where the $m$ observables are known in advance -- the best known rates either scaled benignly but suboptimally in all of $m, d, \epsilon$, or scaled optimally in $\epsilon, m$ but had additional polynomial factors in $d$ for general observables. Intriguingly, we also show via dimensionality reduction, that we can rescale $\epsilon$ and $d$ to reduce to the regime where $\epsilon \le O(d^{-1/2})$. Our algorithm draws upon representation-theoretic tools recently developed in the context of full state tomography.</description>

      <title>Quantum statistical effects in one-particle densities: scattering and pair production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study space-time resolved densities of particle-hole pairs produced by an external time-dependent field acting on non-interacting non-relativistic particles. It is shown that, at least in some cases, the densities are not affected by Fermi-Dirac or Bose- Einstein statistics, and are determined only by the initial state of the multi-particle system. The second quantisation technique is extended to Dirac electrons and, with some modifications, to Klein-Gordon bosons. The difference in pair production in these two relativistic cases is analysed in some detail.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Device-Independent Active Quantum State Certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled quantum states are essential ingredients for many quantum technologies, but they must be validated before they are used. As a full characterization is prohibitively resource-intensive, recent work has focused on developing methods to efficiently extract a few parameters of interest, in a so-called verification framework. Most existing approaches are based on preparing an ensemble of nominally identical and independent (IID) quantum states, and then measuring each copy of the ensemble. However, this leaves no states left for the intended quantum tasks and the IID assumptions do not always hold experimentally. To overcome these challenges, we experimentally implement quantum state certification (QSC), which measures only a subset of the ensemble, certifying the fidelity of the remaining states. We use active optical switches to randomly sample from sources of two-photon Bell states and three-photon GHZ states, reporting statistically-sound fidelities in real time without destroying the entire ensemble. Additionally, our QSC protocol removes the assumption that the states are identical, is device-independent, and can achieve close $N^{-1}$ scaling, in the number of states measured $N$. Altogether, these benefits make our QSC protocol suitable for benchmarking large-scale quantum computing devices and deployed quantum communication setups relying on entanglement in both standard and adversarial situations.</description>

      <title>Qutrit and Qubit Circuits for Three-Flavor Collective Neutrino Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the utility of qutrits and qubits for simulating the flavor dynamics of dense neutrino systems. The evolution of such systems impacts some important astrophysical processes, such as core-collapse supernovae and the nucleosynthesis of heavy nuclei. Many-body simulations require classical resources beyond current computing capabilities for physically relevant system sizes. Quantum computers are therefore a promising candidate to efficiently simulate the many-body dynamics of collective neutrino oscillations. Previous quantum simulation efforts have primarily focused on properties of the two-flavor approximation due to their direct mapping to qubits. Here, we present new quantum circuits for simulating three-flavor neutrino systems on qutrit- and qubit-based platforms, and demonstrate their feasibility by simulating systems of two, four and eight neutrinos on IBM and Quantinuum quantum computers.</description>

      <title>A time-parallel multiple-shooting method for large-scale quantum optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control plays a crucial role in quantum computing by employing control pulses to steer quantum systems and realize logical gate transformations, essential for quantum algorithms. However, this optimization task is computationally demanding due to challenges such as the exponential growth in computational complexity with the system's dimensionality and the deterioration of optimization convergence for multi-qubit systems. Various methods have been developed, including gradient-based and gradient-free reduced-space methods and full-space collocation methods. This paper introduces an intermediate approach based on multiple-shooting, aiming to balance solution accuracy and computational efficiency of previous approaches. Unlike conventional reduced-space methods, multiple-shooting divides the time domain into windows and introduces optimization variables for the initial state in each window. This enables parallel computation of state evolution across windows, significantly accelerating objective function and gradient evaluations. The initial state matrix in each window is only guaranteed to be unitary upon convergence of the optimization algorithm. For this reason the conventional gate trace infidelity is replaced by a generalized infidelity that is convex for non-unitary state matrices. Continuity of the state across window boundaries is enforced by equality constraints. A quadratic penalty optimization method is used to solve the constrained optimal control problem, and an efficient adjoint technique is employed to calculate the gradients in each iteration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical experiments on quantum Fourier transform gates in systems with 2, 3, and 4 qubits. Parallel scalability and optimization performance are evaluated, highlighting the method's potential for optimizing control pulses in multi-qubit quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Practical continuous-variable quantum secret sharing using local local oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although continuous-variable quantum secret sharing (CVQSS) has been theoretically proven to be secure, it may still be vulnerable to various local oscillator (LO)-aimed attacks. To close this loophole, we propose a practical CVQSS scheme using local LO (LLO), which is called LLO-CVQSS. In this scheme, LO is no longer generated by each user but can be locally generated by the legitimate party, i.e., the dealer. This waives the necessity that all LOs have to be transmitted through an untrusted channel, which makes CVQSS system naturally immune to all LO-aimed attacks, greatly enhancing its practical security. We also develop a specially designed phase compensation method for LLO-CVQSS so that the phase noise of the whole system can be eliminated. We finally construct a noise model for LLO-CVQSS and derive its security bound against both eavesdroppers and dishonest users. Numerical simulation shows that LLO-CVQSS is able to support 30 users at the same time and its maximal transmission distance reaches 112 km, revealing that LLO-CVQSS is not only has the ability to defend itself against all LO-aimed attacks but also has the potential for building large-scale practical quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Inductance Parametric Converter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric converters are parametric amplifiers that mix two spatially separate nondegenerate modes and are commonly used for amplifying and squeezing microwave signals in quantum computing and sensing. In Josephson parametric converters, the strong localized nonlinearity of the Josephson Junction limits the amplification and squeezing, as well as the dynamic range, in current devices. In contrast, a weak distributed nonlinearity can provide higher gain and dynamic range, when implemented as a kinetic inductance (KI) nanowire of a dirty superconductor, and has additional benefits such as resilience to magnetic field, higher-temperature operation, and simplified fabrication. Here, we propose, demonstrate, and analyze the performance of a KI parametric converter that relies on the weak distributed nonlinearity of a KI nanowire. The device utilizes three-wave mixing induced by a DC current bias. We demonstrate its operation as a nondegenerate parametric amplifier with high phase-sensitive gain, reaching two-mode amplification and deamplification of $\sim$30 dB for two resonances separated by 0.8 GHz, in excellent agreement with our theory of the device. We observe a dynamic range of -108~dBm at 30 dB gain. Our device can significantly broaden applications of quantum-limited signal processing devices including phase-preserving amplification and two-mode squeezing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a bipartite Gaussian quantum system interacting with an external Gaussian environment may possess a unique Gaussian entangled stationary state and that any initial state converges towards this stationary state. We discuss dependence of entanglement on temperature and interaction strength and show that one can find entangled stationary states only for low temperatures and weak interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamiltonian Embedding of Images for Data Reuploading Classifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When applying quantum computing to machine learning tasks, one of the first considerations is the design of the quantum machine learning model itself. Conventionally, the design of quantum machine learning algorithms relies on the ``quantisation" of classical learning algorithms, such as using quantum linear algebra to implement important subroutines of classical algorithms, if not the entire algorithm, seeking to achieve quantum advantage through possible run-time accelerations brought by quantum computing. However, recent research has started questioning whether quantum advantage via speedup is the right goal for quantum machine learning [1]. Research also has been undertaken to exploit properties that are unique to quantum systems, such as quantum contextuality, to better design quantum machine learning models [2]. In this paper, we take an alternative approach by incorporating the heuristics and empirical evidences from the design of classical deep learning algorithms to the design of quantum neural networks. We first construct a model based on the data reuploading circuit [3] with the quantum Hamiltonian data embedding unitary [4]. Through numerical experiments on images datasets, including the famous MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms the quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN)[5] by a large margin (up to over 40% on MNIST test set). Based on the model design process and numerical results, we then laid out six principles for designing quantum machine learning models, especially quantum neural networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum-classical correspondence in quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum channels describe subsystem or open system evolution. Using the classical Koopman operator that evolves functions on phase space, 4 classical Koopman channels are identified that are analogs of the 4 possible quantum channels in a bipartite setting. Thus when the complete evolution has a quantum-classical correspondence the correspondence at the level of the subunitary channels can be studied. The channels, both classical and quantum can be interpreted as noisy single particle systems. Having parallel classical and quantum operators gives us new access to study fine details of these major limiting theories. Using a coupled kicked rotor as a generic example, we contrast and compare spectra of the quantum and classical channel. The largest nontrivial mode of the quantum channel is seen to be mostly determined by the stable parts of the classical phase space, even those that are surprisingly small in relation to the scale of an effective $\hbar$. In the case when the dynamics has a significant fraction of chaos the spectrum has a prominent annular density that is approximately described by the single-ring theorem of random matrix theory, and the ring shrinks in size when the classical limit is approached. However, the eigenvalues and modes that survive the classical limit seem to be either scarred by unstable manifolds or, if they exist, stable periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>Electrical pumping of h-BN single-photon sources in van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic defects in solids offer a versatile basis to study and realize quantum phenomena and information science in various integrated systems. All-electrical pumping of single defects to create quantum light emission has been realized in several platforms including color centers in diamond, silicon carbide, and zinc oxide, which could lead to the circuit network of electrically triggered single-photon sources. However, a wide conduction channel which reduces the carrier injection per defect site has been a major obstacle. Here, we conceive and realize a novel device concept to construct electrically pumped single-photon sources using a van der Waals stacked structure with atomic plane precision. Defect-induced tunneling currents across graphene and NbSe2 electrodes sandwiching an atomically thin h-BN layer allows persistent and repeatable generation of non-classical light from h-BN. The collected emission photon energies range between 1.4 and 2.9 eV, revealing the electrical excitation of a variety of atomic defects. By analyzing the dipole axis of observed emitters, we further confirm that emitters are crystallographic defect complexes of h-BN crystal. Our work facilitates implementing efficient and miniaturized single-photon devices in van der Waals platforms toward applications in quantum optoelectronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a recently proposed model for the propagation of one-photon states in a random medium of two-level atoms. We demonstrate the existence of Anderson localization of single photon states in an energy band centered at the resonant energy of the atoms. Additionally, for a Bosonic model of the atoms the results can be extended to multiple photon states.</description>

      <title>Role of Quantum Coherence in Kinetic Uncertainty Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kinetic Uncertainty Relation (KUR) bounds the signal-to-noise ratio of stochastic currents in terms of the number of transitions per unit time, known as the dynamical activity. This bound was derived in a classical context, and can be violated in the quantum regime due to coherent effects. However, the precise connection between KUR violations and quantum coherence has so far remained elusive, despite significant investigation. In this work, we solve this problem by deriving a modified bound that exactly pinpoints how, and when, coherence might lead to KUR violations. Our bound is sensitive to the specific kind of unraveling of the quantum master equation. It therefore allows one to compare quantum jumps and quantum diffusion, and understand, in each case, how quantum coherence affects fluctuations. We illustrate our result on a double quantum dot, where the electron current is monitored either by electron jump detection or with continuous diffusive charge measurement.</description>

      <title>Subspace-Based Local Compilation of Variational Quantum Circuits for Large-Scale Quantum Many-Body Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation of quantum many-body systems is a promising application of quantum computers. However, implementing the time-evolution operator as a quantum circuit efficiently on near-term devices with limited resources is challenging. Standard approaches like Trotterization often require deep circuits, making them impractical. This paper proposes a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm called Local Subspace Variational Quantum Compilation (LSVQC) for compiling the time-evolution operator. The LSVQC uses variational optimization to reproduce the action of the target time-evolution operator within a physically reasonable subspace. Optimization is performed on small local subsystems based on the Lieb-Robinson bound, allowing for cost function evaluation using small-scale quantum devices or classical computers. Numerical simulations on a spin-lattice model and an $\mathit{\text{ab initio}}$ effective model of strongly correlated material Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness. It is shown that the LSVQC achieves a 95% reduction in circuit depth compared to Trotterization while maintaining accuracy. The subspace restriction also reduces resource requirements and improves accuracy. Furthermore, we estimate the gate count needed to execute the quantum simulations using the LSVQC on near-term quantum computing architectures in the noisy intermediate-scale or early fault-tolerant quantum computing era. Our estimation suggests that the acceptable physical gate error rate for the LSVQC can be significantly larger than for Trotterization.</description>

      <title>Current-Crowding-Free Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting single photons is essential for applications such as dark matter detection, quantum science and technology, and biomedical imaging. Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) excel in this task due to their near-unity detection efficiency, sub-Hz dark count rates, and picosecond timing jitter. However, a local increase of current density (current crowding) in the bends of meander-shaped SNSPDs limits these performance metrics. By locally irradiating the straight segments of SNSPDs with helium ions while leaving the bends unirradiated, we realize current-crowding-free SNSPDs with simultaneously enhanced sensitivity: after irradiation with 800 ions/nm$\unicode{xB2}$, locally irradiated SNSPDs showed a relative saturation plateau width of 37% while fully irradiated SNSPDs reached only 10%. This larger relative plateau width allows operation at lower relative bias currents, thereby reducing the dark count rate while still detecting single photons efficiently. We achieve an internal detection efficiency of 94% for a wavelength of 780 nm with a dark count rate of 7 mHz near the onset of saturating detection efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical computing harnesses the speed of light to perform matrix-vector operations efficiently. It leverages interference, a cornerstone of quantum computing algorithms, to enable parallel computations. In this work, we interweave quantum computing with classical structured light. This is achieved by formulating the process of photonic matrix multiplication using quantum mechanical principles such as state superposition and subsequently demonstrate a well known algorithm, namely the Deutsch-Jozsa's algorithm. This is accomplished by elucidating the inherent tensor product structure within the Cartesian transverse degrees of freedom of light. To this end, we establish a discrete basis using localized Gaussian modes arranged in a lattice formation and demonstrate the operation of a Hadamard Gate. Leveraging the reprogrammable and digital capabilities of spatial light modulators, coupled with Fourier transforms by lenses, our approach proves adaptable to various algorithms. Therefore our work advances the use of structured light for quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qubit systems based on trapped ultracold ions win one of the leading positions in the quantum computing field, demonstrating quantum algorithms with the highest complexity to date. Surface Paul traps for ion confinement open the opportunity to scale quantum processors to hundreds of qubits and enable high-connectivity manipulations on ions. To fabricate such a system with certain characteristics, the special design of a surface electrode structure is required. The depth of the trapping potential, the stability parameter, the secular frequency and the distance between an ion and the trap surface should be optimized for better performance. Here we present the optimized design of a relatively simple surface trap that allows several important high-fidelity primitives: tight ion confinement, laser cooling, and wide optical access. The suggested trap design also allows to perform an important basic operation, namely, splitting an ion chain into two parts.</description>

      <title>Probing instantaneous quantum circuit refrigeration in the quantum regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in circuit quantum electrodynamics have enabled precise manipulation and detection of the single energy quantum in quantum systems. A quantum circuit refrigerator (QCR) is capable of electrically cooling the excited population of quantum systems, such as superconducting resonators and qubits, through photon-assisted tunneling of quasi-particles within a superconductor-insulator-normal metal junction. In this study, we demonstrated instantaneous QCR in the quantum regime. We performed the time-resolved measurement of the QCR-induced cooling of photon number inside the superconducting resonator by harnessing a qubit as a photon detector. From the enhanced photon loss rate of the resonator estimated from the amount of the AC Stark shift, the QCR was shown to have a cooling power of approximately 300 aW. Furthermore, even below the single energy quantum, the QCR can reduce the number of photons inside the resonator with 100 ns pulse from thermal equilibrium. Numerical calculations based on the Lindblad master equation successfully reproduced these experimental results.</description>

      <title>Generating quantum non-local entanglement with mechanical rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have searched for evidence of the impact of non-inertial motion on the entanglement of particles. The success of these endeavours has been hindered by the fact that such tests were performed within spatial scales that were only "local" when compared to the spatial scales over which the non-inertial motion was taking place. We propose a Sagnac-like interferometer that, by challenging such bottlenecks, is able to achieve entangled states through a mechanism induced by the mechanical rotation of a photonic interferometer. The resulting states violate the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality all the way up to the Tsirelson bound, thus signaling strong quantum nonlocality. Our results demonstrate that mechanical rotation can be thought of as resource for controlling quantum non-locality with implications also for recent proposals for experiments that can probe the quantum nature of curved spacetimes and non-inertial motion.</description>

      <title>QuOp: A Quantum Operator Representation for Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an intuitive and novel method to represent nodes in a graph with special unitary operators, or quantum operators, which does not require parameter training and is competitive with classical methods on scoring similarity between nodes. This method opens up future possibilities to apply quantum algorithms for NLP or other applications that need to detect anomalies within a network structure. Specifically, this technique leverages the advantage of quantum computation, representing nodes in higher dimensional Hilbert spaces. To create the representations, the local topology around each node with a predetermined number of hops is calculated and the respective adjacency matrix is used to derive the Hamiltonian. While using the local topology of a node to derive a Hamiltonian is a natural extension of a graph into a quantum circuit, our method differs by not assuming the quantum operators in the representation a priori, but letting the adjacency matrix dictate the representation. As a consequence of this simplicity, the set of adjacency matrices of size $2^n \times 2^n$ generates a sub-vector space of the Lie algebra of the special unitary operators, $\mathfrak{su}(2^n)$. This sub-vector space in turn generates a subgroup of the Lie group of special unitary operators, $\mathrm{SU}(2^n)$. Applications of our quantum embedding method, in comparison with the classical algorithms GloVe (a natural language processing embedding method) and FastRP (a general graph embedding method, display superior performance in measuring similarity between nodes in graph structures.</description>

      <title>Photon Generation in Double Superconducting Cavities: Quantum Circuits Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we studied photon generation due to the Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE) in a one dimensional (1+1) double superconducting cavity. The cavity consists of two perfectly conducting mirrors and a dielectric membrane of infinitesimal depth that effectively couples two cavities. The total length of the double cavity $L$, the difference in length between the two cavities $\Delta L$, and the electric susceptibility $\chi$ and conductivity $v$ of the dielectric membrane are tunable parameters. All four parameters are treated as independent and are allowed to be tuned at the same time, even with different frequencies. We analyzed the cavity's energy spectra under different conditions, finding a transition between two distinct regimes that is accurately described by $k_c=\sqrt{v/\chi}$. In particular, a lowest energy mode is forbidden in one of the regimes while it is allowed in the other. We compared analytical approximations obtained through the Multiple Scale Analysis method with exact numeric solutions, obtaining the typical results when $\chi$ is not being tuned. However, when the susceptibility $\chi$ is tuned, different behaviours (such as oscillations in the number of photons of a cavity prepared in a vacuum state) might arise if the frequencies and amplitudes of all parameters are adequate. These oscillations can be considered as adiabatic shortcuts where all generated photons are eventually destroyed. Finally, we present an equivalent quantum circuit that would allow to experimentally simulate the DCE under the studied conditions.</description>

      <title>Machine learning meets the CHSH scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a comprehensive study of the machine learning (ML) methods for the purpose of characterising the quantum set of correlations. As our main focus is on assessing the usefulness and effectiveness of the ML approach, we focus exclusively on the CHSH scenario, both the 4-dimensional variant, for which an analytical solution is known, and the 8-dimensional variant, for which no analytical solution is known, but numerical approaches are relatively well understood. We consider a wide selection of approaches, ranging from simple data science models to dense neural networks. The two classes of models that perform well are support vector machines and dense neural networks, and they are the main focus of this work. We conclude that while it is relatively easy to achieve good performance on average, it is hard to train a model that performs well on the "hard" cases, i.e., points in the vicinity of the boundary of the quantum set. Sadly, these are precisely the cases which are interesting from the academic point of view. In order to improve performance on hard cases one must, especially for the 8-dimensional problem, resort to a tailored choice of training data, which means that we are implicitly feeding our intuition and biases into the model. We feel that this is an important and often overlooked aspect of applying ML models to academic problems, where data generation or data selection is performed according to some implicit subjective criteria. In this way, it is possible to unconsciously steer our model, so that it exhibits features that we are interested in seeing. Hence, special care must be taken while determining whether ML methods can be considered objective and unbiased in the context of academic problems.</description>

      <title>Exponential Quantum Advantage for Pathfinding in Regular Sunflower Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding problems that allow for superpolynomial quantum speedup is one of the most important tasks in quantum computation. A key challenge is identifying problem structures that can only be exploited by quantum mechanics. In this paper, we find a class of graphs that allows for exponential quantum-classical separation for the pathfinding problem with the adjacency list oracle, and this class of graphs is named regular sunflower graphs. We prove that, with high probability, a regular sunflower graph of degree at least $7$ is a mild expander graph, that is, the spectral gap of the graph Laplacian is at least inverse polylogarithmic in the graph size.
  We provide an efficient quantum algorithm to find an $s$-$t$ path in the regular sunflower graph while any classical algorithm takes exponential time. This quantum advantage is achieved by efficiently preparing a $0$-eigenstate of the adjacency matrix of the regular sunflower graph as a quantum superposition state over the vertices, and this quantum state contains enough information to help us efficiently find an $s$-$t$ path in the regular sunflower graph.
  Because the security of an isogeny-based cryptosystem depends on the hardness of finding an $s$-$t$ path in an expander graph \cite{Charles2009}, a quantum speedup of the pathfinding problem on an expander graph is of significance. Our result represents a step towards this goal as the first provable exponential speedup for pathfinding in a mild expander graph.</description>

      <title>Routing in Quantum Networks with End-to-End Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the diverse array of physical systems available for quantum computing and the absence of a well-defined quantum internet protocol stack, the design and optimisation of quantum networking protocols remain largely unexplored. To address this, we introduce an approach that facilitates the establishment of paths capable of delivering end-to-end fidelity above a specified threshold, without requiring detailed knowledge of the quantum network properties, which we call the 'grey box approach'. In this study, we define algorithms that are specific instances of this approach and evaluate them in comparison to Dijkstra shortest path algorithm and a fully knowledge-aware algorithm through simulations. Our results demonstrate that one of the grey box algorithms consistently outperforms the other methods in delivering paths above the fidelity threshold, across various network topologies and the number of source-destination pairs involved, while maintaining significant levels of fairness among the users and being robust to inaccurate estimations of the expected end-to-end fidelity.</description>

      <title>Multicritical quantum sensors driven by symmetry-breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum criticality has been demonstrated as a useful quantum resource for parameter estimation. This includes second-order, topological and localization transitions. In all these works reported so far, gap-to-gapless transition at criticality has been identified as the ultimate resource for achieving the quantum enhanced sensing, although there are several important concepts associated with criticality, such as long-range correlation, symmetry breaking. In this work, we analytically demonstrate that symmetry-breaking can drive a quantum enhanced sensing in single- or multiparameter estimation. We show this in the well-known Kitaev model, a lattice version of the 1D p-wave superconductor, which consists of a pairing term and an onsite potential term. The model is characterized by two critical lines and a multi-critical point at the intersection of these two lines. We show that Heisenberg scaling can be obtained in precision measurement of the superconducting coupling by preparing the system at or near the multicritical point despite the fact that parameter variation follows the critical lines, i.e., without an explicit requirement of gap-to-gapless transition. Quantum enhancement in such situations solely occurs due to a global U(1) symmetry-breaking by the pairing term. Extending our analysis in the realm of multiparameter estimation we show that it is possible to obtain super-Heisenberg scaling by combining the effects of symmetry-breaking and gapless-to-gapped transition.</description>

      <title>Diagonalization of large many-body Hamiltonians on a quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The estimation of low energies of many-body systems is a cornerstone of computational quantum sciences. Variational quantum algorithms can be used to prepare ground states on pre-fault-tolerant quantum processors, but their lack of convergence guarantees and impractical number of cost function estimations prevent systematic scaling of experiments to large systems. Alternatives to variational approaches are needed for large-scale experiments on pre-fault-tolerant devices. Here, we use a superconducting quantum processor to compute eigenenergies of quantum many-body systems on two-dimensional lattices of up to 56 sites, using the Krylov quantum diagonalization algorithm, an analog of the well-known classical diagonalization technique. We construct subspaces of the many-body Hilbert space using Trotterized unitary evolutions executed on the quantum processor, and classically diagonalize many-body interacting Hamiltonians within those subspaces. These experiments show that quantum diagonalization algorithms are poised to complement their classical counterpart at the foundation of computational methods for quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Red-QAOA: Efficient Variational Optimization through Circuit Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) addresses combinatorial optimization challenges by converting inputs to graphs. However, the optimal parameter searching process of QAOA is greatly affected by noise. Larger problems yield bigger graphs, requiring more qubits and making their outcomes highly noise-sensitive. This paper introduces Red-QAOA, leveraging energy landscape concentration via a simulated annealing-based graph reduction.
  Red-QAOA creates a smaller (distilled) graph with nearly identical parameters to the original graph. The distilled graph produces a smaller quantum circuit and thus reduces noise impact. At the end of the optimization, Red-QAOA employs the parameters from the distilled graph on the original graph and continues the parameter search on the original graph. Red-QAOA outperforms state-of-the-art Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based pooling techniques on 3200 real-world problems. Red-QAOA reduced node and edge counts by 28% and 37%, respectively, with a mean square error of only 2%.</description>

      <title>Observable-Driven Speed-ups in Quantum Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum technology advances, quantum simulation becomes increasingly promising, with significant implications for quantum many-body physics and quantum chemistry. Despite being one of the most accessible simulation methods, the product formula encounters challenges due to the pessimistic gate count estimation. In this work, we elucidate how observable knowledge can accelerate quantum simulations. By focusing on specific families of observables, we reduce product-formula simulation errors and gate counts in both short-time and arbitrary-time scenarios. For short-time simulations, we deliberately design and tailor product formulas to achieve size-independent errors for local and certain global observables. In arbitrary-time simulations, we reveal that Pauli-summation structured observables generally reduce average errors. Specifically, we obtain quadratic error reductions proportional to the number of summands for observables with evenly distributed Pauli coefficients. Our advanced error analyses, supported by numerical studies, indicate improved gate count estimation. We anticipate that the explored speed-ups can pave the way for efficiently realizing quantum simulations and demonstrating advantages on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Minimum tracking linear response Hubbard and Hund corrected Density Functional Theory in CP2K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the implementation of the Hubbard ($U$) and Hund ($J$) corrected Density Functional Theory (DFT+$U$+$J$) functionality in the Quickstep program, which is part of the CP2K suite. The tensorial and L\"owdin subspace representations are implemented and compared. Full analytical DFT+$U$+$J$ forces are implemented and benchmarked for the tensorial and L\"owdin representations. We also present the implementation of the recently proposed minimum-tracking linear-response method that enables the $U$ and $J$ parameters to be calculated on first principles basis without reference to the Kohn-Sham eigensystem. These implementations are benchmarked against recent results for different materials properties including DFT+$U$ band gap opening in NiO, the relative stability of various polaron distributions in TiO$_2$, the dependence of the calculated TiO$_2$ band gap on +$J$ corrections, and, finally, the role of the +$U$ and +$J$ corrections for the computed properties of a series of the hexahydrated transition metals. Our implementation provides results consistent with those already reported in the literature from comparable methods. We conclude the contribution with tests on the influence of the L\"owdin orthonormalization on the occupancies, calculated parameters, and derived properties.</description>

      <title>Ballistic conductance with and without disorder in a boundary-driven XXZ spin chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on google's sycamore NISQ platform on the spin transport resulting from a non-unitary periodic boundary drive of an XXZ chain, we study a classical variant thereof by a combination of analytical and numerical means. We find the classical model reproduces the quantum results in remarkable detail, and provides an analytical handle on the nature and shape of the spin transport's three distinct regimes: ballistic (easy-plane), subdiffusive (isotropic) and insulating (easy-axis). Further, we show that this phenomenology is remarkably robust to the inclusion of bond disorder -- albeit that the transient dynamics approaching the steady states differs qualitatively between the clean and disordered cases -- providing an accessible instance of ballistic transport in a disordered setting.</description>

      <title>Emergence of phantom cold dark matter from spacetime diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A way to reconcile general relativity and quantum field theory without quantising the geometry is to demand the metric evolve stochastically. In this article, we explore the consequences of such a proposal at early cosmological times. We find the stochastic evolution results in the spatial metric diffusing away from its deterministic value, generating phantom cold dark matter (CDM). It is produced primarily at the end of the inflationary phase of the Universe's evolution, with a statistical distribution that depends on the specifics of the early-times cosmological model. We find the energy density of this phantom cold dark matter is positive on average, a necessary condition to reproduce the cosmological phenomenology of CDM, although further work is required to calculate its mean density and spatial distribution. If the density is cosmologically significant, phantom dark matter acts on the geometry in a way that is indistinguishable from conventional CDM. As such, it has the potential to reproduce phenomenology such as structure formation, lensing, and galactic rotation curves. We conclude by discussing the possibility of testing hybrid theories of gravity by combining measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background with tabletop experiments.</description>

      <title>A novel translationally invariant supersymmetric chain with inverse-square interactions: partition function, thermodynamics and criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel family of translationally-invariant su$(m|n)$ supersymmetric spin chains with long-range interaction not directly associated to a root system. We study the symmetries of these models, establishing in particular the existence of a boson-fermion duality characteristic of this type of systems. Taking advantage of the relation of the new chains with an associated many-body supersymmetric spin dynamical model, we are able to compute their partition function in closed form for all values of $m$ and $n$ and for an arbitrary number of spins. When both $m$ and $n$ are even, we show that the partition function factorizes as the product of the partition functions of two supersymmetric Haldane-Shastry spin chains, which in turn leads to a simple expression for the thermodynamic free energy per spin in terms of the Perron eigenvalue of a suitable transfer matrix. We use this expression to study the thermodynamics of a large class of these chains, showing in particular that the specific heat presents a single Schottky peak at approximately the same temperature as a suitable $k$-level model. We also analyze the critical behavior of the new chains, and in particular the ground state degeneracy and the existence of low energy excitations with a linear energy-momentum dispersion relation. In this way we are able to show that the only possible critical chains are the ones with $m=0,1,2$. In addition, using the explicit formula for the partition function we are able to establish the criticality of the su$(0|n)$ and su$(2|n)$ chains with even $n$, and to evaluate the central charge of their associated conformal field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging aims at providing information on both the spatial and the spectral distribution of light, with high resolution. However, state-of-the-art protocols are characterized by an intrinsic trade-off imposing to sacrifice either resolution or image acquisition speed. We address this limitation by exploiting light intensity correlations, which are shown to enable overcoming the typical downsides of traditional hyperspectral imaging techniques, both scanning and snapshot. The proposed approach also opens possibilities that are not otherwise achievable, such as sharper imaging and natural filtering of broadband spectral components that would otherwise hide the spectrum of interest. The enabled combination of high spatial and spectral resolution, high speed, and insensitivity to undesired spectral features shall lead to a paradigm change in hyperspectral imaging devices and open-up new application scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Messenger Search for Exotic Field Emission with a Global Magnetometer Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis method to search for exotic low-mass field (ELF) bursts generated during large energy astrophysical events such as supernovae, binary black hole or binary neutron star mergers, and fast radio bursts using the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME). In our model, the associated gravitational waves or electromagnetic signals herald the arrival of the ELF burst that interacts via coupling to the spin of fermions in the magnetometers. This enables GNOME to serve as a tool for multi-messenger astronomy. The algorithm employs a model-agnostic excess-power method to identify network-wide candidate events to be subjected to a model-dependent generalized likelihood-ratio test to determine their statistical significance. We perform the first search with this technique on GNOME data coincident with the binary black hole merger S200311bg detected by LIGO/Virgo on the 11th of March 2020 and find no significant events. We place the first lab-based limits on combinations of ELF production and coupling parameters.</description>

      <title>Energy efficient coherent quantum control of nitrogen vacancy (NV) spin with nanoscale magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate coherent quantum control of a nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond with microwave fields generated from a nanoscale magnet that is proximal to the NV center. Our results show remarkable coherent control with high contrast Rabi oscillations using nearfield microwaves from shape anisotropic nanomagnets of lateral dimensions down to 200 nm x 180 nm, driven remotely by surface acoustic wave (SAW) excitation that is at least 400 times and potentially 4 orders of magnitude more energy efficient than generating microwaves with an antenna. Furthermore, we show that varying the acoustic power driving such nanomagnets can achieve control over Rabi frequency. We also report spin-lattice relaxation time T1 is 103 +/-0.5 micro-seconds, the spin-spin relaxation time T2 is 1.23+/-0.29 micro-seconds, and the Ramsey coherence time T2* is 218+/-27 nanoseconds measured using microwave pulses generated by such nanomagnets. The use of the nanoscale magnets to implement highly localized and energy efficient coherent quantum control can replace thermally noisy microwave circuits and demonstrate a path to scalable quantum computing and sensing with NV-defects in diamond and other spin qubits.</description>

Abstract: The circular dichroism (CD) of photoelectrons generated by near-infrared (NIR) laser pulses using multiphoton ionization of excited He^+ ions, which were prepared in the (3p,m=+1) state by circularly polarized extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses, is examined experimentally and theoretically. A complex variation of the CD is observed as a result of intensity- and polarization-dependent Freeman resonances for circularly polarized NIR pulses co- and counter-rotating relative to the polarization of the XUV pulse, with and without additional dichroic AC-Stark shifts. The experimental results are compared with numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation to identify and interpret the pronounced variation of the experimentally observed CD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum system interacting with a time-periodic excitation creates a ladder of hybrid eigenstates in which the system is mixed with an increasing number of photons. This mechanism, referred to as dressing, has been observed in the context of light-matter interaction in systems as varied as atoms, molecules and solid-state qubits. In this work, we demonstrate state dressing in a semiconductor quantum dot tunnel-coupled to a charge reservoir. We observe the emergence of a Floquet ladder of states in the system's high-frequency electrical response, manifesting as interference fringes at the multiphoton resonances despite the system lacking an avoided crossing. We study the dressed quantum dot while changing reservoir temperature, charge lifetime, and excitation amplitude and reveal the fundamental nature of the mechanism by developing a theory based on the quantum dynamics of the Floquet ladder, which is in excellent agreement with the data. Furthermore, we show how the technique finds applications in the accurate electrostatic characterisation of semiconductor quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Effect of environmental noise on charge diffusion in DNA: Towards modeling its potential epigenetic impact in live processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge diffusion through desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a physico-chemical phenomenon that on the one hand is being explored for technological purposes, on the other hand is applied by nature for various informational processes in life. With regard to the latter, increasing experimental and theoretical evidence indicates that charge diffusion through DNA is involved in basic steps of DNA replication and repair, as well as regulation of gene expression via epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation or DNA binding of proteins. From the physics point of view, DNA supports a metallic-like behavior with long-range charge mobility. Nevertheless, particularly considering a living environment, charge mobility in DNA needs to take into account omnipresent noise and disorder. Here, we analyze quantum diffusion of single charges along DNA-inspired two-dimensional tight-binding lattices in presence of different sources of intrinsic and environmental fluctuations. It is shown that double-strand lattices, parametrized according to atomistic calculations of DNA sequences, offer a complex network of pathways between sites and may give rise to long-distance coherence phenomena. These effects strongly depend on carrier type (electrons, holes), the energetic profile of the lattice (composition) as well as the type of noise and disorder. Of particular interest are spatially correlated low-frequency fluctuations which may support coherent charge transfer over distances of a few sites. Our results may trigger further experimental activities aiming at investigating charge mobility in DNA both in the native in-vivo context as well as on artificial platforms.</description>

      <title>Fragment quantum embedding using the Householder transformation: a multi-state extension based on ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent works by Yalouz et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 157, 214112, 2022) and Sekaran et al. (Phys. Rev. B 104, 035121, 2021; Computation 10, 45, 2022), Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) has been reformulated through the use of the Householder transformation as a novel tool to embed a fragment within extended systems. The transformation was applied to a reference non-interacting one-electron reduced density matrix to construct fragments' bath orbitals, which are crucial for subsequent ground state calculations. In the present work, we expand upon these previous developments and extend the utilization of the Householder transformation to the description of multiple electronic states, including ground and excited states. Based on an ensemble noninteracting density matrix, we demonstrate the feasibility of achieving exact fragment embedding through successive Householder transformations, resulting in a larger set of bath orbitals. We analytically prove that the number of additional bath orbitals scales directly with the number of fractionally occupied natural orbitals in the reference ensemble density matrix. A connection with the regular DMET bath construction is also made. Then, we illustrate the use of this ensemble embedding tool in single-shot DMET calculations to describe both ground and first excited states in a Hubbard lattice model and an ab initio hydrogen system. Lastly, we discuss avenues for enhancing ensemble embedding through self-consistency and explore potential future directions.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Dependent Optical Constants of Nanometer-thin Flakes of Fe(Te,Se) Superconductor in the Visible and Near-Infrared Regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iron chalcogenides superconductors, such as Fe(Te,Se) have recently garnered significant attention due to their simple crystal structure with a relatively easy synthesis process, high-temperature superconductivity, intrinsic topological band structure, and an unconventional pairing of superconductivity with ferromagnetism. Here, we report the complex in-plane refractive index measurement of nanometer-thin Fe(Te,Se) flake exfoliated from a single crystal FeTe$_{\text{0.6}}$Se$_{\text{0.4}}$ for photon wavelengths from 450 to 1100 nm over a temperature range from 4 K to 295 K. The results were obtained by employing a two-Drude model for the dielectric function of Fe(Te,Se), a multiband superconductor, and fitting the absolute optical reflection spectra using the transfer matrix method. A high extinction coefficient in the visible to near-infrared range makes nanometer-thin Fe(Te,Se) flakes a promising material for photodetection applications.</description>

      <title>Thermal pure states for systems with antiunitary symmetries and their tensor network representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal pure state algorithms, which employ pure quantum states representing thermal equilibrium states instead of statistical ensembles, are useful both for numerical simulations and for theoretical analysis of thermal states. However, their inherently large entanglement makes it difficult to represent efficiently and limits their use in analyzing large systems. Here, we propose a new algorithm for constructing thermal pure states for systems with certain antiunitary symmetries, such as time-reversal or complex conjugation symmetry. Our method utilizes thermal pure states that, while exhibiting volume-law entanglement, can be mapped to tensor network states through simple transformations. Furthermore, our approach does not rely on random sampling and thus avoids statistical uncertainty. Moreover, we can compute not only thermal expectation values of local observables but also thermodynamic functions. We demonstrate the validity and utility of our method by applying it to the one-dimensional XY model and the two-dimensional Ising model on a triangular lattice. Our results suggest a new class of variational wave functions for volume-law states that are not limited to thermal equilibrium states.</description>

      <title>The 1D photonic wire as a single-photon source: Implications of cQED to a phonon bath of reduced dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the semiconductor quantum dot placed in a solid-state material allows for deterministic emission of single photons, the photon indistinguishability is strongly influenced by the intrinsic coupling to lattice vibrations, phonons, of the solid-state environment. This work investigates the phonon-induced decoherence for a quantum dot placed in the one-dimensional system of a homogeneous cylindrical nanowire. Such a structure supports multiple longitudinal phonon branches, and we consider both a linear and a quadratic coupling of the emitter to these modes. Under a polaron approach, we initially derive an analytical expression for the 1D pure dephasing rate, which leads to a reduced pure dephasing rate compared with bulk. By implementing these results into a full cavity quantum electrodynamic model, we demonstrate that multimode coupling is necessary to correctly predict the indistinguishability in a 1D system, which may otherwise be significantly underestimated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the quest toward realizing novel quantum matter in ultracold molecular gases, we perform a numerical study of evaporative cooling in ultracold gases of microwave-shielded polar fermionic molecules. Our Monte Carlo simulations incorporate accurate two-body elastic and inelastic scattering cross sections, realistic modeling of the optical dipole trap, and the influence of Pauli blocking at low temperatures. The simulations are benchmarked against data from evaporation studies performed with ultracold NaK molecules, showing excellent agreement. We further explore the prospects for optimizing the evaporation efficiency by varying the ramp rate and duration of the evaporation trajectory. Our simulation shows that it is possible to reach $&lt; 10\%$ of the Fermi temperature under optimal conditions even in the presence of two-body molecular losses.</description>

      <title>Extending Radiowave Frequency Detection Range with Dressed States of Solid-State Spin Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensors using solid-state spin defects excel in the detection of radiofrequency (RF) fields, serving various purposes in communication, ranging, and sensing. For this purpose, pulsed dynamical decoupling (PDD) protocols are typically applied, which enhance sensitivity to RF signals. However, these methods are limited to frequencies of a few megahertz, which poses a challenge for sensing higher frequencies. We introduce an alternative approach based on a continuous dynamical decoupling (CDD) scheme involving dressed states of nitrogen vacancy (NV) ensemble spins driven within a microwave resonator. We compare the CDD methods to established PDD protocols and demonstrate the detection of RF signals up to $\sim$ 85 MHz, about ten times the current limit imposed by the PDD approach under identical conditions. Implementing the CDD method in a heterodyne synchronized protocol combines the high frequency detection with high spectral resolution. This advancement extends to various domains requiring detection in the high frequency (HF) and very high frequency (VHF) ranges of the RF spectrum, including spin sensor-based magnetic resonance spectroscopy at high magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: We show that finding the classical bound of broad families of Bell inequalities can be naturally framed as the contraction of an associated tensor network, but in tropical algebra, where the sum is replaced by the minimum and the product is replaced by the arithmetic addition. We illustrate our method with paradigmatic examples both in the multipartite scenario and the bipartite scenario with multiple outcomes. We showcase how the method extends into the thermodynamic limit for some translationally invariant systems and establish a connection between the notions of tropical eigenvalue and the classical bound per particle as a fixed point of a tropical renormalization procedure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum theory features several phenomena which can be considered as resources for information processing tasks. Some of these effects, such as entanglement, arise in a nonlocal scenario, where a quantum state is distributed between different parties. Other phenomena, such as contextuality, can be observed if quantum states are prepared and then subjected to sequences of measurements. We use robust remote state preparation to connect the nonlocal and sequential scenarios and provide an intimate connection between different resources: We prove that entanglement in a nonlocal scenario can arise only if there is preparation and measurement contextuality in the corresponding sequential scenario and that the absence of entanglement implies the absence of contextuality. As a direct consequence, our result allows us to translate any inequality for testing preparation and measurement contextuality into an entanglement test; in addition, entanglement witnesses can be used to design novel contextuality inequalities.</description>

Abstract: We present an efficient scheme for the complete hyperentangled Bell state analysis (HBSA) of photon system with polarization and two longitudinal momentum degrees of freedom (DOFs), resorting to weak cross-Kerr nonlinearity, linear optical elements and single photon detectors. In the process of distinguishing the 64 hyperentangled Bell states in three DOFs, the self-assisted mechanism is embedded, which makes our scheme simple and realizable. Moreover, we have discussed the applications of this complete HBSA scheme for high-capacity quantum communication protocols that are based on photonic hyperentanglement in three DOFs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light is a key information carrier, enabling worldwide high-speed data transmission through a telecommunication fibre network. This information-carrying capacity can be extended to transmitting quantum information (QI) by encoding it in single photons -- flying qubits. However, various QI-processing platforms operate at vastly different timescales. QI-processing units in atomic media, operating within nanosecond to microsecond timescales, and high-speed quantum communication, at picosecond timescales, cannot be efficiently linked due to orders of magnitude mismatch in the timescales or, correspondingly, spectral linewidths. In this work, we develop a large-aperture time lens using complex high-bandwidth electro-optic phase modulation to bridge this gap. We demonstrate coherent, deterministic spectral bandwidth compression of quantum light pulses by more than two orders of magnitude with high efficiency. It will facilitate large-scale hybrid QI-processing by linking the ultrafast and quasi-continuous-wave experimental platforms, which until now, to a large extent, have been developing independently.</description>

      <title>Generation of Kochen-Specker contextual sets in higher dimensions by dimensional upscaling whose complexity does not scale with dimension and their applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, handling of contextual sets, in particular Kochen-Specker (KS) sets, in higher dimensions has been given an increasing attention, both theoretically and experimentally. However, methods of their generation are diverse, not generally applicable in every dimension, and of exponential complexity. Therefore, we design a dimensional upscaling method, whose complexity does not scale with dimension. As a proof of principle we generate manageable-sized KS master sets in up to 27 dimensional spaces and show that well over 32 dimensions can be reached. From these master sets we obtain an ample number of smaller KS sets. We discuss three kinds of applications that work with KS sets in higher dimensions. We anticipate other applications of KS sets for quantum information processing that make use of large families of nonisomorphic KS sets.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Quantum Circuit Construction Method for Mutually Unbiased Bases in $n$-Qubit Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) play a crucial role in numerous applications within quantum information science, such as quantum state tomography, error correction, entanglement detection, and quantum cryptography. Utilizing \(2^n + 1\) MUB circuits provides a minimal and optimal measurement strategy for reconstructing all \(n\)-qubit unknown states. It significantly reduces the number of measurements compared to the traditional \(4^n\) Pauli observables, also enhancing the robustness of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. Previous circuit designs that rely on a single generator can result in exponential gate costs for some MUB circuits. In this work, we present an efficient algorithm to generate each of the \(2^n + 1\) quantum MUB circuits on \(n\)-qubit systems within \(O(n^3)\) time. The algorithm features a three-stage structure, and we have calculated the average number of different gates for random sampling. Additionally, we have identified two linear properties: the entanglement part can be directly defined into \(2n - 3\) fixed sub-parts, and the knowledge of \(n\) special MUB circuits is sufficient to construct all \(2^n + 1\) MUB circuits. This new efficient and simple circuit construction paves the way for the implementation of a complete set of MUBs in diverse quantum information processing tasks on high-dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03838v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hayden-Preskill protocol probes the capability of information recovery from local subsystems after unitary dynamics. As such it resolves the capability of quantum many-body systems to dynamically implement a quantum error-correcting code. The transition to coding behavior has been mostly discussed using effective approaches, such as entanglement membrane theory. Here, we present exact results on the use of Hayden-Preskill recovery as a dynamical probe of scrambling in local quantum many-body systems. We investigate certain classes of unitary circuit models, both structured Floquet (dual-unitary) and Haar-random circuits. We discuss different dynamical signatures corresponding to information transport or scrambling, respectively, that go beyond effective approaches. Surprisingly, certain chaotic circuits transport information with perfect fidelity. In integrable dual-unitary circuits, we relate the information transmission to the propagation and scattering of quasiparticles. Using numerical and analytical insights, we argue that the qualitative features of information recovery extend away from these solvable points. Our results suggest that information recovery protocols can serve to distinguish chaotic and integrable behavior, and that they are sensitive to characteristic dynamical features, such as long-lived quasiparticles or dual-unitarity.</description>

      <title>A universal scheme to self-test any quantum state and extremal measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of quantum devices has raised a significant issue: how to certify the quantum properties of a device without placing trust in it. To characterise quantum states and measurements in a device-independent way, up to some degree of freedom, we can make use of a technique known as self-testing. While schemes have been proposed to self-test all pure multipartite entangled states (up to complex conjugation) and real local rank-one projective measurements, little has been done to certify mixed entangled states, composite or non-projective measurements. By employing the framework of quantum networks, we propose a scheme for self-testing (up to complex conjugation) arbitrary extremal measurements, including the projective ones, but also in an indirect way any quantum states, including the mixed ones. The quantum network considered in this work is the simple star network, which is implementable using current technologies. For our purposes, we also construct a scheme that can be used to self-test the two-dimensional tomographically complete set of measurements with an arbitrary number of parties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-local quantum master equations that describe open quantum systems beyond the limit of ultraweak system-bath coupling are often not of Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) form. Prominent examples are the Redfield equation approximating general open quantum systems and the Hu-Paz-Zhang equation exactly describing a damped harmonic oscillator. Here, we show that not only the former, but also the latter can be brought to pseudo-Lindblad form, with a dissipator that resembles that of a GKSL equation, except for the fact that some of the terms have negative weights. Moreover, we systematically investigate transformations that leave the dissipator of pseudo-Lindblad equations unchanged, while changing the relative weight between its positive and negative terms. These can be used to minimize the weights of the negative terms, which is optimal both for the convergence of a recently developed quantum-trajectory unraveling of pseudo-Lindblad equations as well as for the truncation of the negative terms to obtain a GKSL equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of higher-dimensional photonic encodings (qudits) instead of two-dimensional encodings (qubits) can improve the loss tolerance and reduce the computational resources of photonic-based quantum information processing. To harness this potential, efficient schemes for entangling operations such as the high-dimensional generalization of a linear optics Bell measurement will be required. We show how an efficient high-dimensional entangled state analyzer can be implemented with a linear optics interferometer and auxiliary photonic states. The degree of entanglement of the auxiliary state is much less than in previous protocols as quantified by an exponentially smaller Schmidt rank. In addition, the auxiliary state only occupies a single spatial mode, allowing it to be generated deterministically from a single quantum emitter coupled to a small qubit register. The reduced complexity of the auxiliary states results in a high robustness to imperfections and we show that auxiliary states with fidelities &gt; 0.9 for qudit dimensions 4 can be generated in the presence of qubit error rates on the order of 10%. This paves the way for experimental demonstrations with current hardware.</description>

Abstract: Microwave-driven logic is a promising alternative to laser control in scaling trapped-ion based quantum processors. However, such electronic gates have yet to match the speed offered by their laser-driven counterparts. Here, we implement M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen two-qubit gates on $^{43}\text{Ca}^+$ hyperfine clock qubits in a cryogenic ($\approx25~\text{K}$) surface trap, driven by near-field microwaves. We achieve gate durations of $154~\mu\text{s}$ (with $1.0(2)\%$ error) and $331~\mu\text{s}$ ($0.5(1)\%$ error), which approaches the performance of typical laser-driven gates. In the $331~\mu\text{s}$ gate, we demonstrate a new Walsh-modulated dynamical decoupling scheme which suppresses errors due to fluctuations in the qubit frequency as well as imperfections in the decoupling drive itself.</description>

Abstract: The goal of quantum metrology is to improve measurements' sensitivities by harnessing quantum resources. Metrologists often aim to maximize the quantum Fisher information, which bounds the measurement setup's sensitivity. In studies of fundamental limits on metrology, a paradigmatic setup features a qubit (spin-half system) subject to an unknown rotation. One obtains the maximal quantum Fisher information about the rotation if the spin begins in a state that maximizes the variance of the rotation-inducing operator. If the rotation axis is unknown, however, no optimal single-qubit sensor can be prepared. Inspired by simulations of closed timelike curves, we circumvent this limitation. We obtain the maximum quantum Fisher information about a rotation angle, regardless of the unknown rotation axis. To achieve this result, we initially entangle the probe qubit with an ancilla qubit. Then, we measure the pair in an entangled basis, obtaining more information about the rotation angle than any single-qubit sensor can achieve. We demonstrate this metrological advantage using a two-qubit superconducting quantum processor. Our measurement approach achieves a quantum advantage, outperforming every entanglement-free strategy.</description>

Abstract: The group symmetries inherent in quantum channels often make them tractable and applicable to various problems in quantum information theory. In this paper, we introduce natural probability distributions for covariant quantum channels. Specifically, this is achieved through the application of ``twirling operations'' on random quantum channels derived from the Stinespring representation that use Haar-distributed random isometries. We explore various types of group symmetries, including unitary and orthogonal covariance, hyperoctahedral covariance, diagonal orthogonal covariance (DOC), and analyze their properties related to quantum entanglement based on the model parameters. In particular, we discuss the threshold phenomenon for positive partial transpose and entanglement breaking properties, comparing thresholds among different classes of random covariant channels. Finally, we contribute to the PPT$^2$ conjecture by showing that the composition between two random DOC channels is generically entanglement breaking.</description>

      <title>Quantum One-Wayness of the Single-Round Sponge with Invertible Permutations</title>

Abstract: Sponge hashing is a widely used class of cryptographic hash algorithms which underlies the current international hash function standard SHA-3. In a nutshell, a sponge function takes as input a bit-stream of any length and processes it via a simple iterative procedure: it repeatedly feeds each block of the input into a so-called block function, and then produces a digest by once again iterating the block function on the final output bits. While much is known about the post-quantum security of the sponge construction when the block function is modeled as a random function or one-way permutation, the case of invertible permutations, which more accurately models the construction underlying SHA-3, has so far remained a fundamental open problem.
  In this work, we make new progress towards overcoming this barrier and show several results. First, we prove the "double-sided zero-search" conjecture proposed by Unruh (eprint' 2021) and show that finding zero-pairs in a random $2n$-bit permutation requires at least $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ many queries -- and this is tight due to Grover's algorithm. At the core of our proof lies a novel "symmetrization argument" which uses insights from the theory of Young subgroups. Second, we consider more general variants of the double-sided search problem and show similar query lower bounds for them. As an application, we prove the quantum one-wayness of the single-round sponge with invertible permutations in the quantum random oracle model.</description>

      <title>A new approach towards quantum foundation and some consequences</title>

Abstract: A general theory based upon 6 postulates is introduced. The basical notions are theoretical variables that are associated with an observer or with a group of communicating observers. These variables may be accessible or inaccessible. From these postulates, the ordinary formalism of quantum theory is derived. The mathematical derivations are not given in this article, but I refer to the recent articles [9, 10]. Three possible applications of the general theory can be given; 1) The variables may decision variables connected to the decisions of a person or of a group of persons. 2) The variables may be statistical parameters or future data, But most importantly here: 3) The variables are physical variables in some context. This last application gives a completely new foundation of quantum mechanics, a foundation which in my opinion is much more easy to understand than the ordinary formalism.The other applications seem also to give interesting consequences of the approach. Socalled paradoxes like that of Schr\"odinger's cat can be clarified under the theory. Explanations of the outcomes of David Bohm's version of the EPR experiment and of the Bell experiment are provided. Finally, references to links towards relativity theory and to quantum field theory are given. The concluding remarks point at further possible developments.</description>

Abstract: In the past decade, the toolkit of quantum information has been expanded to include processes in which the basic operations do not have definite causal relations. Originally considered in the context of the unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity, these causally indefinite processes have been shown to offer advantages in a wide variety of quantum information processing tasks, ranging from quantum computation to quantum metrology. Here we overview these advantages and the experimental efforts to realise them. We survey both the different experimental techniques employed, as well as theoretical methods developed in support of the experiments, before discussing the interpretations of current experimental results and giving an outlook on the future of the field.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the advantages of using autoregressive neural quantum states as ansatze for classical shadow tomography to improve its predictive power. We introduce a novel estimator for optimizing the cross-entropy loss function using classical shadows, and a new importance sampling strategy for estimating the loss gradient during training using stabilizer samples collected from classical shadows. We show that this loss function can be used to achieve stable reconstruction of GHZ states using a transformer-based neural network trained on classical shadow measurements. This loss function also enables the training of neural quantum states representing purifications of mixed states. Our results show that the intrinsic capability of autoregressive models in representing physically well-defined density matrices allows us to overcome the weakness of Pauli-based classical shadow tomography in predicting both high-weight observables and nonlinear observables such as the purity of pure and mixed states.</description>

Abstract: Satellite quantum communication is a promising way to build long distance quantum links, making it an essential complement to optical fiber for quantum internetworking beyond metropolitan scales. A satellite point to point optical link differs from the more common fiber links in many ways, both quantitative (higher latency, strong losses) and qualitative (nonconstant parameter values during satellite passage, intermittency of the link, impossibility to set repeaters between the satellite and the ground station). We study here the performance of a quantum link between two ground stations, using a quantum-memory-equipped satellite as a quantum repeater. In contrast with quantum key distribution satellite links, the number of available quantum memory slots m, together with the unavoidable round-trip communication latency t of at least a few milliseconds, severely reduces the effective average repetition rate to m/t -- at most a few kilohertz for foreseeable quantum memories. Our study uses two approaches, which validate each other: 1) a simple analytical model of the effective rate of the quantum link; 2) an event-based simulation using the open source Quantum Internet Simulation Package (QuISP). The important differences between satellite and fiber links led us to modify QuISP itself. This work paves the way to the study of hybrid satellite- and fiber-based quantum repeater networks interconnecting different metropolitan areas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07592v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fighting against noise is crucial for NISQ devices to demonstrate practical quantum applications. In this work, we give a new paradigm of quantum error mitigation based on the vectorization of density matrices. Different from the ideas of existing quantum error mitigation methods that try to distill noiseless information from noisy quantum states, our proposal directly changes the way of encoding information and maps the density matrices of noisy quantum states to noiseless pure states, which is realized by a novel and NISQ-friendly measurement protocol and a classical post-processing procedure. Our protocol requires no knowledge of the noise model, no ability to tune the noise strength, and no ancilla qubits for complicated controlled unitaries. Under our encoding, NISQ devices are always preparing pure quantum states which are highly desired resources for variational quantum algorithms to have good performance in many tasks. We show how this protocol can be well-fitted into variational quantum algorithms. We give several concrete ansatz constructions that are suitable for our proposal and do theoretical analysis on the sampling complexity, the expressibility, and the trainability. We also give a discussion on how this protocol is influenced by large noise and how it can be well combined with other quantum error mitigation protocols. The effectiveness of our proposal is demonstrated by various numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on the presentation and evaluation of the high-level quantum programming language Eclipse Qrisp. The presented framework, used for developing and compiling quantum algorithms, is measured in terms of efficiency for its implementation of the Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) Module. We measure this efficiency and compare it against two alternative QAOA algorithm implementations using IBM's Qiskit toolkit. The evaluation process has been carried out over a benchmark composed of 15 instances of the well-known Maximum Cut Problem. Through this preliminary experimentation, Eclipse Qrisp demonstrated promising results, outperforming both versions of its counterparts in terms of results quality and circuit complexity.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid development of quantum science and technology, quantum batteries have also emerged. However, there are still many unresolved issues in the field of quantum batteries. For example, how to improve battery space utilization, maximize battery energy storage, and how to increase and control the charging power of quantum batteries. A major challenge is how to achieve better charging power without reducing the energy storage of the quantum batteries. Here, we propose a controllable dual-cavity quantum battery which can increase the charging power without diminishing capacity of the quantum batteries by manipulating the number of atoms . This control method can effectively adjust the charging power of quantum batteries from $N^2$ times to $N^2.5$ times, and even to $N^3$ times. By adjusting the number of atoms, quantum batteries can achieve theoretical "fast charging" and "slow charging".</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The feedback-based algorithm for quantum optimization (FALQON) has recently been proposed to solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems. This paper efficiently generalizes FALQON to tackle quadratic constrained binary optimization (QCBO) problems. For this purpose, we introduce a new operator that encodes the problem's solution as its ground state. Using Lyapunov control theory, we design a quantum control system such that the state converges to the ground state of this operator. When applied to the QCBO problem, we show that our proposed algorithm saves computational resources by reducing the depth of the quantum circuit and can perform better than FALQON. The effectiveness of our proposed algorithm is further illustrated through numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: We introduce two uncertainty relations based on the state-dependent norm of commutators, utilizing generalizations of the B\"ottcher-Wenzel inequality. The first relation is mathematically proven, while the second, tighter relation is strongly supported by numerical evidence. Both relations surpass the conventional Robertson and Schr\"odinger bounds, particularly as the quantum state becomes increasingly mixed. This reveals a previously undetected complementarity of quantum uncertainty, stemming from the non-commutativity of observables. We also compare our results with the Luo-Park uncertainty relation, demonstrating that our bounds can outperform especially for mutually unbiased observables.</description>

Abstract: Minimizing both experimental effort and consumption of valuable quantum resources in state estimation is vital in practical quantum information processing. Here, we explore characterizing states as an additional benefit of the entanglement distillation protocols. We show that the Bell-diagonal parameters of any undistilled state can be efficiently estimated solely from the measurement statistics of probabilistic distillation protocols. We further introduce the state estimator `Disti-Mator' designed specifically for a realistic experimental setting, and exhibit its robustness through numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate that a separate estimation protocol can be circumvented whenever distillation is an indispensable communication-based task.</description>

Abstract: In recent years there has been an increasing interest on the theoretical and experimental investigation of space-time dual quantum circuits. They exhibit unique properties and have applications to diverse fields. Periodic space-time dual quantum circuits are of special interest, due to their iterative structure defined by the Floquet operator. A very similar iterative structure naturally appears in Quantum Signal processing (QSP), which has emerged as a framework that embodies all the known quantum algorithms. However, it is yet unclear whether there is deeper relation between these two apparently different concepts. In this work, we establish a relation between a circuit defining a Floquet operator in a single period and its space-time dual defining QSP sequences for the Lie algebra sl$(2,\mathbb{C})$, which is the complexification of su$(2)$. First, we show that our complexified QSP sequences can be interpreted in terms of action of the Lorentz group on density matrices and that they can be interpreted as hybrid circuits involving unitaries and measurements. We also show that unitary representations of our QSP sequences exist, although they are infinite-dimensional and are defined for bosonic operators in the Heisenberg picture. Finally, we also show the relation between our complexified QSP and the nonlinear Fourier transform for sl$(2,\mathbb{C})$, which is a generalization of the previous results on su$(2)$ QSP.</description>

Abstract: A coupling between Earths rotation and orbital angular momentum (OAM), known as the Sagnac effect, is observed in entangled neutrons produced using a spin echo interferometer. After correction for instrument systematics the measured coupling is within 5% of theory, with an uncertainty of 7.2%. The OAM in our setup is transverse to the propagation direction and scales linearly with wavelength (4 A - 12.75 A), hence the coupling can be varied, without mechanically rotating the device. Therefore, the systematic error is lower than in previous experiments. The detected transverse OAM of our beam corresponds to 4098 +- 295 hbar A-1, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous neutron experiments, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of using the Sagnac effect to definitively measure neutron OAM and paving the way towards observations of the quantum Sagnac effect</description>

      <title>Tight lower bound on the error exponent of classical-quantum channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental quantity of interest in Shannon theory, classical or quantum, is the error exponent of a given channel $W$ and rate $R$: the constant $E(W,R)$ which governs the exponential decay of decoding error when using ever larger optimal codes of fixed rate $R$ to communicate over ever more (memoryless) instances of a given channel $W$. Nearly matching lower and upper bounds are well-known for classical channels. Here I show a lower bound on the error exponent of communication over arbitrary classical-quantum (CQ) channels which matches Dalai's sphere-packing upper bound [IEEE TIT 59, 8027 (2013)] for rates above a critical value, exactly analogous to the case of classical channels. This proves a conjecture made by Holevo in his investigation of the problem [IEEE TIT 46, 2256 (2000)].
  Unlike the classical case, however, the argument does not proceed via a refined analysis of a suitable decoder, but instead by leveraging a bound by Hayashi on the error exponent of the cryptographic task of privacy amplification [CMP 333, 335 (2015)]. This bound is then related to the coding problem via tight entropic uncertainty relations and Gallager's method of constructing capacity-achieving parity-check codes for arbitrary channels. Along the way, I find a lower bound on the error exponent of the task of compression of classical information relative to quantum side information that matches the sphere-packing upper bound of Cheng et al. [IEEE TIT 67, 902 (2021)]. In turn, the polynomial prefactors to the sphere-packing bound found by Cheng et al. may be translated to the privacy amplification problem, sharpening a recent result by Li, Yao, and Hayashi [IEEE TIT 69, 1680 (2023)], at least for linear randomness extractors.</description>

      <title>Frequency dependence of nonsequential double ionization of atoms in strong laser fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The frequency dependence of (nonsequential) double ionization is studied in fully quantum mechanical calculations using a (1+1)-dimensional model atom. Other time-dependent effects such as the influence of the number of field cycles are also investigated. We present ionization yields and momentum distributions. The results are consistent with experimental and semi-classical data available in the literature, thus complementing them with a quantum mechanical description.</description>

      <title>Parameter Generation of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm with Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing presents a compelling prospect for revolutionizing the field of combinatorial optimization, in virtue of the unique attributes of quantum mechanics such as superposition and entanglement. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), which is a variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, stands out as leading proposals to efficiently solve the Max-Cut problem, a representative example of combinatorial optimization. However, its promised advantages strongly rely on parameters initialization strategy, a critical aspect due to the non-convex and complex optimization landscapes characterized by low-quality local minima issues. Therefore, in this work, we formulate the problem of finding good initial parameters as a generative task in which the generative machine learning model, specifically the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), is trained to generate high-performing initial parameters for QAOA. The diffusion model is capable of learning the distribution of high-performing parameters and then synthesizing new parameters closer to optimal ones. Experiments with various sized Max-Cut problem instances demonstrate that our diffusion process consistently enhances QAOA effectiveness compared to random parameters initialization. Moreover, our framework indicates the capacity of training on small, classically simulatable problem instances, aiming at extrapolating to larger instances to reduce quantum computational resource overhead.</description>

      <title>Interferometry of non-Abelian band singularities and Euler class topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In systems with a real Bloch Hamiltonian band nodes can be characterised by a non-Abelian frame-rotation charge. The ability of these band nodes to annihilate pairwise is path dependent, since by braiding nodes in adjacent gaps the sign of their charges can be changed. Here, we theoretically construct and numerically confirm two concrete methods to experimentally probe these non-Abelian braiding processes and charges in ultracold atomic systems. We consider a coherent superposition of two bands that can be created by moving atoms through the band singularities at some angle in momentum space. Analyzing the dependency of excitations on the frame charges, we demonstrate an interferometry scheme passing through two band nodes, which reveals the relative frame charges and allows for measuring the multi-gap topological invariant. The second method relies on a single wavepacket probing two nodes sequentially, where the frame charges can be determined from the band populations. Our results present a feasible avenue for measuring non-Abelian charges of band nodes and the direct experimental verification of braiding procedures, which can be applied in a variety of settings including the recently discovered anomalous non-Abelian phases arising under periodic driving.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform readout of a quantum-dot hybrid qubit coupled to a superconducting resonator through a parametric, longitudinal interaction mechanism. Our experiments are performed with the qubit and resonator frequencies detuned by $\sim$10 GHz, demonstrating that longitudinal coupling can facilitate semiconductor qubit operation in the 'ultra-dispersive' regime of circuit quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of Different Quantum Kernels on the Classification Performance of Support Vector Machine Algorithm: A Medical Dataset Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The support vector machine algorithm with a quantum kernel estimator (QSVM-Kernel), as a leading example of a quantum machine learning technique, has undergone significant advancements. Nevertheless, its integration with classical data presents unique challenges. While quantum computers primarily interact with data in quantum states, embedding classical data into quantum states using feature mapping techniques is essential for leveraging quantum algorithms Despite the recognized importance of feature mapping, its specific impact on data classification outcomes remains largely unexplored. This study addresses this gap by comprehensively assessing the effects of various feature mapping methods on classification results, taking medical data analysis as a case study. In this study, the QSVM-Kernel method was applied to classification problems in two different and publicly available medical datasets, namely, the Wisconsin Breast Cancer (original) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Glioma datasets. In the QSVM-Kernel algorithm, quantum kernel matrices obtained from 9 different quantum feature maps were used. Thus, the effects of these quantum feature maps on the classification results of the QSVM-Kernel algorithm were examined in terms of both classifier performance and total execution time. As a result, in the Wisconsin Breast Cancer (original) and TCGA Glioma datasets, when Rx and Ry rotational gates were used, respectively, as feature maps in the QSVM-Kernel algorithm, the best classification performances were achieved both in terms of classification performance and total execution time. The contributions of this study are that (1) it highlights the significant impact of feature mapping techniques on medical data classification outcomes using the QSVM-Kernel algorithm, and (2) it also guides undertaking research for improved QSVM classification performance.</description>
