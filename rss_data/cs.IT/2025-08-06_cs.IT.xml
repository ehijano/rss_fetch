      <title>Exponential convergence rate for Iterative Markovian Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the discrete-time Schr\"odinger bridge problem on a finite state space. Although it has been known that the Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) algorithm converges in Kullback-Leibler divergence to the ground truth solution, the speed of that convergence remained unquantified. In this work, we establish for the first time that IMF exhibits exponential convergence with an explicit contraction factor.</description>

      <title>Distributed Source Coding for Compressing Vector-Linear Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by mobile satellite communication systems and the important and prevalent applications of computational tasks, we consider a distributed source coding model for compressing vector-linear functions, which consists of multiple sources, multiple encoders and a decoder linked to all the encoders. Each encoder has access to a certain subset of the sources and the decoder is required to compute with zero error a vector-linear function of the source information, which corresponds to a matrix $T$. The connectivity state between the sources and the encoders and the vector-linear function are all arbitrary. In the paper, we are interested in the function-compression capacity to measure the efficiency of using the system. We first present a general lower bound on the function-compression capacity applicable to arbitrary connectivity states and vector-linear functions. Next, we confine to the nontrivial models with only three sources and no more than three encoders, and prove that all the $3\times2$ column-full-rank matrices $T$ can be divided into two types $T_1$ and $T_2$, for which the function-compression capacities are identical if the matrices $T$ have the same type. We explicitly characterize the function-compression capacities for two most nontrivial models associated with $T_2$ by a novel approach of both upper bounding and lower bounding the size of image sets of encoding functions. This shows that the lower bound thus obtained is not always tight. Rather, by completely characterizing their capacities, the lower bound is tight for all the models associated with $T_1$ and all the models associated with $T_2$ except for the two most nontrivial models. We finally apply the obtained results to network function computation and answer the open problem whether the best known upper bound proved by Guang et. al. (2019) on computing capacity is in general asymptotically tight.</description>

      <title>Multilevel inserting constructions for constant dimension subspace codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subspace codes, especially constant dimension subspace codes (CDCs), represent an intriguing domain that can be used to conduct basic coding theory investigations. They have received widespread attention due to their applications in random network coding. This paper presents inverse bilateral multilevel construction by introducing inverse bilateral identifying vectors and inverse bilateral Ferrers diagram rank-metric codes. By inserting the inverse bilateral multilevel construction into the double multilevel construction and bilateral multilevel construction, an effective construction for CDCs is provided. Furthermore, via providing a new set of bilateral identifying vectors, we give another efficient construction for CDCs. In this article, several CDCs are exhibited, equipped with the rank-metric, with larger sizes than the known ones in the existing literature. From a practical standpoint, our results could help in the pragmatic framework of constant-dimension-lifted rank-metric codes for applications in network coding. The ratio of the new lower bound to the known upper bound for some CDCs is calculated, which is greater than 0.94548 for any prime power $q \geq 3.$</description>

      <title>Channel Coding for Unequal Error Protection in Digital Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication is an emerging paradigm that prioritizes transmitting task-relevant information over accurately delivering raw data bits. In this paper, we address an unequal error protection (UEP) problem in digital semantic communication, where bits of higher semantic importance require stronger protection. To quantify bit-level importance, we leverage bit-flip probabilities of semantic bits as target error protection levels, which are jointly learned with semantic encoder and decoder. We propose two novel channel coding frameworks aimed at minimizing the total blocklength while satisfying UEP constraints. First, we develop a bit-level UEP framework based on repetition coding, in which the repetition number for each bit is optimized to precisely meet its target bit-flip probability. Second, we introduce a block-level UEP framework utilizing modern channel codes, where semantic bits with similar target bit-flip probabilities are grouped to exploit coding gains. Within this framework, we propose a bit-grouping algorithm guided by finite blocklength capacity analysis. Simulation results conducted on image transmission tasks confirm that the proposed frameworks significantly outperform conventional approaches, yielding substantial improvements in both task performance and transmission efficiency.</description>

      <title>Dual Domain Expurgated Error Exponents for Source Coding with Side Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an expurgation method for source coding with side information that enables direct dual-domain derivations of expurgated error exponents. Dual-domain methods yield optimization problems over few parameters, with any sub-optimal choice resulting in an achievable exponent, as opposed to primal-domain optimization over distributions. In addition, dual-domain methods naturally allow for general alphabets and/or memory. We derive two such expurgated error exponents for different random-coding ensembles. We show the better of the exponents coincides with the Csisz\'ar-K\"orner exponent obtained via a graph decomposition lemma. We show some numerical examples that illustrate the differences between the two exponents and show that in the case of source coding without side information, the expurgated exponent coincides with the error exponent of the source optimal code.</description>

      <title>Decoding Algorithms for Twisted GRS Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted generalized Reed-Solomon (TGRS) codes were introduced to extend the algebraic capabilities of classical generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes. This extension holds the potential for constructing new non-GRS maximum distance separable (MDS) codes and enhancing cryptographic security. It is known that TGRS codes with $1$ twist can either be MDS or near-MDS. In this paper, we employ the Gaussian elimination method to propose new decoding algorithms for MDS TGRS codes with parameters $[n,k,n-k+1]$. The algorithms can correct up to $\lfloor \frac{n-k}{2}\rfloor$ errors when $n-k$ is odd, and $\lfloor \frac{n-k}{2}\rfloor-1$ errors when $n-k$ is even. The computational complexity for both scenarios is $O(n^3)$. %, where $\omega\approx 2.37286$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. Our approach diverges from existing methods based on Euclidean algorithm and addresses situations that have not been considered in the existing literature \cite{SYJL}. Furthermore, this method is also applicable to decoding near-MDS TGRS codes with parameters $[n, k, n-k]$, enabling correction of up to $\lfloor \frac{n-k-1}{2} \rfloor$ errors, while maintaining polynomial time complexity in $n$.</description>

      <title>What If, But Privately: Private Counterfactual Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transparency and explainability are two important aspects to be considered when employing black-box machine learning models in high-stake applications. Providing counterfactual explanations is one way of catering this requirement. However, this also poses a threat to the privacy of the institution that is providing the explanation, as well as the user who is requesting it. In this work, we are primarily concerned with the user's privacy who wants to retrieve a counterfactual instance, without revealing their feature vector to the institution. Our framework retrieves the exact nearest neighbor counterfactual explanation from a database of accepted points while achieving perfect, information-theoretic, privacy for the user. First, we introduce the problem of private counterfactual retrieval (PCR) and propose a baseline PCR scheme that keeps the user's feature vector information-theoretically private from the institution. Building on this, we propose two other schemes that reduce the amount of information leaked about the institution database to the user, compared to the baseline scheme. Second, we relax the assumption of mutability of all features, and consider the setting of immutable PCR (I-PCR). Here, the user retrieves the nearest counterfactual without altering a private subset of their features, which constitutes the immutable set, while keeping their feature vector and immutable set private from the institution. For this, we propose two schemes that preserve the user's privacy information-theoretically, but ensure varying degrees of database privacy. Third, we extend our PCR and I-PCR schemes to incorporate user's preference on transforming their attributes, so that a more actionable explanation can be received. Finally, we present numerical results to support our theoretical findings, and compare the database leakage of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>A Wireless Foundation Model for Multi-Task Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05938v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing complexity and dynamics of the mobile communication networks, accurately predicting key system parameters, such as channel state information (CSI), user location, and network traffic, has become essential for a wide range of physical (PHY)-layer and medium access control (MAC)-layer tasks. Although traditional deep learning (DL)-based methods have been widely applied to such prediction tasks, they often struggle to generalize across different scenarios and tasks. In response, we propose a unified foundation model for multi-task prediction in wireless networks that supports diverse prediction intervals. The proposed model enforces univariate decomposition to unify heterogeneous tasks, encodes granularity for interval awareness, and uses a causal Transformer backbone for accurate predictions. Additionally, we introduce a patch masking strategy during training to support arbitrary input lengths. After trained on large-scale datasets, the proposed foundation model demonstrates strong generalization to unseen scenarios and achieves zero-shot performance on new tasks that surpass traditional full-shot baselines.</description>

      <title>Orbit recovery for spherical functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbit recovery is a central problem in both mathematics and applied sciences, with important applications to structural biology. This paper focuses on recovering generic orbits of functions on ${\mathbb R}^{n}$ and the sphere $S^{n-1}$ under the rotation action of $SO(n)$. Specifically, we demonstrate that invariants of degree three (called the bispectrum) suffice to recover generic orbits of functions in finite-dimensional approximations of $L^2({\mathbb R}^n)$ obtained by band-limiting the spherical component and discretizing the radial direction. In particular, our main result explicitly bounds the number of samples in the radial direction required for recovery from the degree three invariants. From an application perspective, the most important case is $SO(3)$, which arises in many scientific fields, and in particular, plays a central role in leading structural biology applications such as cryo-electron tomography and cryo-electron microscopy. Our result for $SO(3)$ states that considering three spherical shells (i.e., samples in the radial direction) is sufficient to recover generic orbits, which verifies an implicit conjecture made in a paper of Bandeira et al. Our proof technique provides an explicit, computationally efficient algorithm to recover the signal by successively solving systems of linear equations. We implemented this algorithm and demonstrated its effectiveness on two protein structures.</description>

      <title>A Novel Hybrid Optical and STAR IRS System for NTN Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) system that integrates optical intelligent reflecting surfaces (OIRS) and simultaneous transmitting and reflecting Intelligent reflecting surfaces (STAR-IRS) to address critical challenges in next-generation communication networks. The proposed system model features a signal transmitted from the optical ground station (OGS) to the earth station (ES) via an OIRS mounted horizontally on a high altitude platform (HAP). The ES uses an amplify-and-forward (AF) relay with fixed gain for signal relaying, which is then transmitted through a STAR-IRS vertically installed on a building to facilitate communication with both indoor and outdoor users. The FSO link incorporates (multiple-input multiple-output) MIMO technology, and this paper develops a channel model specifically designed for scenarios where the number of OIRS units exceeds one. For the radio-frequency (RF) link, a novel and highly precise approximation method is introduced, offering superior accuracy compared to traditional approaches based on the central limit theorem (CLT). Closed-form analytical expressions for key performance metrics, including outage probability (OP), ergodic capacity and average bit error rate (BER) are derived in terms of the bivariate Fox-H function for this novel five hops system. Asymptotic expressions at high SNR are also presented, providing insights into system diversity order.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Selectivity in State Space Models: A Minimal Predictive Sufficiency Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), particularly recent selective variants like Mamba, have emerged as a leading architecture for sequence modeling, challenging the dominance of Transformers. However, the success of these state-of-the-art models largely relies on heuristically designed selective mechanisms, which lack a rigorous first-principle derivation. This theoretical gap raises questions about their optimality and robustness against spurious correlations. To address this, we introduce the Principle of Predictive Sufficiency, a novel information-theoretic criterion stipulating that an ideal hidden state should be a minimal sufficient statistic of the past for predicting the future. Based on this principle, we propose the Minimal Predictive Sufficiency State Space Model (MPS-SSM), a new framework where the selective mechanism is guided by optimizing an objective function derived from our principle. This approach encourages the model to maximally compress historical information without losing predictive power, thereby learning to ignore non-causal noise and spurious patterns. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmark datasets demonstrate that MPS-SSM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing models in long-term forecasting and noisy scenarios, but also exhibits superior robustness. Furthermore, we show that the MPS principle can be extended as a general regularization framework to enhance other popular architectures, highlighting its broad potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted federated learning (FL) framework that jointly optimizes UAV trajectory, user participation, power allocation, and data volume control to minimize overall system energy consumption. We begin by deriving the convergence accuracy of the FL model under multiple local updates, enabling a theoretical understanding of how user participation and data volume affect FL learning performance. The resulting joint optimization problem is non-convex; to address this, we employ alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to convexify the non-convex constraints, leading to the design of an iterative energy consumption optimization (ECO) algorithm. Simulation results confirm that ECO consistently outperform existing baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>The alpha-beta divergence for real and complex data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Divergences are fundamental to the information criteria that underpin most signal processing algorithms. The alpha-beta family of divergences, designed for non-negative data, offers a versatile framework that parameterizes and continuously interpolates several separable divergences found in existing literature. This work extends the definition of alpha-beta divergences to accommodate complex data, specifically when the arguments of the divergence are complex vectors. This novel formulation is designed in such a way that, by setting the divergence hyperparameters to unity, it particularizes to the well-known Euclidean and Mahalanobis squared distances. Other choices of hyperparameters yield practical separable and non-separable extensions of several classical divergences. In the context of the problem of approximating a complex random vector, the centroid obtained by optimizing the alpha-beta mean distortion has a closed-form expression, which interpretation sheds light on the distinct roles of the divergence hyperparameters. These contributions may have wide potential applicability, as there are many signal processing domains in which the underlying data are inherently complex.</description>

      <title>Optimal quantum locally recoverable codes from matrix-product construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locally recoverable codes (LRCs) are classical error-correcting codes widely used in large scale distributed and cloud storage systems. Quantum locally recoverable codes (quantum LRCs) are the quantum counterpart of classical LRCs. They allow us to correct erasures at several positions from a trace-preserving quantum operation acting on qudits of a larger set of positions. Parameters and localities of quantum LRCs satisfy a Singleton-like bound; codes attaching this bound are named to be optimal. Quantum LRCs, $\mathcal{Q}(\mathcal{C})$, can be constructed from classical Hermitian (or Euclidean) dual containing codes $\mathcal{C}$, and their recovery abilities are upper bounded by the minimum distance of the Hermitian (or Euclidean) dual of those codes.
  We consider matrix-product codes (MPCs) $\mathcal{C}$ and give constituent matrices and conditions on the constituent codes such that the codes $\mathcal{C}$ satisfy the conditions to provide quantum LRCs. As consequence, we are able to provide the locality and parameters of the quantum LRCs $\mathcal{Q}(\mathcal{C})$ and determine families of optimal quantum LRCs derived from them.</description>

      <title>A New Construction of Non-Binary Deletion Correcting Codes and their Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-binary codes correcting multiple deletions have recently attracted a lot of attention. In this work, we focus on multiplicity-free codes, a family of non-binary codes where all symbols are distinct. Our main contribution is a new explicit construction of such codes, based on set and permutation codes. We show that our multiplicity-free codes can correct multiple deletions and provide a decoding algorithm. We also show that, for a certain regime of parameters, our constructed codes have size larger than all the previously known non-binary codes correcting multiple deletions.</description>

      <title>Low Complexity Artificial Noise Aided Beam Focusing Design in Near-Field Terahertz Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel low-complexity artificial noise (AN) aided beam focusing scheme in a near-field terahertz wiretap communication system. In this system, the base station (BS) equipped with a large-scale array transmits signals to a legitimate user, while mitigating information leakage to an eavesdropper. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the secrecy rate achieved at the legitimate user and solve it by designing the optimal beam focusing and power allocation. Numerical results demonstrate the significant performance improvement achieved by the proposed AN aided beam focusing scheme, especially when the eavesdropper is located closer to the BS than the legitimate user.</description>

      <title>Self-orthogonal codes from plateaued functions and their applications in quantum codes and LCD codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-orthogonal codes have received great attention due to their important applications in quantum codes, LCD codes and lattices. Recently, several families of self-orthogonal codes containing the all-$1$ vector were constructed by augmentation technique. In this paper, utilizing plateaued functions, we construct some classes of linear codes which do not contain the all-$1$ vector. We also investigate their punctured codes. The weight distributions of the constructed codes are explicitly determined. Under certain conditions, these codes are proved to be self-orthogonal. Furthermore, some classes of optimal linear codes are obtained from their duals. Using the self-orthogonal punctured codes, we also construct several new families of at least almost optimal quantum codes and optimal LCD codes.</description>

      <title>Optimality of Frequency Moment Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the second frequency moment of a stream up to $(1\pm\varepsilon)$ multiplicative error requires at most $O(\log n / \varepsilon^2)$ bits of space, due to a seminal result of Alon, Matias, and Szegedy. It is also known that at least $\Omega(\log n + 1/\varepsilon^{2})$ space is needed. We prove an optimal lower bound of $\Omega\left(\log \left(n \varepsilon^2 \right) / \varepsilon^2\right)$ for all $\varepsilon = \Omega(1/\sqrt{n})$. Note that when $\varepsilon&gt;n^{-1/2 + c}$, where $c&gt;0$, our lower bound matches the classic upper bound of AMS. For smaller values of $\varepsilon$ we also introduce a revised algorithm that improves the classic AMS bound and matches our lower bound.</description>
