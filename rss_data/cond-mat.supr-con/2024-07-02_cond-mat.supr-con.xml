      <title>Novel Skyrmion and spin wave solutions in superconducting ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coexistence of Ferromagnetism and superconductivity in so called ferromagnetic superconductors is an intriguing phenomenon which may lead to novel physical effects as well as applications. Here in this work we have explored the interplay of topological excitations, namely vortices and skyrmions, in ferromagnetic superconductors using a field theoretic description of such systems. In particular, numerical solutions for the continuous spin field compatible to a given vortex profile are determined in absence and presence of a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) term. The solutions show that the spin configuration is like a skyrmion but intertwined with the vortex structure -- the radius of the the skyrmion-like solution depends on the penetration depth and also the polarity of the skyrmion depends on the sign of the winding number. Thus our solution describes a novel topological structure -- namely a skyrmion-vortex composite. We have also determined the spin wave solutions in such systems in presence and absence of a vortex. In absence of vortex frequency and wave vector satisfy a cubic equation which leads to various interesting features. In particular, we have shown that in the low frequency regime the minimum in dispersion relation shifts from $k=0$ to a non zero $k$ value depending on the parameters. We also discuss the nature of spin wave dispersion in the $\omega \sim \Tilde{m}$ regime which shows a similar pattern in the dispersion curve. The group velocity of the spin wave would change it's sign across such a minimum which is unique to FMSC. Also, the spin wave modes around the local minimum looks like roton mode in superfluid and hence called a magnetic roton. In presence of a vortex, the spin wave amplitude is shown to vary spatially such that the profile looks like that of a N\'eel Skyrmion. Possible experimental signature of both solutions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Unified picture of superconductivity and magnetism in CeRh$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the micorscopic origin of the multiple superconducting and magnetic phases observed in CeRh$_2$As$_2$. We exploit the existence of a van Hove singularity enforced by the nonsymmorphic symmetry to conduct a renormalization group analysis. When Fermi-surface nesting is strong, we find two closely-competing superconducting states with opposite parities, as well as an instability towards specific spin-density wave states, consistent with key features of the phase diagram of CeRh$_2$As$_2$.</description>

      <title>Spin supercurrent in superconductor/ferromagnet van-der-Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dissipationless spin transport induced by a charge supercurrent in a monolayer van der Waals superconductor under the applied magnetic field and in a bilayer superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) heterostructure with no external field. It is shown that in both cases a combined action of the Ising-type spin-orbit coupling and the Zeeman field results in appearance of a nonunitary superconducting triplet correlations with nonzero average Cooper pair spin, which carry spin current in the presence of a condensate motion. Properties of this dissipationless spin current are investigated. In particular, it is shown that it manifests a rectification effect. In addition, in S/F heterostructures the amplitude and the sign of the spin current are controlled by gating.</description>

      <title>Pair Density Waves and Supercurrent Diode Effect in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic altermagnets are unusual collinear magnets that feature zero net magnetization with momentum-dependent spin splitting. Here, we show that this spin splitting can induce pair density wave states even in the absence of external magnetic fields. Focusing on BCS-type attractive interactions, we find the stabilization of symmetrically distinct pair density wave states depending on the chemical potential. These states include Fulde-Ferrell and Fulde-Ferrell* states, both of which break inversion symmetry. We investigate the supercurrent properties and discover non-reciprocal supercurrents for both the Fulde-Ferrell and Fulde-Ferrell* states with distinct spatial dependencies. We propose that the supercurrent diode effect can serve as an experimental tool for distinguishing between different pair density waves in metallic altermagnets and discuss the relation to material candidates.</description>

      <title>Crystalline-Symmetry-Protected Majorana Modes in Coupled Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimalist architecture for achieving various crystalline-symmetry-protected Majorana modes in an array of coupled quantum dots. Our framework is motivated by the recent experimental demonstrations of two-site and three-site artificial Kitaev chains in a similar setup. We find that introducing a $\pi$-phase domain wall in the Kitaev chain leads to a pair of mirror-protected Majorana zero modes located at or near the junction. Joining two $\pi$-junctions into a closed loop, we can simulate two distinct classes of two-dimensional higher-order topological superconducting phases, both carrying symmetry-protected Majorana modes around the sample corners. As an extension of the $\pi$-junction, we further consider a general vertex structure where $n$ Kitaev chains meet, i.e., a Kitaev $n$-vertex. We prove that such an $n$-vertex, if respecting a dihedral symmetry group $D_n$, necessarily carries $n$ vertex-bound Majorana modes protected by the $D_n$ symmetry. Resilience of the junction and vertex Majorana bound states against disorder and correlation effects is also discussed. Our architecture paves the way for designing, constructing, and exploring a wide variety of artificial topological crystalline phases in experiments.</description>

      <title>Linear Criterion for an Upper Bound on the BCS Critical Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since BCS theory of superconductivity is non-linear, it is difficult to study superconducting properties analytically. There is a more tractable linear criterion which determines a temperature $T_l$ below which the system is superconducting. Here, we observe that there is a similar linear criterion which gives a temperature $T_u$ above which no superconductivity occurs. We provide examples of translation invariant systems where $T_u&gt;T_l$ as well as systems where $T_u=T_l$. Furthermore, we estimate $T_u$ for half-spaces and show that it is exponentially small in the weak coupling limit, exhibiting the same asymptotics as the critical temperature for full space.</description>

      <title>Transport signatures of single and multiple Floquet Majorana modes in one-dimensional Rashba nanowire and Shiba chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the transport signature of single and multiple Floquet Majorana end modes~(FMEMs), appearing in an experimentally feasible setup with Rashba nanowire~(NW) placed in closed proximity to a conventional $s$-wave superconductor, in the presence of an external Zeeman field. Periodic drive causes the anomalous $\pi$-modes to emerge in addition to the regular $0$-modes in the driven system where the former does not exhibit any static analog. For single $0$- and/or $\pi$-FMEM, differential conductance exhibits a quantized value of $2e^{2}/h$ while we consider the sum over all the photon sectors, supporting Floquet sum rule. We examine the stability of this summed conductance against random onsite disorder. We further investigate the summed conductance in several cases hosting multiple~(more than one) $0$- or $\pi$-modes at the end of the NW. In these cases, we obtain quantized values of $n\times 2e^{2}/h$ of summed conductance with $n$ being the number of modes~($0$ / $\pi$) located at one end of NW. We repeat our analysis for another experimentally realizable model system known as helical Shiba chain. Moreover, we corroborate our results by computing the differential conductance for FMEMs using non-equilibrium Green's function method. Our work opens up the possibility of studying the transport signatures of FMEMs in these realistic models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a platform for implementing a universal, globally driven quantum computer based on a 2D ladder hosting three different species of superconducting qubits. In stark contrast with the existing literature, our scheme exploits the always-on longitudinal ZZ coupling. The latter, combined with specific driving frequencies, enables the reach of a blockade regime, which plays a pivotal role in the computing scheme.</description>

      <title>Topological Classification of One-Dimensional Chiral Symmetric Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the topological classification of one-dimensional chiral symmetric interfaces embedded into a two-dimensional substrate. A proof of the validity of a topological classification based on the Green's function by explicit evaluation of the topological invariant is presented. Further, we show that due to entanglement between the in-gap modes and the substrate, the full physics of the substrate that is contained in the Green's function is required. This is done by considering a classification scheme derived from the reduced ground state projector, for which we show that an uncritical handling produces erroneous changes in the topological index due to entanglement driven gap closures. We illustrate our results by applying them to a tight-binding model of a spiral magnetic interface in a s-wave superconductor.</description>

      <title>From domain walls and the stripe phase to full suppression of charge density wave in the superconducting 1T-Ti$_{1-\text{x}}$Ta$_\text{x}$Se$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 1T-TiSe$_2$ hosts a $2 \times 2 \times 2$ charge density wave (CDW) that is known to form the state with localized domains separated by the domain walls upon Cu intercalation. The CDW state with the domain wall network has attracted significant interest due to its coexistence with superconductivity. Here we present a scanning tunneling microscopy, transport and magnetic susceptibility study of 1T-Ti$_{1-\text{x}}$Ta$_\text{x}$Se$_2$. Ta substitution for Ti atoms allows us to perform experiments over the wide range of doping ($ 0 \leqslant \text{x} \leqslant 0.2$), providing access to a significantly broader phase diagram than Cu intercalation experiments. At x = 0.02, we observe a complex network of domains and domain walls. We identify two distinct types of domain walls and show their structure with atomic resolution. Additionally, an elusive symmetry-breaking stripe CDW is found at the light substitution of x = 0.02. We also measure highly substituted x = 0.2 crystals that are superconducting despite the full collapse of the CDW order. Our results uncover rich CDW physics in Ta-substituted 1T-TiSe2 crystals and illuminate the interplay between the CDW and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Colloquium: Spin-orbit effects in superconducting hybrid structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.03549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) relates to the interaction between an electron's motion and its spin, and is ubiquitous in solid-state systems. Although the effect of SOC in normal-state phenomena has been extensively studied, its role in superconducting hybrid structures and devices opens many unexplored questions. In conjunction with broken symmetries and material inhomogeneities within superconducting hybrid structures, SOC may have additional contributions, beyond its effects in homogenous materials. Remarkably, even with well-established magnetic or nonmagnetic materials and conventional s-wave spin-singlet superconductors, SOC leads to emergent phenomena including equal-spin triplet pairing and topological superconductivity (hosting Majorana states), a modified current-phase relationship in Josephson junctions, and nonreciprocal transport. SOC is also responsible for transforming quasiparticles in superconducting structures which enhances the spin Hall effect and changes spin dynamics. Taken together, SOC in superconducting hybrid structures and the potential for electric tuning of the SOC strength, creates fascinating possibilities to advance superconducting spintronic devices for energy-efficient computing, and enable topological fault-tolerant quantum computing. By providing a description of experimental techniques and theoretical methods to study SOC, this Colloquium describes the current understanding of resulting phenomena in superconducting structures and offers a framework to select and design a growing class of materials systems where SOC plays an important role.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Examination of SRF-quality Nb Films through Local Nonlinear Microwave Response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities is sometimes limited by local defects. To investigate the RF properties of these local defects, especially those that nucleate RF magnetic vortices, a near-field magnetic microwave microscope is employed. Local third harmonic response (P3f) and its temperature-dependence and RF power-dependence are measured for one Nb/Cu film grown by Direct Current Magnetron Sputtering (DCMS) and six Nb/Cu films grown by High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS) with systematic variation of deposition conditions. Five out of the six HiPIMS Nb/Cu films show a strong third harmonic response that is likely coming from RF vortex nucleation due to a low-Tc surface defect with a transition temperature between 6.3 K and 6.8 K, suggesting that this defect is a generic feature of air-exposed HiPIMS Nb/Cu films. A phenomenological model of surface defect grain boundaries hosting a low-Tc impurity phase is introduced and studied with Time-Dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) simulations of probe/sample interaction to better understand the measured third harmonic response. The simulation results show that the third harmonic response of RF vortex nucleation caused by surface defects exhibits the same general features as the data, including peaks in third harmonic response with temperature, and their shift and broadening with higher microwave amplitude. We find that the parameters of the phenomenological model (the density of surface defects that nucleate RF vortices and the depth an RF vortex travels through these surface defects) vary systematically with film deposition conditions. From the point of view of these two properties, the Nb/Cu film that is most effective at reducing the nucleation of RF vortices associated with surface defects can be identified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the instability of uniform superconducting states that contain the pairing correlations belonging to the odd-frequency symmetry class. The instability originates from the paramagnetic response of odd-frequency Cooper pairs and is considerable at finite temperatures. As a result, the pair potential varies discontinuously at the transition temperature when the amplitude of the odd-frequency pairing correlation functions is sufficiently large. The discontinuous transition to the superconducting phase is a general feature of superconductors that include odd-frequency Cooper pairs.</description>

      <title>Structure and scaling of Kitaev chain across a quantum critical point in real space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spatial Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) is applied to the Kitaev chain with inhomogeneous pairing interactions that vanish in half of the lattice and result in a quantum critical point separating the superfluid and normal-gas phases in real space. The weakly-interacting BCS theory predicts scaling behavior of the penetration of the pair wavefunction into the normal-gas region different from conventional power-law results due to the non-analytic dependence of the BCS order parameter on the interaction. The Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equation produces numerical results confirming the scaling behavior and hints complications in the strong-interaction regime. The limiting case of the step-function quench shows the dominance of the BCS coherence length in absence of additional length scale. Furthermore, the energy spectrum and wavefunctions from the BdG equation show abundant in-gap states from the normal-gas region in addition to the topological edge states.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity at 9 K in Pb-Bi Alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we report the synthesis of Pb-Bi alloy with enhanced Tc of up to 9K, which is higher than that of Pb. The alloy is synthesized via a solid-state reaction route in the vacuum-encapsulated quartz tube at 7000C in an automated furnace. The synthesized sample is characterized by X-ray Diffraction(XRD) and Energy dispersive X-ray analysis(EDAX) for its phase purity and elemental composition. Rietveld refinement of XRD reveals that the end product is a majority hexagonal Pb7Bi3, with minor rhombohedral Bi. The electronic transport measurement shows metallic behavior with the Debye temperature of 108K and a superconductivity transition temperature (Tc) below 9K, which is the maximum to date for any reported Pb-Bi alloy, Pb or Bi at ambient pressure. Partial substitution of Bi at the Pb site may modify the free density of electronic states within the BCS model to attain the optimum Tc, which is higher by around 2K from the reported Tc of Pb. The superconductor phase diagram derived from magneto-transport measurements reveals that the synthesized alloy is a conventional superconductor with an upper critical field (Hc2) of 3.9 Tesla, which lies well within the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The magnetization measurements carried out following ZFC(Zero Field Cool) protocols infer that the synthesized alloy is a bulk superconductor below 9K. The isothermal M-H(Magnetization vs. Field) measurements performed below Tc establish it as a type-II superconductor. The specific heat capacity measurements show that the Pb-Bi alloy is a strongly coupled bulk superconductor below around 9K with possibly two superconducting gaps.</description>

Abstract: We study Andreev reflection in a one-dimensional square-well pair-potential. We discuss the history of the model. The current-phase relation is presented as a sum over Matsubara frequencies. How the current arises from bound and continuum levels is found by analytic continuation. We discuss two limiting cases of the square-well potential, the zero-length well and the infinite well. The model is quantitatively valid in some cases but forms the basis for understanding a wide range of problems in inhomogeneous superconductivity and superfluidity.</description>

      <title>Controlled Erasure as a Building Block for Universal Thermodynamically-Robust Superconducting Computing</title>

Abstract: Reducing the energy inefficiency of conventional CMOS-based computing devices -- which rely on logically irreversible gates to process information -- remains both a fundamental engineering challenge and a practical social challenge of increasing importance. We extend an alternative computing paradigm that manipulates microstate distributions to store information in the metastable minima determined by an effective potential energy landscape. These minima serve as mesoscopic memories that are manipulated by a dynamic landscape to perform information processing. Central to our results is the control erase (CE) protocol that controls the landscape's metastable minima to determine whether information is preserved or erased. Importantly, successive protocol executions can implement a NAND gate -- a logically-irreversible universal logic gate. We show how to practically implement this in a device created by two inductively-coupled superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). We identify circuit parameter ranges that give rise to effective CEs and establish the device's robustness against logical errors. These SQUID-based logical devices are capable of operating above GHz frequencies and at the $k_\text{B} T$ energy scale. Due to this, optimized devices and associated protocols provide a universal-computation substrate that is both computationally fast and energy efficient.</description>
