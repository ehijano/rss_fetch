      <title>Free space optics in two dimensions: optical elements for silicon photonics without lateral confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon photonic components based on freely propagating beams in 220 nm thick Si slab waveguides are described and characterized. Examples include optical relays, waveguide crossings, couplers, and resonators with wavelength independent Q factors. The unconfined beams are manipulated using reflecting mirrors etched into the Si layer, which operate in the total internal reflection (TIR) regime. This approach eliminates the back-scattering and waveguide loss arising from sidewall roughness in single mode waveguides, reduces sensitivity to small dimensional variations, and reduces light induced self-heating. Although the detailed behavior of TIR at curved waveguide side wall mirror is too complex to capture by simple models, the experimental results are found to be in qualitative agreement with simple analytical calculations based on Gaussian beam theory and effective index approximations.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal Quantum Electrodynamics with Bound States in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum electrodynamics (QED) accurately describes all known forms of modern optics and photonics regarding interactions between photons and matter. While matter ranges widely from atoms, particles, to solids, photons are predominantly in a confined physical space, such as a pair of mirrors, for enhanced photon-matter interactions known as cavity QED. Since position and momentum are canonically conjugate variables governed by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, a fundamental question arises - what if light confinement is in the not-so-intuitive momentum or reciprocal space? The realization of photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs) has made possible this exotic scenario. Here, we summarize the most recent advancements at this research frontier in optics and photonics, covering weak coupling, strong coupling, and nonlinear optics. We can designate such photon-matter interactions enabled by reciprocal light confinement through BICs with truly open systems as reciprocal QED, which holds great promise to comprehend and extend cavity QED for optics, photonics, and related fields.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Analysis of Symmetry-Protected Bound States in the Continuum in Waveguide Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous mathematical analysis for symmetry-based Bound States in the Continuum (BICs) in optical waveguide arrays. Different from existing research, we consider a finite system of horizontally and equidistantly aligned waveguides and transform the wave propagation problem into Nonorthogonal Coupled-Mode Equations (NCME), rather than adopting the tight-binding approximation or orthogonal coupled-mode equations. We derive the exact expressions of the overlap integrals and coupling coefficients by utilizing the addition theorems of Bessel functions. We then generalize the discussion to an infinite waveguide array and rigorously characterize the dispersion relation and continuum with the help of theories in harmonic analysis. In the second part of the paper, we give a strict proof of the existence of BICs in the aforementioned waveguide system with two additional identical vertical waveguides aligned symmetrically above and below the horizontal waveguide array. We further numerically demonstrate the transition from a perfect BIC to a leaky mode by introducing a symmetry-breaking refractive index perturbation and quantitatively analyze the resulting radiation losses. This work gives a comprehensive study of symmetry-protected BICs and provides an efficient and precise computational model for designing such BICs devices.</description>

      <title>Complex Refractive Index Extraction for Spintronic Terahertz Emitter Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spintronic terahertz emitters (STEs) generate broadband terahertz (THz) radiation, which is essential for spectroscopy, imaging, and communication. The performances and the essential physical parameters of STE devices are linked to the dielectric properties of the constituent materials. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is an effective tool to measure these properties, but conventional analysis struggles with thin or complex multilayered systems due to simplifying approximations or complex transfer functions. In this work, we present a practical method to extract dielectric properties of STE multilayers using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM). By comparing the THz pulse calculated using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) with the experimentally measured pulse transmitted through the sample, we can extract the dielectric properties of STEs, enhancing THz-TDS analysis and facilitating STE design and optimization. This method avoids constructing complex transfer functions, accommodates diverse sample geometries, and is designed to be accessible, with a publicly available codebase, making it a useful tool for STE research.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization of Energy modulation of high-order R-TEM laser modes in Radially polarized cylindrical vector beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A In this work, an experimental approach is introduced to redistribute optical energy among the multiple concentric core rings of high-order R-TEM laser modes, differing from conventional high-order R-TEM modes that inherently exhibit non-uniform energy across their rings. By employing a diffractive optical element formed from a binary phase mask with two oppositely phased regions, the energy sharing between the rings can be tuned to achieve a variable intensity ratio in the ring pattern. The resulting modulated high-order R-TEM modes are expected to surpass standard R-TEM modes for applications requiring ring structures with nearly equal intensity, such as micro- and nanoparticle manipulation, optical lithography, and near-field optical data storage.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical Skyrmion for manipulation of arbitrary light polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic manipulation of arbitrary light polarization is of fundamental importance for versatile optical functionalities, yet realizing such full-Poincar\'e-sphere control within compact nanophotonic architectures remains a formidable challenge. Here, we theoretically propose and numerically demonstrate a magneto-optical skyrmion platform enabling full polarization control of cavity eigenmodes. We reveal the correspondence between the near-field wavefunctions of degenerate dipoles and far-field polarization. By applying multidirectional magnetic fields to magneto-optical photonic crystals, we achieve any complex superposition of orthogonal eigenmodes, thereby realizing arbitrary far-field polarization. This mapping manifests as a skyrmion with a topological charge of 2, guaranteeing coverage of the entire Poincar\'e sphere. Our theoretical model shows excellent agreement with full-wave simulations. Furthermore, we realize bound states in the continuum (BICs) with dynamically tunable polarization textures and demonstrate high-performance polarization-selective emission and transmission. This work establishes a topological paradigm for precise polarization shaping, offering new avenues for advanced optical communication and sensing.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Phase Noise in Thin Film Lithium Niobate Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fundamental phase noise in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic integrated circuits is governed by thermal-charge-carrier-refractive (TCCR) dynamics arising from thermally driven carrier fluctuations. In contrast to the predominantly thermorefractive noise in silicon photonic platforms, TCCR noise represents a distinct mechanism that becomes critical for applications requiring high frequency stability and phase coherence, including optomechanical sensing, low-phase-noise microwave synthesis, and on-chip quantum squeezing. A quantitative understanding of the deterministic parameters that control TCCR noise is therefore essential for engineering the next generation of low-noise TFLN photonic systems. Here, we identify two dominant contributors to the TCCR noise in TFLN microresonators: material anisotropy and surface states. Material anisotropy results in increased noise for extraordinarily polarized optical modes and leads to a geometry dependent phase noise. Surface-state effects manifest as increased noise in higher-order transverse modes as well as more than 120-fold higher noise in suspended microresonators. Finally, we demonstrate that post-fabrication annealing -- widely used to reduce defect densities and recover crystal quality -- suppresses frequency noise by a factor of 8.2 in cladded microresonators. Together, these results establish a practical pathway for noise engineering in TFLN integrated photonic devices and accelerate their deployment in next-generation precision photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Robust photon blockade with hybrid molecular optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular cavity optomechanical systems, featuring ultrahigh vibrational frequencies and strong light-matter interactions, hold significant promise for advancing applications in quantum science and technology. Specifically, by introducing metallic nanoparticles into microcavities, hybrid molecular cavity optomechanical systems can further enhance optical quality factors and system tunabilities, which enables scalable and controllable quantum platforms. In this study, we propose how to realize robust photon blockade, i.e., strong photon antibunching with arbitrary detuning conditions, by combining degenerate optical parametric amplification with a hybrid molecular cavity optomechanical system. More interesting, we find near-perfect optomechanical photon blockade at room temperature, which is robust against temperature and optical dissipation. In addition, our approach can release the strict condition of high temporal resolution by combining features of conventional and unconventional photon blockade. Our approach offers a feasible route to study intriguing quantum effects in hybrid molecular cavity optomechanical systems, and holds promise for applications in nonclassical state engineering, quantum sensing, and photonic precision measurements.</description>

      <title>Generation of hallow vector beam by high-order cylindrical vector beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for generating hollow beams using higher-order cylindrical vector modes of the form R-TEMpl, where the radial index p is varied from 1 to 3 while the azimuthal index is fixed at l = 1. It is found that this scheme performs identically under incident illumination with either radial or azimuthal polarization. For this purpose, we use a focusing lens in combination with a diffractive optical element formed by a computer-generated hologram containing multiple alternate opaque and transparent regions. Based on vector diffraction theory, our analysis shows that the multi-zone amplitude mask redistributes the beam energy, thereby leading to the formation of a hollow beam. The proposed method provides control over the beam width which maintains a uniform dark core size after focusing through the various NA lens across all the higher order modes. Further the width of high intensity ring can be tuned by varying the NA of the focusing lens. This study shows that the proposed method is well suited for trapping particles or atoms while avoiding exposure to high central intensity, enabling improved contrast and resolution, facilitating ring-shaped ablation or heating, guiding atoms through dark regions to minimize thermal effects, and supporting information encoding using orbital angular momentum and other advanced optical applications.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian gauge field optics in the time domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial gauge fields open up burgeoning opportunities for wave engineering in different disciplines. So far,previous works have mostly focused on synthesizing spatial gauge fields, where the pseudo-magnetic fields lie at the heart of these phenomena. In this Letter, we generalize the paradigm of gauge field optics to the time domain by using time-varying media with rotating anisotropy. Dual to its spatial counterpart, the temporal gauge field induces a pseudo-electric field for optical pulses, leading to the spin-dependent longitudinal shift and Zitterbewegung for both trajectory and frequency. In addition, we analyze the temporal non-Abelian interference effect induced by temporally bounded non-Abelian gauge field media, which results in the temporal spin-precession and the temporal analogy of the non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect. Our work not only fills the gap between synthetic gauge fields and time-varying physical systems, but also provides a fundamentally new approach for manipulating light with time-varying media.</description>

      <title>Dual-comb spectroscopy for the characterization of laboratory flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical spectroscopy, in particular dual-comb (DC) spectroscopy, is a critical, non-invasive tool for combustion diagnostics, offering high precision and calibration-free advantages. However, its implementation remains challenging, especially in the mid-infrared region. This work presents the development of a robust DC spectroscopic system based on electro-optical (EO) frequency comb generators and difference frequency generation (DFG), specifically designed for the characterization of laboratory flames. Operating at a center wavelength of 3427.43 nm, the system utilizes a differential detection strategy to enable precise, calibration-free measurements of unburned methane ($\mathrm{CH_{4}}$) concentrations in a McKenna burner. The experimental results demonstrate a detection limit of 1.1 ppm for a 1 m path length and effectively resolve spatial concentration gradients across the combustion region. Furthermore, the system's high temporal resolution allowed for the identification of dynamic combustion instabilities, including self-sustained pulsations and fuel leakage under fuel-lean conditions. These findings validate the proposed EO architecture as a flexible and highly sensitive tool for advanced flame characterization.</description>

      <title>Controlling photothermal forces and backaction in nano-optomechanical resonators through strain engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In micro- and nanoscale optomechanical systems, radiation pressure interactions are often complemented or impeded by photothermal forces arising from thermal strain induced by optical heating. We show that the sign and magnitude of the photothermal force can be engineered through deterministic nanoscale structural design, by considering the overlap of temperature and modal strain profiles. We demonstrate this capability experimentally in a specific system: a nanobeam zipper cavity by changing the geometry of its supporting tethers. A single design parameter, corresponding to a nanoscale geometry change, controls the magnitude of the photothermal backaction and even its sign. These insights will allow engineering the combined photothermal and radiation pressure forces in nano-optomechanical systems, such that backaction-induced linewidth variations are deterministically minimized if needed, or maximized for applications that require cooling or amplification at specific laser detuning.</description>

      <title>Coherently Assisted Wireless Power Transfer Through Poorly Transparent Barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poorly transparent barriers (e.g., reinforced walls, shielding panels, metallic or high-contrast dielectrics) strongly reflect incident radiation, limiting wireless power transfer (WPT) unless the barrier is structurally modified to support a narrowband transparency window. Here we introduce a barrier-agnostic alternative based on coherent scattering control: a phase-locked auxiliary wave is launched from the receiver side with an amplitude and phase chosen from the measured complex scattering parameters of the barrier. In a two-port (single-channel-per-side) description, we derive closed-form conditions for (i) canceling back-reflection toward the transmitter and (ii) maximizing the net extracted power at the receiver side. In the lossless limit these conditions imply unit transmitter-to-receiver efficiency (all transmitter power is routed to the receiver side) even when the barrier is nearly opaque under one-sided illumination. We validate the concept using (1) an analytically solvable high-index Fabry--P\'erot slab and (2) a numerically simulated perforated PEC metasurface exhibiting vanishing one-sided transmission; in both cases, coherent assistance yields near-unity transmission and large enhancement factors. We further analyze dissipative barriers using a receiver-side energy-balance metric, showing that substantial net delivery can persist well into the lossy regime. The approach is closely related to coherent perfect absorption and time-reversal ideas in wave physics, but targets \emph{reflectionless delivery through barriers} without modifying the obstacle itself.</description>

      <title>Twist-Tuned Strong Coupling in Sub-GHz Wire Metasurface Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twist-angle control offers a bias-free route to reconfigurable metasurfaces, yet its extension to deeply subwavelength resonant platforms at VHF/UHF remains limited. We demonstrate a sub-GHz double-layer wire metasurface formed by two identical wire grids separated by a gap G, with in-plane rotation angle as the sole tuning parameter. One-port, loop-coupled S11 measurements supported by full-wave simulations reveal twist-driven hybridization of the dominant resonant manifold. For small G, the lower hybrid resonance redshifts continuously from 409 MHz to 210 MHz (2:1 tuning), enabling compact, twist-programmable resonant surfaces. Simulations further show that twisting imprints moire-like magnetic near-field super-modulations. From resonance frequencies, linewidths, and normal-mode splitting extracted from the complex response, we obtain normalized coupling up to g = 0.43 with cooperativity exceeding unity over broad angular ranges, meeting the resolved-splitting criterion. The rapid collapse of tunability at larger G confirms the near-field origin of the interaction.</description>

      <title>Constant-Amplitude $2\pi$ Phase Modulation from Topological Pole--Zero Winding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant phase shifters inevitably mix phase and amplitude. We present a topological synthesis that guarantees a full $2\pi$ phase swing at a prescribed constant scattering magnitude $|S_{ij}|=C$ by winding a scattering zero around the operating point in the complex-frequency plane while avoiding pole windings. We realize this either by complex-frequency waveform excitation on an iso-$|S_{ij}|$ (Apollonius) loop or by adiabatic co-modulation of detuning and decay at fixed carrier, suppressing AM--PM conversion and quantizing $\Delta\phi$ by the Argument Principle. The approach targets integrated resonant modulators, programmable photonic circuits, and quantum/beam-steering interferometers that require amplitude-flat phase shifts.</description>

      <title>Watt-class injection-locked diode laser system at 399 nm for atomic physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an injection-locked 399 nm laser system with up to 1 W output power and a locked power fraction of 0.57. The system consists of a high power, multimode diode laser that is seeded by 5 mW from a single-mode external cavity diode laser. The locked high-power laser inherits the frequency agility and linewidth of the seed laser with 3.9 kHz broadening. With active stabilization, the injection lock can be maintained for more than a day. We verify the utility of this system for atomic physics by performing spectroscopy of an ytterbium atomic beam.</description>

      <title>A Large-Depth-Range Layer-Based Hologram Dataset for Machine Learning-Based 3D Computer-Generated Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning-based computer-generated holography (ML-CGH) has advanced rapidly in recent years, yet progress is constrained by the limited availability of high-quality, large-scale hologram datasets. To address this, we present KOREATECH-CGH, a publicly available dataset comprising 6,000 pairs of RGB-D images and complex holograms across resolutions ranging from 256*256 to 2048*2048, with depth ranges extending to the theoretical limits of the angular spectrum method for wide 3D scene coverage. To improve hologram quality at large depth ranges, we introduce amplitude projection, a post-processing technique that replaces amplitude components of hologram wavefields at each depth layer while preserving phase. This approach enhances reconstruction fidelity, achieving 27.01 dB PSNR and 0.87 SSIM, surpassing a recent optimized silhouette-masking layer-based method by 2.03 dB and 0.04 SSIM, respectively. We further validate the utility of KOREATECH-CGH through experiments on hologram generation and super-resolution using state-of-the-art ML models, confirming its applicability for training and evaluating next-generation ML-CGH systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Origin of Classical Background Fields from Coherent States: A First-Principles Formulation in QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical background electromagnetic fields are routinely employed in quantum electrodynamics to describe a wide range of physical situations, from laser-matter interactions to strong-field phenomena. In this work, we present a first-principles formulation that clarifies the quantum origin of such classical background fields in QED by systematically deriving them from coherent states of the electromagnetic field.
  Abstract Starting from the operator formulation of QED, we show how scattering amplitudes between coherent states naturally lead to an effective description in terms of background fields, while maintaining a clear separation between the coherent laser mode and other quantized photon degrees of freedom. This framework allows one to consistently incorporate effects beyond the fixed background approximation, such as depletion and backreaction, without assuming any particular field strength or intensity regime.
  Abstract We further demonstrate how the conventional generating functional with a prescribed background field emerges as a limiting case, corresponding to fixed coherent state boundary conditions. The path integral representation is then obtained as a reformulation of the same underlying Heisenberg picture amplitudes, providing a unified view of operator-based and functional approaches.
  Abstract Our results establish a general and intensity-independent foundation for QED with coherent background fields, within which the standard formulations of strong-field QED arise as well-defined special cases.</description>

      <title>All-optical control and multiplexed readout of multiple superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum circuits operate at millikelvin temperatures, typically requiring independent microwave cables for each qubit for connecting room-temperature control and readout electronics. However, scaling to large-scale processors hosting hundreds of qubits faces a severe input/output (I/O) bottleneck, as the dense cable arrays impose prohibitive constraints on physical footprint, thermal load, wiring complexity, and cost. Here we demonstrate a complete optical I/O architecture for superconducting quantum circuits, in which all control and readout signals are transmitted exclusively via optical photons. Employing a broadband traveling-wave Brillouin microwave-to-optical transducer, we achieve simultaneous frequency-multiplexed optical readout of two qubits. Combined with fiber-integrated photodiode arrays for control signal delivery, this closed-loop optical I/O introduces no measurable degradation to qubit coherence times, with an optically driven single-qubit gate fidelity showing only a 0.19% reduction relative to standard microwave operation. These results establish optical interconnects as a viable path toward large-scale superconducting quantum processors, and open the possibility of networking multiple superconducting quantum computers housed in separate dilution refrigerators through a centralized room-temperature control infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Multivariate scaling of proton and ion energies, divergence, and charge states in Target Normal Sheath Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of an intense laser pulse with a solid target produces energetic proton and ion beams through the Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) mechanism. Such beams are under active investigation for applications in proton beam therapy, materials modification, and nuclear and high-energy-density physics. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical effort, predictive correlations between laser and target parameters and the resulting ion-beam properties remain an open research question, owing to the intrinsically multiphysics and strongly coupled nature of laser-plasma interactions. Here, we employ our unified multiphysics model that reproduces laser-solid interaction dynamics with accuracy exceeding 95% over a broad range of short- and ultrashort-pulse conditions. Using this model, we derive statistically validated scaling laws and probability maps that correlate proton, carbon, and oxygen ion cutoff energies, beam divergences, and ionization states to a wide set of laser and target parameters, including pulse duration, laser power, laser beam spot, target thickness, prepulse-main pulse interval, contrast, laser wavelength, and polarization. Continuous beam properties (cutoff energies and beam divergences) are described using multivariate regression with cross-validation, while discrete ionization states are analyzed using classification and regression tree (CART) methods, enabling nonlinear and threshold-dependent behavior to be captured. The resulting scaling relations, contour maps, and box plots elucidate the coupled roles of laser pulse, and target geometry in governing TNSA ion acceleration and charge-state formation. These results provide a predictive and physically interpretable framework for understanding and optimizing laser-driven ion sources across a wide parameter space.</description>

      <title>High contrast holography through dual modulation</title>

Abstract: Holographic displays are a promising technology for immersive visual experiences, and their potential for compact form factor makes them a strong candidate for head-mounted displays. However, at the short propagation distances needed for a compact, head-mounted architecture, image contrast is low when using a traditional phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM). Although a complex SLM could restore contrast, these modulators require bulky lenses to optically co-locate the amplitude and phase components, making them poorly suited for a compact head-mounted design. In this work, we introduce a novel architecture to improve contrast: by adding a low resolution amplitude SLM a short distance away from the phase modulator, we demonstrate peak signal-to-noise ratio improvement up to 31 dB in simulation and 6.5 dB experimentally compared to phase-only modulation, even when the amplitude modulator is 60$\times$ lower resolution than its phase counterpart. We analyze the relationship between diffraction angle and amplitude modulator pixel size, and validate the concept with a benchtop experimental prototype. By showing that low resolution modulation is sufficient to improve contrast, we open new design spaces for high-contrast holographic displays.</description>

      <title>Giant and Rapidly Switching Intrinsic Chirality Enabled by Toroidal Quasi-Bound States in the Continuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circular dichroism (CD), arising from spin-selective light-matter interactions controlled by chirality, is critical for advanced applications such as chiral imaging and ultrasensitive biosensing. However, CD of chiral natural materials is inherently constrained owing to molecular symmetry and thermodynamic stability. Recently, artificially engineered metasurfaces incorporating chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum (Q-BICs) have emerged as a promising solution, which enables near-unity CD responses. However, their current designs heavily rely on complex three-dimensional geometries, posing significant challenges for integration with planar on-chip platforms. To address the stringent challenges, we demonstrate a truly planar metasurface that achieves giant intrinsic chiral responses by utilizing a chiral Q-BIC dominated by out-of-plane toroidal dipoles (Tz). With deep-subwavelength ({\lambda}/20) thickness, our metasurface exhibits outstanding intrinsic CD values in both simulations (&gt;0.90) and experiments (~0.80). Moreover, in contrast to previous electric or magnetic chiral Q-BICs, the toroidal Q-BIC produces a rapidly switching CD response - transitioning sharply between positive and negative giant CD values within ~0.2 GHz, and the switching is highly sensitive to small oblique incidence of opposite angles. Therefore, our scheme provides a planar platform for studying chiral light-matter interactions involving toroidal dipoles, important for future development of polarization- and angle-sensitive photonic and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Optimization of airgap in a monocentric lens assembly and metasurface based anti-reflecting coating in the long-wave IR regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Owing to minimal aberration, larger field-of-view, and high resolution, monocentric lenses are preferred over other imagers in hemispherical image surface scenarios, particularly in the long-wave infrared (LWIR) region. Herein, we study a monocentric lens assembly consisting of a ball lens and two hemispherical shell lenses of given radii of curvature and lens materials to enhance the transmission of LWIR ranging from 8{\mu}m to 12{\mu}m wavelength. We optimize the air gaps between the lenses of the assembly for a wider range of incidence angles, assuming antireflecting coating (ARC) on all surfaces of the lenses. Additionally, the effect of temperature variation on the transmittance is also studied to attain an optimum air gap between the lenses. With the variation in incidence angle and temperature, modulations in focal length and spot size are reported for different wavelengths. Further, we propose a metasurface design to replace conventional multilayer ARCs to enhance the transmittance through the lens assembly over the given wavelength range for a wide field-of-view.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Cavity from Tunable Coupling between Anapole and Fabry-Perot Resonance or Anti-resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhancing light-matter interactions depends critically on the ability to tailor photonic modes at subwavelength scales, and combining distinct resonant modes has shown remarkable potential unattainable by individual resonances alone. Despite recent advances in anapole metasurfaces for energy confinement and Fabry-Perot (FP) cavities for spectral control, their synergistic coupling and resulting opportunities remain largely unexplored due to challenges such as precise nanoscale assembly. Here, we demonstrate that embedding a terahertz (THz) anapole metasurface within a tunable FP cavity results in a hybrid cavity that demonstrates exotic properties as the anapole transitions between coupling to FP resonances and anti-resonances via cavity-length tuning. At room temperature, we observe ultrastrong coupling (&gt; 30% of the anapole frequency) between anapoles and FP resonances, generating tunable-dispersion polaritons that blend favorable properties of both modes. Meanwhile, anapole spectrally aligns with FP anti-resonances, leading to weak coupling that narrows the linewidth of the anapole's transmission peak by two orders of magnitude and enhances its local density of states (LDOS) near the metasurface correspondingly. With exceptional capabilities including formation of polaritons and significant enhancement of LDOS, the hybrid cavity enables strong interaction with functional materials, paving the way for exploration of quantum optics, molecular sensing, and ultrafast nonlinear photonics.</description>

      <title>Kirigami-based Flexible Metasurface with Reconfigurable Intrinsic Chirality from Zero to Near-unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral responses in electromagnetic metasurfaces are typically categorized as extrinsic, resulting from asymmetric interactions between the structure and incident waves, and intrinsic, arising from three-dimensional symmetry breaking of the unit cell. However, most existing metasurface designs target only one type of chirality and lack a unified, continuously tunable platform for broader chiroptical control. To address this limitation, the designed kirigami-based flexible metasurface is proposed for dynamic, continuous modulation of chirality, which expands the control scope to both extrinsic and intrinsic chiral responses within a single, reconfigurable platform. Initially, the unfolded metasurface exhibits extrinsic chirality under oblique incidence. By introducing well-designed kirigami-based cuts and folds, the metasurface transitions from a planar and achiral configuration to a three-dimensional chiral geometry that breaks the mirror symmetry, thereby exhibiting tunable intrinsic chirality and asymmetric extrinsic chirality. As the folding angle increases, the resulting deformation enables continuous tuning of the chiral response, with circular dichroism and its asymmetry under oblique incidences progressively increasing and reaching pronounced levels across the X-band. Our work provides a lightweight, easy-fabricated, and mechanically reconfigurable metasurface, which offers strong potential for future development in adaptive photonic systems and advanced chiroptical technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate, for the first time, supercontinuum generation spanning more than three octaves in dispersion-engineered thin-film lithium tantalate (TFLT) waveguides. Pumped by a femtosecond laser at 1560 nm, the waveguides yield a spectrum from 240 nm in the ultraviolet to beyond 2400 nm in the near-infrared. The spectral evolution is mapped from low-power harmonic generation (second- and third-harmonic) to a high-power continuum driven by soliton fission and dispersive wave emission. This first demonstration of ultrabroadband nonlinear optics in TFLT establishes it as a competitive, low-loss platform for integrated photonics, with significant potential for applications in frequency metrology and on-chip spectroscopy.</description>
