      <title>Diagonal Frobenius Number via Gomory's Relaxation and Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a matrix $A \in Z^{k \times n}$ of rank $k$, the diagonal Frobenius number $F_{\text{diag}}(A)$ is defined as the minimum $t \in Z_{\geq 1}$, such that, for any $b \in \text{span}_{Z}(A)$, the condition \begin{equation*}
  \exists x \in R_{\geq 0}^n,\, x \geq t \cdot 1 \colon \quad b = A x \end{equation*} implies that \begin{equation*}
  \exists z \in Z_{\geq 0}^n \colon\quad b = A z. \end{equation*}
  In this work, we show that \begin{equation*}
  F_{\text{diag}}(A) = \Delta + O(\log k), \end{equation*} where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum absolute value of $k \times k$ sub-determinants of $A$.
  From the computational complexity perspective, we show that the integer vector $z$ can be found by a polynomial-time algorithm for some weaker values of $t$ in the described condition. For example, we can choose $t = O( \Delta \cdot \log k)$ or $t = \Delta + O(\sqrt{k} \cdot \log k)$. Additionally, in the assumption that a $2^k$-time preprocessing is allowed or a base $J$ with $|{\det A_{J}}| = \Delta$ is given, we can choose $t = \Delta + O(\log k)$.
  Finally, we define a more general notion of the diagonal Frobenius number for slacks $F_{\text{slack}}(A)$, which is a generalization of $F_{\text{diag}}(A)$ for canonical-form systems, like $A x \leq b$. All the proofs are mainly done with respect to $F_{\text{slack}}(A)$. The proof technique uses some properties of the Gomory's corner polyhedron relaxation and tools from discrepancy theory.</description>

      <title>Degree Realization by Bipartite Cactus Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \textsc{Degree Realization} problem with respect to a graph family $\mathcal{F}$ is defined as follows. The input is a sequence $d$ of $n$ positive integers, and the goal is to decide whether there exists a graph $G \in \mathcal{F}$ whose degrees correspond to $d$. The main challenges are to provide a precise characterization of all the sequences that admit a realization in $\mathcal{F}$ and to design efficient algorithms that construct one of the possible realizations, if one exists.
  This paper studies the problem of realizing degree sequences by bipartite cactus graphs (where the input is given as a single sequence, without the bi-partition). A characterization of the sequences that have a cactus realization is already known [28]. In this paper, we provide a systematic way to obtain such a characterization, accompanied by a realization algorithm. This allows us to derive a characterization for bipartite cactus graphs, and as a byproduct, also for several other interesting sub-families of cactus graphs, including bridge-less cactus graphs and core cactus graphs, as well as for the bipartite sub-families of these families.</description>

      <title>Optimal Average Disk-Inspection via Fermat's Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06334v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work resolves the optimal average-case cost of the Disk-Inspection problem, a variant of Bellman's 1955 lost-in-a-forest problem. In Disk-Inspection, a mobile agent starts at the center of a unit disk and follows a trajectory that inspects perimeter points whenever the disk does not obstruct visibility. The worst-case cost was solved optimally in 1957 by Isbell, but the average-case version remained open, with heuristic upper bounds proposed by Gluss in 1961 and improved only recently.
  Our approach applies Fermat's Principle of Least Time to a recently proposed discretization framework, showing that optimal solutions are captured by a one-parameter family of recurrences independent of the discretization size. In the continuum limit these recurrences give rise to a single-parameter optimal control problem, whose trajectories coincide with limiting solutions of the original Disk-Inspection problem. A crucial step is proving that the optimal initial condition generates a trajectory that avoids the unit disk, thereby validating the optics formulation and reducing the many-variable optimization to a rigorous one-parameter problem. In particular, this disproves Gluss's conjecture that optimal trajectories must touch the disk.
  Our analysis determines the exact optimal average-case inspection cost, equal to $3.549259\ldots$ and certified to at least six digits of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Distributed Link Sparsification for Scalable Scheduling Using Graph Neural Networks (Journal Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In wireless networks characterized by dense connectivity, the significant signaling overhead generated by distributed link scheduling algorithms can exacerbate issues like congestion, energy consumption, and radio footprint expansion. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a distributed link sparsification scheme employing graph neural networks (GNNs) to reduce scheduling overhead for delay-tolerant traffic while maintaining network capacity. A GNN module is trained to adjust contention thresholds for individual links based on traffic statistics and network topology, enabling links to withdraw from scheduling contention when they are unlikely to succeed. Our approach is facilitated by a novel offline constrained {unsupervised} learning algorithm capable of balancing two competing objectives: minimizing scheduling overhead while ensuring that total utility meets the required level. In simulated wireless multi-hop networks with up to 500 links, our link sparsification technique effectively alleviates network congestion and reduces radio footprints across four distinct distributed link scheduling protocols.</description>

      <title>On covering cubic graphs with 3 perfect matchings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a bridgeless cubic graph $G$, $m_3(G)$ is the ratio of the maximum number of edges of $G$ covered by the union of $3$ perfect matchings to $|E(G)|$. We prove that for any $r\in [4/5, 1)$, there exist infinitely many cubic graphs $G$ such that $m_3(G) = r$. For any $r\in [9/10, 1)$, there exist infinitely many cyclically $4$-connected cubic graphs $G$ with $m_3(G) = r$.</description>

      <title>Golden Ratio Growth and Phase Transitions in Chromatic Counts of Circular Chord Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study generalized circular chord graphs $\mathcal C^{(k)}_n$, formed from a cycle $C_n$ by adding fixed-offset chords of length $k$ and, for even $n$, diameters. Using transfer matrix methods, we derive exact formulas for 3-colorings when $k=3$: for odd $n$, we obtain \[ P(\mathcal{C}_n^{(3)},3) = L_n + 2\cos\left(\frac{2\pi n}{3}\right) + 2s_n + 2 \] where $L_n$ is the Lucas sequence and $(s_n)$ satisfies $s_{n+3} = -s_{n+2} - s_n$, yielding golden-ratio asymptotic growth $\varphi^n + O(\rho^n)$ along odd indices. For even $n$, we construct a paired-window transfer matrix that exactly enumerates $P(\mathcal{C}_{2m}^{(3)},3)$ while capturing diameter constraints. The chromatic counts exhibit pronounced modular patterns across residue classes without universal vanishing rules (see OEIS A383733). We provide efficient algorithms for exact enumeration and demonstrate applications to cyclic scheduling problems where these results serve as feasibility engines for airline gate assignment, wireless sensor networks, and multiprocessor task coordination.</description>

      <title>Separable convex optimization over indegree polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study egalitarian (acyclic) orientations of undirected graphs under indegree-based objectives, such as minimizing the $\varphi$-sum of indegrees for a strictly convex function $\varphi$, decreasing minimization (dec-min), and increasing maximization (inc-max). In the non-acyclic setting of Frank and Murota (2022), a single orientation simultaneously optimizes these three objectives, however, restricting to acyclic orientations confines us to the corners of the indegree polytope, where these fairness objectives do diverge. We establish strong hardness results across a broad range of settings: minimizing the $\varphi$-sum of indegrees is NP-hard for every discrete strictly convex function $\varphi$; dec-min and inc-max are NP-hard for every indegree bound $k \geq 2$, as well as without a bound; and the complementary inc-min and dec-max problems are NP-hard even on $3$-regular graphs. On the algorithmic side, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for minimizing the maximum weighted indegree via a weighted smallest-last ordering. We also provide an exact exponential-time algorithm for minimizing general separable discrete convex objectives over indegrees, and a polynomial-time algorithm for the non-acyclic case. Finally, for maximizing the sum of the products of indegrees and outdegrees, we prove NP-hardness on graphs of maximum degree $4$, give an algorithm for maximum degree $3$, and provide a $3$-approximation algorithm. Our results delineate the algorithmic frontier of convex integral optimization over indegree (base-)polytopes, and highlight both theoretical consequences and practical implications, notably for scheduling and deadlock-free routing.</description>

      <title>Verifying Sampling Algorithms via Distributional Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a verification framework aimed at establishing the correctness of discrete sampling algorithms. We do so by considering probabilistic programs as distribution transformers. Inspired by recent work on distributional verification of Markov models, we introduce the notion of (inductive) distributional loop invariants for discrete probabilistic programs. These invariants are embedded in a Hoare-like verification framework that includes proof rules for total and partial correctness. To illustrate the applicability of our framework, we prove the correctness of two discrete sampling algorithms: the Fast Dice Roller and the Fast Loaded Dice Roller.</description>

      <title>Relational Algebras for Subset Selection and Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The database community lacks a unified relational query language for subset selection and optimisation queries, limiting both user expression and query optimiser reasoning about such problems. Decades of research (latterly under the rubric of prescriptive analytics) have produced powerful evaluation algorithms with incompatible, ad-hoc SQL extensions that specify and filter through distinct mechanisms. We present the first unified algebraic foundation for these queries, introducing relational exponentiation to complete the fundamental algebraic operations alongside union (addition) and cross product (multiplication). First, we extend relational algebra to complete domain relations-relations defined by characteristic functions rather than explicit extensions-achieving the expressiveness of NP-complete/hard problems, while simultaneously providing query safety for finite inputs. Second, we introduce solution sets, a higher-order relational algebra over sets of relations that naturally expresses search spaces as functions f: Base to Decision, yielding |Decision|^|Base| candidate relations. Third, we provide structure-preserving translation semantics from solution sets to standard relational algebra, enabling mechanical translation to existing evaluation algorithms. This framework achieves the expressiveness of the most powerful prior approaches while providing the theoretical clarity and compositional properties absent in previous work. We demonstrate the capabilities these algebras open up through a polymorphic SQL where standard clauses seamlessly express data management, subset selection, and optimisation queries within a single paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of correcting transpositions (or swaps) of consecutive symbols in $ q $-ary strings is studied. A family of codes correcting a transposition at an arbitrary location is described and proved to have asymptotically optimal redundancy. Additionally, an improved construction is given over a binary alphabet. Bounds on the cardinality of codes correcting $ t = \textrm{const} $ transpositions are obtained. A lower bound on the achievable asymptotic rate of optimal codes correcting $ t = \tau n $ transpositions is derived. Finally, a construction of codes correcting all possible patterns of transpositions is presented, and the corresponding lower bound on the zero-error capacity of the $ q $-ary transposition channel is stated.</description>

      <title>Disk and Partial Disk Inspection: Worst- to Average-Case and Pareto Upper Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15391v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider $n$ unit-speed mobile agents initially positioned at the center of a unit disk, tasked with inspecting all points on the disk's perimeter. A perimeter point is considered covered if an agent located outside the disk's interior has unobstructed visibility of it, treating the disk itself as an obstacle. For $n=1$, this problem is known as the shoreline problem with a known distance. Isbell (1957) derived an optimal trajectory that minimizes the worst-case inspection time for this problem, while Gluss (1961) proposed heuristics for its average-case version. The one-agent case was originally introduced as a more tractable variant of Bellman's famous lost-in-the-forest problem.
  Our contributions are threefold. First, as a warm-up, we extend Isbell's findings by deriving worst-case optimal trajectories for partial inspection of a section of the disk, thereby providing an alternative proof of optimality for inspection with $n \geq 2$ agents. Second, we improve Gluss's bounds on the average-case inspection time under a uniform distribution of perimeter points (equivalent to randomized inspection algorithms), and we also strengthen the methodology by combining spatial discretization with Nonlinear Programming (NLP) to build feasible solutions to the continuous problem and compare them with NLP solutions. Third, we establish Pareto-optimal bounds for the multi-objective problem of jointly minimizing the worst-case and average-case inspection times.</description>

      <title>Computing gradient vector fields with Morse sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We rely on the framework of Morse sequences to enable the direct computation of gradient vector fields on simplicial complexes. A Morse sequence is a filtration from a subcomplex $L$ to a complex $K$ via elementary expansions and fillings, naturally encoding critical and regular simplexes. Maximal increasing and minimal decreasing schemes allow constructing these sequences, and are linked to algorithms like Random Discrete Morse and Coreduction. Extending the approach to cosimplicial complexes ($S=K\setminus L$) allows for efficient computation using reductions, perforations, coreductions, and coperforations. We further generalize to $F$-sequences, which are Morse sequences weighted by an arbitrary stack function $F$, and provide algorithms to compute maximal and minimal sequences. A particular case is when the stack function is given through a vertex map, common in topological data analysis. For injective maps, the complex decomposes into lower stars, recovering established methods and enabling parallel computation; for non-injective maps, our approach applies directly without requiring perturbations. Thus, the paper adopts Morse sequences as a framework that simplifies and connects some important existing propagation-based methods, while also introducing new schemes that extend their scope and practical applicability.</description>

Abstract: The \emph{signed series} problem in the $\ell_2$ norm asks, given set of vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_n\in \mathbf{R}^d$ having at most unit $\ell_2$ norm, does there always exist a series $(\varepsilon_i)_{i\in [n]}$ of $\pm 1$ signs such that for all $i\in [n]$, $\max_{i\in [n]} \|\sum_{j=1}^i \varepsilon_i v_i\|_2 = O(\sqrt{d})$. A result of Banaszczyk [2012, \emph{Rand. Struct. Alg.}] states that there exist signs $\varepsilon_i\in \{-1,1\},\; i\in [n]$ such that $\max_{i\in [n]} \|\sum_{j=1}^i \varepsilon_i v_i\|_2 = O(\sqrt{d+\log n})$. The best constructive bound known so far is of $O(\sqrt{d\log n})$, by Bansal and Garg [2017, \emph{STOC.}, 2019, \emph{SIAM J. Comput.}]. We give a polynomial-time randomized algorithm to find signs $x(i) \in \{-1,1\},\; i\in [n]$ such that \[ \max_{i\in [n]} \|\sum_{j=1}^i x(i)v_i\|_2 = O(\sqrt{d + \log^2 n}) = O(\sqrt{d}+\log n).\] By the constructive reduction of Harvey and Samadi [\emph{COLT}, 2014], this also yields a constructive bound of $O(\sqrt{d}+\log n)$ for the Steinitz problem in the $\ell_2$-norm. Thus, we algorithmically achieve Banaszczyk's bounds for both problems when $d \geq \log^2n$, which also matches the conjectured bounds. Our algorithm is based on the framework on Bansal and Garg, together with a new analysis involving $(i)$ additional linear and spectral orthogonality constraints during the construction of the covariance matrix of the random walk steps, which allow us to control the quadratic variation in the linear as well as the quadratic components of the discrepancy increment vector, alongwith $(ii)$ a ``Freedman-like" version of the Hanson-Wright concentration inequality, for filtration-dependent sums of subgaussian chaoses.</description>

Abstract: For a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), a robust satisfaction algorithm is one that outputs an assignment satisfying most of the constraints on instances that are near-satisfiable. It is known that the CSPs that admit efficient robust satisfaction algorithms are precisely those of bounded width, i.e., CSPs whose satisfiability can be checked by a simple local consistency algorithm (eg., 2-SAT or Horn-SAT in the Boolean case). While the exact satisfiability of a bounded width CSP can be checked by combinatorial algorithms, the robust algorithm is based on rounding a canonical Semidefinite Programming (SDP) relaxation.
  In this work, we initiate the study of robust satisfaction algorithms for promise CSPs, which are a vast generalization of CSPs that have received much attention recently. The motivation is to extend the theory beyond CSPs, as well as to better understand the power of SDPs. We present robust SDP rounding algorithms under some general conditions, namely the existence of particular high-dimensional Boolean symmetries known as majority or alternating threshold polymorphisms. On the hardness front, we prove that the lack of such polymorphisms makes the PCSP hard for all pairs of symmetric Boolean predicates. Our approach relies on SDP integrality gaps argued via the absence of certain colorings of the sphere, with connections to sphere Ramsey theory.
  We conjecture that PCSPs with robust satisfaction algorithms are precisely those for which the feasibility of the canonical SDP implies (exact) satisfiability. We also give a precise algebraic condition, known as a minion characterization, of which PCSPs have the latter property.</description>

      <title>Covering a Graph with Minimal Local Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10678</link>

Abstract: Local sets, a graph structure invariant under local complementation, have been originally introduced in the context of quantum computing for the study of quantum entanglement within the so-called graph state formalism. A local set in a graph is made of a non-empty set of vertices together with its odd neighborhood. We show that any graph can be covered by minimal local sets, i.e. that every vertex is contained in at least one local set that is minimal by inclusion. More precisely, we introduce an algorithm for finding a minimal local set cover in polynomial time. This result is proved by exploring the link between local sets and cut-rank. We prove some additional results on minimal local sets: we give tight bounds on their size, and we show that there can be exponentially many of them in a graph. Finally, we provide an extension of our definitions and our main result to $q$-multigraphs, the graphical counterpart of quantum qudit graph states.</description>

      <title>Solving Modular Linear Systems with a Constraint by parallel decomposition of the Smith form and extended Euclidean division modulo powers of primes divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10158</link>

Abstract: Integral linear systems $Ax=b$ with matrices $A$, $b$ and solutions $x$ are also required to be in integers, can be solved using invariant factors of $A$ (by computing the Smith Canonical Form of $A$). This paper explores a new problem which arises in applications, that of obtaining conditions for solving the Modular Linear System $Ax=b\rem n$ given $A,b$ in $\zz_n$ for $x$ in $\zz_n$ along with the constraint that the value of the linear function $\phi(x)=\la w,x\ra$ is coprime to $n$ for some solution $x$. In this paper we develop decomposition of the system to coprime moduli $p^{r(p)}$ which are divisors of $n$ and show how such a decomposition simplifies the computation of Smith form. This extends the well known index calculus method of computing the discrete logarithm where the moduli over which the linear system is reduced were assumed to be prime (to solve the reduced systems over prime fields) to the case when the factors of the modulus are prime powers $p^{r(p)}$. It is shown how this problem can be addressed effciently using the invariant factors and Smith form of the augmented matrix $[A,-p^{r(p)}I]$ and conditions modulo $p$ satisfied by $w$, where $p^{r(p)}$ vary over all divisors of $n$ with $p$ prime.</description>

      <title>Toward Vu's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2002, Vu conjectured that graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ and maximum codegree at most $\zeta \Delta$ have chromatic number at most $(\zeta+o(1))\Delta$. Despite its importance, the conjecture has remained widely open. The only direct progress so far has been obtained in the ``dense regime,'' when $\zeta$ is close to $1$, by Hurley, de Verclos, and Kang.
  In this paper we provide the first progress in the sparse regime $\zeta \ll 1$, the case of primary interest to Vu. We show that there exists $\zeta_0 &gt; 0$ such that for all $\zeta \in [\log^{-32}\Delta,\zeta_0]$, the following holds: if $G$ is a graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ and maximum codegree at most $\zeta \Delta$, then $\chi(G) \leq (\zeta^{1/32} + o(1))\Delta$. We derive this from a more general result that assumes only that the common neighborhood of any $s$ vertices is bounded rather than the codegrees of pairs of vertices. Our more general result also extends to the list coloring setting, which is of independent interest.</description>
