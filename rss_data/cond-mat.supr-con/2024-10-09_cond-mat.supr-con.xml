      <title>Self-consistent surface superconductivity in time-reversal symmetric Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals host topologically protected surface states, the so-called Fermi arcs, that have a penetration depth into the bulk that depends on surface-momentum, and diverges at the Weyl points. It has recently been observed in PtBi2 that such Fermi arc states can become superconducting, with a critical temperature larger than that of the bulk. Here we introduce a general variational method that captures the interplay between surface and bulk superconductivity, for any bulk Hamiltonian that harbors (topological) surface states with varying penetration depth. From the self-consistent solutions we establish that the surface state localization length of Weyl semimetals leads to characteristic features in the surface superconductivity, with a gap depending on surface momentum and a penetration length for the order parameter that is temperature-dependent due to competition with the bulk superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Valley polarization, magnetization, and superconductivity in bilayer graphene near the van Hove singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of Mott insulators and superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene has ignited intensive research into strong correlation effects in other stacking geometries. Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BBG), when subjected to a perpendicular electric field, exhibits phase transitions to a variety of broken-symmetry states. Notably, superconductivity emerges when BBG is in proximity to a heavy transition-metal dichalcogenide, highlighting the role of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here we investigate the origin of Ising SOC and its role in the competition between superconductivity and spin- and valley-polarized states in BBG. Starting from strong electron-electron interactions on the BBG lattice, we derive a low-energy effective model near the valleys that incorporates both density-density and spin-spin interactions. Using self-consistent mean-field theory, we map out the BBG phase diagram. Our findings reveal that near the van Hove filling, a mixed spin- and valley-polarized phase dominates over superconductivity. Away from the van Hove filling, a spin-polarized, spin-triplet superconducting state arises, characterized by an in-plane orientation of the magnetic moment and an out-of-plane orientation of the d-vector. Contrary to previous proposals, we find that Ising SOC favours spin-valley order while suppressing superconductivity near the van Hove singularity. We discuss other potential proximity effects and suggest directions for future studies.</description>

      <title>On the Amplitude of Vortex Entropy: A Semiclassical Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite a long history of Nernst effect in superconductors, a satisfactory theory on its amplitude in vortex liquid phase is still absent. The central quantity of vortex Nernst signals is the entropy $s_{\phi}$ carried by each vortex. Here we show a semiclassical treatment based on London equation and Pippard nonlocal generalization. The derived $s_{\phi}$ is a function of both temperatures and magnetic fields. Its magnitude $s_{\phi}^{amp}$ scales with normal-state conductivity ${\sigma}_n$. Estimations based on our formula show good consistency with experimentally determined values. In dirty limit, the relation is further simplified into a Wiedemann-Franz-like ratio $s_{\phi}^{amp}/{\sigma}_n \propto k_B \ln 2/{\sigma}_Q$ if taking parameter values deduced from Homes' law, where ${\sigma}_Q=4e^2/h$ is two-dimensional quantum conductivity. We also address related issues, including bounds to $s_{\phi}$, the Nernst signal and viscosity-entropy density ratio, which are all expressed in fundamental physical constants.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Zeeman field, Rashba spin-orbit interaction, and superconductivity: Transition temperature and quasiparticle excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a theoretical analysis on the effects of an external Zeeman field and Rashba spin-orbit interactions on superconductivity. We have extensively studied their influence on the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ and the quasiparticle excitation energy. Our investigation includes a detailed examination of both the $s$-wave and $p$-wave pairing states. Implications for the recently discovered family of superconductors, A$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ (A = Na, K, Rb and Cs), as well as the validation of our theory have been discussed.</description>

      <title>Interplay between superconducting fluctuations and weak localization in disordered TiN thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between superconducting fluctuations (SFs) and weak localization (WL) has been probed by temperature dependent resistance [R(T)] and magnetoresistance (MR) measurements in two-dimensional disordered superconducting TiN thin films. Within a narrow band of temperature above the transition temperature Tc, the coexistence of SFs-mediated positive MR and WL-led negative MR in different range of magnetic field, as well as a crossover from positive to negative MR with increasing temperature are reported here. The crossover temperature coincides with a characteristic temperature (Tmax) at which a resistance peak appears in the zero-field R(T). The resistance peak and the associated magnetoresistance anomalies are addressed by using the quantum corrections to the conductivity (QCC) theory. We show that WL can be accounted for the observed negative MR. By introducing individual coefficients to both SFs and WL contributions, the dominance of one over the other is monitored with respect to temperature. It is observed that just above the Tc, SF dominates and with increasing temperature, the contributions from the both become comparable and finally, at Tmax, WL takes over completely. The presented approach may be adopted to compare various quantum contributions in two-dimensional superconductors particularly in the regime where both SFs and WL are pronounced.</description>

      <title>Praseodymium doping effect on the superconducting properties of FeSe0.5Te0.5 bulks under ambient and high-pressure growth conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A series of Pr-doped FeSe0.5Te0.5 (Fe1-xPrxSe0.5Te0.5; x = 0 to 0.3) bulks are prepared by conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP), and high gas pressure and high temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) methods. These bulks are well characterized by structural and microstructural analysis, Raman spectroscopy, transport, and magnetic measurements. The HP-HTS process of the parent bulks has enhanced the onset transition temperature (Tconset) by 1.5 K and the critical current density (Jc) by two orders of magnitude compared to the CSP method. Pr-doped FeSe0.5Te0.5 up to 10% doping content prepared, either CSP or HP-HTS, slightly increases the unit cell volume, and high-pressure growth produces an almost pure superconducting phase, which confirms the successful Pr-doping at Fe sites. Raman spectroscopy measurements and DFT calculations suggest the substitution of Pr-atoms in the interlayer spacing of Fe(Se,Te) lattice. High-pressure growth of Fe1-xPrxSe0.5Te0.5 also makes the sample less dense compared to the parent sample grown by HP-HTS. Transport and magnetic measurements depict that Tconset is almost unaffected by Pr doping, whereas Jc of Pr-doped FeSe0.5Te0.5 is enhanced by one order of magnitude relative to the parent sample developed by CSP but lower than that of the parent sample grown by HP-HTS. Hence, Pr doping at Fe sites preserves Tconset and improves Jc of FeSe0.5Te0.5 regardless of the doping contents and growth conditions. These results are promising for the practical application of iron-based superconductors to improve Jc properties without affecting Tconset through CSP process and congruent with discoveries from other superconductors, like cuprates and MgB2.</description>

      <title>Investigation of superconducting gap of high-entropy telluride AgInSnPbBiTe5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed transverse-field muon spin relaxation/rotation (TF-{\mu}SR) on a high-entropy-type (HE-type) superconductor AgInSnPbBiTe5. The emergence of bulk superconducting states was confirmed from magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and {\mu}SR. The superconducting gap 2{\Delta}(0) estimated from {\mu}SR was clearly larger than that expected from conventional weak-coupling phonon-mediated model, suggesting the strong-coupling nature of superconductivity. In addition, a long penetration depth of 3.21(7) {\mu}m was obtained. The strong-coupling nature of superconductivity and the long penetration depth are similar to the trends observed in the other HE-type superconductors (HE alloys and transition-metal zirconides), which may be universal feature of HE-type superconductors.</description>

      <title>Revealing nanoscale structural phase separation in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7-\delta}$ single crystal via scanning near-field optical microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7-${\delta}$ under high pressure,with an onset critical temperature (Tc) around 80 K, has sparked significant interest in the superconducting phases of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, Lan+1NinO3n+1 (n = 2,3). While La4Ni3O10 exhibits nearly 100% superconductivity with Tc~30 K under high pressure, magnetic susceptibility studies on La3Ni2O7-${\delta}$, however, reveal a more complex picture, indicating either filamentary superconductivity or that approximately 50% of crystal phase becomes superconducting in polycrystalline samples. In this study, we employed scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) to visualize nanoscale structural phase separation in La3Ni2O7-${\delta}$, identifying enhanced optical conductivity with stripes approximately 183 nm wide. These stripes run diagonally with respect to the Ni-O-Ni bond directions in the a-b plane, ruling out the possibility that they arise from impurity phases, like the '1313', '214' or '4310' structures. Our findings suggest this phase separation corresponds to coexisting orthorhombic Amam and Fmmm structures,exhibiting optical conductivities ~ 22% and 29% of gold's, respectively. Additionally, we find that the Fmmm structure constitutes about 38% of the total field of view, while the remainder consists of Amam structure and the transitional region between Fmmm and Amam structures. In contrast, La4Ni3O10 exhibits uniform and higher optical conductivity with no observable evidence of phase separation. Thus, our study represents a pioneering effort to directly image nanoscale phase separation in Lan+1NinO3n+1 (n=2,3) nickelates. This observation could provide crucial insights into the factors that limit the superconducting volume fraction of La3Ni2O7-${\delta}$, highlighting SNOM as a powerful probe for exploring nanoscale low-energy physics in correlated quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Bose metals, from prediction to realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bose metals are metals made of Cooper pairs, which form at very low temperatures in superconducting films and Josephson junction arrays as an intermediate phase between superconductivity and superinsulation. We predicted the existence of this 2D metallic phase of bosons in the mid 90s, showing that they arise due to topological quantum effects. The observation of Bose metals in perfectly regular Josephson junction arrays fully confirms our original prediction and rules out alternative models based on disorder. Here, we review the basic mechanism leading to Bose metals. The key points are that the relevant vortices in granular superconductors are core-less, mobile XY vortices which can tunnel through the system due to quantum phase slips, that there is no charge-phase commutation relation preventing such vortices to be simultaneously out of condensate with charges, and that out-of-condensate charges and vortices are subject to topological mutual statistics interactions, a quantum effect that dominates at low temperatures. These repulsive mutual statistics interactions are sufficient to increase the energy of the Cooper pairs and lift them out of condensate. The result is a topological ground state in which charge conduction along edges and vortex movement across them organize themselves so as to generate the observed metallic saturation at low temperatures. This state is known today as a bosonic topological insulator.</description>

      <title>$\phi_0$-junction and Josephson diode effect in high-temperature superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in both the Josephson diode effect (JDE) and the high-temperature Josephson junction, we propose to realize the JDE in an s-wave/d-wave/s-wave (s-d-s) superconductor junction and investigate the high-temperature superconducting order parameters. The interlayer coupling between s-wave and d-wave superconductors can induce an effective $d+is$ superconducting state, spontaneously breaking time-reversal symmetry. The asymmetric s-d interlayer couplings break the inversion symmetry. Remarkably, the breaking of these two symmetries leads to a $\phi_0$-junction but does not generate JDE. We find that the emergence of the JDE in this junction depends on the $C_4$ rotational symmetry of the system. Although breaking $C_4$ rotational symmetry does not affect time-reversal and inversion symmetries, it can control the magnitude and polarity of diode efficiency. Furthermore, we propose observing C$_{4}$ symmetry breaking controlled JDE through asymmetric Shapiro steps. Our work suggests a JDE mechanism that relies on high-temperature d-wave pairing, which could inversely contribute to a potential experimental method for detecting the unconventional pairing symmetry in superconductors.</description>

      <title>Chiral superconductivity from parent Chern band and its non-Abelian generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimal model starting from a parent Chern band with quartic dispersion that can describe the spin-valley polarized electrons in rhombohedral tetra-layer graphene. The interplay between repulsive and attractive interactions on top of that parent Chern band is studied. We conduct standard self-consistent mean-field calculations, and find a rich phase diagram that consists of metal, quantum anomalous Hall crystal, chiral topological superconductor, as well as trivial gapped Bose-Einstein condensate. In particular, there exists a topological phase transition from the chiral superconductor to the Bose-Einstein condensate at zero temperature. Motivated by the recent experimental and theoretical studies of composite Fermi liquid in rhombohedral stacked multi-layer graphene, we further generalize the physical electron model to its composite fermion counterpart based on a field theory analysis. We argue that a chiral spin liquid phase can emerge in the vicinity of the chiral superconductor phase of the composite fermion, i.e., the non-Abelian Moore-Read quantum Hall phase. Our work suggests rhombohedral multi-layer graphene as a potential platform for rich correlated topological phases.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial aluminum layer on antimonide heterostructures for exploring Josephson junction effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present results of our recent work of epitaxially-grown aluminum (epi-Al) on antimonide heterostructures, where the epi-Al thin film is grown at either room temperature or below zero $^o$C. A sharp superconducting transition at $T \sim 1.3$ K is observed in these epi-Al films, and the critical magnetic field follows the BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) model. We further show that supercurrent states are achieved in Josephson junctions fabricated in the epi-Al/antimonide heterostructures with mobility $\mu \sim 1.0 \times 10^6$ cm$^2$/Vs, making these heterostructures a promising platform for the exploration of Josephson junction effects for quantum microelectronics applications, and the realization of robust topological superconducting states that potentially allow the realization of intrinsically fault-tolerant qubits and quantum gates.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram from Nonlinear Interaction between Superconducting Order and Density: Toward Data-Based Holographic Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address an inverse problem in modeling holographic superconductors. We focus our research on the critical temperature behavior depicted by experiments. We use a physics-informed neural network method to find a mass function $M(F^2)$, which is necessary to understand phase transition behavior. This mass function describes a nonlinear interaction between superconducting order and charge carrier density. We introduce positional embedding layers to improve the learning process in our algorithm, and the Adam optimization is used to predict the critical temperature data via holographic calculation with appropriate accuracy. Consideration of the positional embedding layers is motivated by the transformer model of natural-language processing in the artificial intelligence (AI) field. We obtain holographic models that reproduce borderlines of the normal and superconducting phases provided by actual data. Our work is the first holographic attempt to match phase transition data quantitatively obtained from experiments. Also, the present work offers a new methodology for data-based holographic models.</description>

      <title>Magnetic coupling through flux branching of adjacent type-I and -II superconductors in a neutron star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inner and outer cores of neutron stars are believed to contain type-I and -II proton superconductors, respectively. The type-I superconductor exists in an intermediate state, comprising macroscopic flux-free and flux-containing regions, while the type-II superconductor is flux-free, except for microscopic, quantized flux tubes. Here, we show that the inner and outer cores are coupled magnetically, when the macroscopic flux tubes subdivide dendritically into quantized flux tubes, a phenomenon called flux branching. An important implication is that up to $\sim 10^{12} (r_1/10^6 \, {\rm cm}) \, {\rm erg}$ of energy are required to separate a quantized flux tube from its progenitor macroscopic flux tube, where $r_1$ is the length of the macroscopic flux tube. Approximating the normal-superconducting boundary as sharp, we calculate the magnetic coupling energy between a quantized and macroscopic flux tube due to flux branching as a function of, $f_1$, the radius of the type-I inner core divided by the radius of the type-II outer core. Strong coupling delays magnetic field decay in the type-II superconductor. For an idealised inner core containing only a type-I proton superconductor and poloidal flux, and in the absence of ambipolar diffusion and diamagnetic screening, the low magnetic moments ($\lesssim 10^{27} \, {\rm G \, cm^3}$) of recycled pulsars imply $f_1 \lesssim 10^{-1.5}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics in symmetry-breaking ordered phases of correlated fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking phases of many-fermion systems are characterized by anomalous functions representing transient processes during which some characteristics of free particles, such as spin or charge, are not conserved. Matching the low-temperature symmetry-breaking phase with the high-temperature one consistently with nontrivial quantum dynamics is a long-standing, unresolved problem. We argue that the two-particle propagators may contain only even powers of the anomalous Green functions to make the thermodynamic system conserving. Only then can we continuously match the symmetry-breaking phase with the normal one at the transition point. We use the antiferromagnetic phase of a dynamical approximation to disclose universal features of the impact of quantum dynamics on thermodynamic and spectral properties of the ordered state.</description>

      <title>On the oxygen $p$ states in superconducting nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While key attention in transition-metal oxides is usually devoted to the $d$ states of the transition-metal ion, the O$(2p)$ states usually also carry important physics. We here examine these $p$ states in representatives of the novel superconducting nickelates, as described in realistic dynamical mean-field theory. Since the materials are located on the boundary between Mott-Hubbard and charge-transfer systems, the role of oxygen is expectedly subtle. Strong reduction of doped holes on oxygen and first asymmetry effects are featured in infinite-layer nickelates. A pronounced nature of bridging $p_z$ orbitals is identified in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ system.</description>

      <title>Novel Emergent Phases in a Two-Dimensional Superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.10215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we report our observation of an extraordinarily rich phase diagram of a LaScO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterostructure. Close to the superconducting transition temperature, the system hosts a superconducting critical point of the Infinite-randomness type characterized by an effective dynamical exponent $\nu z$ that diverges logarithmically. At lower temperatures, we find the emergence of a magnetic field-tuned metallic phase that co-exists with a quantum Griffiths phase (QGP). Our study reveals a previously unobserved phenomenon in 2D superconductors -- an unanticipated suppression of the QGP below a crossover temperature in this system. This concealment is accompanied by the destruction of the superconducting quantum critical point signaled by a power-law divergence (in temperature) of the effective dynamical exponent. These observations are entirely at odds with the predictions of the infinite-randomness scenario and challenge the very concept of a vanishing energy scale associated with a quantum critical point. We develop and discuss possible scenarios like smearing of the phase transition that could plausibly explain our observations. Our findings challenge the notion that QGP is the ultimate ground state in two-dimensional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Topological Superconductivity from Unconventional Band Degeneracy with Conventional Pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.10225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new scheme for Majorana modes in systems with nonsymmporhic-symmetry-protected band degeneracy. We reveal that when the gapless fermionic excitations are encoded with conventional superconductivity and magnetism, which can be intrinsic or induced by proximity effect, topological superconductivity and Majorana modes can be obtained. We illustrate this outcome in a system which respects the space group P4/nmm and features a fourfold-degenerate fermionic mode at (\pi, \pi) in the Brillouin zone. We show that in the presence of conventional superconductivity, different types of topological superconductivity, i.e. first-order and second-order topological superconductivity, with coexisting fragile Wannier obstruction in the latter case, can be generated in accordance with the different types of magnetic orders; Majorana modes are shown to exist on the boundary, at the corner and in the vortices. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, another example related to the space group P4/ncc based on this scheme is also provided. Our study offers insights into constructing topological superconductors based on bulk energy bands and conventional superconductivity, and helps to find new material candidates and design new platforms for realizing Majorana modes.</description>

      <title>Triplet supercurrents in lateral Josephson junctions with a half-metallic ferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the area of superconducting spintronics, spin triplet supercurrents in half-metallic ferromagnets (HMFs) could yield dissipationless spin transport over large distances, and high current density. Promising among the HMFs is the perovskite oxide La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO), and recent studies in combination with the high-Tc superconductor YBa2Cu3O7, or the conventional superconductor NbTi, showed long range effects. Here we focus on two issues that as yet received less attention: the value of the critical current in the HMF in the limit of a very small electrode distance (20 nm), and the nature of the spin triplet generator. We use lateral junctions shaped as bar, square, and disk, and find high supercurrent densities, of order 10^11 A/m2, pointing to an efficient triplet generation mechanism. This is surprising in the sense that no magnetic inhomogeneity is purposely built in, as is done in conventional metal triplet junctions. Furthermore, from the magnetic field dependence of the critical current interference patterns we find a uniform supercurrent distribution in bar-shaped devices, but one more constricted to the rim in disk devices, which is an expected consequence of the geometry. We also analyze the temperature dependence of the critical current and find the quadratic dependence that was predicted in the limit of small junction lengths. From studying the NbTi/LSMO interface with scanning electron transmission microscopy, we conclude that the magnetic inhomogeneity required for triplet generation resides in the LSMO layer adjacent to the interface.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of dual Shapiro steps in small Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bloch oscillations in small Josephson junctions were predicted theoretically as the quantum dual to Josephson oscillations. A significant consequence of this prediction is the emergence of quantized current steps, so-called dual Shapiro steps, when synchronizing Bloch oscillations to an external microwave signal. These steps potentially enable a fundamental standard of current $I$, defined via the frequency $f$ of the external signal and the elementary charge $e$, $I=\pm n \times 2ef$, where $n$ is a natural number. Here, we realize this fundamental relation by synchronizing the Bloch oscillations in small Al/AlO$_\mathrm{x}$/Al Josephson junctions to sinusoidal drives with frequencies varying from $1$ to $6\:\mathrm{GHz}$ and observe dual Shapiro steps up to $I\approx 3 \: \mathrm{nA}$. Inspired by today's voltage standards and to further confirm the duality relation, we investigate a pulsed drive regime, which is dual to the single flux quantum mode of Josephson oscillations, and observe a similar asymmetric pattern of dual Shapiro steps. This work confirms quantum duality effects in Josephson junctions and paves the way towards a range of applications in quantum metrology based on well-established fabrication techniques and straightforward circuit design.</description>

      <title>Signatures of canted antiferromagnetism in infinite-layer nickelates studied by x-ray magnetic dichroism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report an experimental study of the magnetic properties of infinite-layer Nd1-xSrxNiO2 thin films by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at Ni L3,2 and Nd M5,4 edges. We show that at low temperatures the out-of-plane component of the Ni1+ spin-moment is characterized by a rapid increase for magnetic fields below 1T , followed by a slower linear increase reaching a spin-moment value of 0.25uB/Ni at 9T in the case of superconducting Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2. On the other hand, the Nd M5,4 XMCD shows a clear paramagnetic behaviour, which make both Ni- and Nd-spin-sublattices fully uncorrelated.The magnetic field and temperature dependencies of the Ni L3,2 XMCD data can be explained by assuming an out-of-plane canting of the strongly in-plane anti-ferromagnetic ordered Ni1+ spins. A symmetry lowering of the NiO2 planes observed via four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy, triggering a DMI, can be responsible of the proposed Ni1+ spin-canting at zero-field. The resulting out-of-plane weak-ferromagnetic coupling under magnetic field explains the relatively large spin-moment and its magnetic field and temperature dependence.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the pair-density-wave (PDW) state found in the one-dimensional Kondo-Heisenberg chain, we report on a determinant quantum Monte Carlo DQMC study of pair-fields for a two-dimensional half-filled Hubbard layer coupled to an itinerant, non-interacting layer with one electron per site. In a specific range of interlayer hopping, the pairing vertex associated with PDW order becomes more attractive than that for uniform d-wave pairing, although both remain subdominant to the leading antiferromagnetic correlations at half-filling. Our result sheds light on where one potentially may find a PDW state in such a model.</description>

Abstract: Chiral superconductors are one of the predominant quantum electronic states of matter where topology, symmetry, and Fermiology intertwine. This is pushed to a new limit by further invoking the coupling between spin and charge degrees of freedom, which fundamentally affects the principal nature of the Cooper pair wave function. We investigate the onset of superconductivity in the Rashba-Hubbard model on the triangular lattice, which is symmetry-classified by the associated irreducible representations (irrep) of the hexagonal point group. From an instability analysis by means of the truncated-unity functional renormalization group (TU-FRG) we find the $E_2$ irrep to dominate a large fraction of phase space and to lead up to an energetically preferred gapped, chiral superconducting state. The topological phase space classification associated with the anomalous propagators obtained from TU-FRG reveals a fragmentation of the $E_2$ domain into different topological sectors with vastly differing Chern numbers. It hints at a potentially applicable high sensitivity and tunability of chiral superconductors with respect to topological edge modes and phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computation with bosonic modes presents a powerful paradigm for harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics to perform complex information processing tasks. In constructing a bosonic qubit with superconducting circuits, nonlinearity is typically introduced to a cavity mode through an ancillary two-level qubit. However, the ancilla's spurious heating has impeded progress towards fully fault-tolerant bosonic qubits. The ability to in situ decouple the ancilla when not in use would be beneficial but has so far only been realized with tunable couplers or additional parametric drives. This work presents a novel architecture for quantum information processing, comprising a 3D post cavity coupled to a fluxonium ancilla via a readout resonator. This system's intricate energy level structure results in a complex landscape of interactions whose sign can be tuned in situ by the magnetic field threading the fluxonium loop without the need of additional elements. Our results could significantly advance the lifetime and controllability of bosonic qubits.</description>

      <title>Multifold Majorana corner modes arising from multiple pairs of helical edge states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators with a pair of helical edge states and proximity-induced superconductivity have been shown to support second-order topological superconductors with Majorana corner modes. As the Majorana corner modes are originated from the helical edge states of the quantum spin Hall insulators, whether quantum spin Hall insulators with multiple pairs of helical edge states and proximity-induced superconductivity can give rise to second-order topological superconductors with multifold Majorana corner modes is an interesting question to address. In this work, we consider a quantum spin Hall insulator with two pairs of helical edge states. We find robust twofold Majorana corner modes can be achieved when the helical edge states are gapped by a combined action of a magnetic exchange field and an $s$-wave pairing, or an $s+p$ mixed-parity pairing. The stability of two Majorana zero modes per corner under the action of magnetic exchange fields is attributed to the protection from the chiral symmetry. Our study reveals that heterostructures composed of superconductors and quantum spin Hall insulators with multiple pairs of helical edge states could serve as a platform to pursue multifold Majorana corner modes.</description>

      <title>Multi-orbital two-particle self-consistent approach -- strengths and limitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extending many-body numerical techniques which are powerful in the context of simple model calculations to the realm of realistic material simulations can be a challenging task. Realistic systems often involve multiple active orbitals, which increases the complexity and numerical cost because of the large local Hilbert space and the large number of interaction terms or sign-changing off-diagonal Green's functions. The two-particle self-consistent approach (TPSC) is one such many-body numerical technique, for which multi-orbital extensions have proven to be involved due to the substantially more complex structure of the local interaction tensor. In this paper we extend earlier multi-orbital generalizations of TPSC by setting up two different variants of a fully self-consistent theory for TPSC in multi-orbital systems. We first investigate the strengths and limitations of the approach analytically, and then benchmark both variants against exact diagonalization (ED) and dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) results. We find that the exact behavior of the system can be faithfully reproduced in the weak coupling regime, while at stronger couplings the performance of the two approaches strongly depends on details of the system.</description>
