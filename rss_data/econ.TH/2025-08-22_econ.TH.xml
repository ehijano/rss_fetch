      <title>Cautious Dual-Self Expected Utility and Weak Uncertainty Aversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gilboa and Schmeidler's (1989) uncertainty aversion plays a central role in decision theory and economics, yet many inconsistent behaviors have been observed in experiments. Motivated by this, we study an axiom postulating a minimal degree of uncertainty aversion. Our main result shows that this axiom yields a new class of representations, called cautious dual-self expected utility representations. In this model, two selves in the decision maker's mind play an extensive-form game to determine the belief used for evaluation, where the first mover is selected cautiously. As illustrated by two alternative representations, cautiously choosing between two "dual" scenarios is the key implication of our axiom.</description>

      <title>Credit, Land Speculation, and Low-Interest-Rate Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyses the impact of credit expansions arising from increases in collateral values or lower interest rate policies on long-term productivity and economic growth. We show that credit expansions associated with relaxation of real estate financing (capital investment financing) will be productivity-and growth-retarding (enhancing). Without financial regulation, expansionary monetary policy may so encourage land speculation using leverage that productive capital investment is decreased, leading to low interest rates and slow economic growth, while generating temporary asset booms. Its welfare impact differs markedly depending on the generation that experienced the asset price boom and the subsequent generations with low growth.</description>

      <title>Voting with Partial Orders: The Plurality and Anti-Plurality Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17413v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the theory of voting, the Plurality rule for preferences that come in the form of linear orders selects the alternatives most frequently appearing in the first position of those orders, while the Anti-Plurality rule selects the alternatives least often occurring in the final position. We explore extensions of these rules to preferences that are partial orders, offering axiomatic characterisations for them.</description>

      <title>Inequality in the Age of Pseudonymity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04668v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inequality measures such as the Gini coefficient are used to inform and motivate policymaking, and are increasingly applied to digital platforms. We analyze how measures fare in pseudonymous settings that are common in the digital age. One key challenge of such environments is the ability of actors to create fake identities under fictitious false names, also known as ``Sybils.'' While some actors may do so to preserve their privacy, we show that this can inadvertently hamper inequality measurements. As we prove, it is impossible for measures satisfying the literature's canonical set of desired properties to assess the inequality of an economy that may harbor Sybils. We characterize the class of all Sybil-proof measures, and prove that they must satisfy relaxed version of the aforementioned properties. Furthermore, we show that the structure imposed restricts the ability to assess inequality at a fine-grained level. By applying our results, we prove that large classes of popular measures are not Sybil-proof, with the famous Gini coefficient being but one example out of many. Finally, we examine the dynamics leading to the creation of Sybils in digital and traditional settings.</description>
