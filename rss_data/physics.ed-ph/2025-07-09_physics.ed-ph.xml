      <title>Can Contextualized Physics Problems Enhance Student Motivation? Uncovering a Student-Teacher Perception Gap through a Large-Scale Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding physics problems unreal-world settings, here termed contextualized physics problems (CPP), is widely believed to foster students' interest, motivation, and learning. However, firm evidence for this claim remains scarce. To explore this issue, we surveyed 868 secondary students and 154 teachers to examine their attitudes toward CPP and investigate whether students and teachers perceive these problems as promoting student interest and motivation in learning physics. The findings reveal a divergence between teacher and student perspectives. While most teachers view CPP as essential for enhancing interest and motivation, student responses tell a different story. Contextualized problems appear to boost interest and motivation only among 8th graders who are newly introduced to the subject. From 9th to 11th grade, students expressed a clear preference for de-contextualized physics problems (DPP) and generally disagreed that CPP increased their interest in physics. Gender differences were also observed among younger students, with boys showing a moderately stronger preference for CPP than girls. These results provide valuable insights for educators in designing course materials and creating effective test and exercise questions. The discrepancy between teacher and student perceptions, as highlighted by the surveys and interviews, underscores the need to address this gap through targeted teacher training and professional development.</description>

      <title>PULSE-A Mission Overview: Optical Communications for Undergraduate Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in the size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements for space-based sensing have dramatically increased the demand for high-bandwidth downlink. However, high data rate RF transceivers still pose significant SWaP and cost restrictions, especially for university-class CubeSat missions. Optical communication may provide a solution to this challenge, enabling data transmission with order-of-magnitude rate increases over RF while being both secure and SWaP-efficient. The Polarization-modUlated Laser Satellite Experiment (PULSE-A) is a University of Chicago mission to demonstrate optical downlink at a data rate of up to 10 Mbps using circular polarization shift keying (CPolSK). PULSE-A comprises a &lt;1.5U Optical Transmission Terminal, 3U CubeSat Bus, Optical Ground Station (OGS) employing an amateur telescope, and RF Ground Station (RFGS), all of which are being designed and integrated by a team of over 60 undergraduate students. The mission objective is threefold: (1) to provide hands-on educational experiences for undergraduate students, (2) to make hardware for optical communication systems more accessible via open-source design, and (3) to explore the viability and potential advantages of using CPolSK for optical downlink. In this work, we present an overview of the mission, and we describe the PULSE-A Team's learning-oriented approach to program management and engineering. We especially emphasize the importance of student leadership in PULSE-A's development process and the resulting benefits for the University of Chicago community. We also highlight takeaways from the experience of founding and operating an undergraduate student-led CubeSat program.</description>

      <title>scicode-widgets: Bringing Computational Experiments to the Classroom with Jupyter Widgets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Computational experiments" use code and interactive visualizations to convey mathematical and physical concepts in an intuitive way, and are increasingly used to support ex cathedra lecturing in scientific and engineering disciplines. Jupyter notebooks are particularly well-suited to implement them, but involve large amounts of ancillary code to process data and generate illustrations, which can distract students from the core learning outcomes. For a more engaging learning experience that only exposes relevant code to students, allowing them to focus on the interplay between code, theory and physical insights, we developed scicode-widgets (released as scwidgets), a Python package to build Jupyter-based applications. The package facilitates the creation of interactive exercises and demonstrations for students in any discipline in science, technology and engineering. Students are asked to provide pedagogically meaningful contributions in terms of theoretical understanding, coding ability, and analytical skills. The library provides the tools to connect custom pre- and post-processing of students' code, which runs seamlessly "behind the scenes", with the ability to test and verify the solution, as well as to convert it into live interactive visualizations driven by Jupyter widgets.</description>

      <title>Creating a customisable freely-accessible Socratic AI physics tutor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores role engineering as an effective paradigm for customizing Large Language Models (LLMs) into specialized AI tutors for physics education. We demonstrate this methodology by designing a Socratic physics problem-solving tutor using Google's Gemini Gems feature, defining its pedagogical behavior through a detailed 'script' that specifies its role and persona. We present two illustrative use cases: the first demonstrates the Gem's multimodal ability to analyze a student's hand-drawn force diagram and apply notational rules from a 'Knowledge' file; the second showcases its capacity to guide conceptual reasoning in electromagnetism using its pre-trained knowledge without using specific documents provided by the instructor. Our findings show that the 'role-engineered' Gem successfully facilitates a Socratic dialogue, in stark contrast to a standard Gemini model, which tends to immediately provide direct solutions. We conclude that role engineering is a pivotal and accessible method for educators to transform a general-purpose 'solution provider' into a reliable pedagogical tutor capable of engaging students in an active reflection process. This approach offers a powerful tool for both instructors and students, while also highlighting the importance of addressing the technology's inherent limitations, such as the potential for occasional inaccuracies.</description>
