      <title>Theoretical study on $\Xi\alpha$ correlation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $\Xi$-$^4{\mathrm{He}}$ ($\alpha$) momentum correlation functions in the high-energy nuclear collisions to investigate the nature of the $\Xi N$ interactions. We employ the folding $\Xi \alpha$ potential based on the lattice QCD $\Xi N$ interactions to compute the correlation function. The $\Xi \alpha$ potential supports a Coulomb-assisted bound state ${}^5_{\Xi}\mathrm{H}$ in the $\Xi^-\alpha$ channel, while the $\Xi^0\alpha$ channel is unbound. To examine the sensitivity of the correlation function to the nature of the $\Xi \alpha$ interaction, we vary the potential strength simulating stronger and weaker interactions. The result of the correlation function is sensitive to the existence of the bound state in the $\Xi^0 \alpha$ channel, and the characteristic behavior of the bound state remains also in the $\Xi^-\alpha$ correlation with the Coulomb interaction. The effect of the repulsive core of the $\Xi\alpha$ potential can be found in the correlation from the small source as the distinctive dip in the intermediate momentum region.</description>

      <title>Re examination of the effect of Pairing Gaps on Gamow Teller Strength Distributions and beta decay Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beta decay is one of the key factors to understand the r process and evolution of massive stars. The Gamow Teller (GT) transitions drive the beta decay process. We employ the proton neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (on QRPA) model to calculate terrestrial and stellar beta decay rates for 50 top ranked nuclei possessing astrophysical significance according to a recent survey. The model parameters of the on QRPA model affect the predicted results of beta decay. The current study investigates the effect of nucleon nucleon pairing gaps on charge changing transitions and the associated beta decay rates. Three different values of pairing gaps, namely TF, 3TF and 5TF, were used in our investigation. It was concluded that both GT strength distributions and half lives are sensitive to pairing gap values. The 3TF pairing gap scheme, in our chosen nuclear model, resulted in best prediction with around 80 percent of the calculated half-lives within a factor 10 of the measured ones. The 3TF pairing scheme also led to calculation of biggest beta decay rates in stellar matter.</description>

      <title>Can charm fluctuation be a better probe to study QCD critical point?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the diffusion properties of an interacting hadron gas and evaluate the diffusion coefficient matrix for the baryon, strange, electric, and charm quantum numbers. For the first time, this study sheds light on the charm current and estimates the diffusion matrix coefficient for the charmed states by treating them as a part of the quasi-thermalized medium. We explore the diffusion matrix coefficient as a function of temperature and center-of-mass energy. A van der Waals-like interaction is assumed between the hadrons, including attractive and repulsive interactions. The calculation of diffusion coefficients is based on relaxation time approximation to the Boltzmann transport equation. A good agreement with available model calculations is observed in the hadronic limit. To conclude the study, we discuss, with a detailed explanation, that charm fluctuation is expected to be a better tool for probing the QCD critical point.</description>

      <title>Behavior of the continuum coupling correlation energy in the vicinity of the particle emission threshold -- Gamow shell model study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gamow shell model provides the open quantum system formulation of nuclear shell model. In the coupled-channel representation, Gamow shell model provides the unified theory of nuclear structure and reactions which is well suited for the study of resonances and clusterization. In this work, we apply this approach to study the continuum-coupling correlation energy for selected near-threshold states of $^7$Li, $^7$Be, using a translationally invariant Hamiltonian with an effective finite-range two-body interaction.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Light Nuclei on Chemical Freeze-out Parameters at RHIC Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the chemical freeze-out of hadrons, including light-flavor, strange-flavor particles, and light nuclei, produced in Au+Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Utilizing the Thermal-FIST thermodynamic statistical model, we analyzed various particle sets: those inclusive of light nuclei, those exclusive of light nuclei, and those solely comprising light nuclei. We have determined the chemical freeze-out parameters at $\sqrt{s_\text{NN}}=$7.7-200 GeV and four centralities. A significant finding was a decrease in the chemical freeze-out temperature $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ upon the inclusion of light nuclei, with an even more pronounced reduction when considering light nuclei yields exclusively. This indicates that light nuclei formation occurs at a later stage in the system's evolution at RHIC energies. We present parameterized formulas that describe the energy dependence of the chemical freeze-out temperature $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ and baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ for three distinct particle sets in central Au+Au collisions at RHIC energies. Our results reveal the presence of at least three distinct freeze-out hyper-surfaces at RHIC energies, corresponding to different chemical freeze-out temperatures: a light flavor freeze-out temperature of $T_L$=150.2$\pm$6 MeV, a strange flavor freeze-out temperature $T_s$=165.1$\pm$2.7 MeV, and a light nuclei freeze-out temperature $T_{\textrm{ln}}$=141.7$\pm$1.4 MeV. Notably, at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies, the expected lower freeze-out temperature for light nuclei was not observed. Instead, the chemical freeze-out temperature for light nuclei was found to be approximately 10 MeV higher than that for light flavor hadrons. This discrepancy may suggest different production mechanisms for light nuclei between RHIC and LHC energies.</description>

      <title>Multipole responses in fissioning nuclei and their uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electromagnetic multipole responses are key inputs to model the structure, decay and reaction of atomic nuclei. With the introduction of the finite amplitude method (FAM), large-scale calculations of the nuclear linear response in heavy deformed nuclei have become possible. This work provides a detailed study of multipole responses in actinide nuclei with Skyrme energy density functionals. We quantify both systematic and statistical uncertainties induced by the functional parameterization in FAM calculations. We also extend the FAM formalism to perform blocking calculations with the equal filling approximation for odd-mass and odd-odd nuclei, and analyze the impact of blocking configurations on the response. By examining the entire plutonium isotopic chain from the proton to the neutron dripline, we find a large variability of the response with the neutron number and study how it correlates with the deformation of the nuclear ground state.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Nuclear Mass Models Using Algorithms and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Taking into account nucleon-nucleon gravitational interaction, higher-order terms of symmetry energy, pairing interaction, and neural network corrections, a new BW4 mass model has been developed, which more accurately reflects the contributions of various terms to the binding energy. A novel hybrid algorithm and neural network correction method has been implemented to optimize the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental results, significantly improving the model's binding energy predictions (reduced to around 350 keV). At the same time, the theoretical accuracy near magic nuclei has been marginally enhanced, effectively capturing the special interaction effects around magic nuclei and showing good agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to the forward-backward asymmetry in $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.03495v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the $C$-odd radiative corrections to $e^+e^-\to \pi^+\pi^-$ in a dispersive formalism, concentrating on the leading pion-pole contribution in the virtual box diagrams. In particular, we show how the effect of a general pion vector form factor in the loop integral can be incorporated in a model-independent way and how the cancellation of infrared singularities proceeds in this case. The numerical results, dominated by the infrared enhanced contributions, indicate significant corrections beyond scalar QED, essentially confirming recent findings in generalized vector-meson-dominance models.</description>

      <title>Generalized nonlinear Langevin equation from quantum nonlinear projection operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically derive the quantum generalized nonlinear Langevin equation using Morozov's projection operator method. This approach extends the linear Mori-Zwanzig projection operator technique, allowing for the inclusion of nonlinear interactions among macroscopic modes. Additionally, we obtain the quantum generalized Fokker-Planck equation within the Heisenberg picture, which is consistent with Morozov's original formulation. These equations are fundamentally significant in non-equilibrium statistical physics, particularly in scenarios characterized by enhanced fluctuations, such as anomalous transport phenomena near critical points. The quantum nature of the derived generalized Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations is anticipated to provide a more detailed description than their classical equivalents. Specifically, the noise kernel in the quantum generalized Langevin equation is multiplicative, which broadens the applicability beyond Gaussian approximations. Given specific interactions, these equations are expected to be instrumental in investigating critical transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>On the absence of the Chiral Magnetic Effect in equilibrium QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the chiral magnetic effect (CME): the generation of an electric current due to a homogeneous background magnetic field and a homogeneous chiral imbalance in QCD. We demonstrate that the leading coefficient describing the CME vanishes in equilibrium, both for free fermions as well as in full QCD. Our full QCD results are based on continuum extrapolated lattice simulations using dynamical staggered quarks with physical masses as well as quenched Wilson quarks. We show that it is crucial that a gauge invariant ultraviolet regularization is used to compute the CME and elaborate on why some of the existing in-equilibrium calculations of this effect gave a nonzero result. We stress that our findings imply the absence of a time-independent CME current flowing in equilibrium QCD, but do not concern the CME as an out-of-equilibrium, time-dependent effect.</description>
