      <title>A Case for AXI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the LIBOR era, banks routinely tied revolving credit facilities to credit-sensitive benchmarks. This study assesses the Across-the-Curve Credit Spread Index (AXI) -- a transparent, transaction-based measure of wholesale bank funding costs -- as a complement to SOFR, summarizing its behavior, construction, and loan-pricing implications. AXI aggregates observable unsecured funding transactions across short- and long-term maturities to produce a daily credit spread that is IOSCO-aligned and operationally compatible with SOFR-based infrastructure. The Financial Conditions Credit Spread Index (FXI) is a broader market companion to AXI and serves as its fallback. FXI co-moves closely with AXI in normal times; under stress, the correlation of daily changes exceeds 0.9 for economy-wide shocks and remains strong in bank-specific stress, around 0.8 during the Silicon Valley Bank episode. Empirically, AXI is strongly correlated with standard credit-spread measures and market-stress indicators and is inversely related to financial-sector performance. SOFR+AXI exhibits correlations with macroeconomic variables with the signs and magnitudes expected of a credit-sensitive rate. In loan-pricing applications, SOFR+AXI reduces funding risk and can support spread discounts of up to 65 basis points without lowering risk-adjusted returns. In stress scenarios, banks relying on SOFR-only pricing can fail to recover as much as 15 basis points on revolving credit lines over as little as three months. Taken together, AXI restores the credit sensitivity lost in the USD LIBOR transition while avoiding reliance on thin short-term markets, delivering significant economic value.</description>

      <title>HyPV-LEAD: Proactive Early-Warning of Cryptocurrency Anomalies through Data-Driven Structural-Temporal Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abnormal cryptocurrency transactions - such as mixing services, fraudulent transfers, and pump-and-dump operations -- pose escalating risks to financial integrity but remain notoriously difficult to detect due to class imbalance, temporal volatility, and complex network dependencies. Existing approaches are predominantly model-centric and post hoc, flagging anomalies only after they occur and thus offering limited preventive value. This paper introduces HyPV-LEAD (Hyperbolic Peak-Valley Lead-time Enabled Anomaly Detection), a data-driven early-warning framework that explicitly incorporates lead time into anomaly detection. Unlike prior methods, HyPV-LEAD integrates three innovations: (1) window-horizon modeling to guarantee actionable lead-time alerts, (2) Peak-Valley (PV) sampling to mitigate class imbalance while preserving temporal continuity, and (3) hyperbolic embedding to capture the hierarchical and scale-free properties of blockchain transaction networks. Empirical evaluation on large-scale Bitcoin transaction data demonstrates that HyPV-LEAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a PR-AUC of 0.9624 with significant gains in precision and recall. Ablation studies further confirm that each component - PV sampling, hyperbolic embedding, and structural-temporal modeling - provides complementary benefits, with the full framework delivering the highest performance. By shifting anomaly detection from reactive classification to proactive early-warning, HyPV-LEAD establishes a robust foundation for real-time risk management, anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, and financial security in dynamic blockchain environments.</description>
