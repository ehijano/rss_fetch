      <title>Miniature fluorescence sensor for quantitative detection of brain tumour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescence-guided surgery has emerged as a vital tool for tumour resection procedures. As well as intraoperative tumour visualisation, 5-ALA-induced PpIX provides an avenue for quantitative tumour identification based on ratiometric fluorescence measurement. To this end, fluorescence imaging and fibre-based probes have enabled more precise demarcation between the cancerous and healthy tissues. These sensing approaches, which rely on collecting the fluorescence light from the tumour resection site and its remote spectral sensing, introduce challenges associated with optical losses. In this work, we demonstrate the viability of tumour detection at the resection site using a miniature fluorescence measurement system. Unlike the current bulky systems, which necessitate remote measurement, we have adopted a millimetre-sized spectral sensor chip for quantitative fluorescence measurements. A reliable measurement at the resection site requires a stable optical window between the tissue and the optoelectronic system. This is achieved using an antifouling diamond window, which provides stable optical transparency. The system achieved a sensitivity of 92.3% and specificity of 98.3% in detecting a surrogate tumour at a resolution of 1 x 1 mm2. As well as addressing losses associated with collecting and coupling fluorescence light in the current remote sensing approaches, the small size of the system introduced in this work paves the way for its direct integration with the tumour resection tools with the aim of more accurate interoperative tumour identification.</description>

      <title>Necessary and sufficient condition for neutral-type delay systems: Polynomial approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new necessary and sufficient stability test in a tractable number of operations for linear neutral-type delay systems is introduced. It is developed in the Lyapunov-Krasovskii framework via functionals with prescribed derivatives. The necessary conditions, which stem from substituting any polynomial approximation of the functional argument, reduce to a quadratic form of monomials whose matrix is independent of the coefficients of the approximation under consideration. In the particular case of Chebyshev polynomials, the functional approximation error is quantified, leading to an estimate of the order of approximation such that the positive semi-definiteness of the functional is verified. Some examples illustrate the obtained results.</description>

      <title>Combining Neural Networks and Symbolic Regression for Analytical Lyapunov Function Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose CoNSAL (Combining Neural networks and Symbolic regression for Analytical Lyapunov function) to construct analytical Lyapunov functions for nonlinear dynamic systems. This framework contains a neural Lyapunov function and a symbolic regression component, where symbolic regression is applied to distill the neural network to precise analytical forms. Our approach utilizes symbolic regression not only as a tool for translation but also as a means to uncover counterexamples. This procedure terminates when no counterexamples are found in the analytical formulation. Compared with previous results, our algorithm directly produces an analytical form of the Lyapunov function with improved interpretability in both the learning process and the final results. We apply our algorithm to 2-D inverted pendulum, path following, Van Der Pol Oscillator, 3-D trig dynamics, 4-D rotating wheel pendulum, 6-D 3-bus power system, and demonstrate that our algorithm successfully finds their valid Lyapunov functions.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant control of random switching topology multi-agent system based on event triggering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the formation control of multi-agent systems in random switching communication topology is studied, and the problem of excessive bandwidth and low control efficiency among multi-agents is solved. For nonlinear multi-agent systems, a sliding mode formation control algorithm with event-triggered random switching communication topology is proposed. Firstly, a fault-tolerant control strategy based on stochastic system model is designed to solve the problem of low controller efficiency and controller failure during the formation of multi-agent systems. Compared with the traditional multi-agent system dynamic model, the stochastic system model has stronger universality, which improves the efficiency of the controller. Secondly, in order to deal with the problem of high communication load and frequency between agents during formation in random switching communication topology, the sample-based event triggering controller is introduced into the controller, which effectively reduces the communication frequency and reduces the impact of communication delay. Finally, the stability and robustness of event-triggered random switching topology formation control are verified by computer simulation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the growing necessity for precise modeling of power electronics amidst operational and environmental uncertainties, this paper introduces an innovative methodology that ingeniously combines model-driven and data-driven approaches to enhance the stability of power electronics interacting with grid-forming microgrids. By employing the physics-informed neural network (PINN) as a foundation, this strategy merges robust data-fitting capabilities with fundamental physical principles, thereby constructing an accurate system model. By this means, it significantly enhances the ability to understand and replicate the dynamics of power electronics systems under complex working conditions. Moreover, by incorporating advanced learning-based control methods, the proposed method is enabled to make precise predictions and implement the satisfactory control laws even under serious uncertain conditions. Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach, highlighting its substantial potential in addressing prevalent uncertainties in controlling modern power electronics systems.</description>

      <title>Multistep Criticality Search and Power Shaping in Microreactors with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing operation and maintenance costs is a key objective for advanced reactors in general and microreactors in particular. To achieve this reduction, developing robust autonomous control algorithms is essential to ensure safe and autonomous reactor operation. Recently, artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, specifically reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, have seen rapid increased application to control problems, such as plasma control in fusion tokamaks and building energy management. In this work, we introduce the use of RL for intelligent control in nuclear microreactors. The RL agent is trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) and advantage actor-critic (A2C), cutting-edge deep RL techniques, based on a high-fidelity simulation of a microreactor design inspired by the Westinghouse eVinci\textsuperscript{TM} design. We utilized a Serpent model to generate data on drum positions, core criticality, and core power distribution for training a feedforward neural network surrogate model. This surrogate model was then used to guide a PPO and A2C control policies in determining the optimal drum position across various reactor burnup states, ensuring critical core conditions and symmetrical power distribution across all six core portions. The results demonstrate the excellent performance of PPO in identifying optimal drum positions, achieving a hextant power tilt ratio of approximately 1.002 (within the limit of $&lt;$ 1.02) and maintaining criticality within a 10 pcm range. A2C did not provide as competitive of a performance as PPO in terms of performance metrics for all burnup steps considered in the cycle. Additionally, the results highlight the capability of well-trained RL control policies to quickly identify control actions, suggesting a promising approach for enabling real-time autonomous control through digital twins.</description>

      <title>Voltage enhancement and loss minimization in a radial network through optimal capacitor sizing and placement based on Crow Search Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In power systems, the distribution network is pivotal for consumers because it is the final stage in the delivery of electricity from the generation plants to the end users. Reactive power demand from consumers can result in challenges like low power factor, diminished voltage, and heightened power losses. The primary challenge encountered when utilizing a radial system as a distribution network is the voltage drop, which leads to distortion in the voltage profile across the entire network. This research focuses on optimizing network performance by appropriately sizing and placing capacitors based on the Crow Search Algorithm (CSA). The results from this approach were compared with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Artificial bee colony, Cultural Algorithm, Firefly Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm, Invasive Weed Optimization, and Teacher Learner Based Optimization methods illustrated in the study where CSA's effectiveness, demonstrated a notable 30.41% and 29.33% overall reduction in active and reactive power losses compared to the base case. The lowest bus voltage, notably at bus 18 which happens to be the longest in the IEEE 33 Radial Distribution Network (RDN) topology, improved from 0.8820 in the base case to 0.908 with CSA, showcasing a 32.9% enhancement in voltage deviation. This optimization led to a significant 3.841pu reduction in capacitor cost, highlighting CSA's efficacy in enhancing RDN performance and cost efficiency.</description>

      <title>Deep-MPC: A DAGGER-Driven Imitation Learning Strategy for Optimal Constrained Battery Charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of battery charging, several complex aspects demand meticulous attention, including thermal management, capacity degradation, and the need for rapid charging while maintaining safety and battery lifespan. By employing the imitation learning paradigm, this manuscript introduces an innovative solution to confront the inherent challenges often associated with conventional predictive control strategies for constrained battery charging. A significant contribution of this study lies in the adaptation of the Dataset Aggregation (DAGGER) algorithm to address scenarios where battery parameters are uncertain, and internal states are unobservable. Results drawn from a practical battery simulator that incorporates an electrochemical model highlight substantial improvements in battery charging performance, particularly in meeting all safety constraints and outperforming traditional strategies in computational processing.</description>

      <title>State-Compensation-Linearization-Based Stability Margin Analysis for a Class of Nonlinear Systems: A Data-Driven Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical stability margin analysis based on the linearized model is widely used in practice even in nonlinear systems. Although linear analysis techniques are relatively standard and have simple implementation structures, they are prone to misbehavior and failure when the system is performing an off-nominal operation. To avoid the drawbacks and exploit the advantages of linear analysis methods and frequency-domain stability margin analysis while tackling system nonlinearity, a state-compensation-linearization-based stability margin analysis method is studied in the paper. Based on the state-compensation-linearization-based stabilizing control, the definition and measurement of the stability margin are given. The l2 gain margin and l2 time-delay margin for the closed-loop nonlinear system with state-compensation-linearization-based stabilizing control are defined and derived approximatively by the small-gain theorem in theory. The stability margin measurement can be carried out by the frequency-sweep method in practice. The proposed method is a data-driven method for obtaining the stability margin of nonlinear systems, which is practical and can be applied to practical systems directly. Finally, three numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Lightweight GPS Disciplined Oscillators for Distributed UAV Measurement Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With an increasing variety of measurement applications using sensing nodes on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), global positioning system (GPS) and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) disciplined oscillators (GPSDOs, GNSSDOs) are an appealing solution for precise wireless inter-device synchronization. Typically evaluated under laboratory conditions by analyzing the 10 MHz and 1 pulse per second (PPS) reference signal stability, these test methods overlook airborne oscillator performance. This paper characterizes lightweight GNSSDO models for flight suitability using a measurement system based on software defined radios (SDRs). We analyze reference signal stability under controlled GNSS signal impairments to predict performance and measurement precision loss in dynamic operational modes. Additionally, we assess behavior under the impacts caused by operating the UAV, as well as typical flight vibrations and accelerations outlined in the standard for payload devices.</description>

      <title>Proper Implicit Discretization of the Super-Twisting Controller -- without and with Actuator Saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrete-time implementation of the super-twisting sliding mode controller for a plant with disturbances with bounded slope, zero-order hold actuation, and actuator constraints is considered. Motivated by restrictions of existing implicit or semi-implicit discretization variants, a new proper implicit discretization for the super-twisting controller is proposed. This discretization is then extended to the conditioned super-twisting controller, which mitigates windup in presence of actuator constraints by means of the conditioning technique. It is proven that the proposed controllers achieve best possible worst-case performance subject to similarily simple stability conditions as their continuous-time counterparts. Numerical simulations and comparisons demonstrate and illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>The Analysis and the Performance of the Parallel-Partial Reset Control System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reset controllers have demonstrated their effectiveness in enhancing performance in precision motion systems. To further exploiting the potential of reset controllers, this study introduces a parallel-partial reset control structure. Frequency response analysis is effective for the design and fine-tuning of controllers in industries. However, conducting frequency response analysis for reset control systems poses challenges due to their nonlinearities. We develop frequency response analysis methods for both the open-loop and closed-loop parallel-partial reset systems. Simulation results validate the accuracy of the analysis methods, showcasing precision enhancements exceeding 100% compared to the traditional describing function method. Furthermore, we design a parallel-partial reset controller within the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control structure for a mass-spring-damper system. The frequency response analysis of the designed system indicates that, while maintaining the same bandwidth and phase margin of the first-order harmonics, the new system exhibits lower magnitudes of higher-order harmonics, compared to the traditional reset system. Moreover, simulation results demonstrate that the new system achieves lower overshoot and quicker settling time compared to both the traditional reset and linear systems.</description>

      <title>Frequency Constrained MPC for Efficient Grid Side Operation of Wind Power Conversion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) has proven its applicability in power conversion control with its fast dynamic response to reference changes while ensuring critical system constraints are satisfied. Even then, the computational burden still remains a challenge for many MPC variants. In this regard, this paper formulates an indirect MPC scheme for grid-side wind converters. A quadratic program with linear constraints is solved in a receding horizon fashion with a subsequent PWM modulator. To facilitate its solution within a few hundreds of microseconds, its decision variables (modulating signals) are restricted to a specific frequency content. This approach limits the increase in problem size due to horizon length. In case studies, the proposed MPC exhibits fast response in faults and operates the converter within its safety limits.</description>

      <title>Received Power Maximization Using Nonuniform Discrete Phase Shifts for RISs With a Limited Phase Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To maximize the received power at a user equipment, the problem of optimizing a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with a limited phase range R and nonuniform discrete phase shifts with adjustable gains is addressed. Necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve this maximization are given. These conditions are employed in two algorithms to achieve the global optimum in linear time for R {\ge} {\pi} and R &lt; {\pi}, where R is the RIS phase range. With a total number of N(2K +1) complex vector additions, it is shown for R {\ge} {\pi} and R &lt; {\pi} that the global optimality is achieved in NK or fewer and N(K +1) or fewer steps, respectively, where N is the number of RIS elements and K is the number of discrete phase shifts which may be placed nonuniformly over the phase range R. In addition, we define an intuitive quantization algorithm that we call the nonuniform polar quantization (NPQ) algorithm. With NPQ, we provide a closed form solution for the approximation ratio with which an arbitrary set of nonuniform discrete phase shifts can approximate the continuous solution. We also show that with a phase range limitation, equal separation among the nonuniform discrete phase shifts maximizes the normalized performance. Furthermore, we show that the gain of using K {\ge} 3 with R &lt; {\pi}/2 and K {\ge} 4 with R &lt; {\pi} is only marginal. Finally, we reveal that when R &lt; 2{\pi}/3, ON/OFF selection for the RIS elements brings significant performance compared to the case when the RIS elements are strictly ON.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a discrete-time integral resonant control (IRC) approach for negative imaginary (NI) systems, which overcomes several limitations of continuous-time IRC. We show that a discrete-time IRC has a step-advanced negative imaginary property. A zero-order hold-sampled NI system can be asymptotically stabilized using a discrete-time IRC with suitable parameters. A hardware experiment is conducted where a high-speed flexure-guided nanopositioner is efficiently damped using the proposed discrete-time IRC with the discrete-time controller being implemented in FPGA hardware at the sampling rate of 1.25 MHz.</description>

      <title>Testing Topological Data Analysis for Condition Monitoring of Wind Turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an investigation of how topological data analysis (TDA) can be applied to condition-based monitoring (CBM) of wind turbines for energy generation. TDA is a branch of data analysis focusing on extracting meaningful information from complex datasets by analyzing their structure in state space and computing their underlying topological features. By representing data in a high-dimensional state space, TDA enables the identification of patterns, anomalies, and trends in the data that may not be apparent through traditional signal processing methods. For this study, wind turbine data was acquired from a wind park in Norway via standard vibration sensors at different locations of the turbine's gearbox. Both the vibration acceleration data and its frequency spectra were recorded at infrequent intervals for a few seconds at high frequency and failure events were labelled as either gear-tooth or ball-bearing failures. The data processing and analysis are based on a pipeline where the time series data is first split into intervals and then transformed into multi-dimensional point clouds via a time-delay embedding. The shape of the point cloud is analyzed with topological methods such as persistent homology to generate topology-based key health indicators based on Betti numbers, information entropy and signal persistence. Such indicators are tested for CBM and diagnosis (fault detection) to identify faults in wind turbines and classify them accordingly. Topological indicators are shown to be an interesting alternative for failure identification and diagnosis of operational failures in wind turbines.</description>

      <title>Recent advancements on MPC for tracking: periodic and harmonic formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main benefit of model predictive control (MPC) is its ability to steer the system to a given reference without violating the constraints while minimizing some objective. Furthermore, a suitably designed MPC controller guarantees asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system to the given reference as long as its optimization problem is feasible at the initial state of the system. Therefore, one of the limitations of classical MPC is that changing the reference may lead to an unfeasible MPC problem. Furthermore, due to a lack of deep knowledge of the system, it is possible for the user to provide a desired reference that is unfeasible or non-attainable for the MPC controller, leading to the same problem. This chapter summarizes MPC formulations recently proposed that have been designed to address these issues. In particular, thanks to the addition of an artificial reference as decision variable, the formulations achieve asymptotic stability and recursive feasibility guarantees regardless of the reference provided by the user, even if it is changed online or if it violates the system constraints. We show a recent formulation which extends this idea, achieving better performance and larger domains of attraction when working with small prediction horizons. Additional benefits of these formulations, when compared to classical MPC, are also discussed and highlighted with illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Switching Controller Synthesis for Hybrid Systems Against STL Formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Switching controllers play a pivotal role in directing hybrid systems (HSs) towards the desired objective, embodying a ``correct-by-construction'' approach to HS design. Identifying these objectives is thus crucial for the synthesis of effective switching controllers. While most of existing works focus on safety and liveness, few of them consider timing constraints. In this paper, we delves into the synthesis of switching controllers for HSs that meet system objectives given by a fragment of STL, which essentially corresponds to a reach-avoid problem with timing constraints. Our approach involves iteratively computing the state sets that can be driven to satisfy the reach-avoid specification with timing constraints. This technique supports to create switching controllers for both constant and non-constant HSs. We validate our method's soundness, and confirm its relative completeness for a certain subclass of HSs. Experiment results affirms the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Tuning a Cascaded Online Feedback Optimization Controller for Provision of Distributed Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinating a high number of flexibility providing units (e.g. to provide ancillary services for the transmission system) across various grid layers requires new control concepts. A flexibility request at a point of common coupling can be met by utilizing a cascaded control structure based on online feedback optimization. In this paper the influence of the parameterization of the individual controllers on the performance of the hierarchical flexibility provision is studied on a three-level test system. The results show a high interdependency between the choice of control parameters of one controller and the behavior of other controllers as well as a significant impact on the accuracy and speed of flexibility provision. With a careful tuning, a cascaded structure based on online feedback optimization can achieve efficient vertical coordination of flexibility providing units.</description>

      <title>Generalized Modal Analysis in Power System with High CIG Penetration: Concept and Quantitative Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Generalized Modal Analysis (GMA) concept for the small-signal stability analysis of power systems with high penetration of Converter-Interfaced Generation (CIG). GMA quantitatively assesses interactions between various elements in the power system, offering intuitive and transparent physical interpretations. The method's versatility in selecting physical quantities at different input and output ports makes it broadly applicable. Based on the concept of GMA, the study further defines interaction quantification indices by selecting voltage ports, examining the impact of grid disturbances on power sources and the support from the power sources to the grid at connection points. Numerical simulations on modified 14-bus and 68-bus systems validate GMA's effectiveness in capturing the coupling of the dynamic characteristics between grid elements. This research provides a theoretical foundation and analytical framework for future analyses of power system stability with diverse power sources.</description>

      <title>Koopman Operator-based Detection-Isolation of Cyberattack: A Case Study on Electric Vehicle Charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key challenges towards the reliable operation of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is the threat of cyberattacks on system actuation signals and measurements. In recent years, system theoretic research has focused on effectively detecting and isolating these cyberattacks to ensure proper restorative measures. Although both model-based and model-free approaches have been used in this context, the latter are increasingly becoming more popular as complexities and model uncertainties in CPS increases. Thus, in this paper we propose a Koopman operator-based model-free cyberattack detection-isolation scheme for CPS. The algorithm uses limited system measurements for its training and generates real-time detection-isolation flags. Furthermore, we present a simulation case study to detect and isolate actuation and sensor attacks in a Lithium-ion battery system of a plug-in electric vehicle during charging.</description>

      <title>Fuel-Optimal Formation Reconfiguration by Means of Unidirectional Low-Thrust Propulsion System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of electric low-thrust propulsion systems for orbit maneuvers is becoming a popular choice among satellite manufacturers due to their inherent merits over their chemical counterparts. Many designers choose to incorporate multiple of such thrusters to insure omnidirectional orbit maneuverability, while others choose to equip their satellite with only one thruster nozzle, aiming to reduce the required power, weight, and size of the orbit control system. This paper proposes guidance and control schemes to address the problem of autonomous optimal relative orbit reconfiguration for a formation of two satellites, one of which utilizes a single low-thrust throttleable nozzle. Such under-actuated orbit control system requires the controlled spacecraft to constantly slew to direct the nozzle to the desired thrust direction. These redirection attitude maneuvers are treated within the guidance layer by accommodating recurrent no-thrust periods during which slew maneuvers take place. The control loop is then closed with an MPC-like scheme. The main motivation of this article is to support the future missions of LuxSpace's flagship satellite, Triton-X. Since the proposed guidance and control schemes are meant to answer realistic market needs, they are designed to have some specific qualities that makes them attractive from the practical point of view. Namely, they require minimal computational loads, besides being able to accommodate operational time constraints, e.g. no thrusting during eclipse or during ground contact, within the guidance layer.</description>

      <title>A Flexible Cryptographic Infrastructure for High-security SDR-based Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Military software defined radio (SDR) systems are a major factor in future network-centric operations due to their flexibility and support for more capable radio communications systems. The inherent nature of software-based systems requires a more complex auxiliary infrastructure and multiple independent levels of security compared with typical systems: Secure booting of the SDR device, cryptographically signed software, real time operating platform software as well as radio applications. This technology raises new challenges with respect to the management. The largest impact on SDR deployments is due to the auxiliary cryptographic infrastructure for the security of the software life cycle and the cyclic update of the keys. Compared to conventional radio devices, the SDR system with the cryptographic infrastructure described in this paper reaches a higher security level and is more flexible. The advantage is the possibility to deploy trunked radio system and further waveforms, such as coalition wideband, which will be standardized in the future. Also it is possible to update cryptographic mechanisms. In this work, we analyze the requirements for a high secure SDR deployment and model the life cycle of the components of a deployed SDR node based on the Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO) Software Communication Architecture (SCA).</description>

      <title>Cyclic Scheduler Design for Minimizing Age of Information in Massive Scale Networks Susceptible to Packet Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multi-source status update systems, sources need to be scheduled appropriately to maintain timely communication between each of the sources and the monitor. A cyclic schedule is an age-agnostic schedule in which the sources are served according to a fixed finite transmission pattern, which upon completion, repeats itself. Such a scheme has a low $O(1)$ runtime complexity, which is desirable in large networks. This paper's focus is on designing transmission patterns so as to be used in massive scale networking scenarios involving a very large number of sources, e.g., up to thousands of IoT sources, with service time requirements and weights being heterogeneous in nature. The goal is to minimize the weighted sum age of information (AoI), called weighted AoI, when transmitting users' packets over a channel susceptible to heterogeneous packet errors. The main tool we use is a stochastic modeling framework using either Markov chains (MC) or moment generating functions (MGF), by which we obtain the weighted AoI for a given transmission pattern, which is not straightforward in the presence of packet drops. Using this framework, we provide a lower bound on the weighted AoI for the particular case of two sources, and also an algorithm to attain this lower bound. Then, by using the same framework, we design a cyclic scheduler for general number of sources with reasonable complexity using convex optimization and well-established packet spreading algorithms, and comparatively evaluate the proposed algorithm and existing age-agnostic scheduling schemes for general number of sources (resp.~two sources) when the lower bound is not available (resp.~when it is available). We present extensive numerical results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The method of occupation kernels has been used to learn ordinary differential equations from data in a non-parametric way. We propose a two-step method for learning the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation given snapshots of the process. In the first step, we learn the drift by applying the occupation kernel algorithm to the expected value of the process. In the second step, we learn the diffusion given the drift using a semi-definite program. Specifically, we learn the diffusion squared as a non-negative function in a RKHS associated with the square of a kernel. We present examples and simulations.</description>

      <title>Modeling Unknown Stochastic Dynamical System Subject to External Excitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical method for learning unknown nonautonomous stochastic dynamical system, i.e., stochastic system subject to time dependent excitation or control signals. Our basic assumption is that the governing equations for the stochastic system are unavailable. However, short bursts of input/output (I/O) data consisting of certain known excitation signals and their corresponding system responses are available. When a sufficient amount of such I/O data are available, our method is capable of learning the unknown dynamics and producing an accurate predictive model for the stochastic responses of the system subject to arbitrary excitation signals not in the training data. Our method has two key components: (1) a local approximation of the training I/O data to transfer the learning into a parameterized form; and (2) a generative model to approximate the underlying unknown stochastic flow map in distribution. After presenting the method in detail, we present a comprehensive set of numerical examples to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, especially for long-term system predictions.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Planning for Stochastic Control on Constrained Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the world of stochastic control, especially in economics and engineering, Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) can effectively model various stochastic decision processes, from asset management to transportation optimization. These underlying MDPs, upon closer examination, often reveal a specifically constrained causal structure concerning the transition and reward dynamics. By exploiting this structure, we can obtain a reduction in the causal representation of the problem setting, allowing us to solve of the optimal value function more efficiently. This work defines an MDP framework, the \texttt{SD-MDP}, where we disentangle the causal structure of MDPs' transition and reward dynamics, providing distinct partitions on the temporal causal graph. With this stochastic reduction, the \texttt{SD-MDP} reflects a general class of resource allocation problems. This disentanglement further enables us to derive theoretical guarantees on the estimation error of the value function under an optimal policy by allowing independent value estimation from Monte Carlo sampling. Subsequently, by integrating this estimator into well-known Monte Carlo planning algorithms, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we derive bounds on the simple regret of the algorithm. Finally, we quantify the policy improvement of MCTS under the \texttt{SD-MDP} framework by demonstrating that the MCTS planning algorithm achieves higher expected reward (lower costs) under a constant simulation budget, on a tangible economic example based on maritime refuelling.</description>

      <title>Compact Model Parameter Extraction via Derivative-Free Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of compact model parameter extraction to simultaneously extract tens of parameters via derivative-free optimization. Traditionally, parameter extraction is performed manually by dividing the complete set of parameters into smaller subsets, each targeting different operational regions of the device, a process that can take several days or even weeks. Our approach streamlines this process by employing derivative-free optimization to identify a good parameter set that best fits the compact model without performing an exhaustive number of simulations. We further enhance the optimization process to address critical issues in device modeling by carefully choosing a loss function that evaluates model performance consistently across varying magnitudes by focusing on relative errors (as opposed to absolute errors), prioritizing accuracy in key operational regions of the device above a certain threshold, and reducing sensitivity to outliers. Furthermore, we utilize the concept of train-test split to assess the model fit and avoid overfitting. This is done by fitting 80% of the data and testing the model efficacy with the remaining 20%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology by successfully modeling two semiconductor devices: a diamond Schottky diode and a GaN-on-SiC HEMT, with the latter involving the ASM-HEMT DC model, which requires simultaneously extracting 35 model parameters to fit the model to the measured data. These examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and showcase the practical benefits of derivative-free optimization in device modeling.</description>

      <title>Fault Detection for agents on power grid topology optimization: A Comprehensive analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topology optimization of transmission networks using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has increasingly come into focus. Various researchers have proposed different DRL agents, which are often benchmarked on the Grid2Op environment from the Learning to Run a Power Network (L2RPN) challenges. The environments have many advantages with their realistic chronics and underlying power flow backends. However, the interpretation of agent survival or failure is not always clear, as there are a variety of potential causes. In this work, we focus on the failures of the power grid to identify patterns and detect them a priori. We collect the failed chronics of three different agents on the WCCI 2022 L2RPN environment, totaling about 40k data points. By clustering, we are able to detect five distinct clusters, identifying different failure types. Further, we propose a multi-class prediction approach to detect failures beforehand and evaluate five different models. Here, the Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM) shows the best performance, with an accuracy of 86%. It also correctly identifies in 91% of the time failure and survival observations. Finally, we provide a detailed feature importance analysis that identifies critical features and regions in the grid.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Distributionally Robust Optimization Layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing research interest in decision-focused learning, which embeds optimization problems as a layer in learning pipelines and demonstrates a superior performance than the prediction-focused approach. However, for distributionally robust optimization (DRO), a popular paradigm for decision-making under uncertainty, it is still unknown how to embed it as a layer, i.e., how to differentiate decisions with respect to an ambiguity set. In this paper, we develop such differentiable DRO layers for generic mixed-integer DRO problems with parameterized second-order conic ambiguity sets and discuss its extension to Wasserstein ambiguity sets. To differentiate the mixed-integer decisions, we propose a novel dual-view methodology by handling continuous and discrete parts of decisions via different principles. Specifically, we construct a differentiable energy-based surrogate to implement the dual-view methodology and use importance sampling to estimate its gradient. We further prove that such a surrogate enjoys the asymptotic convergency under regularization. As an application of the proposed differentiable DRO layers, we develop a novel decision-focused learning pipeline for contextual distributionally robust decision-making tasks and compare it with the prediction-focused approach in experiments.</description>

Abstract: The control of a mosquito population using the sterile insect technique is considered. Building on a model-based approach, where the control input is the release rate of sterilized males, we propose a non-negative backstepping control law capable of globally stabilizing the extinction equilibrium of the system. A simulation study supports and validates the theoretical findings, showing the efficacy of the approach both on a reduced model, used for control design, and on a complete model of the mosquito population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Sigma-point Kalman Filter with Nonlinear Unknown Input Estimation via Optimization and Data-driven Approach for Dynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most works on joint state and unknown input (UI) estimation require the assumption that the UIs are linear; this is potentially restrictive as it does not hold in many intelligent autonomous systems. To overcome this restriction and circumvent the need to linearize the system, we propose a derivative-free Unknown Input Sigma-point Kalman Filter (SPKF-nUI) where the SPKF is interconnected with a general nonlinear UI estimator that can be implemented via nonlinear optimization and data-driven approaches. The nonlinear UI estimator uses the posterior state estimate which is less susceptible to state prediction error. In addition, we introduce a joint sigma-point transformation scheme to incorporate both the state and UI uncertainties in the estimation of SPKF-nUI. An in-depth stochastic stability analysis proves that the proposed SPKF-nUI yields exponentially converging estimation error bounds under reasonable assumptions. Finally, two case studies are carried out on a simulation-based rigid robot and a physical soft robot, i.e., robots made of soft materials with complex dynamics to validate effectiveness of the proposed filter on nonlinear dynamic systems. Our results demonstrate that the proposed SPKF-nUI achieves the lowest state and UI estimation errors when compared to the existing nonlinear state-UI filters.</description>

      <title>Wholesale Market Participation of DERA: Competitive DER Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the aggregation of distributed energy resources (DERs) by a profit-seeking DER aggregator (DERA), participating directly in the wholesale electricity market and constrained by the distribution network access. We propose a competitive DER aggregation that maximizes the DERA's profit subject to that each customer of the DERA gains no less surplus and pays no higher energy cost than that under the regulated retail tariff. The DERA participates in the wholesale electricity market as virtual storage with optimized generation offers and consumption bids derived from the DERA's competitive aggregation. Also derived are DERA's bid curves for the distribution network access and DERA's profitability when competing with the regulated retail tariff. We show that, with the same distribution network access, the proposed DERA's wholesale market participation achieves the same welfare-maximizing outcome as when its customers participate directly in the wholesale market. We empirically evaluate how many DERAs can survive in the long-run equilibrium. Numerical studies also compare the proposed DERA with existing benchmarks on surpluses of DERA's customers and DERA profits as functions of the DER adoption level and the distribution network access.</description>

      <title>Feedback linearization through the lens of data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling nonlinear systems, especially when data are being used to offset uncertainties in the model, is hard. A natural approach when dealing with the challenges of nonlinear control is to reduce the system to a linear one via change of coordinates and feedback, an approach commonly known as feedback linearization. Here we consider the feedback linearization problem of an unknown system when the solution must be found using experimental data. We propose a new method that learns the change of coordinates and the linearizing controller from a library (a dictionary) of candidate functions with a simple algebraic procedure - the computation of the null space of a data-dependent matrix. Remarkably, we show that the solution is valid over the entire state space of interest and not just on the dataset used to determine the solution.</description>

      <title>An Approach to Evaluate Modeling Adequacy for Small-Signal Stability Analysis of IBR-related SSOs in Multimachine Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-varying phasor-based analysis of subsynchronous oscillations (SSOs) involving grid-following converters (GFLCs) and its benchmarking with electromagnetic transient (EMT) models have so far been restricted to highly simplified grid models with constant voltage sources behind series R-L circuits. In this paper, modeling adequacy of bulk power systems with synchronous generators (SGs), transmission systems, loads, and GFLCs are considered. To this end, we revisit the notions of time-varying phasor calculus, highlighting the distinction between space-phasor-calculus (SPC) and two often interchangeably used frameworks namely baseband-abc and generalized averaging. We present the models of grids in SPC framework that include transmission line dynamics, load dynamics, and SG stator transients. Next, we propose a generic approach to study modeling adequacy in small-signal sense by (a) identifying critical modes through eigenvalue and singular value analysis followed by (b) using weighted maximum singular value error magnitudes as metrics, and (c) further cross-validation. Using a modified 4-machine IEEE benchmark model with up to 3 GFLCs we show that SPC framework can be used for analysis of SSOs. Further, we consider the quasistationary phasor calculus (QPC) framework that neglects transmission line, load, and SG stator dynamics to show its adequacy in SSO modeling and analysis. Time-domain and frequency-domain results with EMT models are also presented.</description>

      <title>Convex MPC and Thrust Allocation with Deadband for Spacecraft Rendezvous</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04197v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper delves into a rendezvous scenario involving a chaser and a target spacecraft, focusing on the application of Model Predictive Control (MPC) to design a controller capable of guiding the chaser toward the target. The operational principle of spacecraft thrusters, requiring a minimum activation time that leads to the existence of a control deadband, introduces mixed-integer constraints into the optimization, posing a considerable computational challenge due to the exponential complexity on the number of integer constraints. We address this complexity by presenting two solver algorithms that efficiently approximate the optimal solution in significantly less time than standard solvers, making them well-suited for real-time applications.</description>

      <title>Tight Remainder-Form Decomposition Functions with Applications to Constrained Reachability and Guaranteed State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.08638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a tractable family of remainder-form mixed-monotone decomposition functions that are useful for over-approximating the image set of nonlinear mappings in reachability and estimation problems. Our approach applies to a new class of nonsmooth, discontinuous nonlinear systems that we call either-sided locally Lipschitz semicontinuous (ELLS) systems, which we show to be a strict superset of locally Lipschitz continuous (LLC) systems, thus expanding the set of systems that are formally known to be mixed-monotone. In addition, we derive lower and upper bounds for the over-approximation error and show that the lower bound is achieved with our proposed approach, i.e., our approach constructs the tightest, tractable remainder-form mixed-monotone decomposition function. Moreover, we introduce a set inversion algorithm that along with the proposed decomposition functions, can be used for constrained reachability analysis and guaranteed state estimation for continuous- and discrete-time systems with bounded noise.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Operator Framework for Optimization and Learning with Sub-Weibull Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.09884v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a framework to study the convergence of stochastic optimization and learning algorithms. The framework is modeled over the different challenges that these algorithms pose, such as (i) the presence of random additive errors (e.g. due to stochastic gradients), and (ii) random coordinate updates (e.g. due to asynchrony in distributed set-ups). The paper covers both convex and strongly convex problems, and it also analyzes online scenarios, involving changes in the data and costs. The paper relies on interpreting stochastic algorithms as the iterated application of stochastic operators, thus allowing us to use the powerful tools of operator theory. In particular, we consider operators characterized by additive errors with sub-Weibull distribution (which parameterize a broad class of errors by their tail probability), and random updates. In this framework we derive convergence results in mean and in high probability, by providing bounds to the distance of the current iteration from a solution of the optimization or learning problem. The contributions are discussed in light of federated learning applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a problem of simultaneous input-output feedback linearization and decoupling (non-interacting) for mechanical control systems with outputs. We show that the natural requirement of preserving mechanical structure of the system and of transformations imposes supplementary conditions when compared to the classical solution of the same problem for general control systems. These conditions can be expressed using objects on the configuration space only. We illustrate our results with several examples of mechanical control systems.</description>

      <title>Interconnection of (Q,S,R)-Dissipative Systems in Discrete Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete-time systems cannot be passive unless there is a direct feedthrough from the input to the output. For passivity-based control to be exploited nevertheless, some authors introduce virtual outputs, while others rely on continuous-time passivity and then apply discretization techniques that preserve passivity in discrete time. Here we argue that quadratic supply rates incorporate and extend the effect of virtual outputs, allowing one to exploit dissipativity properties directly in discrete time. We derive decentralized (Q,S,R)-dissipativity conditions for a set of nonlinear systems interconnected with arbitrary topology, so that the overall network is guaranteed to be stable. For linear systems, we develop dissipative control conditions that are linear in the supply rate matrices. To demonstrate the validity of our methods, we provide numerical examples in the context of islanded microgrids.</description>

      <title>Who Plays First? Optimizing the Order of Play in Stackelberg Games with Many Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the multi-agent spatial navigation problem of computing the socially optimal order of play, i.e., the sequence in which the agents commit to their decisions, and its associated equilibrium in an N-player Stackelberg trajectory game. We model this problem as a mixed-integer optimization problem over the space of all possible Stackelberg games associated with the order of play's permutations. To solve the problem, we introduce Branch and Play (B&amp;P), an efficient and exact algorithm that provably converges to a socially optimal order of play and its Stackelberg equilibrium. As a subroutine for B&amp;P, we employ and extend sequential trajectory planning, i.e., a popular multi-agent control approach, to scalably compute valid local Stackelberg equilibria for any given order of play. We demonstrate the practical utility of B&amp;P to coordinate air traffic control, swarm formation, and delivery vehicle fleets. We find that B&amp;P consistently outperforms various baselines, and computes the socially optimal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Human-AI Safety: A Descendant of Generative AI and Control Systems Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is interacting with people at an unprecedented scale, offering new avenues for immense positive impact, but also raising widespread concerns around the potential for individual and societal harm. Today, the predominant paradigm for human--AI safety focuses on fine-tuning the generative model's outputs to better agree with human-provided examples or feedback. In reality, however, the consequences of an AI model's outputs cannot be determined in isolation: they are tightly entangled with the responses and behavior of human users over time. In this paper, we distill key complementary lessons from AI safety and control systems safety, highlighting open challenges as well as key synergies between both fields. We then argue that meaningful safety assurances for advanced AI technologies require reasoning about how the feedback loop formed by AI outputs and human behavior may drive the interaction towards different outcomes. To this end, we introduce a unifying formalism to capture dynamic, safety-critical human--AI interactions and propose a concrete technical roadmap towards next-generation human-centered AI safety.</description>
