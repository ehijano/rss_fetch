      <title>Probing the geometry dependence of the Casimir-Polder interaction by matter-wave diffraction at a nano-grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic diffraction through a nanograting is a powerful tool to probe the Casimir-Polder potential. Achieving precise measurements require simulations to bridge theory and experiment. In this context, we present various approximations and methods of Casimir-Polder potentials, and we analyze their impact on matter-wave diffraction patterns. Our analysis includes the pairwise summation approach, the proximity force approximation, and multiple scattering expansion method. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the influence of Casimir-Polder interactions extends up to 25 nm before and after the nanograting slit, highlighting the importance of accounting for this effect in any accurate analysis.</description>

      <title>Generation of Motional Squeezed States for Neutral Atoms in Optical Tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical tweezers are a powerful tool for the precise positioning of a variety of small objects, including single neutral atoms. Once trapped, atoms can be cooled to the motional ground state of the tweezers. For a more advanced control of their spatial wavefunction, we report here a simple method to squeeze their motion, and the protocol to measure the squeezing factor based on momentum spreading estimation. We explore the limitations set by the technical imperfections of the tweezers, as well as the more fundamental limit set by their anharmonicity, and finally demonstrate a squeezing of 5.8 dB. The implementation of motional squeezing allows to push back the limit set by the position quantum noise and thus to explore more extreme situations requiring atoms positioned with nanometric precision.</description>

      <title>Narrow-Line Electric Quadrupole Cooling And Background-Free Imaging Of A Single Cs Atom With Spatially Structured Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate background-free imaging and sideband cooling of a single 133Cs atom via the narrow-line 6S1/2 to 5D5/2 electric quadrupole transition in a 1064 nm optical tweezer. The 5D5/2 state decays through the 6P3/2 state to the ground state, emitting an 852 nm wavelength photon that allows for background-free imaging. By encoding both spin and orbital angular momentum onto the 685 nm excitation light, we achieve background-free fluorescence histograms with 99.58(3)% fidelity by positioning the atom at the dark center of a vortex beam. Tuning the tweezer polarization ellipticity realizes a magic trap for the stretched F = 4, mF = 4 to F' = 6, mF' = 6 cycling transition. We cool to 5 uK in a 1.1 mK trap and outline a strategy for ground-state cooling. We compare cooling performance across different sideband regimes, while also exploring how the orbital angular momentum of structured light controls the selection rules for quadrupole transitions. These results expand the toolbox for high-fidelity quantum control and cooling in alkali-atom tweezer arrays.</description>

      <title>Discovery of entanglement generation by elastic collision to realise the original Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The amazing quantum effect of `entanglement' was discovered in the 1935 thought experiment by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen (`EPR'). The ensuing research opened up fundamental questions and led to experiments that proved that quantum theory cannot be completed by local hidden variables. Remarkably, EPR did not discuss how to create the entanglement in their thought experiment. Here I add this part. What is required in the original EPR thought experiment is a simple elastic particle collision, an unbalanced mass ratio of e.g. 1:3 and initial states that are position and momentum squeezed, respectively. In the limiting case of infinite squeeze factors, the measurement of the position or momentum of one particle allows an absolutely precise conclusion to be drawn about the value of the same quantity of the other particle. The EPR idea has never been tested in this way. I outline a way to do this.</description>

      <title>Strontium I, III, IV and V: Electron Impact Excitation Data for Kilonovae and White Dwarf Diagnostic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strontium (Sr) emissions have been observed across a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, from kilonovae (KNe) events to white dwarf (WD) stars. Precise and extensive atomic data for low ionisation stages of Sr is required for accurate theoretical modelling and to improve our understanding of evolutionary pathways. We calculated energy levels, Einstein A coefficients and electron-impact excitation collision strengths for Sr I, Sr III, Sr IV and Sr V at the temperature and density ranges of interest in KNe and WD research. We developed new target structures using the GRASP0 and AUTOSTRUCTURE packages. The energies and A-values arising from the new structures were found to be in good agreement with experimental and theoretical equivalents reported in the literature. Maxwellian averaged electron impact collision strengths were calculated using the R-matrix approach, as applied through the DARC and RMBP coding packages. These are presented in adf04 file format. The new data sets allowed us to construct synthetic spectra for the first five ionisation stages of Sr and probe possible density and temperature diagnostic lines. The synthetic spectra within the KNe regime revealed possible Sr IV and Sr V candidate lines at 1027.69nm and 1203.35nm respectively. These may provide useful benchmarks for determining the extent of Sr ionisation that can be reached in an evolving KNe event. Additional diagnostic lines were found to be poor across the Sr ion stages for both KNe and WD regimes due to most levels being in either coronal or Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) conditions.</description>

      <title>Collective light shifts of many cavity modes probed by an optical frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical cavities can be used to enhance the interaction of light with atoms or molecules. In a regime where cavity resonances are very far from the atomic or molecular transition frequencies, photon absorption can be neglected and the dispersive part of the interaction can induce spectacular phenomena such as squeezing, cooling, and self-organization. So far, this dispersive interaction regime has only been explored using a single or few longitudinal cavity modes at a time. We experimentally study the dispersive interaction between a cold atom cloud and many longitudinal modes of a Fabry-Perot cavity, by detecting collective light shifts in the transmission spectrum of an optical frequency comb probe. Notably, using a high quality resonator coupled to more than $10^5$ intracavity atoms, we detect appreciable shifts of $\sim 100$ cavity modes simultaneously. These results constitute a direct demonstration of dispersive coupling of matter with many longitudinal modes of a linear resonator, and pave the way towards deeper exploration of atom-light dynamics in the multifrequency domain.</description>

      <title>Magnetic deflection of high-spin sodium dimers formed on helium nanodroplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic data on alkali-atom dimers residing on the surface of liquid helium nanodroplets have revealed that they are detected primarily in the weakly bound, metastable, spin-triplet state. Here, by measuring the magnetic Stern-Gerlach deflection of a sodium-doped nanodroplet beam, we transparently demonstrate the abundance of high-magnetic-moment dimers. Their electron spins thermalize with the cryogenic superfluid droplets and become fully oriented by the external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Detecting Phase Coherence of 2D Bose Gases via Noise Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03491v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We measure the noise correlations of two-dimensional (2D) Bose gases after free expansion, and use them to characterize the in-situ phase coherence across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. The noise-correlation function features a characteristic spatial oscillatory behavior in the superfluid phase, which gives direct access to the superfluid exponent. This oscillatory behavior vanishes above the BKT critical point, as we demonstrate for both single-layer and decoupled bilayer 2D Bose gases. Our work establishes noise interferometry as an important general tool to probe and identify many-body states of quantum gases, extending its application to previously inaccessible correlation properties in multimode systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of a Bilayer Superfluid with Interlayer Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the coupling between different degrees of freedom in many-body systems is a powerful technique for engineering novel phases of matter. We create a bilayer system of two-dimensional (2D) ultracold Bose gases and demonstrate the controlled generation of bulk coherence through tunable interlayer Josephson coupling. We probe the resulting correlation properties of both phase modes of the bilayer system: the symmetric phase mode is studied via a noise-correlation method, while the antisymmetric phase fluctuations are directly captured by matter-wave interferometry. The measured correlation functions for both of these modes exhibit a crossover from short-range to quasi-long-range order above a coupling-dependent critical point, thus providing direct evidence of bilayer superfluidity mediated by interlayer coupling. We map out the phase diagram and interpret it with renormalization-group theory and Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, we elucidate the underlying mechanism through the observation of suppressed vortex excitations in the antisymmetric mode.</description>
