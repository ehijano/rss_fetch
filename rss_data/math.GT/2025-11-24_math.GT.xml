      <title>Irreducible train tracks for pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a construction of invariant train tracks with irreducible transition matrix for pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms. This fills what seems to be a gap in the literature concerning the existence of such train tracks. The construction starts with an invariant train track associated to the veering triangulation of the mapping torus of the homeomorphism and then uses the veering property to characterize branches which obstruct irreducibility, finally modifying the track to bypass these obstructions.</description>

      <title>Minimal Generation of Mapping Class Groups: A Survey of the Nonorientable Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter provides a comprehensive survey of foundational results and recent advances concerning minimal generating sets for the mapping class group of a nonorientable surface, $\mathrm{Mod}(N_{g})$, and its index-two twist subgroup, $\mathcal{T}_{g}$. Although the theory for orientable surfaces is well established, the nonorientable case presents unique challenges due to the presence of crosscaps, thus requiring generators beyond Dehn twists. We show that, for a sufficiently large genus $g$, both $\mathrm{Mod}(N_{g})$ and $\mathcal{T}_{g}$ are generated by two elements, which is the minimum possible number. The survey details various types of generating sets, including those composed of torsions, involutions, and commutators, illustrating the geometric and algebraic interplay. We unify foundational work with modern breakthroughs and extend results to punctured surfaces, $\mathrm{Mod}(N_{g,p})$, providing explicit generators, relations, and proof sketches with an emphasis on geometric intuition.</description>

      <title>Minimal Generation of Mapping Class Groups: A Survey of the Orientable Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mapping class group of an orientable surface, which records its symmetries up to isotopy, plays a central role in low-dimensional topology. This chapter explores the foundational problem of determining minimal generating sets for these groups. We chart the development of this area from classical results involving Dehn twist generators to more recent breakthroughs showing that mapping class groups can be generated by just two elements, pairs of torsion elements, or a small collection of involutions. This chapter contains a discussion of the most current results for punctured surfaces, including a new improvement showing that for an even number of punctures $p\geq 8$ the group $\mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma_{13,p})$ is generated by three involutions. Throughout, we highlight the rich interplay between the algebraic features of these generating sets and the underlying geometric structures they encode. The chapter aims to provide a comprehensive account of the pursuit of algebraic and geometric efficiency within one of topology's most intricate and influential groups.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a Python module that we developed to calculate cobordism maps induced on Khovanov homology. As applications of our program, we compute these maps for all incompressible Seifert surfaces for prime knots up to 10 crossings, and distinguish many ribbon disks arising from symmetries of the boundary knots.</description>

      <title>The Boundary Dehn Twist on a Punctured Connected Sum of Two K3 Surfaces is Nontrivial in the Smooth Mapping Class Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the boundary Dehn twist on $K3\#K3\setminus B^4$ is nontrivial in the smooth mapping class group, providing another example of an exotic diffeomorphism on a simply-connected spin four-manifold. We do so by finding an algebraic criterion that must be satisfied if the two maps are smoothly isotopic. The main tools involved are the $\Pintwo$-equivariant families Bauer-Furuta invariant, equivariant topological $K$-theory, and the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence to show this algebraic criterion cannot be satisfied, and this establishes the result. As a corollary, we find any smooth bundle $K3\#K3\into E\downarrow S^2$ has $w_2(T^vE)=0$, so $E$ is spin.</description>

      <title>Groups acting on horocyclic products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Horocyclic products are a well-studied class of metric spaces that provide models for various solvable Lie groups, Baumslag-Solitar groups, and Lamplighter groups. Let $G$ act geometrically on a horocyclic product $X \bowtie Y$ of $\CAT(-\kappa)$ spaces $X,Y$. We show that every such group is either an ascending HNN extension of a finitely-generated virtually nilpotent group, or else is not finitely presented, depending on the connectivity of the visual boundary of $X\bowtie Y$.</description>

      <title>Weinstein Handlebodies for the Painlev\'e Betti Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the generic fibre of the Betti moduli space associated to any of the ten Painlev\'e equations coincides with the result of attaching Weinstein handles along the Stokes Legendrian, and provide Weinstein handlebody diagrams for each of them in the process. We moreover extend the procedure for obtaining presentations in Gompf normal form of Weinstein manifolds obtained by attaching handles to Legendrian lifts of cooriented curves in surfaces to their unit cotangent bundle to the case where the surface may have nonempty boundary.</description>

      <title>The positive scalar curvature cobordism category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12951</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.12951v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that many spaces of positive scalar curvature metrics have the homotopy type of infinite loop spaces. Our result in particular applies to the path component of the round metric inside $\mathcal{R}^+ (S^d)$ if $d \geq 6$.
  To achieve that goal, we study the cobordism category of manifolds with positive scalar curvature. Under suitable connectivity conditions, we can identify the homotopy fibre of the forgetful map from the psc cobordism category to the ordinary cobordism category with a delooping of spaces of psc metrics. This uses a version of Quillen's Theorem B and instances of the Gromov--Lawson surgery theorem.
  We extend some of the surgery arguments by Galatius and the second named author to the psc setting to pass between different connectivity conditions. Segal's theory of $\Gamma$-spaces is then used to construct the claimed infinite loop space structures.
  The cobordism category viewpoint also illuminates the action of diffeomorphism groups on spaces of psc metrics. We show that under mild hypotheses on the manifold, the action map from the diffeomorphism group to the homotopy automorphisms of the spaces of psc metrics factors through the Madsen--Tillmann spectrum. This implies a strong rigidity theorem for the action map when the manifold has trivial rational Pontrjagin classes.
  A delooped version of the Atiyah--Singer index theorem proved by the first named author is used to moreover show that the secondary index invariant to real $K$-theory is an infinite loop map. These ideas also give a new proof of the main result of our previous work with Botvinnik.</description>

      <title>Harmonic maps to Hadamard spaces and a universal higher Teichm\"{u}ller space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a sufficient criterion, which we call stability, for a coarse Lipschitz map $f$ from a complete manifold $X$ with Ricci curvature bounded below to a proper Hadamard space $Y$ to be within bounded distance of a harmonic map. We prove uniqueness of the harmonic map under additional assumptions on $X$ and $Y$.
  Using this criterion, we prove a significant generalization of the Schoen-Li-Wang conjecture on quasi-isometric embeddings between rank 1 symmetric spaces. In particular, under a natural generalization of the quasi-isometric condition, we remove the assumption that the target has rank 1. This allows us to define a universal Hitchin component for each $\mathrm{PGL}_d(\mathbb{R})$, generalizing universal Teichm\"uller space, and show that it can be described both as a space of quasi-symmetric positive maps from $\mathbb{RP}^1$ to the flag variety, and as a space of harmonic maps.</description>
