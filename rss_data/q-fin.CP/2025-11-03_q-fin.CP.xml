      <title>Exact Terminal Condition Neural Network for American Option Pricing Based on the Black-Scholes-Merton Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes the Exact Terminal Condition Neural Network (ETCNN), a deep learning framework for accurately pricing American options by solving the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) equations. The ETCNN incorporates carefully designed functions that ensure the numerical solution not only exactly satisfies the terminal condition of the BSM equations but also matches the non-smooth and singular behavior of the option price near expiration. This method effectively addresses the challenges posed by the inequality constraints in the BSM equations and can be easily extended to high-dimensional scenarios. Additionally, input normalization is employed to maintain the homogeneity. Multiple experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy and exhibits robustness across various situations, outperforming both traditional numerical methods and other machine learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Black-Scholes Model, comparison between Analytical Solution and Numerical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of this article is to give a general overview and understanding of the first widely used option-pricing model, the Black-Scholes model. The history and context are presented, with the usefulness and implications in the economics world. A brief review of fundamental calculus concepts is introduced to derive and solve the model. The equation is then resolved using both an analytical (variable separation) and a numerical method (finite differences). Conclusions are drawn in order to understand how Black-Scholes is employed nowadays. At the end a handy appendix (A) is written with some economics notions to ease the reader's comprehension of the paper; furthermore a second appendix (B) is given with some code scripts, to allow the reader to put in practice some concepts.</description>

      <title>Unbiased simulation of Asian options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an extension of the unbiased simulation method for SDEs developed in Henry-Labordere et al. [Ann Appl Probab. 27:6 (2017) 1-37] to a class of path-dependent dynamics, pertaining for Asian options. In our setting, both the payoff and the SDE's coefficients depend on the (weighted) average of the process or, more precisely, on the integral of the solution to the SDE against a continuous function with bounded variations. In particular, this applies to the numerical resolution of the class of path-dependent PDEs whose regularity, in the sens of Dupire, is studied in Bouchard and Tan [Ann. I.H.P., to appear].</description>

      <title>An Impulse Control Approach to Market Making in a Hawkes LOB Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the optimal Market Making problem in a Limit Order Book (LOB) market simulated using a high-fidelity, mutually exciting Hawkes process. Departing from traditional Brownian-driven mid-price models, our setup captures key microstructural properties such as queue dynamics, inter-arrival clustering, and endogenous price impact. Recognizing the realistic constraint that market makers cannot update strategies at every LOB event, we formulate the control problem within an impulse control framework, where interventions occur discretely via limit, cancel, or market orders. This leads to a high-dimensional, non-local Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Quasi-Variational Inequality (HJB-QVI), whose solution is analytically intractable and computationally expensive due to the curse of dimensionality. To address this, we propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) approximation inspired by auxiliary control formulations. Using a two-network PPO-based architecture with self-imitation learning, we demonstrate strong empirical performance with limited training, achieving Sharpe ratios above 30 in a realistic simulated LOB. In addition to that, we solve the HJB-QVI using a deep learning method inspired by Sirignano and Spiliopoulos 2018 and compare the performance with the RL agent. Our findings highlight the promise of combining impulse control theory with modern deep RL to tackle optimal execution problems in jump-driven microstructural markets.</description>
