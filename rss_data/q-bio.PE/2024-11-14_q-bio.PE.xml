      <title>Segmentized quarantine policy for managing a tradeoff between containment of infectious disease and social cost of quarantine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By the end of 2021, COVID-19 had spread to over 230 countries, with over 5.4 million deaths. To contain its spread, many countries implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions, notably contact tracing and self-quarantine policies. However, these measures came with significant social costs, highlighting the need for more sustainable approaches that minimize disruptions to economic and societal activities. This research explores a segmentized quarantine policy, applying different quarantine measures for various population segments to better balance the benefits and costs of containment. Different groups, like students versus working adults, have distinct societal activity patterns, posing varied risks for disease spread. We define segmentized quarantine policy across two dimensions-contact tracing range and quarantine period-and optimize these parameters for each segment to minimize total infection cases and quarantine days. Using an Agent-Based Epidemic Simulation and an Evolutionary Algorithm to derive the Pareto front, we demonstrate that segmentized policies can be more effective than uniform policies, with specific segments benefiting from tailored measures. The findings support segmentized quarantine as a viable, efficient, and sustainable approach, offering a valuable framework for public health policy in future pandemics.</description>

      <title>An age-structured diffusive model for epidemic modelling: Lie symmetries and exact solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new age-structured diffusive model for the mathematical modelling of epidemics is suggested. The model can be considered as a generalization of two models suggested earlier for the same purposes. The Lie symmetry classification of the model is derived. It is shown that the model admits an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of invariance. Using the Lie symmetries, exact solutions, in particular those of the travelling wave types and in terms of special functions, are constructed. An example of application of the correctly-specified exact solution for calculation of total numbers of infected individuals during an epidemic is presented.</description>

      <title>Steady-State and Dynamical Behavior of a PDE Model of Multilevel Selection with Pairwise Group-Level Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary competition often occurs simultaneously at multiple levels of organization, in which traits or behaviors that are costly for an individual can provide collective benefits to groups to which the individual belongs. Building off of recent work that has used ideas from game theory to study evolutionary competition within and among groups, we study a PDE model for multilevel selection that considers group-level evolutionary dynamics through a pairwise conflict depending on the strategic composition of the competing groups. This model allows for incorporation of group-level frequency dependence, facilitating the exploration for how the form of probabilities for victory in a group-level conflict can impact the long-time support for cooperation via multilevel selection. We characterize well-posedness properties for measure-valued solutions of our PDE model and apply these properties to show that the population will converge to a delta-function at the all-defector equilibrium when between-group selection is sufficiently weak. We further provide necessary conditions for the existence of bounded steady state densities for the multilevel dynamics of Prisoners' Dilemma and Hawk-Dove scenarios, using a mix of analytical and numerical techniques to characterize the relative strength of between-group selection required to ensure the long-time survival of cooperation via multilevel selection. We also see that the average payoff at steady state appears to be limited by the average payoff of the all-cooperator group, even for games in which groups achieve maximal average payoff at intermediate levels of cooperation, generalizing behavior that has previously been observed in PDE models of multilevel selection with frequency-indepdent group-level competition.</description>

      <title>From noisy cell size control to population growth: when variability can be beneficial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell experiments revealed substantial variability in generation times, growth rates but also in birth and division sizes between genetically identical cells. Understanding how these fluctuations determine the fitness of the population, i.e. its growth rate, is necessary in any quantitative theory of evolution. Here, we develop a biologically-relevant model which accounts for the stochasticity in single-cell growth rates, birth sizes and division sizes. We derive expressions for the population growth rate and for the mean birth size in the population in terms of the single-cell fluctuations. Allowing division sizes to fluctuate reveals how the mechanism of cell size control (timer, sizer, adder) influences population growth. Surprisingly, we find that fluctuations in single-cell growth rates can be beneficial for population growth when slow-growing cells tend to divide at smaller sizes than fast-growing cells. Our framework is not limited to exponentially-growing cells like $\textit{Escherichia coli}$, and we derive similar expressions for cells with linear and bi-linear growth laws, such as $\textit{Mycobacterium tuberculosis}$ and fission yeast $\textit{Schizosaccharomyces pombe}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>SMDP: SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Distribution Profiler for rapid estimation of mutational histories of unusual lineages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 usually evolves at a relatively constant rate over time. Occasionally, however, lineages arise with higher-than-expected numbers of mutations given the date of sampling. Such lineages can arise for a variety of reasons, including selection pressures imposed by evolution during a chronic infection or exposure to mutation-inducing drugs like molnupiravir. We have developed an open-source web-based application (SMDP: SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Distribution Profiler; https://eringill.shinyapps.io/covid_mutation_distributions) that compares a list of user-submitted lineage-defining mutations or a FASTA file containing a single genome (from which lineage-defining mutations are calculated) with established mutation distributions including those observed during (1) the first nine months of the pandemic, (2) during the global transmission of Omicron, (3) during the chronic infection of immunocompromised patients, and (4) during zoonotic spillover from humans to deer. The application calculates the most likely distribution for the user's mutation list and displays log likelihoods for all distributions. In addition, the transition:transversion ratio of the user's list is calculated to determine whether there is evidence of exposure to a mutation-inducing drug such as molnupiravir and indicates whether the list contains mutations in the proofreading domain of nsp14 which could lead to a higher-than-expected mutation rate in the lineage. This tool will be useful for public health and researchers seeking to rapidly infer evolutionary histories of SARS-CoV-2 variants, which can aid risk assessment and public health responses.</description>

      <title>Circuit design in biology and machine learning. I. Random networks and dimensional reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A biological circuit is a neural or biochemical cascade, taking inputs and producing outputs. How have biological circuits learned to solve environmental challenges over the history of life? The answer certainly follows Dobzhansky's famous quote that ``nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.'' But that quote leaves out the mechanistic basis by which natural selection's trial-and-error learning happens, which is exactly what we have to understand. How does the learning process that designs biological circuits actually work? How much insight can we gain about the form and function of biological circuits by studying the processes that have made those circuits? Because life's circuits must often solve the same problems as those faced by machine learning, such as environmental tracking, homeostatic control, dimensional reduction, or classification, we can begin by considering how machine learning designs computational circuits to solve problems. We can then ask: How much insight do those computational circuits provide about the design of biological circuits? How much does biology differ from computers in the particular circuit designs that it uses to solve problems? This article steps through two classic machine learning models to set the foundation for analyzing broad questions about the design of biological circuits. One insight is the surprising power of randomly connected networks. Another is the central role of internal models of the environment embedded within biological circuits, illustrated by a model of dimensional reduction and trend prediction. Overall, many challenges in biology have machine learning analogs, suggesting hypotheses about how biology's circuits are designed.</description>

      <title>On Long-Term Species Coexistence in Five-Species Evolutionary Spatial Cyclic Games with Ablated and Non-Ablated Dominance Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I present a replication and, to some extent, a refutation of key results published by Zhong, Zhang, Li, Dai, &amp; Yang in their 2022 paper "Species coexistence in spatial cyclic game of five species" (Chaos, Solitons and Fractals, 156: 111806), where ecosystem species coexistence was explored via simulation studies of the evolutionary spatial cyclic game (ESCG) Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock (RPSLS) with certain predator-prey relationships removed from the game's "interaction structure", i.e. with specific arcs ablated in the ESCG's dominance network, and with the ESCG run for 100,000 Monte Carlo Steps (MCS) to identify its asymptotic behaviors. I replicate the results presented by Zhong et al. for interaction structures with one, two, three, and four arcs ablated from the dominance network. I then empirically demonstrate that the dynamics of the RPSLS ESCG have sufficiently long time constants that the true asymptotic outcomes can often only be identified after running the ablated ESCG for 10,000,000MCS or longer, and that the true long-term outcomes can be markedly less diverse than those reported by Zhong et al. as asymptotic. Finally I demonstrate that, when run for sufficiently many MCS, the original unablated RPSLS system exhibits essentially the same asymptotic outcomes as the ablated RPSLS systems, and in this sense the only causal effect of the ablations is to alter the time required for the system to converge to the long-term asymptotic states that the unablated system eventually settles to anyhow.</description>

      <title>Infection Pressure on Fish in Cages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the question of how to connect predictions by hydrodynamic models of how sea lice move in water to observable measures that count the number of lice on each fish in a cage in the water. This question is important for management and regulation of aquacultural practice that tries to maximise food production and minimise risk to the environment. We do this through a simple rule-based model of interaction between sea lice and caged fish. The model is simple: sea lice can attach and detach from a fish. The model has a novel feature, encoding what is known as a master equation producing a time-series of distributions of lice on fish that one might expect to find if a cage full of fish were placed at any given location. To demonstrate how this works, and to arrive at a rough estimate of the interaction rates, we fit a simplified version of the model with three free parameters to publicly available data about an experiment with sentinel cages in Loch Linnhe in Scotland. Our construction, coupled to the hydrodynamic models driven by surveillance data from industrial farms, quantifies the environmental impact as: what would the infection burden look like in a notional cage at any location and how does it change with time?</description>
