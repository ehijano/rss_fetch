      <title>A Discontinuous Galerkin Method for Simulating 3D Seismic Wave Propagation in Nonlinear Rock Models: Verification and Application to the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha Earthquake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear mechanical responses of rocks and soils to seismic waves play an important role in earthquake physics, influencing ground motion from source to site. Continuous geophysical monitoring, such as ambient noise interferometry, has revealed co-seismic wave speed reductions extending tens of kilometers from earthquake sources. However, the mechanisms governing these changes remain challenging to model, especially at regional scales. Using a nonlinear damage model constrained by laboratory experiments, we develop and apply an open-source 3D discontinuous Galerkin method to simulate regional co-seismic wave speed changes during the 2015 Mw7.8 Gorkha earthquake. We find pronounced spatial variations of co-seismic wave speed reduction, ranging from &lt;0.01% to &gt;50%, particularly close to the source and within the Kathmandu Basin. The most significant reduction occurs within the sedimentary basin and varies with basin depths, while wave speed reductions correlate with the fault slip distribution near the source. By comparing ground motions from simulations with elastic, viscoelastic, elastoplastic, and nonlinear damage rheologies, we demonstrate that the nonlinear damage model effectively captures low-frequency ground motion amplification due to strain-dependent wave speed reductions in soft sediments. We verify the accuracy of our approach through comparisons with analytical solutions and assess its scalability on high-performance computing systems. The model shows near-linear strong and weak scaling up to 2048 nodes, enabling efficient large-scale simulations. Our findings provide a physics-based framework to quantify nonlinear earthquake effects and emphasize the importance of damage-induced wave speed variations for seismic hazard assessment and ground motion predictions.</description>

      <title>From Site Response to Site-city Interaction: a Case Study in the Tokyo Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the purpose of the session relating early engineering developments in site response and soil-structure interaction, this paper focuses on the development of studies regarding site-city interaction following the striking site response observations obtained in Mexico City during the 1985 Guerrero-Michoacan event, The first part presents an overview of the investigations on multiple structure-soil-structure interaction, starting with Mexico-city like environments with dense urbanization on soft soils, which later evolved with the concept of metamaterials. Up to now, such investigations have been largely relying on numerical simulations in 2D and 3D media, coupling soft surface soil layers and simplified building models, including also some theoretical developments using various mechanical concepts. They also relied on a number of laboratory experiments on reduced-scale mock-ups with diverse vibratory sources (shaking table, acoustic devices). The latest studies coupled full-scale experiments on mechanical analogs such as forests or wind turbine farms involving sets of resonators with similar frequencies, and numerical simulation to investigate their impact on the propagation of surface (Rayleigh) waves. Almost all such studies converge in predicting lower ground motion amplitude for sites located within the ''urbanized'' area, but none of them can be considered a ''groundtruth'' proof for a real earthquake in a real city. The second part thus takes advantage of the long duration of strong motion observations in the Kanto area thanks to the KiK-net, K-NET and JMA (Shin-dokei) networks, to investigate the possible changes in site response with time. The first results obtained with the event-specific site terms derived from Generalized Inversion Techniques (Nakano et al., 2015) indicate a systematic reduction of the low frequency (0.2 -1 Hz) site amplification, in the central-south Tokyo area. As this frequency band corresponds both to the site frequency (very thick deposits) and to the high-rise buildings, the discussion focuses on the possible relation with the extensive construction in some areas of downtown Tokyo over the last 2 decades.</description>
