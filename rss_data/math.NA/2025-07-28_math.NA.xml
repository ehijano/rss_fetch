      <title>A conservative invariant-domain preserving projection technique for hyperbolic systems under adaptive mesh refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a rigorous, conservative invariant-domain preserving (IDP) projection technique for hierarchical discretizations that enforces membership in physics-implied convex sets when mapping between solution spaces. When coupled with suitable refinement indicators, the proposed scheme enables a provably IDP adaptive numerical method for hyperbolic systems where preservation of physical properties is essential. In addition to proofs of these characteristics, we supply a detailed construction of the method in the context of a high-performance finite element code. To illustrate our proposed scheme, we study a suite of computationally challenging benchmark problems, demonstrating enhanced accuracy and efficiency properties while entirely avoiding \emph{ad hoc} corrections to preserve physical invariants.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-reduced model reduction of shift-equivariant systems via operator inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider data-driven reduced-order models of partial differential equations with shift equivariance. Shift-equivariant systems typically admit traveling solutions, and the main idea of our approach is to represent the solution in a traveling reference frame, in which it can be described by a relatively small number of basis functions. Existing methods for operator inference allow one to approximate a reduced-order model directly from data, without knowledge of the full-order dynamics. Our method adds additional terms to ensure that the reduced-order model not only approximates the spatially frozen profile of the solution, but also estimates the traveling speed as a function of that profile. We validate our approach using the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, a one-dimensional partial differential equation that exhibits traveling solutions and spatiotemporal chaos. Results indicate that our method robustly captures traveling solutions, and exhibits improved numerical stability over the standard operator inference approach.</description>

      <title>Fourth-Order Compact FDMs for Steady and Time-Dependent Nonlinear Convection-Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the steady and time-dependent nonlinear convection-diffusion (advection-diffusion) equations with the Dirichlet boundary condition. For the steady nonlinear equation, we use an iteration method to reformulate the nonlinear equation into its linear counterpart, and derive a fourth-order compact 9-point finite difference method (FDM) to solve the reformulated equation on a uniform Cartesian grid. To increase the accuracy, we modify the FDM to reduce the pollution effect. The linear system of the FDM generates an M-matrix, provided the mesh size $h$ is sufficiently small. For the time dependent nonlinear equation, we discrete the temporal domain using the Crank-Nicolson (CN), BDF3, BDF4 time stepping methods, and apply a similar iterative method to rewrite the nonlinear equation as the same linear convection-diffusion equation. Then we propose the second-order to fourth-order compact 9-point FDMs with the reduced pollution effects on a uniform Cartesian grid. We prove that all FDMs satisfy the discrete maximum principle for sufficiently small $h$. Several examples with the variable and time-dependent diffusion coefficients and challenging nonlinear terms (not limited to the Burgers equation) are provided to verify the accuracy and the desired convergence rates in the $l_2$ and $l_{\infty}$ norms in space and time. We also compare our second-order CN method with the third-order BDF3 method and the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, and the numerical results demonstrate that our FDM with the coarse time step generates the small error. Especially, if the same BDF3 scheme is applied, our error is 1.6\% of that obtained from the DG method. The proposed methods can be easily extended to a 3D spatial domain and more general nonlinear convection-diffusion-reaction equations.</description>

      <title>Neural Correction Operator: A Reliable and Fast Approach for Electrical Impedance Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive medical imaging method that reconstructs electrical conductivity mediums from boundary voltage-current measurements, but its severe ill-posedness renders direct operator learning with neural networks unreliable. We propose the neural correction operator framework, which learns the inverse map as a composition of two operators: a reconstruction operator using L-BFGS optimization with limited iterations to obtain an initial estimate from measurement data and a correction operator implemented with deep learning models to reconstruct the true media from this initial guess. We explore convolutional neural network architectures and conditional diffusion models as alternative choices for the correction operator. We evaluate the neural correction operator by comparing with L-BFGS methods as well as neural operators and conditional diffusion models that directly learn the inverse map over several benchmark datasets. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly better reconstruction quality compared to both iterative methods and direct neural operator learning methods with the same architecture. The proposed framework also exhibits robustness to measurement noise while achieving substantial computational speedup compared to conventional methods. The neural correction operator provides a general paradigm for approaching neural operator learning in severely ill-posed inverse problems.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Robust Weak Galerkin Method for the Brinkman Equations on Non-Convex Polytopal Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Stabilizer-Free weak Galerkin (WG) finite element method for solving the Brinkman equations without the need for conventional stabilization techniques. The Brinkman model, which mathematically blends features of both the Stokes and Darcy equations, describes fluid flow in multi-physics environments, particularly in heterogeneous porous media characterized by spatially varying permeability. In such settings, flow behavior may be governed predominantly by Darcy dynamics in certain regions and by Stokes dynamics in others. A central difficulty in this context arises from the incompatibility of standard finite element spaces: elements stable for the Stokes equations typically perform poorly for Darcy flows, and vice versa. The primary challenge addressed in this study is the development of a unified numerical scheme that maintains stability and accuracy across both flow regimes. To this end, the proposed WG method demonstrates a robust capacity to resolve both Stokes- and Darcy-dominated flows through a unified framework. The method supports general finite element partitions consisting of convex and non-convex polytopal elements, and employs bubble functions as a critical analytical component to achieve stability and convergence. Optimal-order error estimates are rigorously derived for the WG finite element solutions. Additionally, a series of numerical experiments is conducted to validate the theoretical findings, illustrating the method's robustness, reliability, flexibility, and accuracy in solving the Brinkman equations.</description>

      <title>Double Fourier Sphere Methods with Low Rank Approximation for Block Copolymer Systems on Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18968v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce spectral methods for the Ohta-Kawasaki (OK) and Nakazawa-Ohta (NO) models on a spherical domain, examining their coarsening dynamics and equilibrium pattern formations. We employed the Double Fourier Sphere (DFS) method for spatial discretization and the second-order Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF2) scheme for time evolution, resulting in an efficient energy-stable scheme to simulate the OK and NO models on the unit sphere. Our numerical experiments reveal various self-assembled patterns, such as single-bubble assemblies in binary systems and double-bubble and mixed-bubble assemblies in ternary systems. These patterns closely resemble experimental biomembrane patterns, demonstrating the effectiveness of the OK model in real-world applications. Additionally, our study explores the relationship between repulsive strength and the number of bubbles in assemblies, confirming the two-thirds law in the OK model. This provides quantitative evidence of how self-assembled patterns depend on system parameters in copolymer systems.</description>

      <title>Weighted least squares subdivision schemes for noisy data on triangular meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents and analyses a new family of linear subdivision schemes to refine noisy data given on triangular meshes. The subdivision rules consist of locally fitting and evaluating a weighted least squares approximating first-degree polynomial. This type of rules, applicable to any type of triangular grid, including finite grids or grids containing extraordinary vertices, are geometry-dependent which may result in non-uniform schemes. For these new subdivision schemes, we are able to prove reproduction, approximation order, denoising capabilities and, for some special type of grids, convergence as well. Several numerical experiments demonstrate that their performance is similar to advanced local linear regression methods but their subdivision nature makes them suitable for use within a multiresolution context as well as to deal with noisy geometric data as shown with an example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores Barenblatt solutions of the time-fractional porous medium equation, characterized by a Caputo-type time derivative. Employing an integral equation approach, we rigorously prove the existence of these solutions and establish several fundamental properties, including upper and lower estimates, mass conservation, regularity, and monotonicity. To bridge theory and practice, we introduce a family of convergent numerical schemes specifically designed to compute the Barenblatt solutions, ensuring reliable and efficient approximations. The theoretical framework is enriched with various examples that illustrate the concepts and validate the effectiveness of the proposed numerical methods, enhancing the understanding and applicability of our results.</description>

      <title>Plug and Play Splitting Techniques for Poisson Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plug and Play (PnP) methods achieve remarkable results in the framework of image restoration problems for Gaussian data. Nonetheless, the theory available for the Gaussian case cannot be extended to the Poisson case, due to the non-Lipschitz gradient of the fidelity function, the Kullback-Leibler functional, or the absence of closed-form solution for the proximal operator of such term, leading to employ iterative solvers for the inner subproblem. In this work we extend the idea of PIDSplit+ algorithm, exploiting the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, to PnP scheme: this allows to provide a closed form solution for the deblurring step, with no need for iterative solvers. The convergence of the method is assured by employing a firmly non expansive denoiser. The proposed method, namely PnPSplit+, is tested on different Poisson image restoration problems, showing remarkable performance even in presence of high noise level and severe blurring conditions.</description>

      <title>A non-iterative domain decomposition time integrator for linear wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a non-iterative domain decomposition integrator for the linear acoustic wave equation. The core idea is to combine an implicit Crank-Nicolson step on spatial subdomains with a local prediction step at the subdomain interfaces. This enables parallelization across space while advancing sequentially in time, without requiring iterations at each time step. The method is similar to the methods from Blum, Lisky and Rannacher (1992) or Dawson and Dupont (1992), which have been designed for parabolic problems. Our approach adapts them to the case of the wave equation in a fully discrete setting, using linear finite elements with mass lumping. Compared to explicit schemes, our method permits significantly larger time steps and retains high accuracy. We prove that the resulting method achieves second-order accuracy in time and global convergence of order $\mathcal{O}(h + \tau^2)$ under a CFL-type condition, which depends on the overlap width between subdomains. We conclude with numerical experiments which confirm the theoretical</description>

Abstract: The existence of infinite families of $N \times N$ Jacobi matrices representing the Hamiltonians of quantum spin chains with and without early state exclusion (ESE) has been shown to exist for any even $N \geq 4$. However, their existence for odd $N \geq 7$ has remained an open problem. In Section 3, we consider a chain of qubits experiencing nearest-neighbor interactions with environmental effects and present infinite families of $7 \times 7$ Jacobi matrices with and without ESE.</description>

      <title>Scale-Consistent Learning for Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have emerged as a promising approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in science and engineering. Previous ML models typically cannot generalize outside the training data; for example, a trained ML model for the Navier-Stokes equations only works for a fixed Reynolds number ($Re$) on a pre-defined domain. To overcome these limitations, we propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of PDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of scales. Our formulation leverages the facts: (i) PDEs can be rescaled, or more concretely, a given domain can be re-scaled to unit size, and the parameters and the boundary conditions of the PDE can be appropriately adjusted to represent the original solution, and (ii) the solution operators on a given domain are consistent on the sub-domains. We leverage these facts to create a scale-consistency loss that encourages matching the solutions evaluated on a given domain and the solution obtained on its sub-domain from the rescaled PDE. Since neural operators can fit to multiple scales and resolutions, they are the natural choice for incorporating scale-consistency loss during training of neural PDE solvers. We experiment with scale-consistency loss and the scale-informed neural operator model on the Burgers' equation, Darcy Flow, Helmholtz equation, and Navier-Stokes equations. With scale-consistency, the model trained on $Re$ of 1000 can generalize to $Re$ ranging from 250 to 10000, and reduces the error by 34% on average of all datasets compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>A diffusion-based generative model for financial time series via geometric Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based generative framework for financial time series that incorporates geometric Brownian motion (GBM), the foundation of the Black--Scholes theory, into the forward noising process. Unlike standard score-based models that treat price trajectories as generic numerical sequences, our method injects noise proportionally to asset prices at each time step, reflecting the heteroskedasticity observed in financial time series. By accurately balancing the drift and diffusion terms, we show that the resulting log-price process reduces to a variance-exploding stochastic differential equation, aligning with the formulation in score-based generative models. The reverse-time generative process is trained via denoising score matching using a Transformer-based architecture adapted from the Conditional Score-based Diffusion Imputation (CSDI) framework. Empirical evaluations on historical stock data demonstrate that our model reproduces key stylized facts heavy-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, and the leverage effect more realistically than conventional diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Query Efficient Structured Matrix Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning a structured approximation (low-rank, sparse, banded, etc.) to an unknown matrix $A$ given access to matrix-vector product (matvec) queries of the form $x \rightarrow Ax$ and $x \rightarrow A^Tx$. This problem is of central importance to algorithms across scientific computing and machine learning, with applications to fast multiplication and inversion for structured matrices, building preconditioners for first-order optimization, and as a model for differential operator learning. Prior work focuses on obtaining query complexity upper and lower bounds for learning specific structured matrix families that commonly arise in applications.
  We initiate the study of the problem in greater generality, aiming to understand the query complexity of learning approximations from general matrix families. Our main result focuses on finding a near-optimal approximation to $A$ from any finite-sized family of matrices, $\mathcal{F}$. Standard results from matrix sketching show that $O(\log|\mathcal{F}|)$ matvec queries suffice in this setting. This bound can also be achieved, and is optimal, for vector-matrix-vector queries of the form $x,y\rightarrow x^TAy$, which have been widely studied in work on rank-$1$ matrix sensing.
  Surprisingly, we show that, in the matvec model, it is possible to obtain a nearly quadratic improvement in complexity, to $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log|\mathcal{F}|})$. Further, we prove that this bound is tight up to log-log factors.Via covering number arguments, our result extends to well-studied infinite families. As an example, we establish that a near-optimal approximation from any \emph{linear matrix family} of dimension $q$ can be learned with $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{q})$ matvec queries, improving on an $O(q)$ bound achievable via sketching techniques and vector-matrix-vector queries.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction in the Calder\'on problem on a fixed partition from finite and partial boundary data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This short note modifies a reconstruction method by the author (Comm. PDE, 45(9):1118--1133, 2020), for reconstructing piecewise constant conductivities in the Calder\'on problem (electrical impedance tomography). In the former paper, a layering assumption and the local Neumann-to-Dirichlet map was needed since the piecewise constant partitioning also was assumed unknown. Here I show how to modify the method in case the partitioning is known, for general piecewise constant conductivities and only a finite number of partial boundary measurements. Moreover, no lower/upper bounds on the unknown conductivity are needed.</description>

      <title>Superfast direct inversion of the nonuniform discrete Fourier transform via hierarchically semi-separable least squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A direct solver is introduced for solving overdetermined linear systems involving nonuniform discrete Fourier transform matrices. Such matrices can be transformed into a Cauchy-like form that has hierarchical low rank structure. The rank structure of this matrix is explained, and it is shown that the ranks of the relevant submatrices grow only logarithmically with the number of columns of the matrix. A fast rank-structured hierarchical approximation method based on this analysis is developed, along with a hierarchical least-squares solver for these and related systems. This result is a direct method for inverting nonuniform discrete transforms with a complexity that is usually nearly linear with respect to the degrees of freedom in the problem.This solver is benchmarked against various iterative and direct solvers in the setting of inverting the one-dimensional type-II (or forward) transform, for a range of condition numbers and problem sizes (up to 4 x 10^6 by 2 x 10^6). These experiments demonstrate that this method is especially useful for large problems with multiple right-hand sides.</description>

Abstract: Kernel matrices are a key quantity in kernel-based approximation, and important properties such as stability and algorithmic convergence can be analyzed with their help.
  In this work we refine a multivariate Ingham-type theorem, which is then leveraged to obtain novel and refined stability estimates on kernel matrices. For this, we focus on the case of finitely smooth kernels, such as the family of Mat\'ern or Wendland kernels, while noting that the results also extend to norm-equivalent kernels. In particular we obtain results that relate the Rayleigh quotients of kernel matrices for kernels of different smoothness to each other. Finally we comment on conclusions for the eigenvectors of these kernel matrices.</description>

      <title>Local Characteristic Decomposition of Equilibrium Variables for Hyperbolic Systems of Balance Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with high-order numerical methods for hyperbolic systems of balance laws. Such methods are typically based on high-order piecewise polynomial reconstructions (interpolations) of the computed discrete quantities. However, such reconstructions (interpolations) may be oscillatory unless the reconstruction (interpolation) procedure is applied to the local characteristic variables via the local characteristic decomposition (LCD). Another challenge in designing accurate and stable high-order schemes is related to enforcing a delicate balance between the fluxes, sources, and nonconservative product terms: a good scheme should be well-balanced (WB) in the sense that it should be capable of exactly preserving certain (physically relevant) steady states. One of the ways to ensure that the reconstruction (interpolation) preserves these steady states is to apply the reconstruction (interpolation) to the equilibrium variables, which are supposed to be constant at the steady states. To achieve this goal and to keep the reconstruction (interpolation) non-oscillatory, we introduce a new LCD of equilibrium variables. We apply the developed technique to the fifth-order Ai-WENO-Z interpolation implemented within the WB A-WENO framework recently introduced in [S. Chu, A. Kurganov, and R. Xin, Beijing J. of Pure and Appl. Math., to appear], and illustrate its performance on a variety of numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error control for a finite volume scheme for a cross-diffusion model of ion transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a reliable a posteriori error estimate for a cell-centered finite volume scheme approximating a cross-diffusion system modeling ion transport through nanopores. To this end, we derive a stability framework that is independent of the numerical scheme and introduce a suitable (conforming) reconstruction of the numerical solution. The stability framework relies on some simplifying assumptions that coincide with those made in weak uniqueness results for this system. Additionally, when electrical forces are present, we assume that the solvent concentration is uniformly bounded from below. This is the first a posteriori error estimate for a cross-diffusion system. Along the way, we derive a pointwise a posteriori error estimate for a finite volume scheme that approximates the diffusion equation. We conduct numerical experiments showing that the error estimator scales with the same order as the true error.</description>

      <title>Linearized Localized Orthogonal Decomposition for Quasilinear Nonmonotone Elliptic PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyze a multiscale method for a class of quasilinear elliptic problems of nonmonotone type with spatially multiscale coefficient. The numerical approach is inspired by the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition (LOD), so that we do not require structural assumptions such as periodicity or scale separation and only need minimal regularity assumptions on the coefficient.To construct the multiscale space, we solve linear fine-scale problems on small local subdomains, for which we consider two different linearization techniques. For both, we present a rigorous well-posedness analysis and convergence estimates in the $H^1$-semi norm. We compare and discuss theoretically and numerically the performance of our strategies for different linearization points. Numerical experiments underline the theoretical findings and illustrate the applicability of the method.</description>

      <title>AFIRE: Accurate and Fast Image Reconstruction Algorithm for Geometric-inconsistent Multispectral CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For nonlinear multispectral computed tomography (CT), accurate and fast image reconstruction is challenging when the scanning geometries under different X-ray energy spectra are inconsistent or mismatched. Motivated by this, we propose an Accurate and Fast Image REconstruction (AFIRE) algorithm to address such problems in the case of mildly full scan. From the continuous (resp. discrete) setting, we discover that the derivative operator (gradient) of the involved nonlinear mapping at some special points, for example, at zero, can be represented as a composition (block multiplication) of a diagonal operator (matrix) composed of X-ray transforms (projection matrices) and a very small-scale matrix. Based on these insights, the AFIRE algorithm is proposed by leveraging the simplified Newton method. Under proper conditions, we establish the convergence theory of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, numerical experiments are also carried out to verify that the proposed algorithm can accurately and effectively reconstruct the basis images in completely geometric-inconsistent dual-energy CT with noiseless and noisy projection data. Particularly, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Finally, the flexibility and extensibility of the proposed algorithm are also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>IMEX-RB: a self-adaptive implicit-explicit time integration scheme exploiting the reduced basis method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a self-adaptive implicit-explicit (IMEX) time integration scheme, named IMEX-RB, for the numerical integration of systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), arising from spatial discretizations of partial differential equations (PDEs) by finite difference methods. Leveraging the Reduced Basis (RB) method, at each timestep we project the high-fidelity problem onto a suitable low-dimensional subspace and integrate its dynamics implicitly. Following the IMEX paradigm, the resulting solution then serves as an educated guess within a full-order explicit step. Notably, compared to the canonical RB method, IMEX-RB neither requires a parametrization of the underlying PDE nor features an offline-online splitting, since the reduced subspace is built dynamically, exploiting the high-fidelity solution history. We present the first-order formulation of IMEX-RB, demonstrating and showcasing its convergence and stability properties. In particular, under appropriate conditions on the method's hyperparameters, IMEX-RB is unconditionally stable. The theoretical analysis is corroborated by numerical experiments performed on representative model problems in two and three dimensions. The results demonstrate that our approach can outperform conventional time integration schemes like backward Euler. Indeed, IMEX-RB yields high-fidelity accurate solutions, provided that its main hyperparameters - namely the reduced basis size and the stability tolerance - are suitably tuned. Moreover, IMEX-RB realizes computational gains over backward Euler for a range of timestep sizes above the forward Euler stability threshold.</description>
