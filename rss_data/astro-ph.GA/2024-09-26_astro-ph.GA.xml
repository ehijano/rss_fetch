      <title>Three Quenched, Faint Dwarf Galaxies in the Direction of NGC 300: New Probes of Reionization and Internal Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of three faint and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies -- Sculptor A, Sculptor B and Sculptor C -- in the direction of NGC 300 (D=2.0 Mpc), a Large Magellanic Cloud-mass galaxy. Deep ground-based imaging with Gemini/GMOS resolves all three dwarf galaxies into stars, each displaying a red giant branch indicative of an old, metal-poor stellar population. No young stars or HI gas are apparent, and the lack of a GALEX UV detection suggests that all three systems are quenched. Sculptor C (D=2.04$^{+0.10}_{-0.13}$ Mpc; $M_V$=$-$9.1$\pm$0.1 mag or $L_V$=(3.7$^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$)$\times$10$^5$ $L_{\odot}$) is consistent with being a satellite of NGC 300. Sculptor A (D=1.35$^{+0.22}_{-0.08}$ Mpc; $M_V$=$-$6.9$\pm$0.3 mag or $L_V$=(5$^{+1}_{-1}$)$\times$10$^4$ $L_{\odot}$) is likely in the foreground of NGC 300 and at the extreme edge of the Local Group, analogous to the recently discovered ultra-faint Tucana B in terms of its physical properties and environment. Sculptor B (D=2.48$^{+0.21}_{-0.24}$ Mpc; $M_V$=$-$8.1$\pm$0.3 mag or $L_V$=(1.5$^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$)$\times$10$^5$ $L_{\odot}$) is likely in the background, but future distance measurements are necessary to solidify this statement. It is also of interest due to its quiescent state and low stellar mass. Both Sculptor A and B are $\gtrsim$2-4 $r_{vir}$ from NGC 300 itself. The discovery of three dwarf galaxies in isolated or low-density environments offers an opportunity to study the varying effects of ram pressure stripping, reionization and internal feedback in influencing the star formation history of the faintest stellar systems.</description>

      <title>TRINITY VI: Connection between Galaxy Star Formation Rates and Supermassive Black Hole Accretion Rates from z=0-10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We infer supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion rates and Eddington ratios as a function of SMBH/host galaxy mass and redshift with the empirical TRINITY model of dark matter halo--galaxy--SMBH connection. The galaxy--SMBH mass and growth rate connection from TRINITY is constrained by galaxy observables from $0&lt;z&lt;13$ and SMBH observables from $0&lt;z&lt;6.5$. Key findings include: 1) the ratio between cosmic SMBH accretion rate and galaxy star formation rate stays constant at $\sim 2\times 10^{-3}$ from $z=0-4$, and decreases by 2 orders of magnitude from $z=4-10$; 2) the average SMBH Eddington ratio $\overline{\eta}$ increases towards higher redshifts, nearly reaching $\overline{\eta}=1$ at $z\sim 10$; 3) at fixed redshift for $z&lt;3$, SMBHs/galaxies with higher masses have lower $\overline{\eta}$, consistent with AGN downsizing; 4) the average ratio of specific SMBH accretion rate ($\overline{\mathrm{SBHAR}}$) to average specific star formation rate ($\overline{\mathrm{SSFR}}$) is nearly mass-independent, with a value $\overline{\mathrm{SBHAR}}/\overline{\mathrm{SSFR}}\sim 1$, which decreases slightly from $z=10$ to $z=0$; 5) similar to galaxies, SMBHs reach their peak efficiency to convert baryons into mass when host halos reach $10^{12} M_\odot$; 6) given galaxy and SMBH growth histories from TRINITY, the local descendants of $1&lt;z&lt;11$ overmassive JWST AGNs will remain outliers from the local SMBH mass--galaxy mass relation. These findings combine to give a simple explanation for massive ($10^9-10^{10}M_\odot$) quasars at $z&gt;6$: at these redshifts, dark matter halos experience $\sim$Eddington specific growth rates, driving $\sim$Eddington specific growth rates in both galaxies and SMBHs.</description>

      <title>Detecting dark objects with plasma microlensing by their gravitational wakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A moving mass makes a gravitational wake in the partially ionized interstellar medium, which acts as a lens for radio-frequency light. Consequently, plasma microlensing could complement gravitational microlensing in the search for invisible massive objects, such as stellar remnants or compact dark matter. This work explores the spatial structure of the plasma lens associated with a gravitational wake. Far away from the moving mass, the characteristic lensing signal is the steady demagnification or magnification of a radio source as the wake passes in front of it at the speed of sound. Sources can be plasma lensed at a much greater angular distance than they would be gravitationally lensed to the same degree by the same object. However, only the wakes of objects greatly exceeding stellar mass are expected to dominate over the random turbulence in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>No Evidence of a Dichotomy in the Elliptical Galaxy Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of large integral field spectroscopic surveys has found that elliptical galaxies (EGs) can be classified into two classes: the fast rotators (whose kinematics are dominated by rotation) and the slow rotators (which exhibit slow or no rotation pattern). It is often suggested that while the slow rotators typically have boxy isophotal shapes, have a high $\alpha$-to-iron abundance ratio, and are quite massive, the fast rotators often exhibit the opposite properties (that is, having disky isophotes, lower $\alpha$-to-iron ratio, and of typical masses). Whether the EGs consist of two distinct populations (i.e., a dichotomy exists), remains an unsolved issue. To examine the existence of the dichotomy, we used a sample of 1,895 EGs from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey, and measured robustly the stellar kinematics, isophotal shapes, and [Mg/Fe] ratio. We confirmed the previous finding that the bulk of the EGs are disky (65%) and fast rotators (67%), but found no evidence supporting a dichotomy, based on a principal component analysis. The different classes (boxy/disky and slow/fast rotators) of EGs occupy slightly different loci in the principal component space. This may explain the observed trends that led to the premature support of a dichotomy based on small samples of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Varstrometry for Off-nucleus and Dual sub-Kpc AGN (VODKA): Long-slit optical spectroscopic follow-up with Gemini/GMOS and HST/STIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Gemini/GMOS and HST/STIS optical spectra for 27 dual quasar candidates selected based on their variability-induced astrometric noise or double detections in Gaia (the VODKA project). From this follow-up, we spectroscopically identify 10 star superpositions and 8 dual/lensed quasars. Among the remaining targets, 2 are likely dual/lensed quasars based on additional radio imaging, while the rest are quasars with unknown companions. Notably, WISE J1649+0812 is a newly confirmed dual quasar with a projected separation of 5 kpc at $z=1.39$ and a significant velocity offset of 183$\pm$76 km/s, highlighting the utility of narrow emission lines in identifying genuine dual quasars. Without prior photometric or spectroscopic selection, we find the star contamination rate to be 37-63%, while the dual/lensed quasar fraction is $\gtrsim$ 30% in the follow-up VODKA sample. However, when combined with existing unresolved spectra and spatially-resolved two-band color cuts, the dual/lensed quasar fraction can be increased to $\gtrsim$ 67%. High signal-to-noise ratio spectra ($\gtrsim$ 20 per spectral element) with adequate spectral resolution ($R \gtrsim$ 1000) are essential for identifying faint absorption lines in foreground stars and detecting dual quasars through velocity offsets.</description>

      <title>Using $^{26}$Al to detect ongoing self-enrichment in young massive star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-enrichment is one of the leading explanations for chemical anomalies in globular clusters. In this scenario, various candidate polluter stars have been proposed to eject gas with altered chemical composition during the self-enrichment process. Most of the proposed polluters will also eject radioactive $^{26}$Al into the surroundings. Hence, any detection of $^{26}$Al in young massive star clusters (YMCs) would support the self-enrichment scenario if YMCs were indeed the progenitors of globular clusters. Observations of gamma-ray data from COMPTEL and INTEGRAL, as well as detections of $^{26}$AlF molecules by the Atacama Large Millimeter-submillimeter Array (ALMA), indicate the maturing of $^{26}$Al detection methods. Detection possibilities will be enhanced in the short- to mid-term by the upcoming launch of the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI). The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) could in principle also detect radio recombination lines of the positronium formed from the decay products of $^{26}$Al. Here, we show for a sample of YMCs in the nearby Universe, where self-enrichment could plausibly take place. For some nearby galaxies, this could enhance $^{26}$Al by an order of one magnitude. Detecting $^{26}$AlF with ALMA appears feasible for many candidate self-enrichment clusters, although significant challenges remain with other detection methods. The Large Magellanic Cloud, with its YMC R136, stands out as the most promising candidate. Detecting a 1.8~MeV radioactive decay line of $^{26}$Al here would require at least 15 months of targeted observation with COSI, assuming ongoing self-enrichment in R136.</description>

      <title>Varstrometry for Off-nucleus and Dual sub-Kpc AGN (VODKA): A Mix of Singles, Lenses, and True Duals at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual Active Galactic Nuclei (dual AGNs), a phase in some galaxy mergers during which both central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are active, are expected to be a key observable stage leading up to SMBH mergers. Constraining the population of dual AGNs in both the nearby and high-z universe has proven to be elusive until very recently. We present a multi-wavelength follow-up campaign to confirm the nature of a sample of 20 candidate dual AGNs at cosmic noon (z~2) from the VODKA sample. Through a combination of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Very Large Array (VLA) imaging, we refute the possibility of gravitational lensing in all but one target. We find evidence of dual AGNs in four systems, while seven exhibit single AGN in galaxy pairs, either through strong radio emission or ancillary emission line data. The remaining systems are either confirmed as quasar-star superpositions (six) or non-lensed pairs (two) that require further investigations to establish AGN activity. Among the systems with radio detections, we find a variety of radio spectral slopes and UV/optical colors suggesting that our sample contains a range of AGN properties, from obscured radio-quiet objects to those with powerful synchrotron-emitting jets. This study presents one of the largest dedicated multi-wavelength follow-up campaigns to date searching for dual AGNs at high redshift. We confirm several of the highest-z systems at small physical separations, thus representing some of the most evolved dual AGN systems at the epoch of peak quasar activity known to date.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Evolution of the Supermassive Black Hole Population: A Hybrid Observed Accretion and Simulated Mergers Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can grow through both accretion and mergers. It is still unclear how SMBHs evolve under these two channels from high redshifts to the SMBH population we observe in the local universe. Observations can directly constrain the accretion channel but cannot effectively constrain mergers yet, while cosmological simulations provide galaxy merger information but can hardly return accretion properties consistent with observations. In this work, we combine the observed accretion channel and the simulated merger channel, taking advantage of both observations and cosmological simulations, to depict a realistic evolution pattern of the SMBH population. With this methodology, we can derive the scaling relation between the black-hole mass ($M_\mathrm{BH}$) and host-galaxy stellar mass ($M_\star$) and the local black-hole mass function (BHMF). Our scaling relation is lower than those based on dynamically measured $M_\mathrm{BH}$, supporting the claim that dynamically measured SMBH samples may be biased. We show that the scaling relation has little redshift evolution. The BHMF steadily increases from $z=4$ to $z=1$ and remains largely unchanged from $z=1$ to $z=0$. The overall SMBH growth is generally dominated by the accretion channel, with possible exceptions at high mass ($M_\mathrm{BH}\gtrsim10^{8}~M_\odot$ or $M_\star\gtrsim10^{11}~M_\odot$) and low redshift ($z\lesssim1$). We also predict that around 25% of the total SMBH mass budget in the local universe may be locked within long-lived, wandering SMBHs, and the wandering mass fraction and wandering SMBH counts increase with $M_\star$.</description>

      <title>A Heavy Seed Black Hole Mass Function at High Redshift -- Prospects for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of new and near-future observatories probing the earliest epochs of the Universe has opened the opportunity to investigate the formation and growth of the first massive black holes (MBHs). Additionally, the use of high resolution cosmological simulations to investigate these high-redshift environments is needed to predict the dark matter halos in which these MBH seeds will form. We use the $\textit{Renaissance}$ simulations to analyse the formation and growth of so-called heavy seed black holes. Other past work has investigated the formation and growth of light (black hole) seeds with $\textit{Renaissance}$ and found that these black holes do not grow in the environments in which they reside. In this work we seed MBHs, in post-processing, and track accretion onto the MBHs as well as mergers with other MBHs at high-redshift. We show that the heavy seeds struggle to achieve high accretion rates with only the most massive black holes ($\gtrsim 10^5 \text{M}_\odot$) growing at close to the Eddington limit under optimistic conditions. Despite the lack of significant growth for these early MBHs, the signals from their merger events will be sufficiently strong (SNR $\sim 10^2$) to be probed by the next generation of gravitational wave observatories, such as $\textit{LISA}$. We predict that $\textit{LISA}$ will observe of the order of $10$ MBH merger events per year where the mergers occur at z $\gtrsim$ 10 or at least begin their early inspiral phase at z $\gtrsim$ 10.</description>

      <title>High Spectral Resolution Observations of Propynal (HCCCHO) towards TMC-1 from the GOTHAM Large Program on the Green Bank Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used new high spectral resolution observations of propynal (HCCCHO) towards TMC-1 and in the laboratory to update the spectral line catalog available for transitions of HCCCHO - specifically at frequencies lower than 30 GHz which were previously discrepant in a publicly available catalog. The observed astronomical frequencies provided high enough spectral resolution that, when combined with high-resolution (~2 kHz) measurements taken in the laboratory, a new, consistent fit to both the laboratory and astronomical data was achieved. Now with a nearly exact (&lt;1 kHz) frequency match to the J=2-1 and 3-2 transitions in the astronomical data, using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, a best fit to the total HCCCHO column density of 7.28+4.08/-1.94 x 10^12 cm^-2 was found with a surprisingly low excitation temperature of just over 3 K. This column density is around a factor of 5 times larger than reported in previous studies. Finally, this work highlights that care is needed when using publicly available spectral catalogs to characterize astronomical spectra. The availability of these catalogs is essential to the success of modern astronomical facilities and will only become more important as the next generation of facilities come online.</description>

      <title>Old massive clusters (and a nuclear star cluster?) in the tidal tails of NGC5238</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New, deep HST photometry allowed us to identify and study eight compact and bright (M_V&lt; -5.8) star clusters in the outskirts of the star-forming isolated dwarf galaxy NGC5238 (M_*= 10^8 M_sun). Five of these clusters are new discoveries, and six appear projected onto, and/or aligned with the tidal tails recently discovered around this galaxy. The clusters are partially resolved into stars and their colour magnitude diagrams reveal a well developed red giant branch, implying ages older than 1-2~Gyr. Their integrated luminosity and structural parameters are typical of classical globular clusters and one of them has M_V=-10.56 +/- 0.07, as bright as Omega Cen, the brightest globular cluster of the Milky Way. Since the properties of this cluster are in the range spanned by those of nuclear star clusters we suggest that it may be the nuclear remnant of the disrupted satellite of NGC5238 that produced the observed tidal tails.</description>

      <title>Q-band Line Survey Observations toward a Carbon-chain-rich Clump in the Serpens South Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have conducted Q-band (30 GHz $-$ 50 GHz) line survey observations toward a carbon-chain emission peak in the Serpens South cluster-forming region with the extended Q-band (eQ) receiver installed on the Nobeyama 45 m radio telescope. Approximately 180 lines have been detected including tentative detection, and these lines are attributed to 52 molecules including isotopologues. It has been found that this position is rich in carbon-chain species as much as Cyanopolyyne Peak in Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 (TMC-1 CP), suggesting chemical youth. Not only carbon-chain species, but several complex organic molecules (CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CHO, HCCCHO, CH$_3$CN, and tentatively C$_2$H$_3$CN) have also been detected, which is similar to the chemical complexity found in evolved prestellar cores. The HDCS/H$_2$CS ratio has been derived to be $11.3 \pm 0.5$ %, and this value is similar to the prestellar core L1544. The chemically young features that are similar to the less-dense starless core TMC-1 CP ($10^4$ cm$^{-3}$ $-$ $10^5$ cm$^{-3}$) and chemically evolved characters which resemble the dense prestellar core L1544 ($\sim 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$) mean that the clump including the observed position is a pre-cluster clump without any current star formation activity.</description>

      <title>GOALS-JWST: Constraining the Emergence Timescale for Massive Star Clusters in NGC 3256</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam and NIRSpec investigation into the young massive star cluster (YMC) population of NGC 3256, the most cluster-rich luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) in the Great Observatories All Sky LIRG Survey. We detect 3061 compact YMC candidates with a $S/N \geq 3$ at F150W, F200W, and F335M. Based on yggdrasil stellar population models, we identify 116/3061 sources with F150W - F200W $&gt; 0.47$ and F200W - F355M $&gt; -1.37$ colors suggesting they are young (t $\leq 5$ Myr), dusty ($A_{V} = 5 - 15$), and massive ($M_{\odot} &gt; 10^{5}$). This increases the sample of dust-enshrouded YMCs detected in this system by an order of magnitude relative to previous HST studies. With NIRSpec IFU pointings centered on the northern and southern nucleus, we extract the Pa$\alpha$ and 3.3$\mu$m PAH equivalent widths for 8 bright and isolated YMCs. Variations in both the F200W - F335M color and 3.3$\mu$m PAH emission with the Pa$\alpha$ line strength suggest a rapid dust clearing ($&lt; 3 - 4$ Myr) for the emerging YMCs in the nuclei of NGC 3256. Finally, with both the age and dust emission accurately measured we use yggdrasil to derive the color excess (E(B - V)) for all 8 YMCs. We demonstrate that YMCs with strong 3.3$\mu$m PAH emission (F200W - F335M $&gt; 0$) correspond to sources with E(B - V) $&gt; 3$, which are typically missed in UV-optical studies. This underscores the importance of deep near-infrared imaging for finding and characterizing these very young and dust-embedded sources.</description>

      <title>Optimised neural network predictions of galaxy formation histories using semi-stochastic corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology to improve neural network (NN) predictions of galaxy formation histories by incorporating semi-stochastic corrections to account for short-timescale variability. Our paper addresses limitations in existing models that capture broad trends in galaxy evolution, but fail to reproduce the bursty nature of star formation and chemical enrichment, resulting in inaccurate predictions of key observables such as stellar masses, optical spectra, and colour distributions. We introduce a simple technique to add stochastic components by utilizing the power spectra of galaxy formation histories. We justify our stochastic approach by studying the correlation between the phases of the halo mass assembly and star-formation histories in the IllustrisTNG simulation, and we find that they are correlated only on timescales longer than 6 Gyr, with a strong dependence on galaxy type. Building on NNs developed in Chittenden &amp; Tojeiro (2023), trained on hydrodynamical simulations from the IllustrisTNG project, which predict time-resolved star formation and stellar metallicity histories for central and satellite galaxies based solely on the properties and evolution of their dark matter halos and environments, this approach successfully recovers realistic variability in galaxy properties at short timescales. It significantly improves the accuracy of predicted stellar masses, metallicities, spectra, and colour distributions and provides a powerful framework for generating large, realistic mock galaxy catalogs, while also enhancing our understanding of the complex interplay between galaxy evolution and dark matter halo assembly.</description>

      <title>Supernova Remnant Candidates Discovered by the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Sensitive radio continuum data could remove the difference between the number of known supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Galaxy compared to that expected, but due to confusion in the Galactic plane, faint SNRs can be challenging to distinguish from brighter HII regions and filamentary radio emission. Aims. We wish to exploit new SARAO MeerKAT 1.3 GHz Galactic Plane Survey (SMGPS) radio continuum data, which covers $251\deg \le l \le 358\deg$ and $2\deg \le l \le 61\deg$ at $|b|\le 1.5\deg$, to search for SNR candidates in the Milky Way disk. Methods. We also use MIR data from the Spitzer GLIMPSE, Spitzer MIPSGAL, and WISE surveys to help identify SNR candidates. The identified SNR candidate are sources of extended radio continuum emission that lack MIR counterparts, are not known as HII regions in the WISE Catalog of Galactic HII Regions, and are not known previously as SNRs Results. We locate 237 new Galactic SNR candidates in the SMGPS data. We also identify and confirm the expected radio morphology for 201 objects listed in the literature as being SNRs and 130 previously-identified SNR candidates. The known and candidate SNRs have similar spatial distributions and angular sizes. Conclusions. The SMGPS data allowed us to identify a large population of SNR candidates that can be confirmed as true SNRs using radio polarization measurements or by deriving radio spectral indices. If the 237 candidates are confirmed as true SNRs, it would approximately double the number of known Galactic SNRs in the survey area, alleviating much of the difference between the known and expected populations.</description>

      <title>Strong turbulence and magnetic coherent structures in the interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic turbulence is classified as weak or strong based on the relative amplitude of the magnetic field fluctuations compared to the mean field. These two classifications have different energy transport properties. This study analyzes interstellar turbulence based on this classification. Specifically, we examine the ISM of simulated galaxies to detect evidence of strong magnetic turbulence and provide statistics on the associated magnetic coherent structures (MCoSs), such as current sheets, that arise in this context. We analyzed MHD galaxy simulations with different initial magnetic field structures (ordered or random) and studied the magnetic field fluctuations ($\delta B/B_0$) and the MCoSs, defined here as regions where the current density surpasses a certain threshold. We also studied the MCoS sizes and kinematics. The magnetic field disturbances in both models follow a log-normal distribution, peaking at values close to unity, which turns into a power-law at large values ($\rm \delta B/B_0 &gt; 1$). The current densities are widely distributed, with deviations from a log-normal at the largest values. These deviating values of the current density define MCoSs. We find that, in both models, MCoSs are fractally distributed in space, with a typical volume-filling factor of about 10 percent, and tend to coincide with peaks of star formation density. Their fractal dimension is close to unity below kpc scales and between 2 and 3 on larger scales. Our work challenges the prevailing paradigm of weak magnetic turbulence in the ISM by demonstrating that strong magnetic disturbances occur even when the initial magnetic field is initially ordered due to differential rotation and supernova feedback. Our findings provide a foundation for a strong magnetic turbulence description of the galactic ISM. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Spectrophotometric reverberation mapping of Intermediate-mass black hole NGC 4395</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the origins of massive black hole seeds and their co-evolution with their host galaxy requires studying intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) and estimating their mass. However, measuring the mass of these IMBHs is challenging due to the high spatial resolution requirement. A spectrophotometric reverberation monitoring is performed for a low-luminosity Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4395 to measure the size of the broad line region (BLR) and black hole mass. The data were collected using the 1.3-m Devasthal fast optical telescope (DFOT) and 3.6-m Devasthal optical telescope (DOT) at ARIES, Nainital, over two consecutive days in March 2022. The analysis revealed strong emission lines in the spectra and light curves of merged 5100{\AA} spectroscopic continuum flux ($f_{\mathrm{5100}}$) with photometric continuum V-band and H$\alpha$, with fractional variabilities of 6.38\% and 6.31\% respectively. In comparison to several previous studies with lag estimation $&lt;$ 90 minutes, our calculated H$\alpha$ lag supersedes by $125.0^{+6.2}_{-6.1}$ minutes using ICCF and {\small JAVELIN} methods. The velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\mathrm{line}}$) of the broad line clouds is measured to be $544.7^{+22.4}_{-25.1}$ km s$^{-1}$, yielding a black hole mass of $\sim$ $2.2^{+0.2}_{-0.2}\times 10^{4}M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$ and an Eddington ratio of 0.06.</description>

      <title>ESO 137-001 -- a jellyfish galaxy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ram pressure stripping of the spiral galaxy ESO 137-001 within the highly dynamical intracluster medium (ICM) of the Norma cluster lead to spectacular extraplanar CO, optical, H$\alpha$, UV, and X-ray emission. The Halpha and X-ray tails extend up to 80 kpc from the galactic disk. Dynamical simulations of the ram pressure stripping event are presented to investigate the physics of the stripped gas and its ability to from stars, to predict HI maps, and to constrain the orbit of ESO 137-001 within the Norma cluster. Special care was taken for the stripping of the diffuse gas. In a new approach, we analytically estimate the mixing between the intracluster and interstellar media. Different temporal ram pressure profiles and the ICM-ISM mixing rate were tested. Three preferred models show most of the observed multi-wavelength characteristic of ESO 137-001. Our highest-ranked model best reproduces the CO emission distribution, velocity for distances &lt;~ 20 kpc from the galactic disk, and the available NUV observations. The second and third preferred models reproduce best the available X-ray and Halpha observations of the gas tail including the Halpha velocity field. The angle between the direction of the galaxy's motion and the galactic disk is between 60 and 75 degrees. Ram pressure stripping thus occurs more face-on. The existence of a two-tail structures is a common feature in our models. It is due to the combined action of ram pressure and rotation together with the projection of the galaxy on the sky. Our modelling of the Halpha emission caused by ionization through thermal conduction is consistent with observations. HI emission distributions for the different models are predicted. Based on the 3D velocity vector derived from our dynamical model we derive a galaxy orbit, which is close to unbound.</description>

      <title>Open cluster BSS dynamical clock dependence on the Milly Way gravitational field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since recent years, mass segregation driven by two-body relaxation in star clusters has been proposed to be measured by the so-called dynamical clock, $A^+$, a measure of the area enclosed between the cumulative radial distribution of blue straggler stars and that of a reference population. Since star clusters spend their lifetime immersed in the gravitational potential of their host galaxy, they are also subject to the effects of galactic tides. In this work, I show that the $A^+$ index of a star cluster depends on both, its internal dynamics as it were in isolation and on the effects of galactic tides. Particularly, I focused on the largest sample of open clusters harboring blue straggler stars with robust cluster membership. I found that these open clusters exhibit an overall dispersion of the $A^+$ index in diagnostic diagrams where Milky Way globular clusters show a clear linear trend. However, as also experienced by globular clusters, $A^+$ values of open clusters show some dependence on their galactocentric distances, in the sense that clusters located closer or farther that $\sim$ 11 kpc from the Galactic center have larger and smaller $A^+$ values, respectively. This different response to two-body relaxation and galactic tides in globular and open clusters, which happen concurrently, can be due to their different masses. More massive clusters can somehow protect their innermost regions from galactic tides more effectively.</description>

      <title>The diverse star formation histories of early massive, quenched galaxies in modern galaxy formation simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the star formation histories of massive-quenched galaxies at $z=3$ in 3 semi-analytic models (SHARK, GAEA, GALFORM) and 3 cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (EAGLE, Illustris-TNG, Simba). We study the predicted number density and stellar mass function of massive-quenched galaxies, their formation and quenching timescales and star-formation properties of their progenitors. Predictions are disparate in all these diagnostics, for instance: (i) some simulations reproduce the observed number density of very massive-quenched galaxies ($&gt;10^{11}\rm M_{\odot}$) but underpredict the high density of intermediate-mass ones, while others fit well the lower masses but underpredict the higher ones; (ii) In most simulations, except for GAEA and EAGLE, most massive-quenched galaxies had starburst periods, with the most intense ones happening at $4&lt;z&lt;5$; however, only in SHARK and Illustris-TNG we do find a large number of progenitors with star formation rates $&gt;300\rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$; (iii) quenching timescales are in the range $\approx 20-150$~Myr depending on the simulation; among other differences. These disparate predictions can be tied to the adopted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback model. For instance, the explicit black-hole (BH) mass dependence to trigger the "radio mode" in Illustris-TNG and Simba makes it difficult to produce quenched galaxies with intermediate stellar masses, also leading to higher baryon collapse efficiencies ($\approx 15-30$%); while the strong bolometric luminosity dependence of the AGN outflow rate in GAEA leads to BHs of modest mass quenching galaxies. Current observations are unable to distinguish between these different predictions due to the small sample sizes. However, these predictions are testable with current facilities and upcoming observations, allowing a "true physics experiment" to be carried out.</description>

      <title>SOFIA/upGREAT far-infrared spectroscopy of bright rimmed pillars in IC 1848</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the upGREAT instrument on SOFIA, we have imaged the [C II] 158 {\mu}m fine structure line emission in bright-rimmed pillars located at the southern edge of the IC1848 H II region, and carried out pointed observations of the [O I] 63 and 145 {\mu}m fine structure lines toward selected positions. The observations are used to characterize the morphology, velocity field, and the physical conditions in the G1 - G3 filaments. The velocity-resolved [C II] spectra show evidence of a velocity shift at the head of the brightest G1 filament, possibly caused by radiation pressure from the impinging UV photons or the rocket effect of the evaporating gas. Archival Herschel PACS and SPIRE data imply H2 column densities in the range 10^{21} - 10^{22} cm^{-2}, corresponding to maximum visual extinction AV = 10 mag, and average H2 volume density of about 4500 cm^{-3} in the filaments. The [C II] emission traces ~ 17% of the total H2 column density, as derived from dust SED fits. PDR models are unable to explain the observed line intensities of the two [O I] fine structure lines in IC1848, with the observed [O I] 145 {\mu}m line being too strong compared to the model predictions. The [O I] lines in IC1848 are overall weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is limited. However, our observations suggest that the [O I] 63/145 {\mu}m intensity ratio is a sensitive probe of the physical conditions in photon dominated regions such as IC1848. These lines are thus excellent targets for future high-altitude balloon instruments, less affected by telluric absorption.</description>

      <title>The effect of image quality on galaxy merger identification with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies have shown that the morphologies of galaxies are substantially transformed following coalescence after a merger, but post-mergers are notoriously difficult to identify, especially in imaging that is shallow or low-resolution. We train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify simulated post-merger galaxies in a range of image qualities, modelled after five real surveys: the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), the Canada-France Imaging Survey (CFIS), the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP), and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Holding constant all variables other than imaging quality, we present the performance of the CNNs on reserved test set data for each image quality. The success of CNNs on a given dataset is found to be sensitive to both imaging depth and resolution. We find that post-merger recovery generally increases with depth, but that limiting 5 sigma point-source depths in excess of ~25 mag, similar to what is achieved in CFIS, are only marginally beneficial. Finally, we present the results of a cross-survey inference experiment, and find that CNNs trained on a given image quality can sometimes be applied to different imaging data to good effect. The work presented here therefore represents a useful reference for the application of CNNs for merger searches in both current and future imaging surveys.</description>

      <title>Humps on the profiles of the radial-velocity distribution and the age of the Galactic bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the model of the Galaxy with a bar which reproduces well the distributions of the observed radial, VR, and azimuthal, VT, velocities derived from the Gaia DR3 data along the Galactocentric distance R. The model profiles of the distributions of the velocity VR demonstrate a periodic increase and the formation of a hump (elevation) in the distance range of 6--7 kpc. The average amplitude and period of variations in the velocity VR are A=1.76 +/- 0.15 km s-1 and P=2.1 +/- 0.1 Gyr. We calculated angles theta_01, theta_02 and theta_03 which determine orientations of orbits relative to the major axis of the bar at the time intervals: 0--1, 1--2 and 2--3 Gyr from the start of simulation. Stars whose orbits change orientations as follows: 0 &lt;theta_01&lt; 45 degrees, -45 &lt;theta_02&lt; 0 degrees and 0 &lt;theta_03&lt; 45 degrees, make a significant contribution to the hump formation. The fraction of orbits trapped into libration among orbits lying both inside and outside the Outer Lindblad Resonance (OLR) is 28%. The median period P of long-term variations in the angular momentum and total energy of stars increases as Jacobi energy approaches the values typical for the OLR but then sharply drops. The distribution of model stars over the period P has two maxima located at P=0.6 and 1.9 Gyr. Stars with orbits lying both inside and outside the corotation radius (CR) concentrate to the first maximum. The distribution of stars whose orbits lie both inside and outside the OLR depends on their orientation. The fact that the observed profile of the VR-velocity distribution derived from the Gaia DR3 data does not show a hump suggests that the age of the Galactic bar, counted from the moment of reaching its full power, must lie near one of two values: 2.0 +/- 0.3 or 4.0 +/- 0.5 Gyr.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Radial Acceleration Relation of Dwarf Galaxies with Emergent Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine whether the radial acceleration relation (RAR) of dwarf galaxies can be explained by Verlinde's emergent gravity. This is the extension of arXiv:2206.11685v3, which examines the RAR of typical spiral galaxies, to less massive systems. To do this, we compile the line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles of 30 dwarf galaxies in the Local Group from the literature. We then calculate the expected gravitational acceleration from the stellar component in the framework of the emergent gravity, and compare it with that from observations. The calculated acceleration with the emergent gravity under the assumption of a quasi-de Sitter universe agrees with the observed one within the uncertainty. Our results suggest that the emergent gravity can explain the kinematics of galaxies without introducing dark matter, even for less massive galaxies where dark matter is expected to dominate. This sharply contrasts with MOND, where a new interpolating function has to be introduced for dwarf galaxies to explain their kinematics without dark matter.</description>

      <title>S-Process Nucleosynthesis in Chemically Peculiar Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Around half of the heavy elements in the universe are formed through the slow neutron capture (s-) process, which takes place in thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with masses $1-6\;M_{\odot}$. The nucleosynthetic imprint of the s-process can be studied by observing the material on the surface of binary barium, carbon, CH, and CEMP stars. We study the s-process by observing the luminous components of binary systems polluted by a previous AGB companion. Our radial velocity (RV) monitoring program establishes a collection of binary stars exhibiting enrichment in s-process material for the study of elemental abundances, production of s-process material, and binary mass transfer. From high resolution optical spectra, we measure RVs for 350 stars and derive stellar parameters for 150 stars using ATHOS. For a sub-sample of 24 stars we refine our atmospheric parameters using the Xiru program. We use the MOOG code to compute 1D-LTE abundances of C, Mg, s-process elements Sr, Y, Zr, Mo, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Pb, and Eu to investigate neutron capture events and stellar chemical composition. We estimate dynamical masses by optimising orbits with MCMC techniques in the ELC program, and we compare our results with low-mass AGB models in the FRUITY database. We find enhancements in s-process material in spectroscopic binaries, a signature of AGB mass transfer. We add Mo to the abundance patterns, and for 12 stars we add Pb detections or upper limits. Computed abundances are in general agreement with the literature. Comparing our abundances to the FRUITY yields, we find correlations in s-process enrichment and AGB mass, and agreements in theoretical and dynamically modelled masses. From our high-resolution observations we expand heavy element abundance patterns and highlight binarity in our chemically interesting systems. We investigate evolutionary stages for a small sub-set of our stars.</description>

      <title>Relative distances and peculiar velicities of 140 groups and clusters of galaxies at low redshifts: the Hubble diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To determine the relative distances and peculiar velocities of 140 groups and clusters of galaxies at low redshifts ($z$ &lt; 0.12), we used the fundamental plane (FP) of early-type galaxies (from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data). We constructed the Hubble diagram for the relative distances of galaxy groups/clusters versus their radial velocities in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) reference frame in the flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model ($\Omega_m=0.3$, $H_0=70$~km~s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$). We have found that the standard logarithmic deviation for groups and clusters of galaxies on the Hubble diagram (minus peculiar velocities) is $\pm0.0173$ ($N$ = 140), which corresponds to a deviation of $70\pm2.8$~km~s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the Hubble constant. For a sample of galaxy systems ($N$ = 63), the X-ray luminosity of which is in an interval of (0.151--4)~$\times 10^{44}$~erg/s, this quantity turned out to be $70\pm2.1$~km~s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The root-mean-square deviations of peculiar velocities with quadratic accounting for errors are $&lt;V_{pec}^2&gt;^{1/2}$ = $714\pm7$~km/s and $600\pm7$~km/s, respectively. For five large superclusters of galaxies from the SDSS region, the average peculiar velocity relaive to the CMB reference frame is $+240\pm250$~km/s. We detected no outflow of galaxy systems from the void (Giant Void, $\alpha \approx 13^h, \delta \approx 40^\circ, z \approx 0.107$) formed by groups and clusters of galaxies.</description>

      <title>The fast rise of the unusual Type IIL/IIb SN 2018ivc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic dataset of the Type II supernova (SN) 2018ivc in the nearby (10 Mpc) galaxy Messier 77. Thanks to the high cadence of the CHASE survey, we observed the SN rising very rapidly by nearly three magnitudes in five hours (or 18 mag d$^{-1}$). The $r$-band light curve presents four distinct phases: the maximum light is reached in just one day, then a first, rapid linear decline precedes a short-duration plateau. Finally, a long, slower linear decline lasted for one year. Following a radio rebrightening, we detected SN 2018ivc four years after the explosion. The early spectra show a blue, nearly featureless continuum, but the spectra evolve rapidly: after about 10 days a prominent H$\alpha$ line starts to emerge, with a peculiar profile, but the spectra are heavily contaminated by emission lines from the host galaxy. He I lines, namely $\lambda\lambda$5876,7065, are also strong. On top of the former, a strong absorption from the Na I doublet is visible, indicative of a non-negligible internal reddening. From its equivalent width, we derive a lower limit on the host reddening of $A_V\simeq1.5$ mag, while from the Balmer decrement and a match of the $B-V$ colour curve of SN 2018ivc to that of the comparison objects, a host reddening of $A_V\simeq3.0$ mag is obtained. The spectra are similar to those of SNe II, but with strong He lines. Given the peculiar light curve and spectral features, we suggest SN 2018ivc could be a transitional object between the Type IIL and Type IIb SNe classes. In addition, we found signs of interaction with circumstellar medium in the light curve, making SN 2018ivc also an interacting event. Finally, we modelled the early multi-band light curves and photospheric velocity of SN 2018ivc to estimate the explosion and CSM physical parameters.</description>

      <title>Further evidence of Quasiperiodic Eruptions in a tidal disruption event AT2019vcb by SRG/eROSITA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a short, large amplitude X-ray flare from AT2019vcb (aka Tormund), a tidal disruption event at $z=0.088$. The discovery is based on the data from the SRG/eROSITA X-ray telescope which happened to observe the source seven months after the onset of the optical TDE. eROSITA observation occurred 13 days after a soft flare was detected in the XMM-Newton data by Quintin et al. 2023. Both events bear similar characteristics in terms of timing and spectral properties. eROSITA spectrum is described as an accretion disk with a characteristic temperature of $\sim180$ eV and luminosity $\sim8\times10^{43}$ erg/s. The eROSITA flare lasted less than 12 hours and had an amplitude $\ge70$ with respect to the quiescent level, no flares were detected in later eROSITA observations (6-18 months later). The XMM-Newton and eROSITA flares provide strong evidence that the TDE AT2019vcb is a bona fide QPE source. Our work further strengthens the direct connection between TDEs and QPE following similar recent results in a TDE AT2019qiz by Nicholl et al. 2024.</description>

      <title>A gas rich cosmic web revealed by partitioning the missing baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximately half of the Universe's dark matter resides in collapsed halos; significantly less than half of the baryonic matter (protons and neutrons) remains confined to halos. A small fraction of baryons are in stars and the interstellar medium within galaxies. The lion's share are diffuse (less than $10^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$) and ionized (neutral fraction less than $10^{-4}$), located in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and in the halos of galaxy clusters, groups, and galaxies. The quantity and spatial distribution of this diffuse ionized gas is notoriously difficult to measure, but has wide implications for galaxy formation, astrophysical feedback, and precision cosmology. Recently, the dispersion of extragalactic Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) has been used to measure the total content of cosmic baryons. However, past efforts had modest samples and methods that cannot discriminate between IGM and halo gas, which is critical for studying feedback and for observational cosmology. Here, we present a large cosmological sample of FRB sources localized to their host galaxies. We have robustly partitioned the missing baryons into the IGM, galaxy clusters, and galaxies, providing a late-Universe measurement of the total baryon density of $\Omega_b h_{70}$=0.049$\pm$0.003. Our results indicate efficient feedback processes that can expel gas from galaxy halos and into the intergalactic medium, agreeing with the enriched cosmic web scenario seen in cosmological simulations. The large diffuse baryon fraction that we have measured disfavours bottom-heavy stellar initial mass functions, which predict a large total stellar density, $\Omega_*$.</description>

      <title>Preferential Occurrence of Fast Radio Bursts in Massive Star-Forming Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration events detected from beyond the Milky Way. FRB emission characteristics favor highly magnetized neutron stars, or magnetars, as the sources, as evidenced by FRB-like bursts from a galactic magnetar, and the star-forming nature of FRB host galaxies. However, the processes that produce FRB sources remain unknown. Although galactic magnetars are often linked to core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), it's uncertain what determines which supernovae result in magnetars. The galactic environments of FRB sources can be harnessed to probe their progenitors. Here, we present the stellar population properties of 30 FRB host galaxies discovered by the Deep Synoptic Array. Our analysis shows a significant deficit of low-mass FRB hosts compared to the occurrence of star-formation in the universe, implying that FRBs are a biased tracer of star-formation, preferentially selecting massive star-forming galaxies. This bias may be driven by galaxy metallicity, which is positively correlated with stellar mass. Metal-rich environments may favor the formation of magnetar progenitors through stellar mergers, as higher metallicity stars are less compact and more likely to fill their Roche lobes, leading to unstable mass transfer. Although massive stars do not have convective interiors to generate strong magnetic fields by dynamo, merger remnants are thought to have the requisite internal magnetic-field strengths to result in magnetars. The preferential occurrence of FRBs in massive star-forming galaxies suggests that CCSN of merger remnants preferentially forms magnetars.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the shape: a multi-wavelength analysis of the galaxy clusters Abell 76 and Abell 1307</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the dynamical state of the galaxy clusters Abell 76 and Abell 1307 from the optical point of view, presenting a coherent scenario that responds to the X-ray emissions observed in these structures. Our study is based on 231 and 164 spectroscopic redshifts, for the clusters A76 and A1307, respectively. We find that A76 and A1307 are two galaxy clusters at $z=0.0390$ and 0.0815, respectively, with velocity dispersions of $650 \pm 56$ km s$^{-1}$ and $863 \pm 85$ km s$^{-1}$, and showing velocity distributions following, in practice, Gaussian profiles. From our dynamical analysis, X-ray studies and SZ-Planck emission, we obtain a mean total mass M$_{500} = 1.7 \pm 0.6 \cdot 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$ and $3.5 \pm 1.3 \cdot 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$ for A76 and A1307, respectively. We find that the spatial distribution of likely cluster members in the case of A76 is very anisotropic, while A1307 shows a compact distribution of galaxies, but double peaked and elongated in the south-north direction. we compare the XMM-Newton surface brightness maps with galaxy distributions and see that both distributions are correlated. We reconstruct the total mass profile and velocity anisotropy of both clusters by analysing the full projected phase space, through the MG-MAMPOSSt code. Our study reveals a slight indication of radial orbits for A76, while A1307 seems to prefer more isotropic orbits in the whole cluster range. Summarizing, A76 represent a typical young cluster, in an early stage of formation, with a very low X-ray surface brightness but high temperature showing a very anisotropic galaxy distribution. A1307 is however more consolidated and massive showing in-homogeneous galaxy distribution and an asymmetric X-ray emission, which suggest a scenario characterised by recent minor mergers.</description>

      <title>Photoemission of spin-polarized electrons from aligned grains and chiral symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unique biosignature of life on Earth is the homochirality of organic compounds such as amino acids, proteins, and sugars. High-energy spin-polarized (spin-up or spin-down) electrons (SPEs) from the $\beta$ decay of radioactive nuclei were proposed as a source of symmetry breaking, leading to homochirality; however, their exact role is much debated. Here we propose magnetically aligned dust grains as a new source of SPEs due to photoemission of electrons having aligned spins by the Barnett effect. For the interstellar UV radiation field of strength $G_{\rm UV}$, we found that the SPE emission rate is $\Gamma_{\rm pe}^{\rm SPE}\sim 10^{-14}G_{\rm UV}$ electrons per second per H, the fraction of spin-polarized to total photoelectrons is $\sim 10\%$, and the SPE yield (photoelectron number per UV photon) can reach $\sim 1\%$, using the modern theory of grain alignment. SPEs emitted from aligned grains could play an important role in chiral-induced spin selectivity-driven reduction chemistry in the icy grain mantles, producing an enantiomer excess of chiral molecules formed on the grain mantle. Finally, we suggest magnetically aligned grains could directly impact the enantioselectivity through the chiral-induced spin-selective adsorption effect and exchange interaction. We estimated the disalignment of electron spins and depolarization by elastic scattering using the Mott theory and found that these effects are negligible for low-energy SPEs, so that the spins of SPEs remain well aligned during their jurney through dust grains and the gas. Our proposed mechanism might explain the chiral asymmetry of prebiotic molecules detected in numerous comets, asteroids, and meteorites.</description>

Abstract: The FAST All Sky H I survey (FASHI) will cover the entire observable sky (about 22000 square degrees) with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). With the currently released data, we perform a blind survey of 21 cm H I absorption galaxies at redshift $z &lt; 0.09$ over an area of about 10000 square degrees. We have detected 51 H I absorbers, including 21 previously known and 30 new ones. The probability of occurrence for the H I absorbers in all H I galaxies is 1/1078. The radio flux densities of the FASHI absorbers are mainly concentrated in the range of $S_{\rm 1.4GHz} = 10 \sim 100$ mJy, but also as low as 2.6 $\pm$ 0.4 mJy. We find that the H I column density and optical depth are negatively correlated across redshift. We also find that the host galaxies of the associated H I absorbers have relatively high star formation rates, and there is a negative correlation between the H I column density and the stellar mass in the host galaxy. Consequently, FAST has significantly improved the capabilities and performance for H I absorption observations and has provided a true blind survey of 21 cm H I absorption galaxies for such studies.</description>

      <title>Determining the Extents, Geometries, and Kinematics of Narrow-Line Region Outflows in Nearby Seyfert Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Outflowing gas from supermassive black holes in the centers of active galaxies has been postulated as a major contributor to galactic evolution. To explore the interaction between narrow-line region (NLR) outflows and their host galaxies, we use Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) spectra and Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) images of 15 nearby (z &lt; 0.02) active galactic nuclei (AGN) to determine the extents and geometries of their NLRs. We combine new HST WFC3 continuum and [O III] $\lambda$5007A images of 11 AGN with 4 archival AGN to match existing spectra from HST STIS. For the 6 AGN with suitable long-slit coverage of their NLRs, we use isophotal fitting of ground-based images, continuum-subtracted [O III] images, and the STIS spectra, to resolve, measure, and de-project the gas kinematics to the plane of the host galaxy disk and distinguish NLR outflows from galaxy rotation and/or kinematically disturbed gas. We find an average [O III] extent of $\sim$680pc with a correlation between gas extent and [O III] luminosity of R$_\mathrm{[O III]}$ $\propto$ L$_{\text{[O III]}}^{0.39}$. The measured extents depend strongly on the depth of the [O III] images, highlighting the importance of adopting uniform thresholds when analyzing scaling relationships. The outflows reach from 39-88% of the full NLR extents, and we find that all 6 of the AGN with STIS coverage of their entire NLRs show strong kinematic evidence for outflows, despite previous uncertainty for these AGN. This suggests that NLR outflows are ubiquitous in moderate luminosity AGN and that standard criteria for kinematic modeling are essential for identifying outflows.</description>

      <title>SMILE: Discriminating milli-lens systems in a pilot project</title>

Abstract: Dark Matter (DM) remains poorly probed on critical, sub-galactic scales, where predictions from different models diverge in terms of abundance and density profiles of halos. Gravitational lens systems on milli-arcsecond scales (milli-lenses) are expected for a population of dense DM halos, or free-floating supermassive black holes (SMBHs), that might be comprised of primordial black holes (PBHs), in the mass range of $10^6$ to $10^9 M_\odot$. In this paper, we aim to look for milli-lens systems via a systematic search in a large sample of radio-loud AGN observed with very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). We present the observational strategy to discriminate milli-lenses from contaminant objects mimicking a milli-lens morphology. In a pilot project, we have investigated VLBI images from 13,828 sources from the Astrogeo VLBI image database and reduced the number of candidates to 40 in a first step. We present here the images and analysis of sensitive follow-up observations with the EVN at 5 and 22 GHz, and streamline our analysis to reject milli-lens candidates. Using constraints such as the surface brightness ratio, conservation of spectral shape, stability of flux ratios over time, and changes in morphology, we can confidently discriminate between milli-lenses and their mimickers. Using the above constraints, we rule out 32 out of our initial 40 candidates as milli-lenses, demonstrating the power of our approach. Also, we find many new candidates for compact symmetric objects, that are thought to be short-lived, jetted radio sources. This serves as a pathfinder for the final sample used for the SMILE (Search for MIlli-LEnses) project, which will allow us to constrain DM models by comparing the results to theoretical predictions. This SMILE sample will consist of $\sim$5,000 sources based on the VLA CLASS survey, including many observations obtained for this project specifically.</description>

      <title>Discovery of 118 New Ultracool Dwarf Candidates Using Machine Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of 118 new ultracool dwarf candidates, discovered using a new machine learning tool, named \texttt{SMDET}, applied to time series images from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. We gathered photometric and astrometric data to estimate each candidate's spectral type, distance, and tangential velocity. This sample has a photometrically estimated spectral class distribution of 28 M dwarfs, 64 L dwarfs, and 18 T dwarfs. We also identify a T subdwarf candidate, two extreme T subdwarf candidates, and two candidate young ultracool dwarfs. Five objects did not have enough photometric data for any estimations to be made. To validate our estimated spectral types, spectra were collected for 2 objects, yielding confirmed spectral types of T5 (estimated T5) and T3 (estimated T4). Demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning tools as a new large-scale discovery technique.</description>
