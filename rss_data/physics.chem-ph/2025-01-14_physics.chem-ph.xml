      <title>A Physics-informed Sheaf Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normal mode analysis (NMA) provides a mathematical framework for exploring the intrinsic global dynamics of molecules through the definition of an energy function, where normal modes correspond to the eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix derived from the second derivatives of this function. The energy required to 'trigger' each normal mode is proportional to the square of its eigenvalue, with six zero-eigenvalue modes representing universal translation and rotation, common to all molecular systems. In contrast, modes associated with small non-zero eigenvalues are more easily excited by external forces and are thus closely related to molecular functions. Inspired by the anisotropic network model (ANM), this work establishes a novel connection between normal mode analysis and sheaf theory by introducing a cellular sheaf structure, termed the anisotropic sheaf, defined on undirected, simple graphs, and identifying the conventional Hessian matrix as the sheaf Laplacian. By interpreting the global section space of the anisotropic sheaf as the kernel of the Laplacian matrix, we demonstrate a one-to-one correspondence between the zero-eigenvalue-related normal modes and a basis for the global section space. We further analyze the dimension of this global section space, representing the space of harmonic signals, under conditions typically considered in normal mode analysis. Additionally, we propose a systematic method to streamline the Delaunay triangulation-based construction for more efficient graph generation while preserving the ideal number of normal modes with zero eigenvalues in ANM analysis.</description>

      <title>Charge-transport enhanced by the quantum entanglement in the Photosystem II reaction center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Revealing the role of quantum entanglement in charge-transport in the Photosystem II reaction center (PSII RC) is of great significance. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that the robust quantum entanglement provides regulatory benefits to the charge-transport via a quantum heat engine (QHE) model with two absorbed photon channels. The calculation results manifest that the dynamic charge-transport and the steady-state photosynthetic properties of the PSII RC were enhanced by the intensity of quantum entanglement. Insight into the role of quantum entanglement in photosynthesis could motivate new experimental strategies for biomimetic photosynthetic devices in the future.</description>

      <title>Influence of the coupled-dipoles on photosynthetic performance in a photosynthetic quantum heat engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that the multi charge-separation pathways can contribute to the photosynthetic performance. In this work, the influence of coupled-dipoles on the photosynthetic performance was investigated in a two-charge separation pathways quantum heat engine (QHE) model. And the population dynamics of the two coupled sites, j-V characteristics and power involving this photosynthetic QHE model were evaluated for the photosynthetic performance. The results illustrate that the photosynthetic performance can be greatly enhanced but quantum interference was deactivated by the coupled-dipoles between the two-charge separation pathways. However, the photosynthetic performance can also be promoted by the deactivated quantum interference owing to the coupled-dipoles. It is a novel role of the coupled-dipoles in the energy transport process of biological photosynthetic and some artificial strategies may be motivated by this photosynthetic QHE model in the future.</description>

      <title>Enhancing energy transport utilising permanent molecular dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study exciton quantum transfer along a molecular chain whilst accounting for the effects of permanent dipoles that are induced by charge displacements in the molecular orbitals. These effects are typically neglected as they do not arise in atomic quantum optics; however, they can play an important role in molecular systems. We also consider novel collective photon-assisted transport and compare it against the scaling of phonon-assisted transport in chains featuring permanent dipoles, and determine a linear scaling with the number of dipoles, akin to single-excitation superradiance. We further demonstrate how permanent dipoles, dipoles can preferentially arrange energy eigenstates to support excitation transport. Finally, we show how permanent dipoles can enhance the ability of the molecular chain to support excitation transport compared to that of systems that do not possess permanent dipoles across a range of environmental and system configurations.</description>

      <title>Monolayer-Defined Flat Colloidal PbSe Quantum Dots in Extreme Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal two-dimensional lead chalcogenide nanocrystals represent an intriguing new class of materials that push the boundaries of quantum confinement by combining a crystal thickness down to the monolayer with confinement in the lateral dimension. In particular flat PbSe quantum dots exhibit efficient telecommunication band-friendly photoluminescence (1.43 - 0.83 eV with up to 61% quantum yield) that is highly interesting for fiber-optics information processing. By using cryogenic scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we probe distinct single layer-defined PbSe quantum dot populations down to a monolayer with in-gap state free quantum dot-like density of states, in agreement with theoretical tight binding calculations. Cryogenic ensemble photoluminescence spectra reveal mono-, bi-, and trilayer contribution, confirming the structural, electronic and theoretical results. From larger timescale shifts and ratio changes in the optical spectra we infer Ostwald ripening in solution and fusing in deposited samples of thinner flat PbSe quantum dots, which can be slowed down by surface passivation with PbI2. By uncovering the interplay between thickness, lateral size and density of states, as well as the synthetic conditions and post-synthetic handling, our findings enable the target-oriented synthesis of two-dimensional PbSe quantum dots with precisely tailored optical properties at telecom wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Quantification of Nuclear Coordinate Activation on Polaritonic Potential Energy Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polaritonic states, which arise from strong coupling between light and matter, show great promise in modifying chemical reactivity. However, reproducible enhancement of chemical reactions with polaritons is challenging due to a lack of understanding on how to launch wavepackets along productive reactive coordinates while avoiding unproductive local minima in the multidimensional potential energy landscape. Here we employ resonance Raman intensity analysis to quantify mode-specific nuclear displacement values in pentacene thin films and pentacene exciton-polaritons. We find that coupling significantly changes the potential energy landscape, including both enhancement and suppression of nuclear displacements. We demonstrate that controlling cavity parameters enables selective steering of vibronic wavepackets. Our approach provides a quantitative methodology for screening polaritonic catalysts and opens new avenues for designing reproducible and effective cavity-controlled chemistry.</description>

      <title>Accuracy versus Predominance: Reassessing the validity of the quasi-steady-state approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation to the Michaelis--Menten reaction mechanism is a textbook example of biochemical model reduction, derived using singular perturbation theory. However, determining the specific biochemical conditions that dictate the validity of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation remains a challenging endeavor. Emerging research suggests that the accuracy of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation improves as the ratio of the initial enzyme concentration, $e_0$, to the Michaelis constant, $K_M$, decreases. In this work, we examine this ratio and its implications for the accuracy and validity of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation. Using standard tools from the analysis of ordinary differential equations, we show that while $e_0/K_M$ provides an indication of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation's asymptotic accuracy, the standard quasi-steady-state approximation's predominance relies on a small ratio of $e_0$ to the Van Slyke-Cullen constant, $K$. We conclude that the magnitude of $e_0/K$ offers the most accurate measure of the validity of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation.</description>

      <title>Coupled-cluster pairing models for radicals with strong correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pairing hierarchy of perfect pairing (PP), perfect quadruples (PQ) and perfect hextuples (PH) are sparsified coupled cluster models that are exact in a pairing active space for 2, 4, and 6 electron clusters, respectively. We describe and implement three extensions for radicals. First is the trivial generalization that does not correlate radical orbitals. The second model (PQr, PHr) includes terms that entangle pair indices and radical indices such that their maximum total number is 2 for PQ and 3 for PH (like their closed-shell versions). The third family of extended radical models (PPxr, PQxr, and PHxr) include cluster amplitudes that entangle up to 1, 2, and 3 pair indices with up to 1, 2, and 3 radical indices. Notably, PPxr and PQxr are exact for (3e,3o) and (5e,5o), respectively, while still having only $O(N)$ and $O(N^{2}$) amplitudes like their parent models (for $N$ paired electrons). Orbital optimization is considered for PPxr. A series of large-scale numerical tests of these models are presented for spin gaps, and ionization energies of polyenes and polyenyl radicals, ranging in size from ethene and allyl radical up to C$_{22}$H$_{24}$ in full-valence active spaces up to (122e,122o). The xR models perform best.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evidence of Quantum Drude Oscillator Behavior in Liquids Revealed with Probabilistic Iterative Boltzmann Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first experimental evidence of quantum Drude oscillator behavior in liquids is determined using probabilistic machine learning-augmented iterative Boltzmann inversion applied to noble gas radial distribution functions. Furthermore, classical force fields for noble gases are shown to be reduced to a single parameter through simple empirical relations linked to atomic dipole polarizability. These findings highlight how neutron scattering data can inspire innovative force field design and offer insight into interatomic forces to advance molecular simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first analytic-derivative-based formulation of vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) atomic axial tensors for second-order Moller-Plesset (MP2) perturbation theory. We compare our implementation to our recently reported finite-difference approach and find close agreement, thus validating the new formulation. The new approach is dramatically less computationally expensive than the numerical-derivative method with an overall computational scaling of $O(N^6)$. In addition, we report the first fully analytic VCD spectrum for (S)-methyloxirane at the MP2 level of theory.</description>

      <title>Exposing a Fatal Flaw in Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI) methods (also known as Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization, SQD) have emerged as promising near-term approaches to solving the electronic Schr\"odinger equation with quantum computers. In this work, we show that QSCI methods face fundamental limitations that severely hinder their practical applicability. Using the nitrogen molecule and the iron-sulfur cluster [2Fe-2S] as examples, we demonstrate that while QSCI can, in principle, yield high-quality CI expansions similar to classical SCI heuristics in some cases, the method struggles with inefficiencies in finding new determinants as sampling repeatedly selects already seen configurations. This inefficiency becomes especially pronounced when targeting high-accuracy results or sampling from an approximate ansatz. In cases where the sampling problem is not present, the resulting CI expansions are less compact than those generated from classical heuristics, rendering QSCI an overall more expensive method. Our findings suggest a fatal flaw in QSCI methods as the inescapable trade-off between finding sufficiently many determinants and generating compact, accurate CI expansions. This ultimately hinders utility in quantum chemistry applications as QSCI falls behind more efficient classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Competing Effects of Local Solvation Structures on Chemical Shift Changes of Liquid Electrolyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the solvation structure of electrolytes is critical for optimizing the electrochemical performance of rechargeable batteries, as it directly influences properties such as ionic conductivity, viscosity, and electrochemical stability. The highly complex structures and strong interactions in high-concentration electrolytes make accurate modeling and interpretation of their ``structure-property" relationships even more challenging with spectroscopic methods. In this study, we present a machine learning-based approach to predict dynamic $^7$Li NMR chemical shifts in LiFSI/DME electrolyte solutions. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive structural analysis to interpret the observed chemical shift behavior in our experiments, particularly the abrupt changes in $^7$Li chemical shifts at high concentrations. Using advanced modeling techniques, we quantitatively establish the relationship between molecular structure and NMR spectra, offering critical insights into solvation structure assignments. Our findings reveal the coexistence of two competing local solvation structures that shift in dominance as electrolyte concentration approaches the concentrated limit, leading to anomalous reverse of $^7$Li NMR chemical shift in our experiment. This work provides a detailed molecular-level understanding of the intricate solvation structures probed by NMR spectroscopy, leading the way for enhanced electrolyte design.</description>

      <title>Photodissociation of Cr(CO)$_4$bpy: A non-adiabatic dynamics investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbonyl complexes of $d^6$ metals with an alpha-diimine ligand exhibit both emission and ligand-selective photodissociation from MLCT states. Studying this photodissociative mechanism is challenging for experimental approaches due to an ultrafast femtosecond timescale and spectral overlap of multiple photoproducts. The photochemistry of a prototypical system Cr(CO)$_4$bpy is investigated with non-adiabatic dynamic simulations. Obtained 86 fs lifetime of the bright $S_3$ state and 13% quantum yield are in good agreement with experimental data. The present simulations suggest a ballistic mechanism of photodissociation, which is irrespective of the occupied electronic state. This is in contrast to the previously established mechanism of competitive intersystem crossing and dissociation. Selectivity of axial photodissociation is shown to be caused by the absence of an avoided crossing in the equatorial direction.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast photodissociation dynamics of dichloromethane on three-dimensional potential energy surfaces and its Coulomb explosion signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present efficient and reliable molecular dynamics simulations of the photodissociation of dichloromethane followed by Coulomb explosion. These simulations are performed by calculating trajectories on accurate potential energy surfaces of the low-lying excited states of the neutral dichloromethane molecule. The subsequent time-resolved Coulomb explosions are simulated on the triply charged ionic state, assuming Coulomb interactions between ionic fragments. Both the neutral state trajectories and the simulated Coulomb explosion observables indicate that intra-molecular photoisomerization of dichloromethane is unlikely to occur. Estimating the kinetic energy release using \textit{ab initio} ionic potential reveals a discrepancy of approximately 5-8 eV compared to our simulated values using Coulomb potential. The molecular structural changes during photodissociation are clearly mapped to the ionic-fragment coincidence signals, demonstrating the Coulomb explosion imaging technique as a powerful tool to probe the time-resolved reaction dynamics.</description>

      <title>Migration of phthalate plasticisers in heritage objects made of poly(vinyl chloride): mechanical and environmental aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To clean or not to clean? The solution to this dilemma is related to understanding the plasticiser migration which has a few practical implications for the state of museum artefacts made of plasticised poly(vinyl chloride) - PVC and objects stored in their vicinity. The consequences of this process encompass aesthetic changes due to the presence of exudates and dust deposition, an increase in air pollution and the development of mechanical stresses. Therefore, this paper discusses the plasticiser migration in PVC to provide evidence and support the development of recommendations and guidelines for conservators, collection managers and heritage scientists. Particularly, the investigation is focused on the migration of the ortho-phthalates representing the group of the most abundant plasticisers in PVC collections. The predominance of inner diffusion or surface emission (evaporation) determining the rate-limiting step of the overall migration process is considered a fundament for understanding the potential environmental and mechanical risk. According to this concept, general correlations for various ortho-phthalates are proposed depending on their molar mass with the support of molecular dynamics simulations and NMR diffusometry. The study reveals that for the majority of the PVC objects in collections, the risk of accelerated migration upon mild removal of surface plasticiser exudate is low. Thus, surface cleaning would allow for diminishing dust deposition and air pollution by phthalate-emitting objects in a museum environment. Bearing in mind simplicity and the need for fast decision-supporting solutions, the step-by-step protocol for non-destructive identification and quantification of plasticisers in objects made of or containing plasticised PVC, determination of the physical state of investigated artefacts and rate-limiting process of plasticiser migration is proposed.</description>

Abstract: The achievement of selectivity in the formation of cubic diamond is challenging due to the emergence of competing phases such as its hexagonal polymorph or clathrates possessing similar free energy. Although both polymorphs exhibit a complete photonic bandgap, the cubic diamond exhibits it at lower frequencies than the hexagonal counterpart, positioning him as a promising candidate for photonic applications.Herein, we demonstrate that the 1:1 mixture of identical patchy particles cannot selectively form the cubic diamond polymorph due to the frustrations present in the system that are manifested in the primary adsorption layer and propagate as the film grows. We provide a plausible} explanation why the binary system under confinement, resembling interactions between the complementary DNA bases cannot yield the selectivity in the formation of cubic diamond crystals which is based on the similarities to the antiferromagnetic systems. We always observe the mixture of both hexagonal and cubic diamonds, however, the formation of such stacking hybrids is observed for a wider range of patch sizes compared to the one-component system.</description>

      <title>Challenging reaction prediction models to generalize to novel chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models for anticipating the products of organic reactions have found many use cases, including validating retrosynthetic pathways and constraining synthesis-based molecular design tools. Despite compelling performance on popular benchmark tasks, strange and erroneous predictions sometimes ensue when using these models in practice. The core issue is that common benchmarks test models in an in-distribution setting, whereas many real-world uses for these models are in out-of-distribution settings and require a greater degree of extrapolation. To better understand how current reaction predictors work in out-of-distribution domains, we report a series of more challenging evaluations of a prototypical SMILES-based deep learning model. First, we illustrate how performance on randomly sampled datasets is overly optimistic compared to performance when generalizing to new patents or new authors. Second, we conduct time splits that evaluate how models perform when tested on reactions published in years after those in their training set, mimicking real-world deployment. Finally, we consider extrapolation across reaction classes to reflect what would be required for the discovery of novel reaction types. This panel of tasks can reveal the capabilities and limitations of today's reaction predictors, acting as a crucial first step in the development of tomorrow's next-generation models capable of reaction discovery.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Basis for Classifying Hyperuniform States of Two-Component Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniform states of matter exhibit unusual suppression of density fluctuations at large scales, contrasting sharply with typical disordered configurations. Various types of hyperuniformity emerge in multicomponent disordered systems, significantly enhancing their functional properties for advanced applications. This paper focuses on developing a theoretical framework for two-component hyperuniform systems. We provide a robust theoretical basis to identify novel conditions on structure factors for a variety of hyperuniform binary mixtures, classifying them into five distinct types with seven unique states. Our findings also offer valuable guidelines for designing multihyperuniform materials where each component preserves hyperuniformity, added to the overall hyperuniformity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of ultrafast phenomena is a frontier of condensed matter research, where the interplay of theory, computation, and experiment is unveiling new opportunities for understanding and engineering quantum materials. With the advent of advanced experimental techniques and computational tools, it has become possible to probe and manipulate nonequilibrium processes at unprecedented temporal and spatial resolutions, providing insights into the dynamical behavior of matter under extreme conditions. These capabilities have the potential to revolutionize fields ranging from optoelectronics and quantum information to catalysis and energy storage.
  This Roadmap captures the collective progress and vision of leading researchers, addressing challenges and opportunities across key areas of ultrafast science. Contributions in this Roadmap span the development of ab initio methods for time-resolved spectroscopy, the dynamics of driven correlated systems, the engineering of materials in optical cavities, and the adoption of FAIR principles for data sharing and analysis. Together, these efforts highlight the interdisciplinary nature of ultrafast research and its reliance on cutting-edge methodologies, including quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory, correlated electronic structure methods, nonequilibrium Green's function approaches, quantum and ab initio simulations.</description>

      <title>D3MES: Diffusion Transformer with multihead equivariant self-attention for 3D molecule generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the diverse conformational states of molecules is crucial for advancing fields such as chemistry, material science, and drug development. Despite significant progress in generative models, accurately generating complex and biologically or material-relevant molecular structures remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model for three-dimensional (3D) molecule generation that combines a classifiable diffusion model, Diffusion Transformer, with multihead equivariant self-attention. This method addresses two key challenges: correctly attaching hydrogen atoms in generated molecules through learning representations of molecules after hydrogen atoms are removed; and overcoming the limitations of existing models that cannot generate molecules across multiple classes simultaneously. The experimental results demonstrate that our model not only achieves state-of-the-art performance across several key metrics but also exhibits robustness and versatility, making it highly suitable for early-stage large-scale generation processes in molecular design, followed by validation and further screening to obtain molecules with specific properties.</description>

      <title>Theoretical characterization of NV-like defects in 4H-SiC using ADAQ with the SCAN and r2SCAN meta-GGA functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) is widely used for screening color centers in semiconductors. While the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional is efficient, it often lacks precision in describing defects. The Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) functional is more accurate but computationally expensive, making it impractical for large-scale screening. However, third-rung functionals of "Jacob's ladder" remain largely under explored in this context. This study evaluates the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) family of meta-GGA functionals as potential alternatives to PBE for characterizing NV-like color centers in 4H-SiC using the Automatic Defect Analysis and Qualification (ADAQ) framework. We examine nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, sulfur, and chlorine vacancies in 4H-SiC, focusing on applications in quantum technology. Our results show that SCAN and r2SCAN achieve greater accuracy than PBE, approaching HSE's precision at a lower computational cost. This suggests that the SCAN family offers a practical improvement for screening new color centers, with computational demands similar to PBE.</description>

Abstract: A complete Dusty-Gas Model for the H$_2$--H$_2$O mixture in the anode transport layer of the anode-supported SOFC is considered. An exact conservation law relating the total pressure and hydrogen molar fraction at any point inside the anode to their values in the anode channel is derived. Using this conservation law, approximate analytical solutions for the hydrogen molar fraction and total pressure in the anode transport layer are obtained. The solutions can be used to calculate concentration overpotential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) into chemistry offers transformative potential in the design of molecules with targeted properties. However, the focus has often been on creating highly efficient predictive models, sometimes at the expense of interpretability. In this study, we leverage explainable AI techniques to explore the rational design of boron-based Lewis acids, which play a pivotal role in organic reactions due to their electron-ccepting properties. Using Fluoride Ion Affinity as a proxy for Lewis acidity, we developed interpretable ML models based on chemically meaningful descriptors, including ab initio computed features and substituent-based parameters derived from the Hammett linear free-energy relationship. By constraining the chemical space to well-defined molecular scaffolds, we achieved highly accurate predictions (mean absolute error &lt; 6 kJ/mol), surpassing conventional black-box deep learning models in low-data regimes. Interpretability analyses of the models shed light on the origin of Lewis acidity in these compounds and identified actionable levers to modulate it through the nature and positioning of substituents on the molecular scaffold. This work bridges ML and chemist's way of thinking, demonstrating how explainable models can inspire molecular design and enhance scientific understanding of chemical reactivity.</description>

Abstract: Optical pumping of molecules provides unique opportunities for control of chemical reactions at a wide range of rotational energies. This work reports a chemical reaction with extreme rotational excitation of a reactant and its kinetic characterization. We investigate the chemical reactivity for the hydrogen abstraction reaction SiO$^+$ + H$_2$ $\rightarrow$ SiOH$^+$ + H in an ion trap. The SiO$^+$ cations are prepared in a narrow rotational state distribution, including super-rotor states with rotational quantum number $\it{(j)}$ as high as 170, using a broad-band optical pumping method. We show that the super-rotor states of SiO$^+$ substantially enhance the reaction rate, a trend reproduced by complementary theoretical studies. We reveal the mechanism for the rotational enhancement of the reactivity to be a strong coupling of the SiO$^+$ rotational mode with the reaction coordinate at the transition state on the dominant dynamical pathway.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable molecular property prediction is essential for various scientific endeavors and industrial applications, such as drug discovery. However, the data scarcity, combined with the highly non-linear causal relationships between physicochemical and biological properties and conventional molecular featurization schemes, complicates the development of robust molecular machine learning models. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a popular solution, utilizing large-scale, unannotated molecular data to learn a foundational representation of chemical space that might be advantageous for downstream tasks. Yet, existing molecular SSL methods largely overlook chemical knowledge, including molecular structure similarity, scaffold composition, and the context-dependent aspects of molecular properties when operating over the chemical space. They also struggle to learn the subtle variations in structure-activity relationship. This paper introduces a novel pre-training framework that learns robust and generalizable chemical knowledge. It leverages the structural hierarchy within the molecule, embeds them through distinct pre-training tasks across channels, and aggregates channel information in a task-specific manner during fine-tuning. Our approach demonstrates competitive performance across various molecular property benchmarks and offers strong advantages in particularly challenging yet ubiquitous scenarios like activity cliffs.</description>

Abstract: We show that capillary waves can exist at the the boundary between miscible co-flowing fluids. We unveil that the interplay between transient interfacial stresses and confinement drives the progressive transition from the well-known inertial regime, characterized by a frequency independent wavenumber, $k\sim\omega^{0}$, to a capillary wave scaling, $k\sim\omega^{2/3}$, unexpected for miscible fluids. This allows us to measure the effective interfacial tension between miscible fluids and its rapid decay on time scales never probed so far, which we rationalize with a model going beyond square-gradient theories. Our work potentially opens a new avenue to measure transient interfacial tensions at the millisecond scale in a controlled manner.</description>

      <title>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. I. Hierarchical equations of motion approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying charge transport in models with nonlocal carrier-phonon interaction is difficult because it requires finite-temperature real-time correlation functions of mixed carrier-phonon operators. Focusing on models with discrete undamped phonon modes, we show that such correlation functions can be retrieved from the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), although phonons have been integrated out. Our procedure relies on the explicit expression of HEOM auxiliaries in terms of phonon creation and annihilation operators. It reveals that the auxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced by genuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlations are subtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem. Applying the procedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOM method featuring a specific hierarchy closing, we compute the numerically exact dynamical mobility of a carrier within the one-dimensional Peierls model. The carrier mobility at moderate temperatures decreases with increasing interaction, whereas high temperatures see the opposite trend, reflecting the prevalence of the phonon-assisted current over the purely electronic band current. The pronounced finite-size effects and HEOM instabilities delimit the range of applicability of our approach to moderate interactions, moderate to high temperatures, and not too fast phonons. Importantly, this range comprises the values relevant for charge transport in crystalline organic semiconductors, and we present and discuss the corresponding numerically exact results in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05055).</description>

      <title>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. II. Numerically exact quantum dynamics in the slow-phonon regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transport of charge carriers in mechanically soft semiconductors is mainly limited by their interaction with slow intermolecular phonons. Carrier motion exhibits a crossover from superdiffusive to subdiffusive, producing a distinct low-frequency peak in the dynamical-mobility profile. These features can be understood within approaches relying on the timescale separation between carrier and phonon dynamics, such as the transient localization scenario (TLS). However, recovering them from fully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05054), we study carrier transport in the one-dimensional Peierls model near the adiabatic limit. We find that the TLS approximates HEOM dynamics very well at higher temperatures and for stronger interactions. Then, the transport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns diffusive from the subdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In contrast, the band current dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions, relevant for transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that the super-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusive motion sets in from the superdiffusive side after a couple of phonon periods. The low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibits a dip at approximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequency peak. Our findings in this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS, and support the results of the most advanced quantum-classical simulations. We expect that the qualitative differences between HEOM and TLS dynamics would diminish for a more realistic phonon density of states.</description>

Abstract: Electronic structure calculations of molecular systems are among the most promising applications for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) in quantum chemistry and drug design. However, while recent algorithmic advancements such as qubitization and Tensor Hypercontraction (THC) have significantly reduced the complexity of such calculations, they do not yet achieve computational runtimes short enough to be practical for industrially relevant use cases. In this work, we introduce several advances to electronic structure calculation for molecular systems, resulting in a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup of estimated runtimes over prior-art algorithms run on comparable quantum devices. One of these advances is a novel framework for block-invariant symmetry-shifted Tensor Hypercontraction (BLISS-THC), with which we achieve the tightest Hamiltonian factorizations reported to date. We compile our algorithm for an Active Volume (AV) architecture, a technical layout that has recently been proposed for fusion-based photonic quantum hardware. AV compilation contributes towards a lower runtime of our computation by eliminating overheads stemming from connectivity issues in the underlying surface code. We present a detailed benchmark of our approach, focusing primarily on the computationally challenging benchmark molecule P450. Leveraging a number of hardware tradeoffs in interleaving-based photonic FTQC, we estimate runtimes for the electronic structure calculation of P450 as a function of the device footprint.</description>
