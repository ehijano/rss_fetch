      <title>Aggregate Bounds on the eigenvalues of the principal submatrices of a Hermitian matrix and majorization relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend bounds, proved by R.C. Thompson in 1966, on the sum of the $j$-th largest eigenvalues of the $(n-1) \times (n-1)$ principal matrices of an $n \times n$ Hermitian matrix. Our bounds are stronger than just summing up Thompson's bounds. We achieve the extensions as a corollary of a more general result giving bounds on the zeros of the generalized derivatives of polynomials with real roots. We use the extended bounds to obtain majorization relationships between the eigenvalues of all $m \times m$ principal matrices of an $n \times n$ Hermitian matrix. These majorization relationships imply both a well-known majorization result by Schur and the well-known Szasz's inequalities.</description>

      <title>The Fourier Ratio: A Unifying Measure of Complexity for Recovery, Localization, and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalized Fourier ratio, the \(\ell^1/\ell^2\) norm ratio of coefficients in an \emph{arbitrary} orthonormal system, as a single, basis-invariant measure of \emph{effective dimension} that governs fundamental limits across signal recovery, localization, and learning. First, we prove that functions with small Fourier ratio can be stably recovered from random missing samples via \(\ell^1\) minimization, extending and clarifying compressed sensing guarantees for general bounded orthonormal systems. Second, we establish a sharp \emph{localization obstruction}: any attempt to localize recovery to subslices of a product space necessarily inflates the Fourier ratio by a factor scaling with the square root of the slice count, demonstrating that global complexity cannot be distributed locally. Finally, we show that the same parameter controls key complexity-theoretic measures: it provides explicit upper bounds on Kolmogorov rate-distortion description length and on the statistical query (SQ) dimension of the associated function class. These results unify analytic, algorithmic, and learning-theoretic constraints under a single complexity parameter, revealing the Fourier ratio as a fundamental invariant in information-theoretic signal processing.</description>

      <title>Local Antisymmetric Connectedness in Quasi-Uniform and Quasi-Modular Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directional notions in topology and analysis naturally lead to nonsymmetric structures such as quasi-metrics, quasi-uniformities, and modular spaces. In these settings, classical notions of connectedness and completion based on symmetric uniformities are often inadequate. In this paper, we study \emph{antisymmetric connectedness} and \emph{local antisymmetric connectedness} within the setting of quasi-uniform and quasi-modular pseudometric spaces. We associate to each quasi-modular pseudometric family compatible forward and backward modular topologies and quasi-uniformities, yielding a canonical bitopological structure. Using this setting, we establish characterization and stability results for local antisymmetric connectedness, including invariance under subspaces, uniformly continuous mappings, and bicompletion. We further relate these notions to Smyth completeness and Yoneda-type completions and show how precompactness combined with asymmetric completeness yields compactness in the join topology. Applications to asymmetric normed and modular spaces illustrate the theory.</description>

      <title>Circulant quantum channels and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note introduces a family of circulant quantum channels -- a subclass of the mixed-permutation channels -- and investigates its key structural and operational properties. We show that the image of the circulant quantum channel is precisely the set of circulant matrices. This characterization facilitates the analysis of arbitrary $n$-th order Bargmann invariants. Furthermore, we prove that the channel is entanglement-breaking, implying a substantially reduced resource cost for erasing quantum correlations compared to a general mixed-permutation channel. Applications of this channel are also discussed, including the derivation of tighter lower bounds for $\ell_p$-norm coherence and a characterization of its action in bipartite systems.</description>

      <title>$L^p$--$L^q$ estimates for Shimorin-type integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\nu$ be a positive measure on $[0,1]$. A Shimorin-type operator $T_\nu$ is an integral operator on the unit disk given by \[ T_\nu f(z) = \int_{\mathbb{D}} \frac{1}{1 - z\overline{\lambda}} \left( \int_0^1 \frac{d\nu(r)}{1 - r z \overline{\lambda}} \right) f(\lambda) \, dA(\lambda), \] which originates from Shimorin's work on Bergman-type kernel representations for logarithmically subharmonic weighted Bergman spaces.
  In this paper, we study $L^p$--$L^q$ estimates for $T_\nu$. Unlike classical Bergman-type operators, the critical line on the $(1/p,1/q)$-plane that separates the boundedness and unboundedness regions of $T_\nu$ is not immediately evident. Moreover, even along this line, new phenomena arise. In the present work, by introducing a quantity $c_\nu$, \begin{itemize}
  \item we first determine the critical boundary in the $(1/p,1/q)$-plane for bounded $T_\nu$;
  \item furthermore, on this critical line, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for $T_\nu$ which have standard Bergman-type $L^p$--$L^q$ estimates, meaning that it is bounded in the interior of the region and admits weak-type and BMO-type estimates at endpoints. \end{itemize}</description>

      <title>On the transportation cost norm on finite metric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a finite metric graph $X=(V,E,\ell)$, where $V$ is endowed with the shortest path metric, we consider the transportation cost problem associated with the distance $d$ on $V$. Namely, for $f$ a function with total sum 0 on $V$, write $f=\sum_{a,b\in V}P(a,b)(\delta_a-\delta_b)$ where the transportation plan $P$ satisfies $P(a,b)\geq 0$ for $(a,b)\in V\times V$. The cost of $P$ is $W(P):=\sum_{a,b\in V}P(a,b)d(a,b)$ and the transportation norm of $f$ is $\|f\|_{TC}=\min_P W(P)$ where $P$ runs over all transportation plans for $f$.
  In this semi-survey paper, we give short proofs for the following statements:
  1)There always exists an optimal transportation plan supported in $V_+\times V_-$ where $V_+=\{x\in V: f(x)&gt;0\}$ and $V_-=\{x\in V: f(x)&lt;0\}$. If $X$ is a metric tree, we may moreover assume that this plan involves at most $|Supp(f)|-1$ transports.
  2) There always exists an optimal transportation plan supported in the set of edges of $X$.
  3) Better, there always exists an optimal transportation plan supported in some spanning tree of $X$.
  We use this to reprove known formulae for the transportation norm when $X$ is either a tree or a cycle.</description>

      <title>Resolvent Compositions for Positive Linear Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resolvent compositions were recently introduced as monotonicity-preserving operations that combine a set-valued monotone operator and a bounded linear operator. They generalize in particular the notion of a resolvent average. We analyze the resolvent compositions when the monotone operator is a positive linear operator. We establish several new properties, including L\"owner partial order relations, concavity, and asymptotic behavior. In addition, we show that the resolvent composition operations are nonexpansive with respect to the Thompson metric. We also introduce a new form of geometric interpolation and explore its connections to resolvent compositions. Finally, we study two nonlinear equations based on resolvent compositions.</description>

      <title>Sard properties for polynomial maps in infinite dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02296v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sard's theorem asserts that the set of critical values of a smooth map from one Euclidean space to another one has measure zero. A version of this result for infinite-dimensional Banach manifolds was proven by Smale for maps with Fredholm differential. It is well-known, however, that when the domain is infinite dimensional and the range is finite dimensional, the result is not true -- even under the assumption that the map is ``polynomial'' -- and a general theory is still lacking. Addressing this issue, in this paper, we provide sharp quantitative criteria for the validity of Sard's theorem in this setting. Our motivation comes from sub-Riemannian geometry and, as an application of our results, we prove the sub-Riemannian Sard conjecture for the restriction of the Endpoint map of Carnot groups to the set of piece-wise real-analytic controls with large enough radius of convergence, and the strong Sard conjecture for the restriction to the set of piece-wise entire controls.</description>

      <title>The H\"{o}rmander--Bernhardsson extremal function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the function $\varphi$ of minimal $L^1$ norm among all functions $f$ of exponential type at most $\pi$ for which $f(0)=1$. This function, studied by H\"{o}rmander and Bernhardsson in 1993, has only real zeros $\pm \tau_n$, $n=1,2, \ldots$. Starting from the fact that $n+\frac12-\tau_n$ is an $\ell^2$ sequence, established in an earlier paper of ours, we identify $\varphi$ in the following way. We factor $\varphi(z)$ as $\Phi(z)\Phi(-z)$, where $\Phi(z)= \prod_{n=1}^\infty(1+(-1)^n\frac{z}{\tau_n})$ and show that $\Phi$ satisfies a certain second order linear differential equation along with a functional equation either of which characterizes $\Phi$. We use these facts to establish an odd power series expansion of $n+\frac12-\tau_n$ in terms of $(n+\frac12)^{-1}$ and a power series expansion of the Fourier transform of $\varphi$, as suggested by the numerical work of H\"{o}rmander and Bernhardsson. The dual characterization of $\Phi$ arises from a commutation relation that holds more generally for a two-parameter family of differential operators, a fact that is used to perform high precision numerical computations.</description>

      <title>Infinite-Dimensional LQ Mean Field Games with Common Noise: Small and Arbitrary Finite Time Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the results of (Liu and Firoozi, 2025), which develops the theory of linear-quadratic (LQ) mean field games (MFGs) in Hilbert spaces, by incorporating a common noise. This common noise is modeled as an infinite-dimensional Wiener process affecting the dynamics of all agents. In the presence of common noise, the mean-field consistency condition is characterized by a system of coupled forward-backward stochastic evolution equations (FBSEEs) in Hilbert spaces, whereas, in its absence it is represented by coupled forward-backward deterministic evolution equations. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the coupled linear FBSEEs associated with the LQ MFG framework for small time horizons and prove the $\epsilon$-Nash property of the resulting equilibrium strategy. Furthermore, we establish the well-posedness of these coupled linear FBSEEs for arbitrary finite time horizons. Beyond the specific context of MFGs, our analysis also yields a broader contribution by providing, to the best of our knowledge, the first well-posedness result for a class of infinite-dimensional linear FBSEEs, for which only mild solutions exist, over arbitrary finite time horizons.</description>
