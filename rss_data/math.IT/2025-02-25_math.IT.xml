      <title>Optimality and Renormalization imply Statistical Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benford's Law is an important instance of experimental mathematics that appears to constrain the information-theoretic behavior of numbers. Elias' encoding for integers is a remarkable approach to universality and optimality of codes. In the present analysis we seek to deduce a general law and its particular implications for these two cases from optimality and renormalization as applied to information-theoretical functionals. Both theoretical and experimental results corroborate our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Study of Constrained Precoding with Zero-Crossing Modulation for Channels with 1-Bit Quantization and Oversampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future wireless communications systems are expected to operate at bands above 100GHz. The high energy consumption of analog-to-digital converters, due to their high resolution represents a bottleneck for future wireless communications systems which require low-energy consumption and low-complexity devices at the receiver. In this work, we derive a novel precoding method based on quality of service constraints for a multiuser multiple-input multiple-output downlink system with 1-bit quantization and oversampling. For this scenario, the time-instance zero-crossing modulation which conveys the information into the zero-crossings is considered. Unlike prior studies, the constraint is given regarding the symbol error probability related to the minimum distance to the decision threshold. Numerical results illustrate the performance of the proposed precoding method evaluated under different parameters</description>

      <title>Preserving Simultaneity and Chronology for Sensing in Wireless Perceptive Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of preserving the simultaneity and chronology of sensing events in multi-sensory systems with wireless links. The network uses temporal windows of integration (TWIs), borrowed multi-sensory perception, to preserve the temporal structure of the sensing data at the application side. We introduce a composite latency model for propagation, sensing, and communication that leads to the derivation of the probability of simultaneity violation. This is used to select the TWI duration aiming to achieve the desired degrees of chronological preservation, while maintaining the throughput of events. The letter provides important insights and analytical tools about the TWI impact on the event registration.</description>

      <title>M4SC: An MLLM-based Multi-modal, Multi-task and Multi-user Semantic Communication System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are capable of precisely extracting high-level semantic information from multi-modal data, enabling multi-task understanding and generation. This capability facilitates more efficient and intelligent data transmission in semantic communications. In this paper, we design a tailored MLLM for semantic communication and propose an MLLM-based Multi-modal, Multi-task and Multi-user Semantic Communication (M4SC) system. First, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to achieve multi-modal alignment in MLLMs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of semantics representation in the semantic space across different modalities. Next, we introduce a multi-task fine-tuning approach based on task instruction following, which leverages a unified task instruction template to describe various semantic communication tasks, improving the MLLM's ability to follow instructions across multiple tasks. Additionally, by designing a semantic sharing mechanism, we transmit the public and private semantic information of multiple users separately, thus increasing the efficiency of semantic communication. Finally, we employ a joint KAN-LLM-channel coding strategy to comprehensively enhance the performance of the semantic communication system in complex communication environments. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed M4SC in multi-modal, multi-task, and multi-user scenarios.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Vision Model-based Multi-user Semantic Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic Communication (SemCom) is a promising new paradigm for next-generation communication systems, emphasizing the transmission of core information, particularly in environments characterized by uncertainty, noise, and bandwidth constraints. However, existing image SemCom systems face several challenges, such as inefficient knowledge base construction, insufficient semantic encoding, and lack of multi-user semantic sharing. To address these issues, we propose a Lightweight Vision Model-based Multi-user Semantic Communication System (LVM-MSC). First, we construct a Lightweight Knowledge Base (LKB) based on the fast Segment Anything Model (SAM). LKB incorporates the extensive image knowledge of the SAM model while significantly reducing the number of parameters through its convolutional architecture. Next, we design an Efficient Semantic Codec (ESC) based on the Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) architecture. ESC enhances semantic compression at both the pixel and semantic levels and implements lightweight semantic decoding tailored for user devices. Furthermore, we propose a Multi-user Semantic Sharing (MSS) transmission for the multi-user SemCom. By calculating the similarity of semantic information among different users in the sharing semantic space, we unify the transmissions of similar semantic information through broadcasting, further improving the transmission efficiency. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed LVM-MSC system.</description>

      <title>A Contemporary Survey on Semantic Communications:Theory of Mind, Generative AI, and Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic Communication is becoming the next pillar in wireless communication technology due to its various capabilities. However, it still encounters various challenging obstacles that need to be solved before real-world deployment. The major challenge is the lack of standardization across different directions, leading to variations in interpretations and objectives. In the survey, we provide detailed explanations of three leading directions in semantic communications, namely Theory of Mind, Generative AI, Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding. These directions have been widely studied, developed, and verified by institutes worldwide, and their effectiveness has increased along with the advancement in technology. We first introduce the concepts and background of these directions. Firstly, we introduce the Theory of Mind, where the communication agents interact with each other, gaining understanding from observations and slowly forming a common language. Secondly, we present generative AI models, which can create new content and offer more freedom to interpret the data beyond the limitation of semantic meaning compression of raw data before transmitting it. The received signal is then decoded by another generative AI model to execute the oriented task. Thirdly, we review deep learning models to jointly optimize the source and channel coding modules. Then, we present a comprehensive survey of existing works in each direction, thereby offering readers an overview of past achievements and potential avenues for further contribution. Moreover, for each direction, we identify and discuss the existing challenges that must be addressed before these approaches can be effectively deployed in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Downlink Multiuser Communications Relying on Flexible Intelligent Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A flexible intelligent metasurface (FIM) is composed of an array of low-cost radiating elements, each of which can independently radiate electromagnetic signals and flexibly adjust its position through a 3D surface-morphing process. In our system, an FIM is deployed at a base station (BS) that transmits to multiple single-antenna users. We formulate an optimization problem for minimizing the total downlink transmit power at the BS by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and the FIM's surface shape, subject to an individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for each user as well as to a constraint on the maximum morphing range of the FIM. To address this problem, an efficient alternating optimization method is proposed to iteratively update the FIM's surface shape and the transmit beamformer to gradually reduce the transmit power. Finally, our simulation results show that at a given data rate the FIM reduces the transmit power by about $3$ dB compared to conventional rigid 2D arrays.</description>

      <title>Flexible Intelligent Metasurfaces for Enhanced MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible intelligent metasurfaces (FIMs) constitute a promising technology that could significantly boost the wireless network capacity. An FIM is essentially a soft array made up of many low-cost radiating elements that can independently emit electromagnetic signals. What's more, each element can flexibly adjust its position, even perpendicularly to the surface, to morph the overall 3D shape. In this paper, we study the potential of FIMs in point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications, where two FIMs are used as transceivers. In order to characterize the capacity limits of FIM-aided narrowband MIMO transmissions, we formulate an optimization problem for maximizing the MIMO channel capacity by jointly optimizing the 3D surface shapes of the transmitting and receiving FIMs, as well as the transmit covariance matrix, subject to a specific total transmit power constraint and to the maximum morphing range of the FIM. To solve this problem, we develop an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm. The BCD algorithm iteratively updates the 3D surface shapes of the FIMs and the transmit covariance matrix, while keeping the other fixed. Numerical results verify that FIMs can achieve higher MIMO capacity than traditional rigid arrays. In some cases, the MIMO channel capacity can be doubled by employing FIMs.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal RIS in Multiuser MIMO: Graph Theoretic Modeling and Optimal Architectures with Low Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) is regarded as a key enabler of wave/analog-domain beamforming, processing, and computing in future wireless communication systems. Recently, Beyond Diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has been proposed as a generalization of conventional RIS, offering enhanced design flexibility thanks to the presence of tunable impedances that connect RIS elements. However, increased interconnections lead to high circuit complexity, which poses a significant practical challenge. In this paper, we address the fundamental open question: What is the class of BD-RIS architectures that achieves the optimal performance in a RIS-aided multiuser multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system? By modeling BD-RIS architectures using graph theory, we identify a class of BD-RIS architectures that achieves the optimal performance--matching that of fully-connected RIS--while maintaining low circuit complexity. Our result holds for a broad class of performance metrics, including the commonly used sum channel gain/sum-rate/energy efficiency maximization, transmit power minimization, and the information-theoretic capacity region. The number of tunable impedances in the proposed class is ${O}(N\min\{D,N/2\})$, where $N$ denotes the number of RIS elements and $D$ is the degree of freedom of the multiuser MIMO channel, i.e., the minimum between the number of transmit antennas and the total number of received antennas across all users. Since $D$ is much smaller than $N$ in practice, the complexity scales as ${O}(ND)$, which is substantially lower than the ${O}(N^2)$ complexity of fully-connected RIS. We further introduce two novel BD-RIS architectures--band-connected RIS and stem-connected RIS--and show that they belong to the optimal architecture class under certain conditions. Simulation results validate the optimality and enhanced performance-complexity tradeoff of our proposed architecture.</description>

      <title>Parselets: An Abstraction for Fast, General-Purpose Algorithmic Information Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work describes the principled design of a theoretical framework leading to fast and accurate algorithmic information measures on finite multisets of finite strings by means of compression. One distinctive feature of our approach is to manipulate {\em reified}, explicit representations of the very entities and quantities of the theory itself: compressed strings, models, rate-distortion states, minimal sufficient models, joint and relative complexity. To do so, a programmable, recursive data structure called a {\em parselet} essentially provides modeling of a string as a concatenation of parameterized instantiations from sets of finite strings that encode the regular part of the data. This supports another distinctive feature of this work, which is the native embodiment of Epicurus' Principle on top of Occam's Razor, so as to produce both a most-significant and most-general explicit model for the data. This model is iteratively evolved through the Principle of Minimal Change to reach the so-called minimal sufficient model of the data. Parselets may also be used to compute a compression score to any arbitrary hypothesis about the data. A lossless, rate-distortion oriented, compressed representation is proposed, that allows immediate reusability of the costly computations stored on disk for their fast merging as our core routine for information calculus. Two information measures are deduced: one is exact because it is purely combinatorial, and the other may occasionally incur slight numerical inaccuracies because it is an approximation of the Kolmogorov complexity of the minimal sufficient model. Symmetry of information is enforced at the bit level. Whenever possible, parselets are compared with off-the-shelf compressors on real data. Some other applications just get enabled by parselets.</description>

      <title>Spatial Disease Propagation With Hubs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical contact or proximity is often a necessary condition for the spread of infectious diseases. Common destinations, typically referred to as hubs or points of interest, are arguably the most effective spots for the type of disease spread via airborne transmission. In this work, we model the locations of individuals (agents) and common destinations (hubs) by random spatial point processes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and focus on disease propagation through agents visiting common hubs. The probability of an agent visiting a hub depends on their distance through a connection function $f$. The system is represented by a random bipartite geometric (RBG) graph. We study the degrees and percolation of the RBG graph for general connection functions. We show that the critical density of hubs for percolation is dictated by the support of the connection function $f$, which reveals the critical role of long-distance travel (or its restrictions) in disease spreading.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna System (PASS)-enabled Multicast Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna system (PASS) is a novel flexible-antenna technology, which employs long-spread waveguides to convey signals with negligible path loss and pinching antennas (PAs) with adjustable positions to radiate signals from the waveguide into the free space. Therefore, short-distance and strong line-of-sight transmission can be established. In this paper, a novel PASS-enabled multicast communication framework is proposed, where multiple PAs on a single waveguide radiate the broadcast signals to multiple users. The multicast performance maximization problem is formulated to optimize the positions of all PAs. To address this non-convex problem, a particle swarm optimization-based algorithm is developed. Numerical results show that PASS can significantly outperform the conventional multiple-antenna transmission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surface (STARS) empowered multi-functional 6G wireless networks are investigated. Starting with the communication functionality, various types of STARS are introduced in terms of power amplification capabilities, reciprocity features, and spatial density of elements. Then, three STARS-empowered wireless sensing architectures are proposed, namely STARS-aided monostatic sensing, STARS-enabled bistatic sensing, and sensing with target-mounted STARS, where the representative benefits and application challenges are identified. Furthermore, promising applications of STARS for computing and caching functionalities are explored to improve the computation efficiency and reduce the content delivery latency. Finally, recent standardization progress for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces is presented for motivating the employment of STARS in multi-functional 6G.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of successive-refinement coding for lossy compression of individual sequences, namely, compression in two stages, where in the first stage, a coarse description at a relatively low rate is sent from the encoder to the decoder, and in the second stage, additional coding rate is allocated in order to refine the description and thereby improve the reproduction. Our main result is in establishing outer bounds (converse theorems) for the rate region where we limit the encoders to be finite-state machines in the spirit of Ziv and Lempel's 1978 model.The matching achievability scheme is conceptually straightforward. We also consider the more general multiple description coding problem on a similar footing and propose achievability schemes that are analogous to the well-known El Gamal-Cover and the Zhang-Berger achievability schemes of memoryless sources and additive distortion measures.</description>

      <title>Optimal redundancy of function-correcting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Function-correcting codes, introduced by Lenz, Bitar, Wachter-Zeh, and Yaakobi, protect specific function values of a message rather than the entire message. A central challenge is determining the optimal redundancy -- the minimum additional information required to recover function values amid errors. This redundancy depends on both the number of correctable errors $t$ and the structure of message vectors yielding identical function values. While prior works established bounds, key questions remain, such as the optimal redundancy for functions like Hamming weight and Hamming weight distribution, along with efficient code constructions. In this paper, we make the following contributions:
  (1) For the Hamming weight function, we improve the lower bound on optimal redundancy from $\frac{10(t-1)}{3}$ to $4t - \frac{4}{3}\sqrt{6t+2} + 2$. On the other hand, we provide a systematical approach to constructing explicit FCCs via a novel connection with Gray codes, which also improve the previous upper bound from $\frac{4t-2}{1 - 2\sqrt{\log{2t}/(2t)}}$ to $4t - \log{t}$. Consequently, we almost determine the optimal redundancy for Hamming weight function.
  (2) The Hamming weight distribution function is defined by the value of Hamming weight divided by a given positive integer $T$. Previous work established that the optimal redundancy is $2t$ when $T &gt; 2t$, while the case $T \le 2t$ remained unclear. We show that the optimal redundancy remains $2t$ when $T \ge t+1$. However, in the surprising regime where $T = o(t)$, we achieve near-optimal redundancy of $4t - o(t)$. Our results reveal a significant distinction in behavior of redundancy for distinct choices of $T$.</description>

      <title>Subspace and DOA estimation under coarse quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation from coarsely quantized data. We focus on a two-step approach which first estimates the signal subspace via covariance estimation and then extracts DOA angles by the ESPRIT algorithm. In particular, we analyze two stochastic quantization schemes which use dithering: a one-bit quantizer combined with rectangular dither and a multi-bit quantizer with triangular dither. For each quantizer, we derive rigorous high probability bounds for the distances between the true and estimated signal subspaces and DOA angles. Using our analysis, we identify scenarios in which subspace and DOA estimation via triangular dithering qualitatively outperforms rectangular dithering. We verify in numerical simulations that our estimates are optimal in their dependence on the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of the target matrix. The resulting subspace estimation guarantees are equally applicable in the analysis of other spectral estimation algorithms and related problems.</description>

      <title>A Frequency-Domain Opportunistic Approach for Spectral-Efficient Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constrained by weak signal strength and significant inter-cell interference, users located at the cell edge in a cellular network suffer from inferior service quality. Recently, cell-free massive MIMO (CFmMIMO) has gained considerable attention due to its capability to offer uniform quality of service, alleviating the cell-edge problem. In contrast to previous studies focused on narrow-band CFmMIMO systems, this paper studies wideband CFmMIMO communications against channel frequency selectivity. By exploiting the frequency-domain flexibility offered by orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), and leveraging a particular spatial characteristic in the cell-free structure -- namely, the near-far effect among distributed access points (APs) -- we propose an opportunistic approach to boost spectral efficiency. The core concept lies in opportunistically activating nearby APs for certain users across their assigned OFDM subcarriers while deactivating distant APs to prevent power wastage and lower inter-user interference. Furthermore, this approach enables the use of downlink pilots by reducing the number of active APs per subcarrier to a small subset, thereby substantially improving downlink performance through coherent detection at the user receiver. Verified by numerical results, our proposed approach demonstrates considerable performance improvement compared to the two benchmark approaches.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Trade-off Between Computation and Communication in Private Coded Distributed Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed computing enables scalable machine learning by distributing tasks across multiple nodes, but ensuring privacy in such systems remains a challenge. This paper introduces a private coded distributed computing model that integrates privacy constraints to keep task assignments hidden. By leveraging placement delivery arrays (PDAs), we design an extended PDA framework to characterize achievable computation and communication loads under privacy constraints. By constructing two classes of extended PDAs, we explore the trade-offs between computation and communication, showing that although privacy increases communication overhead, it can be significantly alleviated through optimized PDA-based coded strategies.</description>

      <title>Exact Recovery of Sparse Binary Vectors from Generalized Linear Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of exact recovery of a $k$-sparse binary vector from generalized linear measurements (such as logistic regression). We analyze the linear estimation algorithm (Plan, Vershynin, Yudovina, 2017), and also show information theoretic lower bounds on the number of required measurements. As a consequence of our results, for noisy one bit quantized linear measurements ($\mathsf{1bCSbinary}$), we obtain a sample complexity of $O((k+\sigma^2)\log{n})$, where $\sigma^2$ is the noise variance. This is shown to be optimal due to the information theoretic lower bound. We also obtain tight sample complexity characterization for logistic regression.
  Since $\mathsf{1bCSbinary}$ is a strictly harder problem than noisy linear measurements ($\mathsf{SparseLinearReg}$) because of added quantization, the same sample complexity is achievable for $\mathsf{SparseLinearReg}$. While this sample complexity can be obtained via the popular lasso algorithm, linear estimation is computationally more efficient. Our lower bound holds for any set of measurements for $\mathsf{SparseLinearReg}$, (similar bound was known for Gaussian measurement matrices) and is closely matched by the maximum-likelihood upper bound. For $\mathsf{SparseLinearReg}$, it was conjectured in Gamarnik and Zadik, 2017 that there is a statistical-computational gap and the number of measurements should be at least $(2k+\sigma^2)\log{n}$ for efficient algorithms to exist. It is worth noting that our results imply that there is no such statistical-computational gap for $\mathsf{1bCSbinary}$ and logistic regression.</description>

      <title>Joint Value Estimation and Bidding in Repeated First-Price Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study regret minimization in repeated first-price auctions (FPAs), where a bidder observes only the realized outcome after each auction -- win or loss. This setup reflects practical scenarios in online display advertising where the actual value of an impression depends on the difference between two potential outcomes, such as clicks or conversion rates, when the auction is won versus lost. We analyze three outcome models: (1) adversarial outcomes without features, (2) linear potential outcomes with features, and (3) linear treatment effects in features. For each setting, we propose algorithms that jointly estimate private values and optimize bidding strategies, achieving near-optimal regret bounds. Notably, our framework enjoys a unique feature that the treatments are also actively chosen, and hence eliminates the need for the overlap condition commonly required in causal inference.</description>

      <title>Semantic Security with Infinite Dimensional Quantum Eavesdropping Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07663v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new proof method for direct coding theorems for wiretap channels where the eavesdropper has access to a quantum version of the transmitted signal on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and the legitimate parties communicate through a classical channel or a classical input, quantum output (cq) channel. The transmitter input can be subject to an additive cost constraint, which specializes to the case of an average energy constraint. This method yields errors that decay exponentially with increasing block lengths. Moreover, it provides a guarantee of a quantum version of semantic security, which is an established concept in classical cryptography and physical layer security. Therefore, it complements existing works which either do not prove the exponential error decay or use weaker notions of security. The main part of this proof method is a direct coding result on channel resolvability which states that there is only a doubly exponentially small probability that a standard random codebook does not solve the channel resolvability problem for the cq channel. Semantic security has strong operational implications meaning essentially that the eavesdropper cannot use its quantum observation to gather any meaningful information about the transmitted signal. We also discuss the connections between semantic security and various other established notions of secrecy.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Analog Processing in MIMO Systems with Coarse Quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analog to digital converters (ADCs) are a major contributor to the power consumption of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receivers in large bandwidth millimeter-wave systems. Prior works have considered two mitigating solutions to reduce the ADC power consumption: i) decreasing the number of ADCs via analog and hybrid beamforming, and ii) decreasing the ADC resolution, i.e., utilizing one-bit and few-bit ADCs. These mitigating solutions lead to performance loss in terms of achievable rates due to increased quantization error. In this work, the use of nonlinear analog operators such as envelope detectors and polynomial operators, prior to sampling and quantization is considered, as a way to reduce the aforementioned rate-loss. The receiver architecture consists of linear combiners, nonlinear analog operators, and few-bit ADCs. The fundamental performance limits of the resulting communication system, in terms of achievable rates, are investigated under various assumptions on the set of implementable analog operators. Extensive numerical evaluations are provided to evaluate the set of achievable rates and the power consumption of the proposed receiver architectures. Circuit simulations and measurement results, based on both 22 nm FDSOI CMOS technology and 65 nm Bulk CMOS transistor technologies, are provided to justify the power efficiency of the proposed receiver architectures.</description>

      <title>Encoding and Construction of Quantum Codes from $(\gamma,\Delta)$-cyclic Codes over a Class of Non-chain Rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a finite field of $q=p^m$ elements where $p$ is a prime and $m$ is a positive integer. This paper considers $(\gamma,\Delta)$-cyclic codes over a class of finite non-chain commutative rings $\mathscr{R}_{q,s}=\mathbb{F}_q[v_1,v_2,\dots,v_s]/\langle v_i-v_i^2,v_iv_j=v_jv_i=0\rangle$ where $\gamma$ is an automorphism of $\mathscr{R}_{q,s}$, $\Delta$ is a $\gamma$-derivation of $\mathscr{R}_{q,s}$ and $1\leq i\neq j\leq s$ for a positive integer $s$. Here, we show that a $(\gamma,\Delta)$-cyclic code of length $n$ over $\mathscr{R}_{q,s}$ is the direct sum of $(\theta,\Im)$-cyclic codes of length $n$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$, where $\theta$ is an automorphism of $\mathbb{F}_q$ and $\Im$ is a $\theta$-derivation of $\mathbb{F}_q$. Further, necessary and sufficient conditions for both $(\gamma,\Delta)$-cyclic and $(\theta,\Im)$-cyclic codes to contain their Euclidean duals are established. Then, we obtain many quantum codes by applying the dual containing criterion on the Gray images of these codes. These codes have better parameters than those available in the literature. Finally, the encoding and error-correction procedures for our proposed quantum codes are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of recovering the hidden vertex correspondence between two correlated random graphs. We propose the partially correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs model, wherein a pair of induced subgraphs with a certain number are correlated. We investigate the information-theoretic thresholds for recovering the latent correlated subgraphs and the hidden vertex correspondence. We prove that there exists an optimal rate for partial recovery for the number of correlated nodes, above which one can correctly match a fraction of vertices and below which correctly matching any positive fraction is impossible, and we also derive an optimal rate for exact recovery. In the proof of possibility results, we propose correlated functional digraphs, which partition the edges of the intersection graph into two types of components, and bound the error probability by lower-order cumulant generating functions. The proof of impossibility results build upon the generalized Fano's inequality and the recovery thresholds settled in correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple access communication systems enable numerous users to share common communication resources simultaneously, playing a crucial role in wireless networks. With the emergence of the sixth generation (6G) and beyond communication systems, supporting massive machine-type communications with sporadic activity patterns is expected to become a critical challenge. Unsourced random access (URA) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address this challenge by decoupling user identification from data transmission through the use of a common codebook. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of URA solutions, covering both theoretical foundations and practical implementations. We present a systematic classification of URA solutions across three main channel models: Gaussian multiple access channels (GMACs), single-antenna fading, and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels. For each category, we analyze and compare state-of-the-art solutions in terms of performance, complexity, and practical feasibility. Additionally, we discuss critical challenges such as interference management, computational complexity, and synchronization issues. The survey concludes with promising future research directions and potential methods to address existing limitations, providing a roadmap for researchers and practitioners in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

Abstract: This work introduces a novel approach to constructing DNA codes from linear codes over a non-chain extension of $\mathbb{Z}_4$. We study $(\text{\textbaro},\mathfrak{d}, \gamma)$-constacyclic codes over the ring $\mathfrak{R}=\mathbb{Z}_4+\omega\mathbb{Z}_4, \omega^2=\omega,$ with an $\mathfrak{R}$-automorphism $\text{\textbaro}$ and a $\text{\textbaro}$-derivation $\mathfrak{d}$ over $\mathfrak{R}.$ Further, we determine the generators of the $(\text{\textbaro},\mathfrak{d}, \gamma)$-constacyclic codes over the ring $\mathfrak{R}$ of any arbitrary length and establish the reverse constraint for these codes. Besides the necessary and sufficient criterion to derive reverse-complement codes, we present a construction to obtain DNA codes from these reversible codes. Moreover, we use another construction on the $(\text{\textbaro},\mathfrak{d},\gamma)$-constacyclic codes to generate additional optimal and new classical codes. Finally, we provide several examples of $(\text{\textbaro},\mathfrak{d}, \gamma)$ constacyclic codes and construct DNA codes from established results. The parameters of these linear codes over $\mathbb{Z}_4$ are better and optimal according to the codes available at \cite{z4codes}.</description>

      <title>Age Optimal Sampling for Unreliable Channels under Unknown Channel Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a system in which a sensor forwards status updates to a receiver through an error-prone channel, while the receiver sends the transmission results back to the sensor via a reliable channel. Both channels are subject to random delays. To evaluate the timeliness of the status information at the receiver, we use the Age of Information (AoI) metric. The objective is to design a sampling policy that minimizes the expected time-average AoI, even when the channel statistics (e.g., delay distributions) are unknown. We first review the threshold structure of the optimal offline policy under known channel statistics and then reformulate the design of the online algorithm as a stochastic approximation problem. We propose a Robbins-Monro algorithm to solve this problem and demonstrate that the optimal threshold can be approximated almost surely. Moreover, we prove that the cumulative AoI regret of the online algorithm increases with rate $\mathcal{O}(\ln K)$, where $K$ is the number of successful transmissions. In addition, our algorithm is shown to be minimax order optimal, in the sense that for any online learning algorithm, the cumulative AoI regret up to the $K$-th successful transmissions grows with the rate at least $\Omega(\ln K)$ in the worst case delay distribution. Finally, we improve the stability of the proposed online learning algorithm through a momentum-based stochastic gradient descent algorithm. Simulation results validate the performance of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>A New Construction Structure on Coded Caching with Linear Subpacketization: Non-Half-Sum Disjoint Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coded caching is a promising technique to effectively reduce peak traffic by using local caches and the multicast gains generated by these local caches. We prefer to design a coded caching scheme with the subpacketization $F$ and transmission load $R$ as small as possible since these are the key metrics for evaluating the implementation complexity and transmission efficiency of the scheme, respectively. However, most of the existing coded caching schemes have large subpacketizations which grow exponentially with the number of users $K$, and there are a few schemes with linear subpacketizations which have large transmission loads. In this paper, we focus on studying the linear subpacketization, i.e., $K=F$, coded caching scheme with low transmission load. Specifically, we first introduce a new combinatorial structure called non-half-sum disjoint packing (NHSDP) which can be used to generate a coded caching scheme with $K=F$. Then a class of new schemes is obtained by constructing NHSDP. Theoretical and numerical comparisons show that (i) compared to the existing schemes with linear subpacketization (to the number of users), the proposed scheme achieves a lower load; (ii) compared to some existing schemes with polynomial subpacketization, the proposed scheme can also achieve a lower load in some cases; (iii) compared to some existing schemes with exponential subpacketization, the proposed scheme has loads close to those of these schemes in some cases. Moreover, the new concept of NHSDP is closely related to the classical combinatorial structures such as cyclic difference packing (CDP), non-three-term arithmetic progressions (NTAP), and perfect hash family (PHF). These connections indicate that NHSDP is an important combinatorial structure in the field of combinatorial design.</description>

      <title>Generalized Orthogonal de Bruijn and Kautz Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A de Bruijn sequence of order $k$ over a finite alphabet is a cyclic sequence with the property that it contains every possible $k$-sequence as a substring exactly once. Orthogonal de Bruijn sequences are collections of de Bruijn sequences of the same order, $k$, satisfying the joint constraint that every $(k+1)$-sequence appears as a substring in at most one of the sequences in the collection. Both de Bruijn and orthogonal de Bruijn sequences have found numerous applications in synthetic biology, although the latter remain largely unexplored in the coding theory literature. Here we study three relevant practical generalizations of orthogonal de Bruijn sequences where we relax either the constraint that every $(k+1)$-sequence appears exactly once, or that the sequences themselves are de Bruijn rather than balanced de Bruijn sequences. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the number of fixed-weight orthogonal de Bruijn sequences. The paper concludes with parallel results for orthogonal nonbinary Kautz sequences, which satisfy similar constraints as de Bruijn sequences except for only being required to cover all subsequences of length $k$ whose maximum runlength equals to one.</description>

      <title>Embracing Reconfigurable Antennas in the Tri-hybrid MIMO Architecture for 6G and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication has led to immense enhancements in data rates and efficient spectrum management. The evolution of MIMO, though, has been accompanied by increased hardware complexity and array sizes, causing the system power consumption to increase. Despite past advances in power-efficient hybrid architectures, new solutions are needed to enable extremely large-scale MIMO deployments for 6G and beyond. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture that integrates low-power reconfigurable antennas with both digital and analog precoding. This \emph{tri-hybrid} approach addresses key limitations in traditional and hybrid MIMO systems by improving power consumption and adds a new layer for signal processing. We provide an analysis of the proposed architecture and compare its performance with existing solutions, including fully-digital and hybrid MIMO systems. The results demonstrate significant improvements in energy efficiency, highlighting the potential of the tri-hybrid system to meet the growing demands of future wireless networks. We conclude the paper with a summary of design and implementation challenges, including the need for technological advancements in reconfigurable array hardware and tunable antenna parameters.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Property Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Locality is a fundamental feature of many physical time evolutions. Assumptions on locality and related structural properties also underlie recently proposed procedures for learning an unknown Hamiltonian from access to the induced time evolution. However, no protocols to rigorously test whether an unknown Hamiltonian is local were known. We investigate Hamiltonian locality testing as a property testing problem, where the task is to determine whether an unknown $n$-qubit Hamiltonian $H$ is $k$-local or $\varepsilon$-far from all $k$-local Hamiltonians, given access to the time evolution along $H$. First, we emphasize the importance of the chosen distance measure: With respect to the operator norm, a worst-case distance measure, incoherent quantum locality testers require $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n)$ many time evolution queries and an expected total evolution time of $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n / \varepsilon)$, and even coherent testers need $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ many queries and $\Omega(2^{n/2}/\varepsilon)$ total evolution time. In contrast, when distances are measured according to the normalized Frobenius norm, corresponding to an average-case distance, we give a sample-, time-, and computationally efficient incoherent Hamiltonian locality testing algorithm based on randomized measurements. In fact, our procedure can be used to simultaneously test a wide class of Hamiltonian properties beyond locality. Finally, we prove that learning a general Hamiltonian remains exponentially hard with this average-case distance, thereby establishing an exponential separation between Hamiltonian testing and learning. Our work initiates the study of property testing for quantum Hamiltonians, demonstrating that a broad class of Hamiltonian properties is efficiently testable even with limited quantum capabilities, and positioning Hamiltonian testing as an independent area of research alongside Hamiltonian learning.</description>

      <title>Geometry and factorization of multivariate Markov chains with applications to the swapping algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12589v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the factorizability and geometry of transition matrices of multivariate Markov chains. Specifically, we demonstrate that the induced chains on factors of a product space can be regarded as information projections with respect to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This perspective yields Han-Shearer type inequalities and submodularity of the entropy rate of Markov chains, as well as applications in the context of large deviations and mixing time comparison. As a concrete algorithmic application, we introduce a projection sampler based on the swapping algorithm, which resamples the highest-temperature coordinate at stationarity at each step. We prove that such practice accelerates the mixing time by multiplicative factors related to the number of temperatures and the dimension of the underlying state space when compared with the original swapping algorithm.</description>

      <title>Weak recovery, hypothesis testing, and mutual information in stochastic block models and planted factor graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic block model is a canonical model of communities in random graphs. It was introduced in the social sciences and statistics as a model of communities, and in theoretical computer science as an average case model for graph partitioning problems under the name of the ``planted partition model.'' Given a sparse stochastic block model, the two standard inference tasks are: (i) Weak recovery: can we estimate the communities with non trivial overlap with the true communities? (ii) Detection/Hypothesis testing: can we distinguish if the sample was drawn from the block model or from a random graph with no community structure with probability tending to $1$ as the graph size tends to infinity?
  In this work, we show that for sparse stochastic block models, the two inference tasks are equivalent except at a critical point. That is, weak recovery is information theoretically possible if and only if detection is possible. We thus find a strong connection between these two notions of inference for the model. We further prove that when detection is impossible, an explicit hypothesis test based on low degree polynomials in the adjacency matrix of the observed graph achieves the optimal statistical power. This low degree test is efficient as opposed to the likelihood ratio test, which is not known to be efficient. Moreover, we prove that the asymptotic mutual information between the observed network and the community structure exhibits a phase transition at the weak recovery threshold.
  Our results are proven in much broader settings including the hypergraph stochastic block models and general planted factor graphs. In these settings we prove that the impossibility of weak recovery implies contiguity and provide a condition which guarantees the equivalence of weak recovery and detection.</description>

      <title>Online Optimization for Learning to Communicate over Time-Correlated Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00575v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques have garnered great interest in designing communication systems owing to their capacity in tacking with channel uncertainty. To provide theoretical guarantees for learning-based communication systems, some recent works analyze generalization bounds for devised methods based on the assumption of Independently and Identically Distributed (I.I.D.) channels, a condition rarely met in practical scenarios. In this paper, we drop the I.I.D. channel assumption and study an online optimization problem of learning to communicate over time-correlated channels. To address this issue, we further focus on two specific tasks: optimizing channel decoders for time-correlated fading channels and selecting optimal codebooks for time-correlated additive noise channels. For utilizing temporal dependence of considered channels to better learn communication systems, we develop two online optimization algorithms based on the optimistic online mirror descent framework. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees for proposed algorithms via deriving sub-linear regret bound on the expected error probability of learned systems. Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted to validate that our presented approaches can leverage the channel correlation to achieve a lower average symbol error rate compared to baseline methods, consistent with our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Conformal Distributed Remote Inference in Sensor Networks Under Reliability and Communication Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07902v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents communication-constrained distributed conformal risk control (CD-CRC) framework, a novel decision-making framework for sensor networks under communication constraints. Targeting multi-label classification problems, such as segmentation, CD-CRC dynamically adjusts local and global thresholds used to identify significant labels with the goal of ensuring a target false negative rate (FNR), while adhering to communication capacity limits. CD-CRC builds on online exponentiated gradient descent to estimate the relative quality of the observations of different sensors, and on online conformal risk control (CRC) as a mechanism to control local and global thresholds. CD-CRC is proved to offer deterministic worst-case performance guarantees in terms of FNR and communication overhead, while the regret performance in terms of false positive rate (FPR) is characterized as a function of the key hyperparameters. Simulation results highlight the effectiveness of CD-CRC, particularly in communication resource-constrained environments, making it a valuable tool for enhancing the performance and reliability of distributed sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Approximate Degenerate Ordered Statistics Decoding for Quantum Codes via Reliable Subset Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient decoding of quantum codes is crucial for achieving high-performance quantum error correction. In this paper, we introduce the concept of approximate degenerate decoding and integrate it with ordered statistics decoding (OSD). Previously, we proposed a reliability metric that leverages both hard and soft decisions from the output of belief propagation (BP), which is particularly useful for identifying highly reliable subsets of variables. Using the approach of reliable subset reduction, we reduce the effective problem size. Additionally, we identify a degeneracy condition that allows high-order OSD to be simplified to order-0 OSD. By integrating these techniques, we present an ADOSD algorithm that significantly improves OSD efficiency in the code capacity noise model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our BP+ADOSD approach through extensive simulations on a varity of quantum codes, including generalized hypergraph-product codes, topological codes, lift-connected surface codes, and bivariate bicycle codes. The results indicate that the BP+ADOSD decoder outperforms existing methods, achieving higher error thresholds and enhanced performance at low error rates. Additionally, we validate the efficiency of our approach in terms of computational time, demonstrating that ADOSD requires, on average, the same amount of time as two to three BP iterations on surface codes at a depolarizing error rate of around $1\%$. All the proposed algorithms are compared using single-threaded CPU implementations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we rethink delay Doppler channels (also called doubly selective channels). We prove that no modulation schemes (including the current active VOFDM/OTFS) can compensate a non-trivial Doppler spread well. We then discuss some of the existing methods to deal with time-varying channels, in particular time-frequency (TF) coding in an OFDM system. TF coding is equivalent to space-time coding in the math part. We also summarize state of the art on space-time coding that was an active research topic over a decade ago.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Whitney function of a q-matroid can be determined from the cloud and flock polynomials associated to the cyclic flats. These polynomials capture information about the corank (resp., nullity) of certain spaces whose cyclic core (resp., closure) is the given cyclic flat. Going one step further, we prove that the Whitney function, and in fact the cloud-flock lattice, are determined by the configuration of the q-matroid, which is the abstract lattice of cyclic flats together with the corank-nullity data. Furthermore, we show that the configuration and cloud-flock lattice behave well under duality and direct sums, whereas the Whitney function does not contain enough information to behave well under taking direct sums.</description>

      <title>Effcient classical error correction for parity-encoded spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast solvers for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) have garnered engineering interest across various industrial and social applications. Quantum annealing (QA) has emerged as a promising candidate, with considerable efforts dedicated to its development. Since COP is encoded in the Ising interaction among logical spins, its realization necessitates a spin system with all-to-all connectivity, presenting technical challenges in the physical implementation of large-scale QA devices. W. Lechner, P. Hauke, and P. Zoller proposed a parity-encoding (PE) architecture, which consists of an enlarged system of physical spins with only local connectivity among them, to circumvent this difficulty in developing near-future QA devices. They suggested that this architecture not only alleviates implementation challenges and enhances scalability but also possesses intrinsic fault tolerance, as logical spins are redundantly and nonlocally encoded in the physical spins. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how these advantageous features can be exploited. This paper addresses correcting errors in a spin readout of PE architecture. Our work is based on the close connection between PE architecture and classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We have shown that independent and identically distributed errors in a spin readout can be corrected using a straightforward decoding algorithm that can be viewed as a bit flipping (BF) algorithm for the LDPC codes. The BF algorithm has been shown to perform comparably to the belief propagation (BP) decoding algorithm. Furthermore, it is suggested that the introduction of post-readout BF decoding reduces the total computational cost and enhances the performance of the global optimal solution search using the PE architecture. Our results indicate that the PE architecture is a promising platform for near-term QA devices.</description>

      <title>Coarse Set Theory for AI Ethics and Decision-Making: A Mathematical Framework for Granular Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) and decision-making systems, structured approximations are essential for balancing model interpretability and predictive accuracy. Coarse Set Theory (CST) introduces a mathematical framework to formalize Coarse Ethics (CE), which models coarse-grained decision-making processes commonly used in human evaluations and AI classification systems. CST defines hierarchical relationships among sets using totally ordered structures and coarse mappings, enabling AI systems to adjust decision granularity dynamically. However, coarse evaluations inherently involve a trade-off between efficiency and information retention, as they simplify complex data representations at the cost of precision. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we introduce Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as a measure of information loss in coarse evaluations, demonstrating the impact of coarse partitioning on decision accuracy. This study applies CST to grading systems, automated recommendations, and risk assessments, demonstrating its potential to enhance fairness, reduce bias, and improve transparency in AI-driven decision-making.</description>
