      <title>A Parallelized 3D Geomechanical Solver for Fluid-induced Fault Slip in Poroelastic Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully implicit formulation of coupled fluid flow and geomechanics for fluid injection/withdrawal in fractured reservoirs in the context of CO2storage.
  Utilizing a Galerkin finite-element approach, both flow and poroelasticity equations are discretized on a shared three-dimensional mesh. The fluid flow is assumed to be single-phase. The hydraulic behaviour of fractures is represented through a double-nodes flow element, which allows to efficiently model longitudinal and transversal fracture permeabilities. In addressing the mechanical subproblem, fractures are explicitly modelled using cohesive elements to account for contact, friction and opening phenomena. The nonlinear set of equations is solved implicitly through an iterative partitioned conjugate gradient procedure, extending its traditional application to continuous problems to those involving explicit discontinuities such as faults and fractures. The model's accuracy is verified against analytical solutions for different geomechanical problems, notably for the growth of a frictional slip rupture along a fault due to fluid injection. Such a particularly challenging benchmark for a critically stressed fault is here reproduced for the first time by a finite-element based scheme.
  The capabilities of the developed parallel solver are then illustrated through a scenario involving CO2 injection into a faulted aquifer. The original solver code, tutorials, and data visualization routines are publicly accessible.</description>

      <title>Evaluating potential landing sites for the Artemis III mission using a multi-criteria decision making approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The selection of a landing site within the Artemis Exploration Zone (AEZ) involves multiple factors and presents a complex problem. This study evaluates potential landing sites for the Artemis III mission using a combination of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methodologies, specifically the TOPSIS algorithm. By integrating topographic, illumination, and mineralogy data of the Moon, we assess 1247 locations that meet the Human Landing System (HLS) requirements within 13 candidate regions and Site 004 near the lunar south pole. Criteria considered include surface visibility, HLS-astronaut line of sight, Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs), sunlight exposure, direct communication with Earth, geological units, and mafic mineral abundance. Site DM2 (Nobile Rim 2), particularly the point at latitude 84{\deg}12'5.61" S (-84.20156{\deg}) and longitude 60{\deg}41'59.61" E (60.69989{\deg}), is the optimal location for landing. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of our approach, validating the suitability of the best location despite the MCDM method employed and variations in criteria weightings to prioritize illumination and PSRs. This research demonstrates the applicability of GIS-MCDM techniques for lunar exploration and the potential benefits they can bring to the Artemis program.</description>
