      <title>Rate-Matching Framework for RSMA-Enabled Multibeam LEO Satellite Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the goal of ubiquitous global connectivity, multibeam low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SATCOM) has attracted significant attention in recent years. The traffic demands of users are heterogeneous within the broad coverage of SATCOM due to different geological conditions and user distributions. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel rate-matching (RM) framework based on rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) that minimizes the difference between the traffic demands and offered rates while simultaneously minimizing transmit power for power-hungry satellite payloads. Moreover, channel phase perturbations arising from channel estimation and feedback errors are considered to capture realistic multibeam LEO SATCOM scenarios. To tackle the non-convexity of the RSMA-based RM problem under phase perturbations, we convert it into a tractable convex form via the successive convex approximation method and present an efficient algorithm to solve the RM problem. Through the extensive numerical analysis across various traffic demand distribution and channel state information accuracy at LEO satellites, we demonstrate that RSMA flexibly allocates the power between common and private streams according to different traffic patterns across beams, thereby efficiently satisfying users non-uniform traffic demands. In particular, the use of common messages plays a vital role in overcoming the limited spatial dimension available at LEO satellites, enabling it to manage inter- and intra-beam interference effectively in the presence of phase perturbation.</description>

      <title>Coalition Formation for Heterogeneous Federated Learning Enabled Channel Estimation in RIS-assisted Cell-free MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Downlink channel estimation remains a significant bottleneck in reconfigurable intelligent surface-assisted cell-free multiple-input multiple-output communication systems. Conventional approaches primarily rely on centralized deep learning methods to estimate the high-dimensional and complex cascaded channels. These methods require data aggregation from all users for centralized model training, leading to excessive communication overhead and significant data privacy concerns. Additionally, the large size of local learning models imposes heavy computational demands on end users, necessitating strong computational capabilities that most commercial devices lack. To address the aforementioned challenges, a coalition-formation-guided heterogeneous federated learning (FL) framework is proposed. This framework leverages coalition formation to guide the formation of heterogeneous FL user groups for efficient channel estimation. Specifically, by utilizing a distributed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, each FL user intelligently and independently decides whether to join or leave a coalition, aiming at improving channel estimation accuracy, while reducing local model size and computational costs for end users. Moreover, to accelerate the DRL-FL convergence process and reduce computational burdens on end users, a transfer learning method is introduced. This method incorporates both received reference signal power and distance similarity metrics, by considering that nodes with similar distances to the base station and comparable received signal power have a strong likelihood of experiencing similar channel fading. Massive experiments performed that reveal that, compared with the benchmarks, the proposed framework significantly reduces the computational overhead of end users by 16%, improves data privacy, and improves channel estimation accuracy by 20%.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Information Freshness of IEEE 802.11ax Uplink OFDMA-Based Random Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latest WiFi standard, IEEE 802.11ax (WiFi 6), introduces a novel uplink random access mechanism called uplink orthogonal frequency division multiple access-based random access (UORA). While existing work has evaluated the performance of UORA using conventional performance metrics, such as throughput and delay, its information freshness performance has not been thoroughly investigated in the literature. This is of practical significance as WiFi 6 and beyond are expected to support real-time applications. This paper presents the first attempt to fill this gap by investigating the information freshness, quantified by the Age of Information (AoI) metric, in UORA networks. We establish an analytical framework comprising two discrete-time Markov chains (DTMCs) to characterize the transmission states of stations (STAs) in UORA networks. Building on the formulated DTMCs, we derive an analytical expression for the long-term average AoI (AAoI), facilitating the optimization of UORA parameters for enhanced AoI performance through exhaustive search. To gain deeper design insights and improve the effectiveness of UORA parameter optimization, we derive a closed-form expression for the AAoI and its approximated lower bound for a simplified scenario characterized by a fixed backoff contention window and generate-at-will status updates. By analyzing the approximated lower bound of the AAoI, we propose efficient UORA parameter optimization algorithms that can be realized with only a few comparisons of different possible values of the parameters to be optimized. Simulation results validate our analysis and demonstrate that the AAoI achieved through our proposed parameter optimization algorithm closely approximates the optimal AoI performance obtained via exhaustive search, outperforming the round-robin and max-AoI policies in large and low-traffic networks.</description>

      <title>Mixing Time of the Proximal Sampler in Relative Fisher Information via Strong Data Processing Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mixing time guarantee for sampling in relative Fisher information via the Proximal Sampler algorithm, which is an approximate proximal discretization of the Langevin dynamics. We show that when the target probability distribution is strongly log-concave, the relative Fisher information converges exponentially fast along the Proximal Sampler; this matches the exponential convergence rate of the relative Fisher information along the continuous-time Langevin dynamics for strongly log-concave target. When combined with a standard implementation of the Proximal Sampler via rejection sampling, this exponential convergence rate provides a high-accuracy iteration complexity guarantee for the Proximal Sampler in relative Fisher information when the target distribution is strongly log-concave and log-smooth. Our proof proceeds by establishing a strong data processing inequality for relative Fisher information along the Gaussian channel under strong log-concavity, and a data processing inequality along the reverse Gaussian channel for a special distribution. The forward and reverse Gaussian channels compose to form the Proximal Sampler, and these data processing inequalities imply the exponential convergence rate of the relative Fisher information along the Proximal Sampler.</description>

      <title>DISCD: Distributed Lossy Semantic Communication for Logical Deduction of Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address hypothesis testing in a distributed network of nodes, where each node has only partial information about the State of the World (SotW) and is tasked with determining which hypothesis, among a given set, is most supported by the data available within the node. However, due to each node's limited perspective of the SotW, individual nodes cannot reliably determine the most supported hypothesis independently. To overcome this limitation, nodes must exchange information via an intermediate server. Our objective is to introduce a novel distributed lossy semantic communication framework designed to minimize each node's uncertainty about the SotW while operating under limited communication budget. In each communication round, nodes determine the most content-informative message to send to the server. The server aggregates incoming messages from all nodes, updates its view of the SotW, and transmits back the most semantically informative message. We demonstrate that transmitting semantically most informative messages enables convergence toward the true distribution over the state space, improving deductive reasoning performance under communication constraints. For experimental evaluation, we construct a dataset designed for logical deduction of hypotheses and compare our approach against random message selection. Results validate the effectiveness of our semantic communication framework, showing significant improvements in nodes' understanding of the SotW for hypothesis testing, with reduced communication overhead.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Wireless Distributed Networks for 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of intelligent interconnectivity between the physical and human worlds has attracted great attention for future sixth-generation (6G) networks, emphasizing massive capacity, ultra-low latency, and unparalleled reliability. Wireless distributed networks and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), both of which have evolved from centralized paradigms, are two promising solutions for the great attention. Given their distinct capabilities, such as decentralization and collaborative mechanisms, integrating these two paradigms holds great promise for unleashing the full power of 6G, attracting significant research and development attention. This paper provides a comprehensive study on MARL-assisted wireless distributed networks for 6G. In particular, we introduce the basic mathematical background and evolution of wireless distributed networks and MARL, as well as demonstrate their interrelationships. Subsequently, we analyze different structures of wireless distributed networks from the perspectives of homogeneous and heterogeneous. Furthermore, we introduce the basic concepts of MARL and discuss two typical categories, including model-based and model-free. We then present critical challenges faced by MARL-assisted wireless distributed networks, providing important guidance and insights for actual implementation. We also explore an interplay between MARL-assisted wireless distributed networks and emerging techniques, such as information bottleneck and mirror learning, delivering in-depth analyses and application scenarios. Finally, we outline several compelling research directions for future MARL-assisted wireless distributed networks.</description>

      <title>Stacked Intelligent Metasurface Enabled Near-Field Multiuser Beamfocusing in the Wave Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent surfaces represent a breakthrough technology capable of customizing the wireless channel cost-effectively. However, the existing works generally focus on planar wavefront, neglecting near-field spherical wavefront characteristics caused by large array aperture and high operation frequencies in the terahertz (THz). Additionally, the single-layer reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) lacks the signal processing ability to mitigate the computational complexity at the base station (BS). To address this issue, we introduce a novel stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) comprised of an array of programmable metasurface layers. The SIM aims to substitute conventional digital baseband architecture to execute computing tasks with ultra-low processing delay, albeit with a reduced number of radio-frequency (RF) chains and low-resolution digital-to-analog converters. In this paper, we present a SIM-aided multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) near-field system, where the SIM is integrated into the BS to perform beamfocusing in the wave domain and customize an end-to-end channel with minimized inter-user interference. Finally, the numerical results demonstrate that near-field communication achieves superior spatial gain over the far-field, and the SIM effectively suppresses inter-user interference as the wireless signals propagate through it.</description>

      <title>Zak-Transform-Induced Optimal Sequences and Their Applications in OTFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel finite Zak transform (FZT)-aided framework for constructing multiple zero-correlation zone (ZCZ) sequence sets with optimal correlation properties. Specifically, each sequence is perfect with zero auto-correlation sidelobes, each ZCZ sequence set meets the Tang-Fan-Matsufuji bound with equality, and the maximum inter-set cross-correlation of multiple sequence sets meets the Sarwate bound with equality. Our study shows that these sequences can be sparsely expressed in the Zak domain through properly selected index and phase matrices. Particularly, it is found that the maximum inter-set cross-correlation beats the Sarwate bound if every index matrix is a circular Florentine array. Several construction methods of multiple ZCZ sequence sets are proposed, demonstrating both the optimality and high flexibility. Additionally, it is shown that excellent synchronization performance can be achieved by the proposed sequences in orthogonal-time-frequency-space (OTFS) systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new family of codes that requires only polynomial randomness yet achieves $(\rho,\ell,L)$-list-recoverability at a rate within $\epsilon$ of capacity, with $L \approx \tfrac{\ell}{\epsilon}$. In contrast, every previous construction using polynomial randomness required an exponentially larger list size. Our approach extends earlier work by Li and Wootters (2021) on the list-decodability of random linear binary codes.</description>

      <title>Study of Robust Multiuser Scheduling and Power Allocation in Cell-Free MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a robust resource allocation framework for the downlink of cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (CF-mMIMO) networks to address the effects caused by imperfect channel state information (CSI). In particular, the proposed robust resource allocation framework includes a robust user scheduling algorithm to optimize the network's sum-rate and a robust power allocation technique aimed at minimizing the mean square error (MSE) for a network with a linear precoder. Unlike non-robust resource allocation techniques, the proposed robust strategies effectively counteract the effects of imperfect CSI, enhancing network efficiency and reliability. Simulation results show a significant improvement in network performance obtained by the proposed approaches, highlighting the impact of robust resource allocation in wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Beamforming Optimization for Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pinching-Antenna SyStem (PASS) is a revolutionary flexible antenna technology designed to enhance wireless communication by establishing strong line-of-sight (LoS) links, reducing free-space path loss and enabling antenna array reconfigurability. PASS uses dielectric waveguides with low propagation loss for signal transmission, radiating via a passive pinching antenna, which is a small dielectric element applied to the waveguide. This paper first proposes a physics-based hardware model for PASS, where the pinching antenna is modeled as an open-ended directional coupler, and the electromagnetic field behavior is analyzed using coupled-mode theory. A simplified signal model characterizes the coupling effect between multiple antennas on the same waveguide. Based on this, two power models are proposed: equal power and proportional power models. Additionally, a transmit power minimization problem is formulated/studied for the joint optimization of transmit and pinching beamforming under both continuous and discrete pinching antenna activations. Two algorithms are proposed to solve this multimodal optimization problem: the penalty-based alternating optimization algorithm and a low-complexity zero-forcing (ZF)-based algorithm. Numerical results show that 1) the ZF-based low-complexity algorithm performs similarly to the penalty-based algorithm, 2) PASS reduces transmit power by over 95% compared to conventional and massive MIMO, 3) discrete activation causes minimal performance loss but requires a dense antenna set to match continuous activation, and 4) the proportional power model yields performance comparable to the equal power model.</description>

      <title>Ensemble-Tight Second-Order Asymptotics and Exponents for Guessing-Based Decoding with Abandonment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers guessing-based decoders with abandonment for discrete memoryless channels in which all codewords have the same composition. This class of decoders rank-orders all input sequences in the codebook's composition class from ``closest'' to ``farthest'' from the channel output and then queries them sequentially in that order for codebook membership. Decoding terminates when a codeword is encountered or when a predetermined number of guesses is reached, and decoding is abandoned. We derive ensemble-tight first-order asymptotics for the code rate and abandonment rate, which shows that guessing-based decoding is more efficient than conventional testing-based decoding whenever the capacity of the channel exceeds half the entropy of the capacity-achieving input distribution. The main focus of this paper is on refined asymptotics, specifically, second-order asymptotics, error exponents, and strong converse exponents. The optimal second-order region is characterized in terms of the minimum of the second-order code and abandonment rates. The error (resp.\ strong converse) exponent is characterized in terms of the minimum (resp.\ maximum) of the usual channel coding exponent and an abandonment exponent, which turns out to be a special case of the exponent of conditional almost-lossless source coding.</description>

      <title>Regular LDPC codes on BMS wiretap channels: Security bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We improve the secrecy guarantees for transmission over general binary memoryless symmetric wiretap channels that relies on regular LDPC codes. Previous works showed that LDPC codes achieve secrecy capacity of some classes of wiretap channels while leaking $o(n)$ bits of information over $n$ uses of the channel. In this note, we improve the security component of these results by reducing the leakage parameter to $O(\log^2 n)$. While this result stops short of proving \emph{strong security}, it goes beyond the general secrecy guarantees derived from properties of capacity-approaching code families.</description>

      <title>Rateless Joint Source-Channel Coding, and a Blueprint for 6G Semantic Communications System Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces rateless joint source-channel coding (rateless JSCC). The code is rateless in that it is designed and optimized for a continuum of coding rates such that it achieves a desired distortion for any rate in that continuum. We further introduce rate-adaptive and stable communication link operation to accommodate rateless JSCCs. The link operation resembles a ``bit pipe'' that is identified by its rate in bits per frame, and, by the rate of bits that are flipped in each frame. Thus, the link operation is rate-adaptive such that it punctures the rateless JSCC codeword to adapt its length (and coding rate) to the underlying channel capacity, and is stable in maintaining the bit flipping ratio across time frames.
  Next, a new family of autoencoder rateless JSCC codes are introduced. The code family is dubbed RLACS code (read as relax code, standing for ratelss and lossy autoencoder channel and source code). The code is tested for reconstruction loss of image signals and demonstrates powerful performance that is resilient to variation of channel quality. RLACS code is readily applicable to the case of semantic distortion suited to variety of semantic and effectiveness communications use cases.
  In the second part of the paper, we dive into the practical concerns around semantic communication and provide a blueprint for semantic networking system design relying on updating the existing network systems with some essential modifications. We further outline a comprehensive list of open research problems and development challenges towards a practical 6G communications system design that enables semantic networking.</description>

      <title>Pcodec: Better Compression for Numerical Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Pcodec (Pco), a format and algorithm for losslessly compressing numerical sequences. Pco's core and most novel component is a binning algorithm that quickly converges to the true entropy of smoothly, independently, and identically distributed (SIID) data. To automatically handle more general data, Pco has two opinionated preprocessing steps. The first step, Pco's mode, decomposes the data into more smoothly distributed latent variables. The second step, delta encoding, makes the latents more independently and identically distributed. We prove that, given $k$ bins, binning uses only $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ bits more than the SIID data's entropy. Additionally, we demonstrate that Pco achieves 29-94% higher compression ratio than other approaches on six real-world datasets while using less compression time.</description>

      <title>Token-Domain Multiple Access: Exploiting Semantic Orthogonality for Collision Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Token communications is an emerging generative semantic communication concept that reduces transmission rates by using context and transformer-based token processing, with tokens serving as universal semantic units. In this paper, we propose a semantic multiple access scheme in the token domain, referred to as ToDMA, where a large number of devices share a tokenizer and a modulation codebook for source and channel coding, respectively. Specifically, the source signal is tokenized into sequences, with each token modulated into a codeword. Codewords from multiple devices are transmitted simultaneously, resulting in overlap at the receiver. The receiver detects the transmitted tokens, assigns them to their respective sources, and mitigates token collisions by leveraging context and semantic orthogonality across the devices' messages. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed ToDMA framework outperforms context-unaware orthogonal and non-orthogonal communication methods in image transmission tasks, achieving lower latency and better image quality.</description>

      <title>Product gales and Finite state dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the notion of product gales, which is the modification of an $s$-gale such that $k$ separate bets can be placed at each symbol. The product of the bets placed are taken into the capital function of the product-gale. We show that Hausdorff dimension can be characterised using product gales.
  A $k$-bet finite-state gambler is one that can place $k$ separate bets at each symbol. We call the notion of finite-state dimension, characterized by product gales induced by $k$-bet finite-state gamblers, as multi-bet finite-state dimension. Bourke, Hitchcock and Vinodchandran gave an equivalent characterisation of finite state dimension by disjoint block entropy rates. We show that multi-bet finite state dimension can be characterised using sliding block entropy rates. Further, we show that multi-bet finite state dimension can also be charatcterised by disjoint block entropy rates.
  Hence we show that finite state dimension and multi-bet finite state dimension are the same notions, thereby giving a new characterisation of finite state dimension using $k$-bet finite state $s$-gales. We also provide a proof of equivalence between sliding and disjoint block entropy rates, providing an alternate, automata based proof of the result by Kozachinskiy, and Shen.</description>

      <title>On the Reliability of Information Retrieval From MDS Coded Data in DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a theoretical analysis of the probability of successfully retrieving data encoded with MDS codes (e.g., Reed-Solomon codes) in DNA storage systems. We study this probability under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) substitution errors, focusing on a common code design strategy that combines inner and outer MDS codes. Our analysis demonstrates how this probability depends on factors such as the total number of sequencing reads, their distribution across strands, the rates of the inner and outer codes, and the substitution error probabilities. These results provide actionable insights into optimizing DNA storage systems under reliability constraints, including determining the minimum number of sequencing reads needed for reliable data retrieval and identifying the optimal balance between the rates of inner and outer MDS codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to derive exact cumulant expressions of any order of von Neumann entropy over Hilbert-Schmidt ensemble. The new method uncovers hidden cumulant structures that decouple each cumulant in a summation-free manner into its lower-order joint cumulants involving families of ancillary statistics. Importantly, the new method is able to avoid the seemingly inevitable task of simplifying nested summations of increasing difficulty that prevents the existing method in the literature to obtain higher-order cumulants.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Differential Privacy on Correlated Datasets Using Pointwise Maximal Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven advancements significantly contribute to societal progress, yet they also pose substantial risks to privacy. In this landscape, differential privacy (DP) has become a cornerstone in privacy preservation efforts. However, the adequacy of DP in scenarios involving correlated datasets has sometimes been questioned and multiple studies have hinted at potential vulnerabilities. In this work, we delve into the nuances of applying DP to correlated datasets by leveraging the concept of pointwise maximal leakage (PML) for a quantitative assessment of information leakage. Our investigation reveals that DP's guarantees can be arbitrarily weak for correlated databases when assessed through the lens of PML. More precisely, we prove the existence of a pure DP mechanism with PML levels arbitrarily close to that of a mechanism which releases individual entries from a database without any perturbation. By shedding light on the limitations of DP on correlated datasets, our work aims to foster a deeper understanding of subtle privacy risks and highlight the need for the development of more effective privacy-preserving mechanisms tailored to diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>Machine Unlearning via Information Theoretic Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can we effectively remove or "unlearn" undesirable information, such as specific features or individual data points, from a learning outcome while minimizing utility loss and ensuring rigorous guarantees? We introduce a mathematical framework based on information-theoretic regularization to address both feature and data point unlearning. For feature unlearning, we derive a unified solution that simultaneously optimizes diverse learning objectives, including entropy, conditional entropy, KL-divergence, and the energy of conditional probability. For data point unlearning, we first propose a novel definition that serves as a practical condition for unlearning via retraining, is easy to verify, and aligns with the principles of differential privacy from an inference perspective. Then, we provide provable guarantees for our framework on data point unlearning. By combining flexibility in learning objectives with simplicity in regularization design, our approach is highly adaptable and practical for a wide range of machine learning and AI applications.</description>

      <title>Interactive Inference: A Neuromorphic Theory of Human-Computer Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic HCI is a new theoretical approach to designing better UX inspired by the neurophysiology of the brain. Here, we apply the neuroscientific theory of Active Inference to HCI, postulating that users perform Bayesian inference on progress and goal distributions to predict their next action (Interactive Inference). We show how Bayesian surprise between goal and progress distributions follows a mean square error function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the task. However, capacity to process Bayesian surprise follows the logarithm of SNR, and errors occur when average capacity is exceeded. Our model allows the quantitative analysis of performance and error in one framework with real-time estimation of mental load. We show through mathematical theorems how three basic laws of HCI, Hick's Law, Fitts' Law and the Power Law fit our model. We then test the validity of the general model by empirically measuring how well it predicts human performance in a car following task. Results suggest that driver processing capacity indeed is a logarithmic function of the SNR of the distance to a lead car. This positive result provides initial evidence that Interactive Interference can work as a new theoretical underpinning for HCI, deserving further exploration.</description>

      <title>Pre-Equalization Aided Grant-Free Massive Access in Massive MIMO System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial diversity and multiplexing advantages of massive multi-input-multi-output (mMIMO) can significantly improve the capacity of massive non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in machine type communications. However, state-of-the-art grant-free massive NOMA schemes for mMIMO systems require accurate estimation of random access channels to perform activity detection and the following coherent data demodulation, which suffers from excessive pilot overhead and access latency. To address this, we propose a pre-equalization aided grant-free massive access scheme for mMIMO systems, where an iterative detection scheme is conceived. Specifically, the base station (BS) firstly activates one of its antennas (i.e., beacon antenna) to broadcast a beacon signal, which facilitates the user equipment (UEs) to perform downlink channel estimation and pre-equalize the uplink random access signal with respect to the channels associated with the beacon antenna. During the uplink transmission stage, the BS detects UEs' activity and data by using the proposed iterative detection algorithm, which consists of three modules: coarse data detection (DD), data-aided channel estimation (CE), and fine DD. In the proposed algorithm, the joint activity and DD is firstly performed based on the signals received by the beacon antenna. Subsequently, the DD is further refined by iteratively performing data-aided CE module and fine DD module using signals received by all BS antennas. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art mMIMO-based grant-free massive NOMA schemes with the same access latency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In stabilizer-based quantum secret sharing schemes, it is known that some shares can be distributed to participants before a secret is given to the dealer. This distribution is known as advance sharing. It is already known that a set of shares is advance shareable only if it is a forbidden set. However, it was not known whether any forbidden set is advance shareable. We provide an example of a set of shares such that it is a forbidden set but is not advance shareable in the previous scheme. Furthermore, we propose a quantum secret sharing scheme for quantum secrets such that any forbidden set is advance shareable.</description>

Abstract: We propose an iterative algorithm for computing the Petz-Augustin information of order $\alpha\in(1/2,1)\cup(1,\infty)$. The optimization error is guaranteed to converge at a rate of $O\left(\vert 1-1/\alpha \vert^T\right)$, where $T$ is the number of iterations. Let $n$ denote the cardinality of the input alphabet of the classical-quantum channel, and $d$ the dimension of the quantum states. The algorithm has an initialization time complexity of $O\left(n d^{3}\right)$ and a per-iteration time complexity of $O\left(n d^{2}+d^3\right)$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm for computing the Petz-Augustin information with a non-asymptotic convergence guarantee.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a refinement to the convex split lemma by replacing the max mutual information with the collision mutual information, transforming the inequality into an equality. This refinement yields tighter achievability bounds for quantum source coding tasks, including state merging and state splitting. Furthermore, we derive a universal upper bound on the smoothed max mutual information, where "universal" signifies that the bound depends exclusively on R\'enyi entropies and is independent of the system's dimensions. This result has significant implications for quantum information processing, particularly in applications such as the reverse quantum Shannon theorem.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the recovery of nodes and amplitudes from noisy frequency samples in spike train signals, also known as the super-resolution (SR) problem. When the node separation falls below the Rayleigh limit, the problem becomes ill-conditioned. Admissible sampling rates, or decimation parameters, improve the conditioning of the SR problem, enabling more accurate recovery. We propose an efficient preprocessing method to identify the optimal sampling rate, significantly enhancing the performance of SR techniques.</description>

      <title>Quantile Multi-Armed Bandits with 1-bit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a variant of best-arm identification involving elements of risk sensitivity and communication constraints. Specifically, the goal of the learner is to identify the arm with the highest quantile reward, while the communication from an agent (who observes rewards) and the learner (who chooses actions) is restricted to only one bit of feedback per arm pull. We propose an algorithm that utilizes noisy binary search as a subroutine, allowing the learner to estimate quantile rewards through 1-bit feedback. We derive an instance-dependent upper bound on the sample complexity of our algorithm and provide an algorithm-independent lower bound for specific instances, with the two matching to within logarithmic factors under mild conditions, or even to within constant factors in certain low error probability scaling regimes. The lower bound is applicable even in the absence of communication constraints, and thus we conclude that restricting to 1-bit feedback has a minimal impact on the scaling of the sample complexity.</description>

Exact enumeration results are derived for these families of codes with the prescribed hull dimension. These formulas, in turn, are the most used tools to prove the good behavior of double circulant and four circulant codes asymptotically. Computational results on the code families in consideration are provided as well.</description>

      <title>Novel Joint Estimation and Decoding Metrics for Short-Block length Transmission Systems</title>

Abstract: This paper presents Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation metrics for joint estimation detection using training or reference signal transmission strategies for short to long block length channels. We show that it is possible to enhance the performance and sensitivity through joint detection-estimation compared to standard receivers, especially when the channel state information is unknown and the density of the training dimensions is low. The performance analysis makes use of a full 5G transmitter and receiver chains for both Polar and LDPC coded transmissions paired with BPSK/QPSK modulation schemes. We consider transmissions where reference signals are interleaved with data and both are transmitted over a small number of OFDM symbols so that near-perfect channel estimation cannot be achieved. This is particularly adapted to mini-slot transmissions for ultra-reliable, low-latency communications (URLLC) or for short packet random access use cases. We characterize the performance for up to eight receiving antennas in order to determine the performance gain offered by the proposed BICM detection in realistic base station receiver scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that when the detection windows used in the metric units is on the order of four modulated symbols the proposed BICM metrics can be used to achieve detection performance that is close to that of a coherent receiver with perfect channel state information for both polar and LDPC coded configurations. Furthermore, we show that for transmissions with low DMRS density, a good trade-off can be achieved in terms of additional coding gain and improved channel estimation quality by adaptive DMRS power adjustment.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Low-Complexity Receiver Design for Short Block Transmission Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis and performance enhancement of short block length channel detection incorporating training information. The current communication systems' short block length channel detection typically consists of least squares channel estimation followed by quasi-coherent detection. By investigating the receiver structure, specifically the estimator-correlator, we show that the non-coherent term, often disregarded in conventional detection metrics, results in significant losses in performance and sensitivity in typical operating regimes of 5G and 6G systems. A comparison with the fully non-coherent receiver in multi-antenna configurations reveals substantial losses in low spectral efficiency operating areas. Additionally, we demonstrate that by employing an adaptive DMRS-data power adjustment, it is possible to reduce the performance loss gap, which is amenable to a more sensitive quasi-coherent receiver. However, both of the aforementioned ML detection strategies can result in substantial computational complexity when processing long bit-length codes. We propose an approach to tackle this challenge by introducing the principle of block or segment coding using First-Order RM Codes, which is amenable to low-cost decoding through block-based fast Hadamard transforms. The Block-based FHT has demonstrated to be cost-efficient with regards to decoding time, as it evolves from quadric to quasi-linear complexity with a manageable decline in performance. Additionally, by incorporating an adaptive DMRS-data power adjustment technique, we are able to bridge/reduce the performance gap with respect to the conventional maximum likelihood receiver and attain high sensitivity, leading to a good trade-off between performance and complexity to efficiently handle small payloads.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents low-complexity block-based encoding and decoding algorithms for short block length channels. In terms of the precise use-case, we are primarily concerned with the baseline 3GPP Short block transmissions in which payloads are encoded by Reed-Muller codes and paired with orthogonal DMRS. In contemporary communication systems, the short block decoding often employs the utilization of DMRS-based least squares channel estimation, followed by maximum likelihood decoding. However, this methodology can incur substantial computational complexity when processing long bit length codes. We propose an innovative approach to tackle this challenge by introducing the principle of block/segment encoding using First-Order RM Codes which is amenable to low-cost decoding through block-based fast Hadamard transforms. The Block-based FHT has demonstrated to be cost-efficient with regards to decoding time, as it evolves from quadric to quasi-linear complexity with a manageable decline in performance. Additionally, by incorporating an adaptive DMRS/data power adjustment technique, we can bridge/reduce the performance gap and attain high sensitivity, leading to a good trade-off between performance and complexity to efficiently handle small payloads.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is recognized as one of the key enabling technologies for sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication networks, facilitating diverse emerging applications and services in an energy and cost-efficient manner. This paper proposes a multi-user multi-target ISAC system to enable full-space coverage for communication and sensing tasks. The proposed system employs a hybrid simultaneous transmission and reflection reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) comprising active transmissive and passive reflective elements. In the proposed scheme, the passive reflective elements support communication and sensing links for local communication users and sensing targets situated within the same physical region as the base station (BS), while low-power active transmissive elements are deployed to improve sensing performance and overcome high path attenuation due to multi-hop transmission for distant communication users and sensing targets situated far from of the coverage area of the BS. Moreover, to optimize the transmissive/reflective coefficients of the hybrid STAR-RIS, a semi-definite relaxation (SDR)-based algorithm is proposed. Furthermore, to evaluate communication and sensing performance, signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) and Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) metrics have been derived and investigated via conducting extensive computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) System Level Simulations for Industry Standards</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is an emerging technology for wireless communications. In this paper, extensive system level simulations are conducted for analyzing the performance of multi-RIS and multi-base-station (BS) scenarios, by considering typical settings for industry standards. Pathloss and large-scale fading are taken into account when modeling the RIS cascaded and direct links. The performance metrics considered are the downlink reference signal received power (RSRP) and the signal to interference noise ratio (SINR). The evaluation methodology is compatible with that utilized for technology studies in industry standards development organizations, by considering the uniqueness of RIS. The simulations are comprehensive, and they take into account different layouts of RIS panels and mobiles in a cell, and different densities and sizes of RIS panels. Several practical aspects are considered, including the interference between RIS panels, the phase quantization of RIS elements, and the failure of RIS elements. The impact of near field effects for the RIS-mobile links is analyzed as well. Simulation results demonstrate the potential of RIS-aided deployments in improving the system capacity and cell coverage in 6G mobile systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study cooperation problems in broadcast and relay networks, where the receivers do not satisfy the classical physical degradedness assumptions. New notions of degradedness, strongly less noisy and strongly more capable are introduced. We show that under these conditions, decode and forward (D&amp;F) is optimal for classes of cooperative systems with limited conference rates, thus yielding new capacity results for these systems. In particular, we derive bounds on the capacity region of a class of broadcast channels with cooperation, that are tight on part of the capacity region. It is shown that the cut-set bound is tight for classes of primitive relay and diamond channels, beyond the physically or stochastically degraded models.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Fluid Antenna Multiple Access Assisted Wireless Powered Communication Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA)-assisted wireless powered communication network (WPCN), in which a hybrid access point (HAP) equipped with multiple fixed position antennas (FPAs) provides integrated data and energy transfer (IDET) services towards low-power devices that are equipped with a single fluid antenna (FA), while the low-power devices use harvested energy to power their own uplink transmission. Using the block correlation channel model, both the downlink and uplink wireless data transfer (WDT) outage probabilities are analyzed under specific port selection strategies, including downlink signal-to-interference ratio-based port selection (DSPS) strategy, downlink energy harvesting power-based port selection (DEPS) strategy, uplink signal-to-noise ratio-based port selection (USPS) strategy, and uplink channel-based port selection (UCPS) strategy. A step function approximation (SFA) approach is also relied upon to derive closed-form expressions for the outage probabilities, while the lower bounds for uplink WDT outage probabilities are also formulated. Numerical results demonstrate the validity of our theoretical analysis, which also provide useful guidelines for the system design through the analytical framework.</description>

      <title>Reed-Muller Codes on CQ Channels via a New Correlation Bound for Quantum Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The question of whether Reed-Muller (RM) codes achieve capacity on binary memoryless symmetric (BMS) channels has drawn attention since it was resolved positively for the binary erasure channel by Kudekar et al. in 2016. In 2021, Reeves and Pfister extended this to prove the bit-error probability vanishes on BMS channels when the code rate is less than capacity. In 2023, Abbe and Sandon improved this to show the block-error probability also goes to zero. These results analyze decoding functions using symmetry and the nested structure of RM codes. In this work, we focus on binary-input symmetric classical-quantum (BSCQ) channels and the Holevo capacity. For a BSCQ, we consider observables that estimate the channel input in the sense of minimizing the mean-squared error (MSE). Using the orthogonal decomposition of these observables under a weighted inner product, we establish a recursive relation for the minimum MSE estimate of a single bit in the RM code. Our results show that any set of $2^{o(\sqrt{\log N})}$ bits can be decoded with a high probability when the code rate is less than the Holevo capacity.</description>

      <title>Rate of convergence of the smoothed empirical Wasserstein distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.02128v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider an empirical measure $\mathbb{P}_n$ induced by $n$ iid samples from a $d$-dimensional $K$-subgaussian distribution $\mathbb{P}$ and let $\gamma = N(0,\sigma^2 I_d)$ be the isotropic Gaussian measure. We study the speed of convergence of the smoothed Wasserstein distance $W_2(\mathbb{P}_n * \gamma, \mathbb{P}*\gamma) = n^{-\alpha + o(1)}$ with $*$ being the convolution of measures. For $K&lt;\sigma$ and in any dimension $d\ge 1$ we show that $\alpha = {1\over2}$. For $K&gt;\sigma$ in dimension $d=1$ we show that the rate is slower and is given by $\alpha = {(\sigma^2 + K^2)^2\over 4 (\sigma^4 + K^4)} &lt; 1/2$. This resolves several open problems in [GGNWP20], and in particular precisely identifies the amount of smoothing $\sigma$ needed to obtain a parametric rate. In addition, for any $d$-dimensional $K$-subgaussian distribution $\mathbb{P}$, we also establish that $D_{KL}(\mathbb{P}_n * \gamma \|\mathbb{P}*\gamma)$ has rate $O(1/n)$ for $K&lt;\sigma$ but only slows down to $O({(\log n)^{d+1}\over n})$ for $K&gt;\sigma$. The surprising difference of the behavior of $W_2^2$ and KL implies the failure of $T_{2}$-transportation inequality when $\sigma &lt; K$. Consequently, it follows that for $K&gt;\sigma$ the log-Sobolev inequality (LSI) for the Gaussian mixture $\mathbb{P} * N(0, \sigma^{2})$ cannot hold. This closes an open problem in [WW+16], who established the LSI under the condition $K&lt;\sigma$ and asked if their bound can be improved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a generalization of one-way superdense coding to two-way communication protocols for transmitting classical bits by using entangled quantum pairs. The proposed protocol jointly addresses the provision of entangled pairs and superdense coding, introducing an integrated approach for managing entanglement within the communication protocol. To assess the performance of the proposed protocol, we consider its data rate and resource usage, and we analyze this both in an ideal setting with no decoherence and in a more realistic setting where decoherence must be taken into account. In the ideal case, the proposal offers a 50% increase in both data rate and resource usage efficiency compared to conventional protocols. Even when decoherence is taken into consideration, the quantum protocol performs better as long as the decoherence time is not extremely short. Finally, we present the results of implementing the protocol in a computer simulation based on the NetSquid framework. We compare the simulation results with the theoretical values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The potential synergy between quantum communications and future wireless communication systems is explored. By proposing a quantum-native or quantum-by-design philosophy, the survey examines technologies such as quantumdomain (QD) multi-input multi-output, QD non-orthogonal multiple access, quantum secure direct communication, QD resource allocation, QD routing, and QD artificial intelligence. The recent research advances in these areas are summarized. Given the behavior of photonic and particle-like Terahertz (THz) systems, a comprehensive system-oriented perspective is adopted to assess the feasibility of using quantum communications in future systems. This survey also reviews quantum optimization algorithms and quantum neural networks to explore the potential integration of quantum communication and quantum computing in future systems. Additionally, the current status of quantum sensing, quantum radar, and quantum timing is briefly reviewed in support of future applications. The associated research gaps and future directions are identified, including extending the entanglement coherence time, developing THz quantum communications devices, addressing challenges in channel estimation and tracking, and establishing the theoretical bounds and performance trade-offs of quantum communication, computing, and sensing. This survey offers a unique perspective on the potential for quantum communications to revolutionize future systems and pave the way for even more advanced technologies.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Dependence of Samples along the Langevin Dynamics and Algorithms via Contraction of $\Phi$-Mutual Information</title>

Abstract: The mixing time of a Markov chain determines how fast the iterates of the Markov chain converge to the stationary distribution; however, it does not control the dependencies between samples along the Markov chain. In this paper, we study the question of how fast the samples become approximately independent along popular Markov chains for continuous-space sampling: the Langevin dynamics in continuous time, and the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm and the Proximal Sampler in discrete time. We measure the dependence between samples via $\Phi$-mutual information, which is a broad generalization of the standard mutual information, and which is equal to $0$ if and only if the the samples are independent. We show that along these Markov chains, the $\Phi$-mutual information between the first and the $k$-th iterate decreases to $0$ exponentially fast in $k$ when the target distribution is strongly log-concave. Our proof technique is based on showing the Strong Data Processing Inequalities (SDPIs) hold along the Markov chains. To prove fast mixing of the Markov chains, we only need to show the SDPIs hold for the stationary distribution. In contrast, to prove the contraction of $\Phi$-mutual information, we need to show the SDPIs hold along the entire trajectories of the Markov chains; we prove this when the iterates along the Markov chains satisfy the corresponding $\Phi$-Sobolev inequality, which is implied by the strong log-concavity of the target distribution.</description>

      <title>Self-Regulating Random Walks for Resilient Decentralized Learning on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the setting of multiple random walks (RWs) on a graph executing a certain computational task. For instance, in decentralized learning via RWs, a model is updated at each iteration based on the local data of the visited node and then passed to a randomly chosen neighbor. RWs can fail due to node or link failures. The goal is to maintain a desired number of RWs to ensure failure resilience. Achieving this is challenging due to the lack of a central entity to track which RWs have failed to replace them with new ones by forking (duplicating) surviving ones. Without duplications, the number of RWs will eventually go to zero, causing a catastrophic failure of the system. We propose two decentralized algorithms called DecAFork and DecAFork+ that can maintain the number of RWs in the graph around a desired value even in the presence of arbitrary RW failures. Nodes continuously estimate the number of surviving RWs by estimating their return time distribution and fork the RWs when failures are likely to happen. DecAFork+ additionally allows terminations to avoid overloading the network by forking too many RWs. We present extensive numerical simulations that show the performance of DecAFork and DecAFork+ regarding fast detection and reaction to failures compared to a baseline, and establish theoretical guarantees on the performance of both algorithms.</description>

      <title>Variants of Solovay reducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Outside of the left-c.e. reals, Solovay reducibility is considered to be behaved badly [10.1007/978-0-387-68441-3]. Proposals for variants of Solovay reducibility that are better suited for the investigation of arbitrary, not necessarily left-c.e. reals were made by Rettinger and Zheng [10.1007/978-3-540-27798-9_39], and, recently, by Titov [10.11588/heidok.00034250] and by Kumabe and co-authors [10.4115/jla.2020.12.2; 10.3233/COM-230486]. These variants all coincide with the original version of Solovay reducibility on the left-c.e. reals. Furthermore, they are all defined in terms of translation functions. The latter translate between computable approximations in the case of Rettinger and Zheng, are monotone in the case of Titov, and are functions between reals in the case of Kumabe et al.
  Solovay reducibility and its variants mentioned so far have tight connections to Martin-L\"of randomness, the strongest and most central notion of a random sequence. For the investigation of Schnorr randomness, total variants of Solovay reducibility have been introduced by Merkle and Titov [10.48550/arXiv.2407.14869] in 2022 and, independently, by Kumabe et al. [10.3233/COM-230486] in 2024, the latter again via real-valued translation functions. In what follows, we show that total Solovay reducibility defined in terms of rational functions implies total Solovay reducibility defined in terms of real functions and is strictly stronger that the original version of Solovay reducibility.
  In what follows, we derive new results on the mentioned variants and their relation to each other. In particular, we obtain that Solovay reducibility defined in terms of translation function on rationals implies Solovay reducibility defined in terms of translation functions on reals, and we show that the original version of Solovay reducibility is strictly weaker than its monotone variant.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Time-Varying Kernelized Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimization of black-box functions with noisy observations is a fundamental problem with widespread applications, and has been widely studied under the assumption that the function lies in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). This problem has been studied extensively in the stationary setting, and near-optimal regret bounds are known via developments in both upper and lower bounds. In this paper, we consider non-stationary scenarios, which are crucial for certain applications but are currently less well-understood. Specifically, we provide the first algorithm-independent lower bounds, where the time variations are subject satisfying a total variation budget according to some function norm. Under $\ell_{\infty}$-norm variations, our bounds are found to be close to an existing upper bound (Hong et al., 2023). Under RKHS norm variations, the upper and lower bounds are still reasonably close but with more of a gap, raising the interesting open question of whether non-minor improvements in the upper bound are possible.</description>

      <title>Compressed Image Generation with Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel generative approach based on Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), which produces high-quality image samples along with their losslessly compressed bit-stream representations. This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</description>

      <title>A Variant of the Bravyi-Terhal Bound for Arbitrary Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a modified version of the Bravyi-Terhal bound that applies to quantum codes defined by local parity-check constraints on a $D$-dimensional lattice quotient. Specifically, we consider a quotient $\mathbb{Z}^D/\Lambda$ of $\mathbb{Z}^D$ of cardinality $n$, where $\Lambda$ is some $D$-dimensional sublattice of $\mathbb{Z}^D$: we suppose that every vertex of this quotient indexes $m$ qubits of a stabilizer code $C$, which therefore has length $nm$. We prove that if all stabilizer generators act on qubits whose indices lie within a ball of radius $\rho$, then the minimum distance $d$ of the code satisfies $d \leq m\sqrt{\gamma_D}(\sqrt{D} + 4\rho)n^\frac{D-1}{D}$ whenever $n^{1/D} \geq 8\rho\sqrt{\gamma_D}$, where $\gamma_D$ is the $D$-dimensional Hermite constant. We apply this bound to derive an upper bound on the minimum distance of Abelian Two-Block Group Algebra (2BGA) codes whose parity-check matrices have the form $[\mathbf{A} \, \vert \, \mathbf{B}]$ with each submatrix representing an element of a group algebra over a finite abelian group.</description>
