      <title>Study of acoustic neutrino detection in O$\nu$DE-2 raw acoustic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research suggests that acoustic technology may be able to detect ultra-high-energy neutrinos if a large amount of non-linear fluid is analyzed. When a neutrino interacts in water, it creates a quasi-instantaneous cascade of particles, heating that region of the fluid and emitting a tiny acoustic signal. This rapid heating produces a thermoacoustic Bipolar Pulse (BP) with unique characteristics such as a wide bandwidth and a narrow directivity for these frequencies. While dedicated devices for acoustic neutrino detection are currently non-existent, there are a few underwater neutrino telescopes that utilize optical technology, but often with an acoustic positioning system that deploys hydrophones in the infrastructure. The possibility of using them to study a BP caused by a neutrino interaction is currently being discussed. This study aims to evaluate the implementation of a trigger system to detect a possible BP in deep-sea hydrophones. For this, up to 24 hours of the raw acoustic signal recorded by the O$\nu$DE-2 station, which was located 25 km off-shore from Catania in the Western Ionian Sea, at 2100 m depth, is analyzed. The station used calibrated hydrophones from a few Hz to 70 kHz. In this work, a synthetic BP is created and added to the experimental data, allowing the study of its detection and the calculation of precision and recall.</description>

      <title>4D-Tracking with Digital SiPMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) are the state-of-the-art technology in single-photon detection with solid-state detectors. Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs), the key element of SiPMs, can now be manufactured in CMOS processes, facilitating the integration of a SPAD array into custom monolithic ASICs. This allows implementing features such as signal digitization, masking, full hit-map readout, noise suppression, and photon counting in a monolithic CMOS chip. The complexity of the off-chip readout chain is thereby reduced.
  These new features allow new applications for digital SiPMs, such as 4D-tracking of charged particles, where spatial resolutions of the order of $10 \mu m$ and timestamping with time resolutions of a few tens of ps are required.
  A prototype of a digital SiPM was designed at DESY using the LFoundry $150 nm$ CMOS technology. Various studies were carried out in the laboratory and at the DESY II test-beam facility to evaluate the sensor performance in Minimum Ionizing Particles (MIPs) detection. The direct detection of charged particles was investigated for bare prototypes and assemblies coupling dSiPMs and thin LYSO crystals. Spatial resolution $\sim20 \mu m$ and a full-system time resolution of $\sim50 ps$ are measured using bare dSiPMs in direct MIP detection. Efficiency $&gt;99.5 \%$, low noise rate and time resolution $&lt;1 ns$ can be reached with the thin radiator coupling.</description>

      <title>Detections of He-3 in Ni-based binary metal nanocomposites with Cu in zirconia exposed to hydrogen gas at elevated temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study aims to detect helium-3 in nickel-based metal nano-composites doped with zirconia, which exhibited anomalous heat generation when exposed to hydrogen gas at approximately 450{\deg}C. Two complementary analytical techniques were employed: Nuclear Reaction Analysis (NRA) utilizing 1.4 MeV deuteron beams from a tandem accelerator, and Thermal Desorption Spectrometry (TDS) using a quadrupole mass spectrometer. Both methods successfully detected helium-3 in the samples. Given the extreme rarity of this isotope, its presence strongly suggests the occurrence of nuclear reactions within the nickel-containing materials. These findings lend support to the 4H/TSC (4 Hydrogen/Tetrahedral Symmetric Condensate) model, which uniquely predicts helium-3 as one of the primary reaction products.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of TAO DAQ System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO) is a satellite experiment of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), also known as JUNO-TAO. Located close to one of the reactors of the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant, TAO will measure the antineutrino energy spectrum precisely as a reference spectrum for JUNO. The data acquisition (DAQ) system is designed to acquire data from the TAO readout electronics and process it with software trigger and data compression algorithms. The data storage bandwidth is limited by the onsite network to be less than 100 Mb/s.
  Methods: The system is designed based on a distributed architecture, with fully decoupled modules to facilitate customized design and implementation. It is divided into two main components: the data flow system and the online software. The online software serves as the foundation, providing the electronics configuration, the process management, the run control, and the information sharing. The data flow system facilitates continuous data acquisition from various electronic boards or trigger systems, assembles and processes raw data, and ultimately stores it on the disk.
  Results: The core functionality of the system has been designed and developed. The usability of the data flow system interface and the software trigger results have been verified during the pre-installation testing phase.
  Conclusion: The DAQ system has been deployed for the TAO experiment. It has also successfully been applied to the integration test of the detector and electronics prototypes.</description>

      <title>Finite Element Analysis of the Uncertainty Contribution from Mechanical Imperfections in the LNE's Thompson-Lampard Calculable Capacitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thompson-Lampard type calculable capacitors (TLCC) serve as electrical capacitance standards, enabling the realization of the farad in the International System of Units (SI) with a combined uncertainty on the order of one part in $10^8$. This paper presents an electrostatic finite element (FEM) simulation study focusing on the mechanical imperfections inherent in the developed second generation TLCC at LNE and their influence on the combined uncertainty of the practical realization of the farad. In particular, this study establishes the acceptable tolerances for deviations from perfect geometrical arrangements of the TLCC electrodes required to achieve the target relative uncertainty of one part in $10^8$. The simulation predictions are compared with corresponding experimental observations which were conducted with the help of the sub-micron level control of the standard's electrode geometry. In the second generation of the LNE's TLCC, the uncertainty contribution from mechanical imperfections was reduced by at least a factor of 4, as demonstrated by the present FEM analysis. Combined with other improvements, the standard's overall uncertainty meets the target level.</description>

      <title>10$^{-15}$-level laser stabilization down to fiber thermal noise limit using balanced photodetection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a self-homodyne detection method to stabilize a continuous-wave 1550-nm laser to a 1-km optical fiber delay line, achieving a frequency instability of 6.3x10&lt;sup&gt;-15&lt;/sup&gt; at a 16-ms averaging time. This result, limited by fiber thermal noise, is achieved without the need for a vacuum system, highlighting the potential of our approach for ultra-stable laser systems in non-laboratory environments. The system utilizes only a few passive fiber optic components and a single balanced photodetector, significantly simplifying the laser stabilization process while maintaining high performance. The entire optical setup is compactly packaged in a portable metal air-tight enclosure.</description>

      <title>Characterization of resonator using confocal laser scanning microscopy and its application in air density sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the characterization of the photonic waveguide resonator using confocal laser scanning microscopy imaging method. Free space TEM$_{00}$ laser mode is coupled into quasi-TE$_{0}$ waveguide mode using confocal microscopy via a diffractive grating coupler and vice versa. Our work includes the design, fabrication, and experimental characterization of a silicon nitride racetrack-shaped resonator of length ~ 165 um. We illustrate clear evidence of resonance excitation from the confocal microscope image and demonstrate loaded Q-factor and finesse ~ 8.2 \pm 0.17 * 10^4 and ~ 180 \pm 3.5, respectively. We further demonstrate its one application in air density sensing by measuring the resonance wavelength shifts with variation in environment air pressure. Our work impacts spectroscopy, imaging, and sensing applications of single or ensemble atoms or molecules coupled to photonic devices. Additionally, our study highlights the potential of confocal microscopy for analyzing photonic components on large-scale integrated circuits, providing high-resolution imaging and spectral characterization.</description>

      <title>Image color consistency in datasets: the Smooth-TPS3D method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image color consistency is the key problem in digital imaging consistency when creating datasets. Here, we propose an improved 3D Thin-Plate Splines (TPS3D) color correction method to be used, in conjunction with color charts (i.e. Macbeth ColorChecker) or other machine-readable patterns, to achieve image consistency by post-processing. Also, we benchmark our method against its former implementation and the alternative methods reported to date with an augmented dataset based on the Gehler's ColorChecker dataset. Benchmark includes how corrected images resemble the ground-truth images and how fast these implementations are. Results demonstrate that the TPS3D is the best candidate to achieve image consistency. Furthermore, our Smooth-TPS3D method shows equivalent results compared to the original method and reduced the 11-15% of ill-conditioned scenarios which the previous method failed to less than 1%. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Smooth-TPS method is 20% faster than the original method. Finally, we discuss how different methods offer different compromises between quality, correction accuracy and computational load.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Boron Concentration Measurement in BNCT Using Compton Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dosimetry in BNCT poses significant challenges due to the indirect effect of neutrons interacting with elements within the body and uncertainties associated with the uptake of boron compounds used in clinical practice. Current treatment planning relies on unconventional estimates of boron tumor uptake derived from prior PET scans and thus, an online boron-uptake monitor would be highly convenient. This work presents the first pilot experiments carried out at ILL-Grenoble with the high-efficiency Compton camera i-TED, hereby aiming at demonstrating its applicability for BNCT dosimetry by introducing real-time measurement of the boron concentration and imaging capabilities of spatial dose distribution. In this experiment, we measured the $^{10}$B uptake of different cancer cells of tongue squamous cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma and glioblastoma treated with BPA (80~ppm of $^{10}$B). The samples were irradiated with the thermal neutron spectrum of ILL-Grenoble and the 478keV $\gamma$-rays from the $^{7}$Li de-excitation after the neutron-boron reaction were registered both with the Compton imager and the high-sensitivity FIPPS HPGe array. These series of measurements allowed us to demonstrate the imaging capabilities of the Compton imaging device for this type of application, as well as to assess its sensitivity, which was found to be below 1 $\mu$g of $^{10}$B.</description>

      <title>X-ray Microscopy and Talbot Imaging with the Matter in Extreme Conditions X-ray Imager at LCLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The last decade has shown the great potential that X-ray Free Electron Lasers (FEL) have to study High Energy Density matter. Experiments at FELs have made significant breakthroughs in Shock Physics and Dynamic Diffraction, Dense Plasma Physics and Warm Dense Matter Science, using techniques such as isochoric heating, inelastic scattering, small angle scattering and x-ray diffraction. In addition, and complementary to these techniques, the coherent properties of the FEL beam can be used to image HED samples with high fidelity. We present new imaging diagnostics and techniques developed at the Matter in Extreme Conditions (MEC) instrument at Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) over the last few years. We show result of a previously used Phase Contrast Imaging setup, where the X-ray beam propagates from the target to a camera some distance away revealing its phase, as well as a imaging approach where the target is re-imaged on the camera with 300nm resolution. Last, we show a new Talbot Imaging method allowing both x-ray phase and intensity measurements change introduced by a target with sub-micron resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the world's first SPAD family design in 130 nm SiGe BiCMOS process. At 1.8um, we achieved the smallest pitch on record thanks to guard-ring sharing techniques, while keeping a relatively high fill factor of 24.2%. 4x4 SPAD arrays with two parallel selective readout circuits were designed to explore crosstalk and scalability. The SPAD family has a minimum breakdown voltage of 11 V, a maximum PDP of 40.6% and a typical timing jitter of 47 ps FWHM. The development of silicon SPADs in SiGe process paves the way to Ge-on-Si SPADs for SWIR applications, and to cryogenic optical interfaces for quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network-Based Track Finding in the LHCb Vertex Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next decade will see an order of magnitude increase in data collected by high-energy physics experiments, driven by the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The reconstruction of charged particle trajectories (tracks) has always been a critical part of offline data processing pipelines. The complexity of HL-LHC data will however increasingly mandate track finding in all stages of an experiment's real-time processing. This paper presents a GNN-based track-finding pipeline tailored for the Run 3 LHCb experiment's vertex detector and benchmarks its physics performance and computational cost against existing classical algorithms on GPU architectures. A novelty of our work compared to existing GNN tracking pipelines is batched execution, in which the GPU evaluates the pipeline on hundreds of events in parallel. We evaluate the impact of neural-network quantisation on physics and computational performance, and comment on the outlook for GNN tracking algorithms for other parts of the LHCb track-finding pipeline.</description>

      <title>Photon Counting Interferometry to Detect Geontropic Space-Time Fluctuations with GQuEST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The GQuEST (Gravity from the Quantum Entanglement of Space-Time) experiment uses tabletop-scale Michelson laser interferometers to probe for fluctuations in space-time. We present a practicable interferometer design featuring a novel photon counting readout method that provides unprecedented sensitivity, as it is not subject to the interferometric standard quantum limit. We evaluate the potential of this design to measure space-time fluctuations motivated by recent `geontropic' quantum gravity models. The accelerated accrual of Fisher information offered by the photon counting readout enables GQuEST to detect the predicted quantum gravity phenomena within measurement times at least 100 times shorter than equivalent conventional interferometers. The GQuEST design thus enables a fast and sensitive search for signatures of quantum gravity in a laboratory-scale experiment.</description>

      <title>Performance of CMS muon reconstruction from proton-proton to heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of muon tracking, identification, triggering, momentum resolution, and momentum scale has been studied with the CMS detector at the LHC using data collected at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV in proton-proton (pp) and lead-lead (PbPb) collisions in 2017 and 2018, respectively, and at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV in proton-lead (pPb) collisions in 2016. Muon efficiencies, momentum resolutions, and momentum scales are compared by focusing on how the muon reconstruction performance varies from relatively small occupancy pp collisions to the larger occupancies of pPb collisions and, finally, to the highest track multiplicity PbPb collisions. We find the efficiencies of muon tracking, identification, and triggering to be above 90% throughout most of the track multiplicity range. The momentum resolution and scale are unaffected by the detector occupancy. The excellent muon reconstruction of the CMS detector enables precision studies across all available collision systems.</description>

      <title>Digital stabilization of an IQ modulator in the carrier suppressed single side-band (CS-SSB) mode for atom interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an all-digital method for stabilising the phase biases in an electro-optic I/Q modulator for carrier-suppressed single-sideband modulation. Building on the method presented in S. Wald \ea, Appl. Opt. \textbf{62}, 1-7 (2023), we use the Red Pitaya STEMlab 125-14 platform to digitally generate and demodulate an auxiliary radio-frequency tone whose beat with the optical carrier probes the I/Q modulator's phase imbalances. We implement a multiple-input, multiple-output integral feedback controller which accounts for unavoidable cross-couplings in the phase biases to lock the error signals at exactly zero where optical power fluctuations have no impact on phase stability. We demonstrate $&gt;23\,\rm dB$ suppression of the optical carrier relative to the desired sideband at $+3.4\,\rm GHz$ over a period of $15$ hours and over temperature variations of $20^\circ\rm C$.</description>
