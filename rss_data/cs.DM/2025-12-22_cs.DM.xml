      <title>A decomposition approach for large virtual network embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) is the core combinatorial problem of Network Slicing, a 5G technology which enables telecommunication operators to propose diverse service-dedicated virtual networks, embedded onto a common substrate network. VNE asks for a minimum-cost mapping of a virtual network on a substrate network, encompassing simultaneous node placement and edge routing decisions. On a benchmark of large virtual networks with realistic topologies we compiled, the state-of-the art heuristics often provide expensive solutions, or even fail to find a solution when resources are sparse. We introduce a new integer linear formulation together with a decomposition scheme based on an automatic partition of the virtual network. This results in a column generation approach whose pricing problems are also VNE problems. This method allows to compute better lower bounds than state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we devise an efficient Price-and-Branch heuristic for large instances.</description>

      <title>Nowhere-zero flow reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of nowhere-zero flow reconfiguration. The natural question is whether any two nowhere-zero $k$-flows of a given graph $G$ are connected by a sequence of nowhere-zero $k$-flows of $G$, such that any two consecutive flows in the sequence differ only on a cycle of $G$. We conjecture that any two nowhere-zero 5-flows in any 2-edge-connected graph are connected in this way. This can be seen as a reconfiguration variant of Tutte's 5-flow conjecture.
  We study this problem in the setting of integer flows and group flows, and show that the structure of groups affects the answer, contrary to the existence of nowhere-zero flows. We also highlight a duality with recoloring in planar graphs and deduce that any two nowhere-zero 7-flows in a planar graph are connected, among other results. Finally we show that for any graph $G$, there is an abelian group $A$ such that all nowhere-zero $A$-flows in $G$ are connected, which is a weak form of our original conjecture. We conclude with several problems and conjectures.</description>

      <title>A distance-free approach to generalized weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified theory of generalized weights for linear codes endowed with an arbitrary distance. Instead of relying on supports or anticodes, the weights of a code are defined via the intersections of the code with a chosen family of spaces, which we call a test family. The choice of test family determines the properties of the corresponding generalized weights and the characteristics of the code that they capture. In this general framework, we prove that generalized weights are weakly increasing and that certain subsequences are strictly increasing. We also prove a duality result reminiscent of Wei's Duality Theorem. The corresponding properties of generalized Hamming and rank-metric weights follow from our general results by selecting optimal anticodes as a test family. For sum-rank metric codes, we propose a test family that results in generalized weights that are closely connected to -- but not always the same as -- the usual generalized weights. This choice allows us to extend the known duality results for generalized sum-rank weights to some sum-rank-metric codes with a nonzero Hamming component. Finally, we explore a family of generalized weights obtained by intersecting the underlying code with MDS or MRD codes.</description>

      <title>Refining the Complexity Landscape of Speed Scaling: Hardness and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of scheduling jobs on a single speed-scalable processor with the objective of capturing the trade-off between the (weighted) flow time and the energy consumption. This trade-off has been extensively explored in the literature through a number of problem formulations that differ in the specific job characteristics and the precise objective function. Nevertheless, the computational complexity of four important problem variants has remained unresolved and was explicitly identified as an open question in prior work. In this paper, we settle the complexity of these variants.
  More specifically, we prove that the problem of minimizing the objective of total (weighted) flow time plus energy is NP-hard for the cases of (i) unit-weight jobs with arbitrary sizes, and (ii)~arbitrary-weight jobs with unit sizes. These results extend to the objective of minimizing the total (weighted) flow time subject to an energy budget and hold even when the schedule is required to adhere to a given priority ordering.
  In contrast, we show that when a completion-time ordering is provided, the same problem variants become polynomial-time solvable. The latter result highlights the subtle differences between priority and completion orderings for the problem.</description>

      <title>Plane Strong Connectivity Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of strong connectivity augmentation within plane oriented graphs.
  We show that deciding whether a plane oriented graph $D$ can be augmented with (any number of) arcs $X$ such that $D+X$ is strongly connected, but still plane and oriented, is NP-hard.
  This question becomes trivial within plane digraphs, like most connectivity augmentation problems without a budget constraint.
  The budgeted version, Plane Strong Connectivity Augmentation (PSCA) considers a plane oriented graph $D$ along with some integer $k$, and asks for an $X$ of size at most $k$ ensuring that $D+X$ is strongly connected, while remaining plane and oriented.
  Our main result is a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for PSCA, running in time $2^{O(k)} n^{O(1)}$.
  The cornerstone of our procedure is a structural result showing that, for any fixed $k$, each face admits a bounded number of partial solutions "dominating" all others.
  Then, our algorithm for PSCA combines face-wise branching with a Monte-Carlo reduction to the polynomial Minimum Dijoin problem, which we derandomize.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first FPT algorithm for a (hard) connectivity augmentation problem constrained by planarity.</description>

      <title>Extended formulations for induced tree and path polytopes of chordal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we give two extended space formulations, respectively, for the induced tree and path polytopes of chordal graphs with vertex and edge variables.
  These formulations are obtained by proving that the induced tree and path extended incidence vectors of chordal graphs form Hilbert basis. This also shows that both polytopes have the integer decomposition property in chordal graphs.
  Whereas the formulation for the induced tree polytope is easily seen to have a compact size, the system we provide for the induced path polytope has an exponential number of inequalities.
  We show which of these inequalities define facets and exhibit a superset of the facet-defining ones that can be enumerated in polynomial time. We show that for some graphs, the latter superset contains redundant inequalities.
  As corollaries, we obtain that the problems of finding an induced tree or path maximizing a linear function over the edges and vertices are solvable in polynomial time for the class of chordal graphs.</description>

      <title>Foundations for an Abstract Proof Theory in the Context of Horn Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel, logic-independent framework for the study of sequent-style proof systems, which covers a number of proof-theoretic formalisms and concrete proof systems that appear in the literature. In particular, we introduce a generalized form of sequents, dubbed 'g-sequents,' which are taken to be binary graphs of typical, Gentzen-style sequents. We then define a variety of 'inference rule types' as sets of operations that act over such objects, and define 'abstract (sequent) calculi' as pairs consisting of a set of g-sequents together with a finite set of operations. Our approach permits an analysis of how certain inference rule types interact in a general setting, demonstrating under what conditions rules of a specific type can be permuted with or simulated by others, and being applicable to any sequent-style proof system that fits within our framework. We then leverage our permutation and simulation results to establish generic calculus and proof transformation algorithms, which show that every abstract calculus can be effectively transformed into a lattice of polynomially equivalent abstract calculi. We determine the complexity of computing this lattice and compute the relative sizes of proofs and sequents within distinct calculi of a lattice. We recognize that top and bottom elements in lattices correspond to many known deep-inference nested sequent systems and labeled sequent systems (respectively) for logics characterized by Horn properties.</description>

      <title>Feedback Arc Sets and Feedback Arc Set Decompositions in Weighted and Unweighted Oriented Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06935v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $D=(V(D),A(D))$ be a digraph with at least one directed cycle. A set $F$ of arcs is a feedback arc set (FAS) if $D-F$ has no directed cycle. The FAS decomposition number ${\rm fasd}(D)$ of $D$ is the maximum number of pairwise disjoint FASs whose union is $A(D)$. The directed girth $g(D)$ of $D$ is the minimum length of a directed cycle of $D$. Note that ${\rm fasd}(D)\le g(D).$ The FAS decomposition number appears in the well-known and far-from-solved conjecture of Woodall (1978) stating that for every planar digraph $D$ with at least one directed cycle, ${\rm fasd}(D)=g(D).$ The degree of a vertex of $D$ is the sum of its in-degree and out-degree.
  Let $D$ be an arc-weighted digraph and let ${\rm fas}_w(D)$ denote the minimum weight of its FAS. In this paper, we study bounds on ${\rm fasd}(D)$, ${\rm fas}_w(D)$ and ${\rm fas}(D)$ for arc-weighted oriented graphs $D$ (i.e., digraphs without opposite arcs) with upper-bounded maximum degree $\Delta(D)$ and lower-bounded $g(D)$. Note that these parameters are related: ${\rm fas}_w(D)\le w(D)/{\rm fasd}(D)$, where $w(D)$ is the total weight of $D$, and ${\rm fas}(D)\le |A(D)|/{\rm fasd}(D).$ In particular, we prove the following: (i) If $\Delta(D)\leq~4$ and $g(D)\geq 3$, then ${\rm fasd}(D) \geq 3$ and therefore ${\rm fas}_w(D)\leq \frac{w(D)}{3}$ which generalizes a known tight bound for an unweighted oriented graph with maximum degree at most 4; (ii) If $\Delta(D)\leq 3$ and $g(D)\in \{3,4,5\}$, then ${\rm fasd}(D)=g(D)$; (iii) If $\Delta(D)\leq 3$ and $g(D)\ge 8$ then ${\rm fasd}(D)&lt;g(D).$ We also give some bounds for the cases when $\Delta$ or $g$ are large and state several open problems and a conjecture.</description>

      <title>Going deep and going wide: Counting logic and homomorphism indistinguishability over graphs of bounded treedepth and treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the expressive power of first-order logic with counting quantifiers, especially the $k$-variable and quantifier-rank-$q$ fragment $\mathsf{C}^k_q$, using homomorphism indistinguishability. Recently, Dawar, Jakl, and Reggio (2021) proved that two graphs satisfy the same $\mathsf{C}^k_q$-sentences iff they are homomorphism indistinguishable over the class $\mathcal{T}^k_q$ of graphs admitting a $k$-pebble forest cover of depth $q$. After reproving this result using elementary means, we provide a graph-theoretic analysis of $\mathcal{T}^k_q$. This allows us to separate $\mathcal{T}^k_q$ from the intersection $\mathcal{TW}_{k-1} \cap \mathcal{TD}_q$, provided that $q$ is sufficiently larger than $k$. Here $\mathcal{TW}_{k-1}$ is the class of all graphs of treewidth at most $k-1$ and $\mathcal{TD}_q$ is the class of all graphs of treedepth at most $q$.
  We are able to lift this separation to a separation of the respective homomorphism indistinguishability relations $\equiv_{\mathcal{T}^k_q}$ and $\equiv_{\mathcal{TW}_{k-1} \cap \mathcal{TD}_q}$. We do this by showing that the classes $\mathcal{TD}_q$ and $\mathcal{T}^k_q$ are homomorphism distinguishing closed, as conjectured by Roberson (2022).
  In order to prove Roberson's conjecture for $\mathcal{T}^k_q$, we characterise $\mathcal{T}^k_q$ in terms of a monotone Cops-and-Robber game. The crux is to prove that if Cop has a winning strategy then Cop also has a winning strategy that is monotone. To that end, we transform Cops' winning strategy into a pree-tree-decomposition, which is inspired by decompositions of matroids, and then apply an intricate breadth-first cleaning up procedure along the pree-tree-decomposition (which may temporarily lose the property of representing a strategy). Thereby, we achieve monotonicity while controlling the number of rounds across all branches of the decomposition via a vertex exchange argument.</description>

      <title>On the Codebook Design for NOMA Schemes from Bent Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uplink grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising technology for massive connectivity with low latency and high energy efficiency. In code-domain NOMA schemes, the requirements boil down to the design of codebooks that contain a large number of spreading sequences with low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) while maintaining low coherence. When employing binary Golay sequences with guaranteed low PAPR in the design, the fundamental problem is to construct a large set of $n$-variable quadratic bent or near-bent functions in a particular form such that the difference of any two is bent for even $n$ or near-bent for odd $n$ to achieve optimally low coherence. In this work, we propose a theoretical construction of NOMA codebooks by applying a recursive approach to those particular quadratic bent functions in smaller dimensions. The proposed construction yields desired NOMA codebooks that contain $6\cdot N$ Golay sequences of length $N=2^{4m}$ for any positive integer $m$ and have the lowest possible coherence $1/\sqrt{N}$.</description>
