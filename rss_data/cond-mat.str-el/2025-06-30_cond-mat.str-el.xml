      <title>Conformal scalar field theory from Ising tricriticality on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free theories are landmarks in the landscape of quantum field theories: their exact solvability serves as a pillar for perturbative constructions of interacting theories. Fuzzy sphere regularization, which combines quantum Hall physics with state-operator correspondence, has recently been proposed as a promising framework for simulating three-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), but so far it has not provided access to free theories. We overcome this limitation by designing a bilayer quantum Hall system that hosts an Ising tricritical point -- a nontrivial fixed point where first-order and second-order transitions meet -- which flows to the conformally coupled scalar theory in the infrared. The critical energy spectrum and operator structure match those at the Gaussian fixed point, providing nonperturbative evidence for the emergence of a free scalar CFT. Our results expand the landscape of CFTs realizable on the fuzzy sphere and demonstrate that even free bosonic theories -- previously inaccessible -- can emerge from interacting electrons in this framework.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Theory of Gapped Domain Wall Partons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entanglement bootstrap program has generated new quantum numbers associated with degrees of freedom living on gapped domain walls between topological phases in two dimensions. Most fundamental among these are the so-called "parton" quantum numbers, which give rise to a zoo of composite sectors. In this note, we propose a categorical description of partons. Along the way, we make contact with ideas from generalized symmetries and SymTFT.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dilution in the triangular lattice antiferromagnet NaYb$_{1-x}$Lu$_{x}$O$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The delafossite-like compound NaYbO$_2$ hosts a triangular lattice of Yb$^{3+}$ moments and is a promising candidate for realizing a quantum spin liquid state. Here we leverage the substitution of nonmagnetic Lu$^{3+}$ onto the Yb$^{3+}$ sites to track the evolution of the quantum disordered ground state with increasing magnetic disorder in NaYb$_{1-x}$Lu$_x$O$_2$. Low temperature $\mu$SR measurements preclude conventional spin freezing and magnetic inhomogeneity, and instead resolve resilient, correlated magnetic fluctuations that persist to at least 15$\%$ dilution. Heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility measurements resolve a rapid suppression of the field-induced ``up-up-down" phase upon introducing magnetic disorder and a crossover in the power-law behavior of the low-temperature magnetic excitations associated with the zero-field quantum disordered ground state. Our combined results place constraints on theories modeling the emergence of the quantum spin liquid-like behavior in NaYbO$_2$.</description>

      <title>Ising spin-1/2 XXZ chain's quantum problems beyond the spinon paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin chains are correlated quantum models of great interest in quantum systems and materials exhibiting quasi-one-dimensional magnetic properties. Here we review results on quantum problems associated with spin chains that are beyond the usual spinon paradigm. In this review we consider two quantum problems that are beyond the spinon representation: (a) Spin Bethe strings of length n that have no spinon representation, contribute to the dynamical properties of the spin-1/2 XXZ chain with anisotropy larger than 1 and for n=1,2,3 were experimentally identified and realized in the zigzag materials SrCo2V2O8 and BaCo2V2O8; (b) The spin stiffness associated with ballistic spin transport at arbitrary finite temperature, which involves a huge number of energy eigenstates, many of which are generated in the thermodynamic limit from ground states by an infinite number of elementary processes.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking in an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally believed that spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry is restricted by Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem. A special case is that the 1D ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain holds long-range order because the order parameter commutes with the Hamiltonian. The other one is that the recently found frustration-free Hamiltonians can bypass this theorem, but the observed symmetry breaking is fragile under generic perturbations. In this work, we have discovered a new example that goes beyond the above two examples -- a 1D antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model -- that can achieve spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry. Importantly, it is not a frustration-free model and its order parameter does not commute with the Hamiltonian. Moreover, the long-range order is robust under symmetry-preserving perturbations. Combining numerical simulation and theoretical analysis, we have further confirmed and understood this nontrivial phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Seeding neural network quantum states with tensor network states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find an efficient approach to approximately convert matrix product states (MPSs) into restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions consisting of a multinomial hidden unit through a canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition of the MPSs. This method allows us to generate well-behaved initial neural network quantum states for quantum many-body ground-state calculations in polynomial time of the number of variational parameters and systematically shorten the distance between the initial states and the ground states with increasing the rank of the CP decomposition. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method by taking the transverse-field Ising model as an example and discuss possible applications of our method to more general quantum many-body systems in which the ground-state wave functions possess complex nodal structures.</description>

      <title>High-mobility heavy quasiparticles in a van der Waals antiferromagnetic dense Kondo lattice CeTe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit high carrier mobility and tunability, making them suitable for low-power, high-performance electronic and spintronic applications. Incorporating narrow-band electronic correlation effects could further promote tunability, though mass renormalization may impact carrier mobility. It is therefore challenging to identify a vdW material with both high mobility and strong correlation. Herein, by a combination of optical spectroscopy and high-field quantum-oscillation measurements, we observe significant effective-mass enhancement in CeTe$_3$ at low temperature, arising from not only the band-structure modulation by antiferromagnetic ordering but also the narrow-band correlation effect. Despite the mass enhancement, the quantum mobility surprisingly \textit{increases} and reaches $\sim$2403 cm$^2$/Vs, likely benefiting from topological protection. Remarkably, these unique properties are maintained in atomically thin nanoflakes with quantum mobility enhanced to $\sim$3158 cm$^2$/Vs. Thus, CeTe$_3$ emerges as a promising vdW antiferromagnetic metal with high-mobility heavy quasiparticles, potentially unlocking new device concepts.</description>

      <title>Reexamination of the charge-ordered dimer pattern in the spinel compound CuIr2S4 using single-crystal synchrotron x-ray diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have re-investigated the crystal structure of a spinel type CuIr2S4 at low temperatures using a single-crystal in a synchrotron radiation x-ray diffraction experiment. The crystal structure of the low-temperature phase of CuIr2S4 has been already studied by diffraction experiments using a powder sample, and it has been reported that the formation of dimer molecules accompanied by charge ordering of Ir has been achieved. The crystal structure of the low-temperature phase obtained in our reanalysis was the same as the previously reported structure in that it showed the formation of Ir dimers accompanied by charge ordering, but the charge ordering pattern and arrangement of the dimers in the unit cell were different. We will discuss the validity of the structure obtained in this study and provide the structural parameters revealed in the reanalysis. The results of this study should provide a basis for further studies of the physical properties of CuIr2S4, which are still being actively investigated.</description>

      <title>Reviewing Current-Driven Dynamics and Monte Carlo based Analysis of Thermodynamic Properties of a Magnetic Skyrmion Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions with its topologically protected, nano-sized spin textures have already earned immense fame as information carriers due to their stability and low-current mobility. While ferromagnetic skyrmions suffer from a transverse deflection (i.e., the skyrmion Hall effect), their anti-ferromagnetic counterparts promise straight-line motion and ultrafast dynamics. Here we present a numerical study of the dynamics of lattice-based antiferromagnetic skyrmions driven by spin-transfer torque for which the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation is solved using a fourth-order Range-Kutta integration. Then we conduct a detailed Monte Carlo study of the two-dimensional classical XY model to quantify how spatial anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) coupling reshape its thermal response across multiple lattice sizes. By tuning the ratio Jy/Jx, we document a systematic evolution of the specific-heat anomaly. For example, in the quasi-one-dimensional limit, CV exhibits a broad, low-temperature hump, whereas stronger anisotropy yields sharper peaks that migrate to higher inverse temperature. Finite-size scaling confirms the crossover from quasi-1D fluctuations to a two-dimensional Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Incorporating a DM interaction further enriches this landscape. At D/J = 0.1, the main peak shifts modestly upward and is slightly suppressed; raising D/J elevates the peak magnitudes and creates a pronounced low-temperature plateau. This residual CV signals enduring chiral excitations and complex spin-twist textures beyond simple vortex unbinding. Our findings chart how directional and chiral couplings can be harnessed to tune pseudo-critical temperatures and thermodynamic signatures in two-dimensional magnets, providing a practical blueprint for engineering topological spin systems.</description>

      <title>EuPdSn2; magnetic structures in view of resonant x-ray Bragg diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic properties of materials hosting Eu2+(J = 7/2, 4f7) ions have attracted much attention in the science of strongly correlated electrons. In part because crystal electric field effects are impoverished for an s-state ion, as with Gd3+ intermetallics, and Eu2+ substitution in biological and optically active materials is resourceful. The magnetic structure of EuPdSn2 is not wholly resolved. Ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic structures coexist in powder neutron diffraction patterns, and compete in the ground state. Moreover, the specific heat as a function of temperature is enigmatic and indicative of J = 5/2. We present symmetry-informed analytic magnetic structure factors for single crystal resonant x-ray Bragg diffraction using Eu atomic resonances that reveal significant potential for the technique. Europium ions use acentric Wyckoff positions in magnetic space groups inferred from neutron diffraction. In consequence, axial and polar Eu multipoles are compulsory components of both magnetic neutron and resonant x-ray Bragg diffraction patterns. The proposed antiferromagnetic phase of EuPdSn2 supports anapoles (magnetic polar dipoles) already observed in magnetic neutron diffraction patterns presented by Gd doped SmAl2, and several resonant x-ray diffraction patterns.</description>

      <title>First observation of quantum oscillations by transport measurements in semi-destructive pulsed magnetic fields up to 125 T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High magnetic fields have proven instrumental in exploring the physical properties of condensed matter, leading to groundbreaking discoveries such as the quantum Hall effect in 2D heterostructures and quantum oscillations in cuprate superconductors. The ability to conduct precise measurements at progressively higher magnetic fields continues to push the frontiers of knowledge and enable new discoveries. In this work, we present the development of a microwave technique for performing two-point transport measurements in semi-destructive pulsed magnetic fields (up to 125 T) and at low temperatures (down to 1.5 K) with unprecedented sensitivity. This new setup was tested on a variety of samples. We present results on the metal-insulator transition in InAs and we report notably the first observation of Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations in WTe$_{2}$ at magnetic fields beyond 100 T.</description>

      <title>Probing and tuning geometric frustration in an organic quantum magnet via elastocaloric measurements under strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric frustration is a key ingredient in the emergence of exotic states of matter, such as the quantum spin liquid in Mott insulators. While there has been intense interest in experimentally tuning frustration in candidate materials, achieving precise and continuous control has remained a major hurdle -- particularly in accessing the properties of the ideally frustrated lattice. Here, we show that large, finely controlled anisotropic strains can effectively tune the degree of geometric frustration in the Mott insulating $\kappa$-(ET)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ -- a slightly anisotropic triangular-lattice quantum magnet. Using thermodynamic measurements of the elastocaloric effect, we experimentally map out a temperature-strain phase diagram that captures both the ground state of the isotropic lattice and the less frustrated parent state. Our results provide a new benchmark for calculations of the triangular-lattice Hubbard model as a function of frustration and highlight the power of lattice engineering as a route to realizing perfectly frustrated quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Topological two-body interaction obstructing trivial ground states: an indicator of fractional Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for candidate materials for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) has mainly focused on the topological and geometrical structures of single-particle Chern bands. However, there are inherent limitations in approaches that neglect interaction effects, highlighting the need for complementary methods. In this work, we discuss how the Chern number defined for the effective interaction projected onto a Chern band is related to the stabilization of FCIs. Specifically, by formulating both the effective interaction and the two-particle problem using a common matrix, we establish a connection between the two-particle band structure and the effective interaction. This formulation allows us to characterize the effective interaction through the topology of the two-particle band. To investigate the relationship between topological effective interactions and FCIs, we perform numerical calculations primarily based on exact diagonalization. We find a notable correlation between the fact that the dominant two-particle bands carry a unit Chern number and the realization of a robust FCI at the filling fraction $\nu = 1/3$. This result is consistent with the presumed correspondence between pseudopotentials in the fractional quantum Hall effect and the two-particle band structure. From another perspective, our findings suggest that the topology inherent in the interaction itself can obstruct trivial ground states. We also discuss this in the context of scattering channels. Extending such topological two-body interactions could pave the way for realizing exotic states beyond FCIs.</description>

      <title>Combine effect of site dilution and long-range interaction on magnetic and transport properties in the half-filled Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetotransport properties of a diluted half-filled one-band Hubbard model with second-nearest-neighbor hopping on a simple cubic lattice, aiming to explore the possibility of metallicity in diluted antiferromagnetic systems. Our semiclassical Monte Carlo (s-MC) calculations reveal an antiferromagnetic metallic regime in diluted correlated materials. This unexpected metallic regime naturally leads to a central question: how does the introduction of dilution into an antiferromagnetic material, especially with long-range magnetic interactions, induce metallicity -- a feature not commonly associated with antiferromagnets? To address this question, we demonstrate that when the on-site repulsion strength ($U$) is set to zero on a percentage of the sites (site dilution), the insulating state weakens due to percolative conduction among the diluted sites at low temperatures. Remarkably, this occurs without any significant alteration to the underlying long-range antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering in the system, thereby providing a pathway to realize antiferromagnetic metals. In addition, we show how the sublattice-dependent hopping can be exploited to engineer spin-polarized half-metallic antiferromagnets. Overall, our numerical results collectively provide a basis for understanding the combined effect of site dilution and competing interactions, which will assist in the design of new antiferromagnetic metals for future spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Symmetry-Fragmentation of Nonabelian Anyons In Symmetry-Enriched Topological Phases: A String-Net Model Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases combine intrinsic topological order with global symmetries, giving rise to novel symmetry phenomena. While SET phases with Abelian anyons are relatively well understood, those involving non-Abelian anyons remain elusive. This obscurity stems from the multi-dimensional internal gauge spaces intrinsic to non-Abelian anyons -- a feature first made explicit in [1,2] and further explored and formalized in our recent works [3-8]. These internal spaces can transform in highly nontrivial ways under global symmetries. In this work, we employ an exactly solvable model -- the multifusion Hu-Geer-Wu string-net model introduced in a companion paper [9] -- to reveal how the internal gauge spaces of non-Abelian anyons transform under symmetries. We uncover a universal mechanism, global symmetry fragmentation (GSF), whereby symmetry-invariant anyons exhibit internal Hilbert space decompositions into eigensubspaces labeled by generally fractional symmetry charges. Meanwhile, symmetry-permuted anyons hybridize and fragment their internal spaces in accordance with their symmetry behavior. These fragmented structures realize genuinely nonlinear symmetry representations -- to be termed coherent representations -- that transcend conventional linear and projective classifications, reflecting the categorical nature of symmetries in topological phases. Our results identify nonlinear fragmentation as a hallmark of non-Abelian SETs and suggest new routes for symmetry-enabled control in topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Computing excited eigenstates using inexact Lanczos methods and tree tensor network states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excited eigenstates are crucial to understand the dynamics of quantum many-body systems. Tensor network states are one of the workhorses to compute ground states of many-body systems, yet the accurate computation of excited eigenstates is still challenging. Here, we develop a combination of the inexact Lanczos method, which aims at efficiently computing excited states, to tree tensor network states (TTNSs). We demonstrate our approach by computing excited vibrational states for three challenging problems: (1) 84 states in different energy intervals of acetonitrile (12-dimensional), (2) Fermi resonance states of the fluxional Zundel ion (15-dimensional), and (3) selected excited states of the fluxional and very correlated Eigen ion (33-dimensional). The proposed TTNS inexact Lanczos method is directly applicable to other quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Homomorphism, substructure and ideal: Elementary but rigorous aspects of renormalization group or hierarchical structure of topological orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study ring homomorphisms between fusion rings appearing in conformal field theories connected under massless renormalization group (RG) flows. By interpreting the elementary relationship between homomorphism, quotient ring, and projection, we propose a general quantum Hamiltonian formalism of a massless and massive RG flow with an emphasis on generalized symmetry. In our formalism, the noninvertible nature of the ideal of a fusion ring plays a fundamental role as a condensation rule between anyons. Our algebraic method applies to the domain wall problem in $2+1$ dimensional topologically ordered systems and the corresponding classification of $1+1$ dimensional gapped phase, for example. An ideal decomposition of a fusion ring provides a straightforward but strong constraint on the gapped phase with noninvertible symmetry and its symmetry-breaking (or emergent symmetry) patterns. Moreover, even in several specific homomorphisms connected under massless RG flows, less familiar homomorphisms appear, and we conjecture that they correspond to partially solvable models in recent literature. Our work demonstrates the fundamental significance of the abstract algebraic structure, ideal, for the RG in physics.</description>

      <title>Topotactic phase transformation in correlated vanadium dioxide through oxygen vacancy ordering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the insulator-metal transition (IMT) in correlated oxide system through oxygen vacancy ordering opens up a new paradigm for exploring exotic structural transformation and physical functionality. Oxygen vacancy serves as a powerful tuning knob for adjusting the IMT property in VO2, though driving topochemical reduction to V2O3 remains challenging due to structural incompatibility and competing phase instability. Here we unveil consecutive oxygen-vacancy-driven VO2-VO2-x-V2O3 topotactic phase transformation route with enticing facet-dependent anisotropy, engendering tunable IMT properties over an extended temperature range. Remarkably, topochemically reduced V2O3 inherits the crystallographic characteristics from parent VO2, enabling emergent lattice framework and IMT behavior inaccessible via direct epitaxial growth. Analogous electron doping arising from hydrogenation and oxygen vacancy contributes cooperatively to drive the Mott phase transition in VO2 through band-filling control. Our work not only unveils sequential topotactic phase transformations in VO2 through oxygen vacancy ordering but also provides fundamentally new insights for defect-mediated Mott transitions.</description>

      <title>Controlling the quantum phase transition in a double quantum dot Josephson junction via interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we employ a surrogate BCS model with discrete energy levels to investigate a hybrid system comprising two quantum dots (QD1 and QD2), where QD1 is tunnel-coupled to two superconducting leads. Through exact diagonalization of this system, we obtain numerically exact solutions that enable rigorous computation of key physical quantities. Our analysis reveals a rich phase diagram featuring multiple controllable phase transitions mediated by quantum dot interactions. Specifically, the system first undergoes an initial phase transition when tuning QD2's interaction strength while maintaining QD1 in the non-interacting regime. Subsequent adjustment of QD1's interaction induces a secondary phase transition, followed by a third transition arising from inter-dot coupling modulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that parallel magnetic field application can drive reversible ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic phase transitions under specific parameter conditions. Finally, we report the emergence of non-local magnetization phenomena when subjecting QD1 to weak magnetic fields. And our results demonstrate that the orientation of nonlocal magnetization can be precisely manipulated through systematic adjustment of the on-site interaction strength $U_2$ in QD2.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Cobalt Doping on the Skyrmion Hosting Material Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ has fascinating magnetic phases that can be easily manipulated through chemical doping. In this work, we report on the synthesis and characterization of Co-doped Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ and its influence on both the atomic and magnetic structure. Polycrystalline (Cu$_{1_-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$OSeO$_3$ samples with 0 &lt; x &lt; 0.1 were synthesized and the presence of Co was confirmed via elemental analysis. Using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction, and high-resolution neutron powder diffraction, the incorporation of Co$^{2+}$ into the Cu2 sites was confirmed. Co-doping led to an expansion to the unit cell but shows no apparent changes in bond lengths and angles in the crystal structure. Magnetization measurements showed that the incorporation of Co$^{2+}$ into the Cu2 site led to significant changes to the magnetic ordering of the material. Including an increase to the critical fields, the lowering of the critical temperature of the helimagnetic phase, and both a lowering and expansion of the skyrmion pocket temperatures. Lastly, small-angle neutron scattering was used to probe the magnetic structures hosted by the material. It was found that upon doping, the skyrmion lattice nucleates at lower temperatures as well as stabilized over a large temperature range. The observed results highlight the effects of incorporating a magnetic ion into the crystal structure and how it affects the internal magnetic structures.</description>

      <title>Pressure and doping effects on the electronic structure and magnetism of the single-layer nickelate La$_2$NiO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: La$_2$NiO$_4$ is a prototypical member of the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate series that offers a valuable reference point for elucidating the key ingredients behind the intriguing properties of these systems. However, the structural and electronic properties of La$_2$NiO$_4$ under pressure and doping remain surprisingly underexplored. Here, we investigate these properties using density-functional-theory calculations. We find that its tetragonal $I4/mmm$ structure can be stabilized, not only under comparatively low pressures of $\sim$ 8 GPa, but also at ambient pressure via the partial substitution of La with Ba. Moreover, we show that the combined effects of Ba substitution and pressure leads to qualitative changes in the electronic structure towards the formal $d^{7.5}$ configuration of the superconducting bilayer nickelates. Further, while La$_2$NiO$_4$ can undergo a insulator-metal transition with pressure retaining G-type antiferromagnetic order, La$_{1.5}$Ba$_{0.5}$NiO$_4$ exhibits metallic behavior with an enhanced competition between different magnetic states. Our results thus offer new insights into the interplay of structure, doping, and magnetism across the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate series.</description>

      <title>Topological Holography: Towards a Unification of Landau and Beyond-Landau Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.10712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We outline a holographic framework that attempts to unify Landau and beyond-Landau paradigms of quantum phases and phase transitions. Leveraging a modern understanding of symmetries as topological defects/operators, the framework uses a topological order to organize the space of quantum systems with a global symmetry in one lower dimension. The global symmetry naturally serves as an input for the topological order. In particular, we holographically construct a String Operator Algebra (SOA) which is the building block of symmetric quantum systems with a given symmetry $G$ in one lower dimension. This exposes a vast web of dualities which act on the space of $G$-symmetric quantum systems. The SOA facilitates the classification of gapped phases as well as their corresponding order parameters and fundamental excitations, while dualities help to navigate and predict various corners of phase diagrams and analytically compute universality classes of phase transitions. A novelty of the approach is that it treats conventional Landau and unconventional topological phase transitions on an equal footing, thereby providing a holographic unification of these seemingly-disparate domains of understanding. We uncover a new feature of gapped phases and their multi-critical points, which we dub fusion structure, that encodes information about which phases and transitions can be dual to each other. Furthermore, we discover that self-dual systems typically posses emergent non-invertible, i.e., beyond group-like symmetries. We apply these ideas to $1+1d$ quantum spin chains with finite Abelian group symmetry, using topologically-ordered systems in $2+1d$. We predict the phase diagrams of various concrete spin models, and analytically compute the full conformal spectra of non-trivial quantum phase transitions, which we then verify numerically.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the Kitaev model on the $\{9,3\}$ hyperbolic lattice. The $\{9,3\}$ is formed by a regular tricoordinated tiling of nonagons, where the 3-color coding of bonds according to the inequivalent Kitaev Ising spin couplings yields the natural generalization of the original Kitaev model for Euclidean regular honeycomb tiling. Upon investigation of the bulk spectrum for large finite size droplets, we identify a gapless chiral $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid state featuring spontaneous time reversal symmetry breaking. Due to its non-commutative translation group structure, such type of hyperbolic spin liquid is conjectured to feature chiral quasiparticles with a potentially non-Abelian Bloch profile.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall response of an abelian chiral spin liquid at finite temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal Hall transport has emerged as a valuable tool for probing the fractionalized excitations in chiral quantum spin liquids. Observing quantized thermal Hall response, expected at temperatures below the spectral gap, has been challenging and controversial. The finite temperature behavior, especially in the quantum critical regime above the spectral gap, can provide useful signatures of the underlying topological order. In this context, we study the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a kagome lattice that is believed to be a U$(1)$ Dirac spin liquid over a wide intermediate energy range. Scalar spin chirality perturbations turn this into a gapped abelian chiral spin liquid (CSL) with semionic topological order. Using a recently developed large-$N$ technique [Guo et al., Phys. Rev. B 101, 195126 (2020)], we obtain explicit expressions for the thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$ at finite temperatures taking into account both matter and gauge fluctuations. At low temperatures below the spectral gap, the quantized thermal Hall response agrees with that expected from conformal field theory and gravitational anomaly arguments. Our main finding is that in a large temperature window spanning the spectral gap and the Curie temperature scales where quantum critical fluctuations dominate, $\kappa_{xy}/T$ obeys a power-law with logarithmic corrections. Our analysis also provides a route to understanding the thermal Hall response at higher temperatures in the quantum critical regime.</description>

      <title>Strain induced topological phase transitions in split and line graphs of bipartite lattices featuring flat bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, materials with topological flat bands have attracted significant attention due to their association with extraordinary transport properties and strongly correlated electrons. This includes phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, ferromagnetism, Wigner crystallization, and Mott-insulating behavior. Among these systems, two-dimensional (2D) materials are particularly compelling as they can host electronic states with unique band structures, such as dispersionless states alongside linearly dispersive Dirac cones. In this work, we use tight-binding models to comprehensively investigate a class of 2D lattices that generically support flat bands, and focus on the effects of strain on their electronic and topological properties. The studied lattices are constructed within a unifying graph-theoretic framework, whereupon split-graph and line-graph operations on bipartite square and hexagonal lattices are employed to generate new structures. In the absence of strain, the introduction of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces a bulk excitation gap, which transforms flat bands into quasi-flat bands with topologically nontrivial characteristics. By tuning system parameters and external strain, we observe the emergence of directional flat bands, and tilted and semi-Dirac cones. Remarkably, all lattices studied show phase transitions among trivial insulating, semimetallic, and topological phases. In addition to exploring understudied lattices, our contribution comprehensively analyzes the potential of strain engineering as a versatile tool for manipulating electronic and topological phases in a wide variety of 2D materials.</description>

Abstract: We construct exact ground states of the $J_1$-$J_{3b}$ classical Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice in the presence of a magnetic field. They are non-coplanar multi-$\vec{Q}$ spin configurations with a large magnetic unit cell that generalize the previously found coplanar sublattice pairing states. Using linear spin wave theory, we show that entropy favors these multi-$\vec{Q}$ states at low temperatures in high magnetic fields. This is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations, and a phase diagram is constructed. We also calculate the zero-temperature dynamical structure factor. Besides the usual Goldstone modes associated with the ordering $\vec{Q}$s, we find high intensity gapless modes at momenta where there are no Bragg peaks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Decohered One Dimensional Critical States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14221v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this work, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under local strong symmetry preserving decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Importantly, we analyze this transition from two complementary perspectives: on one hand, through the behavior of order parameters that characterize the symmetry breaking; on the other hand, from a quantum information viewpoint by studying entropic quantities and the concept of quantum recoverability. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrary decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Importantly, our unified theoretical framework is applicable to a broad class of one-dimensional quantum systems, including spin chains and fermionic systems, whose low-energy physics can be described by Luttinger liquid theory, under arbitrary symmetry-preserving decoherence channels. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.</description>

      <title>A Promising Method for Strongly Correlated Electrons in Two Dimensions: Gutzwiller-Guided Density Matrix Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of strongly correlated electron systems remains a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics, particularly in two-dimensional (2D) systems hosting various exotic phases of matter including quantum spin liquids, unconventional superconductivity, and topological orders. Although Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) has established itself as a pillar for simulating one-dimensional quantum systems, its application to 2D systems has long been hindered by the notorious ``local minimum'' issues. Recent methodological breakthroughs have addressed this challenge by incorporating Gutzwiller-projected wavefunctions as initial states for DMRG simulations. This hybrid approach, referred to as DMRG guided by Gutzwiller-projected wave functions (or Gutzwiller-guided DMRG), has demonstrated remarkable improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and the ability to explore exotic quantum phases such as topological orders. This review examines the theoretical underpinnings of this approach, details key algorithmic developments, and showcases its applications in recent studies of 2D quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Unified Magnetoelectric Mechanism for Spin Splitting in Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a relativistic magnetoelectric correction that completes the theoretical description of spin splitting (SS) in magnetic systems. Derived from the Dirac equation, this term couples local magnetic moments to the scalar electric potential, providing a third fundamental mechanism, alongside Zeeman and spin-orbit coupling (SOC), that governs SS in ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and altermagnets. In compensated magnets, the correction depends on the difference in electric potential between symmetry-inequivalent motifs, $\mu_{\text{B}}(\mathcal{V}_1 - \mathcal{V}_2)\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \boldsymbol{m}$, which explains how finite SS emerges in the absence of SOC and enables a complete classification of momentum dependence and motif connectivity across all 32 point groups. Through illustrative examples, we show that distinct SS behaviors - quadratic (altermagnetic), linear (spin Zeeman effect), and $k$-independent (SS at $\Gamma$) - are specific manifestations of the proposed magnetoelectric relativistic mechanism, each governed by electric quadrupoles, dipoles, or monopoles, respectively. The formalism naturally extends to higher-order multipoles and more complex symmetries. This work establishes a unified framework for SS in magnets and provides a predictive tool for analyzing symmetry-allowed SS in magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Flat-band Superconductors: Rigorous Lower Bounds on Superfluid Stiffness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superfluid stiffness fundamentally constrains the transition temperature of superconductors, especially in the strongly coupled regime. However, accurately determining this inherently quantum many-body property in microscopic models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we show how the \textit{quantum many-body bootstrap} framework, specifically the reduced density matrix (RDM) bootstrap, can be leveraged to obtain rigorous lower bounds on the superfluid stiffness in frustration-free interacting models with superconducting ground state. We numerically apply the method to a special class of frustration free models, which are known as quantum geometric nesting models, for flat-band superconductivity, where we uncover a general relation between the stiffness and the pair mass. Going beyond the familiar Hubbard case within this class, we find how additional interactions, notably simple magnetic couplings, can enhance the superfluid stiffness. Furthermore, the RDM bootstrap unexpectedly reveals that the trion-type correlations are essential for bounding the stiffness, offering new insights on the structure of these models. A straightforward generalization of the method can lead to bounds on susceptibilities that are complementary to variational approaches. Our findings underscore the immense potential of the quantum many-body bootstrap as a powerful tool to derive rigorous bounds on physical quantities beyond energy.</description>

      <title>Site-polarized Mott phases competing with a correlated metal in twisted WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted WSe$_2$ hosts superconductivity, metal-insulator phase transitions, and field-controllable Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid transport properties. In this work, we use dynamical mean-field theory to provide a coherent understanding of the electronic correlations shaping the twisted WSe$_2$ phase diagram. We find a correlated metal competing with three distinct site-polarized correlated insulators; the competition is controlled by interlayer potential difference and interaction strength. The insulators are characterized by a strong differentiation between orbitals with respect to carrier concentration and effective correlation strength. Upon doping, a strong particle-hole asymmetry emerges, resulting from a Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen-type charge-transfer mechanism. The associated charge-transfer physics and proximity to a van Hove singularity in the correlated metal sandwiched between two site-polarized insulators naturally explains the interlayer potential-driven metal-to-insulator transition, particle-hole asymmetry in transport, and the coherence-incoherence crossover in $3.65^\circ$ twisted WSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced sensing with variable-range interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The typical bound on parameter estimation, known as the standard quantum limit (SQL), can be surpassed by exploiting quantum resources such as entanglement. To estimate the magnetic probe field, we propose a quantum sensor based on a variable-range many-body quantum spin chain with a moderate transverse magnetic field. We report the threefold benefits of employing a long-range system as a quantum sensor. First, sensors with quasi-long-range interactions can always beat the SQL for all values of the coordination number, while a sensor with long-range interactions does not have this ubiquitous quantum advantage. Second, a long-range Hamiltonian outperforms a nearest-neighbor (NN) Hamiltonian in terms of both estimating precision and system-size scaling. Finally, we observe that the system with long-range interactions can go below the SQL in the presence of a high temperature of the initial state, while sensors having NN interactions cannot. Furthermore, a sensor based on the long-range Ising Hamiltonian proves to be robust against impurities in the magnetic field and when the time-inhomogeneous dephasing noise acts during interaction of the probe with the system.</description>

      <title>Postselection-free approach to monitored quantum dynamics and entanglement phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits have stimulated activity in a diverse research community. However, the study of measurement-induced dynamics, due to the requirement of exponentially complex postselection, has been experimentally limited to small or specially designed systems that can be efficiently simulated classically. We present a solution to this outstanding problem by introducing a scalable protocol in $U(1)$ symmetric circuits that facilitates the observation of entanglement phase transitions \emph{directly} from experimental data, without detailed assumptions of the underlying model or benchmarking with simulated data. Thus, the method is applicable to circuits which do not admit efficient classical simulation and allows a reconstruction of the full entanglement entropy curve with minimal theoretical input. Our approach relies on adaptive circuits and a steering protocol to approximate pure-state trajectories with mixed ensembles, from which one can efficiently filter out the subsystem $U(1)$ charge fluctuations of the target trajectory to obtain its entanglement entropy. The steering protocol replaces the exponential costs of postselection and state tomography with a scalable overhead which, for fixed accuracy $\epsilon$ and circuit size $L$, scales as $\mathcal{N}_s\sim L^{5/2}/\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence by magnetic fluctuations in a magnetic topological insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In magnetic topological insulators, spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking by intrinsic magnetic order can gap the topological surface spectrum, resulting in exotic properties like axion electrodynamics, the quantum anomalous Hall effect, and other topological magnetoelectric responses. Understanding the magnetic order and its coupling to topological states is essential to harness these properties. Here, we leverage near-resonant magnetic dipole optical second harmonic generation to probe magnetic fluctuations in the candidate axion insulator EuSn$_2$(As,P)$_2$ across its antiferromagnetic phase boundary. We observe a pronounced dimensional crossover in the quantum decoherence induced by magnetic fluctuations, whereby two-dimensional in-plane ferromagnetic correlations at high temperatures give way to three-dimensional long-range order at the N\'eel temperature. We also observe the breaking of rotational symmetry within the long-range-ordered antiferromagnetic state and map out the resulting spatial domain structure. More generally, we demonstrate the unique capabilities of nonlinear optical spectroscopy to study quantum coherence and fluctuations in magnetic quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous mass inversion enriched quantum anomalous Hall states in multilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, multilayer graphene systems have attracted significant attention due to the discovery of a variety of intriguing phases, particularly quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. In rhombohedral pentalayer graphene (RPG), both QAH states with Chern number $C = -5$ and $C = -3$ have been observed. While the $C = -5$ QAH state is well understood, the origin of the $C = -3$ QAH state remains unclear. In this letter, we propose that the $C = -3$ QAH state, as well as the topological phase transition from $C = -3$ to $C = -5$ state in RPG, arises from an asynchronous mass inversion mechanism driven by the interplay between trigonal warping, staggered layer order, and the displacement field: Trigonal warping splits the low-energy bands of RPG into a central touching point and three satellite Dirac cones. Meanwhile, the coexistence of the staggered layer order and displacement field induces a momentum-dependent effective mass in the low-energy bands. Consequently, mass inversions at the central touching point and the satellite Dirac cones, induced by an increasing displacement field, can occur asynchronously, leading to the formation of the $C = -3$ QAH state and the topological phase transition from QAH state with $C=-3$ to $C=-5$. Additionally, based on this mechanism, we predict the presence of a $C=3$ QAH state in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene (RTG), which can be detected experimentally. Furthermore, this mechanism can also be applied to Bernal tetralayer graphene (BTG), explaining the origin of the observed $C=6$ QAH state.</description>

Abstract: We propose a mechanism of current-induced phonon angular momentum, which we call phonon Edelstein effect. We investigate this effect in three-dimensional chiral metals with spin-orbit coupling and chiral phonons, and obtain an analytical expression of phonon angular momentum induced by the current. We also discuss the physical interpretation of this effect and give an estimation of its magnitude.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Spin Systems with Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01891v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are a class of variational wave functions parametrized by neural networks (NNs) to study quantum many-body systems. In this work, we propose \texttt{SineKAN}, a NQS \textit{ansatz} based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), to represent quantum mechanical wave functions as nested univariate functions. We show that \texttt{SineKAN} wavefunction with learnable sinusoidal activation functions can capture the ground state energies, fidelities and various correlation functions of the one dimensional Transverse-Field Ising model, Anisotropic Heisenberg model, and Antiferromagnetic $J_{1}-J_{2}$ model with different chain lengths. In our study of the $J_1-J_2$ model with $L=100$ sites, we find that the \texttt{SineKAN} model outperforms several previously explored neural quantum state \textit{ans\"atze}, including Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Long Short-Term Memory models (LSTMs), and Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) \textit{a.k.a.} Feed Forward Neural Networks, when compared to the results obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. We find that \texttt{SineKAN} models can be trained to high precisions and accuracies with minimal computational costs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a generic platform for designing topological flat bands through applying an artificially designed electrostatic superlattice potential to a thin film with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Utilizing many-body exact diagonalization, we show that the lowest flat band can host fractional Chern insulator states at filling factor $n = 1/3$ and $2/3$. Notably, these fractional charge states present robustly in a broad regime of the parameter space. We further discuss the potential realistic materials and the associated experimental conditions required to realize these compelling theoretical predictions. Our findings establish a versatile platform for engineering topological flat bands and exploring topologically nontrivial correlated states.</description>
