      <title>A Direct Proof of the Short-Side Advantage in Random Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stable matching problem under the random matching model where the preferences of the doctors and hospitals are sampled uniformly and independently at random. In a balanced market with $n$ doctors and $n$ hospitals, the doctor-proposal deferred-acceptance algorithm gives doctors an expected rank of order $\log n$ for their partners and hospitals an expected rank of order $\frac{n}{\log n}$ for their partners. This situation is reversed in an unbalanced market with $n+1$ doctors and $n$ hospitals, a phenomenon known as the short-side advantage. The current proofs of this fact are indirect, counter-intuitively being based upon analyzing the hospital-proposal deferred-acceptance algorithm. In this paper we provide a direct proof of the short-side advantage, explicitly analyzing the doctor-proposal deferred-acceptance algorithm. Our proof sheds light on how and why the phenomenon arises.</description>

      <title>Mim-Width is paraNP-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that it is NP-hard to distinguish graphs of linear mim-width at most 1211 from graphs of sim-width at least 1216. This implies that Mim-Width, Sim-Width, One-Sided Mim-Width, and their linear counterparts are all paraNP-complete, i.e., NP-complete to compute even when upper bounded by a constant.</description>

      <title>Oriented discrepancy of Hamilton cycles and paths in digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Erd{\H o}s (1963) initiated extensive graph discrepancy research on 2-edge-colored graphs. Gishboliner, Krivelevich, and Michaeli (2023) launched similar research on oriented graphs. They conjectured the following generalization of Dirac's theorem: If the minimum degree $\delta$ of an $n$-vertex oriented graph $G$ is greater or equal to $n/2$,then $G$ has a Hamilton oriented cycle with at least $\delta$ forward arcs. This conjecture was proved by Freschi and Lo (2024) who posed an open problem to extend their result to an Ore-type condition. We propose two conjectures for such extensions and prove some results which provide support to the conjectures. For forward arc maximization on Hamilton oriented cycles and paths in semicomplete multipartite digraphs and locally semicomplete digraphs, we obtain characterizations which lead to polynomial-time algorithms.</description>

      <title>Exercises in Iterational Asymptotics II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear recurrences we consider here include the functions $3x(1-x)$ and $\cos(x)$, which possess attractive fixed points $2/3$ and $0.739...$ (Dottie's number). Detailed asymptotics for oscillatory convergence are found, starting with a 1960 paper by Wolfgang Thron. Another function, $x/(1+x\ln(1+x))$, gives rise to a sequence with monotonic convergence to $0$ but requires substantial work to calculate its associated constant $C$.</description>

      <title>An Approximate Generalization of the Okamura-Seymour Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of multicommodity flows in planar graphs. Okamura and Seymour showed that if all the demands are incident on one face, then the cut-condition is sufficient for routing demands. We consider the following generalization of this setting and prove an approximate max flow-min cut theorem: for every demand edge, there exists a face containing both its end points. We show that the cut-condition is sufficient for routing $\Omega(1)$-fraction of all the demands. To prove this, we give a $L_1$-embedding of the planar metric which approximately preserves distance between all pair of points on the same face.</description>

      <title>Morse Sequences: A simple approach to discrete Morse theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the notion of a Morse sequence, which provides an alternative approach to discrete Morse theory, and which is both simple and effective. A Morse sequence on a finite simplicial complex is a sequence composed solely of two elementary operations, that is, expansions (the inverse of a collapse), and fillings (the inverse of a perforation). In a dual manner, a Morse sequence may be obtained by considering only collapses and perforations. Such a sequence is another way to represent the gradient vector field of an arbitrary discrete Morse function. To each Morse sequence, we assign a reference map and an extension map. A reference map associates a set of critical simplexes to each simplex of a given complex, and an extension map associates a set of simplexes to each critical simplex. By considering the boundary of each critical simplex, we obtain a chain complex from these maps, which corresponds precisely to the Morse complex. We show that, when restricted to homology, an extension map is the inverse of a reference map. Also we show that these two maps allow us to recover directly the isomorphism theorem between the homology of an object and the homology of its Morse complex. At last, we introduce the notion of a flow complex, which is based solely on extension maps. We prove that this notion is equivalent to the classical one based on gradient flows.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Genus Algorithm Based on Graph Rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining the minimal genus of a simple finite connected graph. We present an algorithm which, for an arbitrary graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, determines the orientable genus of $G$ in $\mathcal{O}(n(4^m/n)^{n/t})$ steps where $t$ is the girth. This algorithm avoids the difficulties that many other genus algorithms have with handling bridge placements which is a well-known issue. The algorithm has a number of properties that make it useful for practical use: it is simple to implement, it outputs the faces of the optimal embedding, it outputs a proof certificate for verification and it can be used to obtain upper and lower bounds. We illustrate the algorithm by determining the genus of the $(3,12)$ cage (which is 17); other graphs are also considered.</description>

      <title>On first-order transductions of classes of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14412v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study various aspects of the first-order transduction quasi-order on graph classes, which provides a way of measuring the relative complexity of graph classes based on whether one can encode the other using a formula of first-order (FO) logic. In contrast with the conjectured simplicity of the transduction quasi-order for monadic second-order logic, the FO-transduction quasi-order is very complex, and many standard properties from structural graph theory and model theory naturally appear in it. We prove a local normal form for transductions among other general results and constructions, which we illustrate via several examples and via the characterizations of the transductions of some simple classes. We then turn to various aspects of the quasi-order, including the (non-)existence of minimum and maximum classes for certain properties, the strictness of the pathwidth hierarchy, the fact that the quasi-order is not a lattice, and the role of weakly sparse classes in the quasi-order.</description>

      <title>Approximation of Spanning Tree Congestion using Hereditary Bisection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Spanning Tree Congestion (STC) problem is the following NP-hard problem: given a graph $G$, construct a spanning tree $T$ of $G$ minimizing its maximum edge congestion where the congestion of an edge $e\in T$ is the number of edges $uv$ in $G$ such that the unique path between $u$ and $v$ in $T$ passes through $e$; the optimal value for a given graph $G$ is denoted $STC(G)$.
  It is known that every spanning tree is an $n/2$-approximation for the STP problem. A long-standing problem is to design a better approximation algorithm. Our contribution towards this goal is an $O(\Delta\cdot\log^{3/2}n)$-approximation algorithm where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree in $G$ and $n$ the number of vertices. For graphs with a maximum degree bounded by a polylog of the number of vertices, this is an exponential improvement over the previous best approximation.
  Our main tool for the algorithm is a new lower bound on the spanning tree congestion which is of independent interest. Denoting by $hb(G)$ the hereditary bisection of $G$ which is the maximum bisection width over all subgraphs of $G$, we prove that for every graph $G$, $STC(G)\geq \Omega(hb(G)/\Delta)$.</description>
