      <title>Can the effect of an external gravitational field be incorporated in the classical kinetic theory of gases?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposed an extension of the classical kinetic theory of gases (CKTG) that incorporates the gravitational effect on the motions of molecular particles. First, we rederived the CKTG in terms of the kinetics of constituent particles to account for the effect of accelerating particles by external gravitational fields. Consequently, we obtained an extended expression for the virial pressure in molecular dynamics under external potential fields. As indicated by our theoretical model, a pressure difference in the gravitational direction was observed in our particle collision simulations. Further analysis proved that if the external potential energy of each particle was sufficiently small (but not negligible compared to its kinetic energy), a pressure difference emerged between the walls while still maintaining the properties of equilibrium statistical mechanics, following the Maxwell--Boltzmann distribution. Notably, our model was formulated based on only fundamental knowledge of physics and is therefore suitable for educational purposes. Thus, this study obtained fundamental insights into the kinetic theory of gases under gravitational fields that are expected to be useful for both education and practical applications.</description>

      <title>New algorithm of measuring gravitational wave radiation from rotating binary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to investigate the gravitational wave (GW) radiation, without appealing to the tensorial formalism of the linearized general relativity, we formulate the so-called modified linearized general relativity (MLGR). As an application of the MLGR, we construct a novel paradigm of measuring the GW radiation from a binary system of compact objects, to theoretically interpret their phenomenology. To do this, we formulate the mass scalar and mass vector potentials for the merging binary compact objects, from which we construct the mass magnetic field in addition to the mass electric one which also includes the mass vector potential effect. Next, defining the mass Poyinting vector in terms of the mass electric and mass magnetic fields, we construct the GW radiation intensity profile possessing a prolate ellipsoid geometry due to the merging binary compact objects source. At a given radial distance from the binary compact objects, the GW radiation intensity on the revolution axis of the binary compact objects is shown to be twice that on the equatorial plane. Moreover, we explicitly obtain the total radiation power of the GW, which has the same characteristic as that of the electromagnetic wave in the rotating charge electric dipole moment. We also find that, in no distorting limit of the merging binary compact objects, the compact objects do not yield the total GW radiation power, consistent with the result of the linearized general relativity.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of an $E_8$ model of elementary particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are many ways to embed the Lie groups of the Standard Model of Particle Physics in a Lie group of type $E_8$, but so far there is no convincing demonstration that the finite symmetries (and asymmetries) of weak hypercharge, three generations of electrons, three quarks in a proton, and photon polarisation can also be embedded correctly. I show that there is a unique way to embed these finite symmetries consistently, and that the gauge groups of the Standard Model are then uniquely determined. The model is automatically chiral, and the generation symmetry acts as a rotation in a real 2-space, so that the spinors for three generations have only twice as many degrees of freedom in total as the spinors for a single generation. In fact, two distinct generation symmetries arise from the restriction to the Standard Model, related by the CKM and/or PMNS matrices. It therefore appears that these two matrices are not independent. I further speculate on the implications for quantum gravity.</description>
