      <title>Selling Multiple Items to a Unit-Demand Buyer via Automated Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding the optimal (revenue-maximizing) mechanism to sell multiple items has been a prominent and notoriously difficult open problem. Existing work has mainly focused on deriving analytical results tailored to a particular class of problems (for example, Giannakopoulos (2015) and Yang (2023)). The present paper explores the possibility of a generally applicable methodology of the Automated Mechanism Design (AMD). We first employ the deep learning algorithm developed by D\"utting et al. (2023) to numerically solve small-sized problems, and the results are then generalized by educated guesswork and finally rigorously verified through duality. By focusing on a single buyer who can consume one item, our approach leads to two key contributions: establishing a much simpler way to verify the optimality of a wide range of problems and discovering a completely new result about the optimality of grand bundling. First, we show that selling each item at an identical price (or equivalently, selling the grand bundle of all items) is optimal for any number of items when the value distributions belong to a class that includes the uniform distribution as a special case. Different items are allowed to have different distributions. Second, for each number of items, we established necessary and sufficient conditions that $c$ must satisfy for grand bundling to be optimal when the value distribution is uniform over an interval $[c, c + 1]$. This latter model does not satisfy the previously known sufficient conditions for the optimality of grand bundling Haghpanah and Hartline (2021). Our results are in contrast to the only known results for $n$ items (for any $n$), Giannakopoulos (2015) and Daskalakis et al. (2017), which consider a single buyer with additive preferences, where the values of items are narrowly restricted to i.i.d. according to a uniform or exponential distribution.</description>

      <title>Prior-Independent Bidding Strategies for First-Price Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-price auctions are one of the most popular mechanisms for selling goods and services, with applications ranging from display advertising to timber sales. Unlike their close cousin, the second-price auction, first-price auctions do not admit a dominant strategy. Instead, each buyer must design a bidding strategy that maps values to bids -- a task that is often challenging due to the lack of prior knowledge about competing bids. To address this challenge, we conduct a principled analysis of prior-independent bidding strategies for first-price auctions using worst-case regret as the performance measure. First, we develop a technique to evaluate the worst-case regret for (almost) any given value distribution and bidding strategy, reducing the complex task of ascertaining the worst-case competing-bid distribution to a simple line search. Next, building on our evaluation technique, we minimize worst-case regret and characterize a minimax-optimal bidding strategy for every value distribution. We achieve it by explicitly constructing a bidding strategy as a solution to an ordinary differential equation, and by proving its optimality for the intricate infinite-dimensional minimax problem underlying worst-case regret minimization. Our construction provides a systematic and computationally-tractable procedure for deriving minimax-optimal bidding strategies. When the value distribution is continuous, it yields a deterministic strategy that maps each value to a single bid. We also show that our minimax strategy significantly outperforms the uniform-bid-shading strategies advanced by prior work. Our result allows us to precisely quantify, through minimax regret, the performance loss due to a lack of knowledge about competing bids. We leverage this to analyze the impact of the value distribution on the performance loss, and find that it decreases as the buyer's values become more dispersed.</description>

      <title>Strategyproof Maximum Matching under Dichotomous Agent Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a two-sided matching problem in which the agents on one side have dichotomous preferences and the other side representing institutions has strict preferences (priorities). It captures several important applications in matching market design in which the agents are only interested in getting matched to an acceptable institution. These include centralized daycare assignment and healthcare rationing. We present a compelling new mechanism that satisfies many prominent and desirable properties including individual rationality, maximum size, fairness, Pareto-efficiency on both sides, strategyproofness on both sides, non-bossiness and having polynomial time running time. As a result, we answer an open problem whether there exists a mechanism that is agent-strategyproof, maximum, fair and non-bossy.</description>
