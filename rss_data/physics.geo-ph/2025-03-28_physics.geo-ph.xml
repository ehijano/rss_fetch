      <title>When Cubic Law and Darcy Fail: Correcting Model Misspecification in Fracture Conductivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainties in the subsurface challenge reliable leakage risk assessments and long-term integrity of CO2 storage. Fault zones, characterised by multi-scale heterogeneities, are critical pathways for leakage and suffer from significant data uncertainties due to unresolved features. Understanding the multi-scale uncertainties in estimating fracture network conductivity is essential for mitigating leakage risks and ensuring reliable modelling of upscaled fault leakage rates. However, current models fail to capture all fault zone heterogeneity, particularly fracture surface roughness effects on fluid migration. Simplified assumptions, such as the Cubic Law based on mechanical aperture measurements, lead to erroneous models known as model misspecifications and introduce modelling uncertainty in leakage predictions. Here, we develop an AI-driven framework to address data uncertainties and correct model misspecifications in estimating fracture conductivities. By automatically integrating small-scale uncertainties, including fracture surface roughness, and leveraging their interactions across scales, we improve upon traditional empirical corrections. We combine physics-based constraints with adaptive, data-driven and geometric corrections to infer the hydraulic aperture governing fluid flow in fractures with varying roughness. This approach generates reliable local permeability maps that account for roughness effects and discrepancies between mechanical and hydraulic apertures, accurately reflecting overall fracture conductivity. By propagating uncertainties from individual fractures to network scales, our approach will support robust calibration of conductivity ranges for fault leakage sensitivity analyses, not only resolving uncertainties in fracture-scale modelling but also enabling efficient integration into larger-scale simulations to enhance predictions for subsurface CO2 storage.</description>

      <title>Delayed dynamic triggering and enhanced high-frequency seismic radiation due to brittle rock damage in 3D multi-fault rupture simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a novel high-performance computing implementation of a nonlinear continuum damage breakage model, we explore interactions between 3D co-seismic off-fault damage, seismic radiation, and rupture dynamics. Our simulations demonstrate that off-fault damage enhances high-frequency wave radiation above 1~Hz, reduces rupture speed and alters the total kinetic energy. We identify distinct damage regimes separated by solid-granular transition, with smooth distributions under low damage conditions transitioning to localized, mesh-independent shear bands upon reaching brittle failure. The shear band orientations depend systematically on the background stress and agree with analytical predictions. The brittle damage inhibits transitions to supershear rupture propagation and the rupture front strain field results in locally reduced damage accumulation during supershear transition. The dynamically generated damage yields uniform and isotropic ratios of fault-normal to fault-parallel high-frequency ground motions. Co-seismic damage zones exhibit depth-dependent width variations, becoming broader near the Earth's surface consistent with field observations, even under uniform stress conditions. We discover a new delayed dynamic triggering mechanism in multi-fault systems, driven by reductions in elastic moduli and the ensuing stress heterogeneity in 3D tensile fault step-overs. This mechanism affects the static and dynamic stress fields and includes the formation of high shear-traction fronts around localized damage zones. The brittle damage facilitates rupture cascading across faults, linking delay times directly to damage rheology and fault zone evolution. Our results help explain enhanced high-frequency seismic radiation and delayed rupture triggering, improving our understanding of earthquake processes, seismic radiation and fault system interactions.</description>

      <title>The Fe-Ni phase diagram and the Earth's inner core structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fe-Ni alloy is believed to be the main component of Earth's core. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of phase equilibria near the melting point of this alloy under core conditions is still lacking, leaving the effect of nickel inconclusive. Using ab initio simulations, we computed Gibbs free energy and phase diagram for liquid and solid solutions of the Fe-Ni alloy under conditions close to the inner core, considering inner-shell electron contributions and non-ideal mixing effects. The Fe-Ni phase diagram provides crucial insights for understanding previous experimental observations and crystallization simulations of the Fe-Ni alloy under core conditions. It also presents new scenarios for inner core structures, suggesting bcc-liquid coexistence at the inner core boundary and the possibility of multi-layer structures consisting of bcc-hcp composites within the inner core. Our work clarifies nickel's substantial impact on the inner core structure, providing new constraints for the study of core's composition and formation.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Deployable Solar Panels on GRACE-like Satellites by Closed-Loop Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future satellite gravimetry missions seek to surpass the performance of CHAMP, GOCE, GRACE, and GRACE-FO to meet increasing scientific and operational demands. These missions will integrate advanced technologies, including optical and quantum accelerometers, high-precision inter-satellite laser ranging, and micro-Newton electric thrusters. However, increased power demands for sensors and propulsion systems require larger solar panels, constrained by payload mass and launcher limitations. This study assesses the impact of modified satellite shapes on gravity field recovery (GFR) using closed-loop simulation. Five satellite configurations were analyzed: a standard shape and variations with single and double solar panels mounted on the top and bottom of the satellite body, each modeled with distinct finite element models and moments of inertia. Orbit simulations accounted for non-spherical static gravity and time-variable non-gravitational forces. Performance of a simplified gravitational reference sensor (SGRS) with optical interferometer test mass displacement readout was evaluated. The air drag coefficient, a complex parameter influenced by multiple factors, was varied from 2.25 (standard) to 4.5 (double-panel). Time-variable gravity background models were excluded to isolate instrument performance effects. Gravity models were evaluated in the spectral domain using Degree RMS of spherical harmonic coefficient differences. Discrepancies between configurations stemmed primarily from variations in SGRS actuation noise due to satellite cross-sectional area. Convergence of residuals in the spectral domain for the double-panel configuration under different drag coefficients confirmed the dominant role of SGRS performance in GFR accuracy.</description>

      <title>Structure and Melting of Fe, MgO, SiO2, and MgSiO3 in Planets: Database, Inversion, and Phase Diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present globally inverted pressure-temperature (P-T) phase diagrams up to 5,000 GPa for four fundamental planetary materials, Fe, MgO, SiO2, and MgSiO3, derived from logistic regression and supervised learning, together with an experimental phase equilibria database. These new P-T phase diagrams provide a solution to long-standing disputes about their melting curves. Their implications extend to the melting and freezing of rocky materials in the interior of giant planets and super-Earth exoplanets, contributing to the refinement of their internal structure models.</description>

      <title>On the recent seismic activity at Ioannina (Greece): Pre-earthquake electromagnetic emissions with critical and tricritical behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:1610.06220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short paper we report that the dynamics of the earthquake (EQ) preparation processes, as embedded in the observed fracture-induced electromagnetic emissions (EME), were characterized by critical and then tricritical behavior a few days before the occurrence of the recent Ioannina (Greece) earthquake [($39.79^o N, 20.69^o E$), 15 October 2016, $M_L=5.3$]. Specifically, an excerpt of the MHz EME recorded by our remote telemetric station near the city of Ioannina five days before the EQ was found to possess critical characteristics, followed by an excerpt possessing tricritical characteristics. The analysis was performed by means of the method of critical fluctuations (MCF). Interestingly, spontaneous symmetry breaking was identified between critical and tricritical behavior.</description>

      <title>Ab initio superionic-liquid phase diagram of Fe1-xOx under Earth's inner core conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superionic state is a unique phase of matter in which liquid-like ion mobility coexists within a solid crystalline lattice. Recently discovered in Earth's inner core, this state has been extensively studied for its kinetic properties and geophysical impact. However, the equilibrium between the superionic phase and the liquid solution under core conditions remains unexplored. Here we present a thermodynamic method to calculate the Gibbs free energy and construct the ab initio superionic-liquid phase diagram for the Fe1-xOx system under inner core (IC) boundary conditions. We find that oxygen forms superionic states in both hcp and bcc iron in the IC, influencing iron's cooperative diffusion in the bcc phase. The stability fields of these superionic phases depend strongly on oxygen stoichiometry. Our results suggest that the oxygen concentration in the IC is higher than previously estimated due to the presence of superionic states. Our work provides a framework for studying superionic-liquid equilibria in planetary interiors.</description>

      <title>Unified Mechanical Erosion Model for Multi-phase Mass Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Erosion poses a great challenge in multi-phase mass flows as it drastically changes flow behavior and deposition pattern by dramatically increasing their masses, adversely affecting population and civil structures. There exists no mechanically-explained, unified multi-phase erosion model. We constitute a novel, unified and comprehensive mechanical erosion rates for solid and fluid phases and demonstrate their richness and urgency. This is achieved by seminally introducing interacting stresses across erosion-interface. Shear resistances from the bed against shear stresses from the landslide are based on consistent physical principles including frictional, collisional and viscous stresses. Proposed multi-phase interactive shear structures are mechanically superior and dynamically flexible. Total erosion rate is the sum of solid and fluid erosion rates which are mechanically extensive and compact. Erosion rates consistently take solid and fluid fractions from the bed and customarily supply to solid and fluid components in the flow. This overcomes severe limitations inherited by existing models. For the first time, we physically correctly construct composite, intricate erosion velocities of particle and fluid from the bed and architect the complete net momentum productions that include all interactions between solids and fluids in the landslide and bed. We invent stress correction, erosive-shear-velocity, super-erosion-drift and erosion-matrix characterizing erosion processes. By embedding well constrained extensive erosion velocities, unified erosion rates and net momentum productions including erosion-induced inertia into mass and momentum balances, we develop a novel, mechanically-explained, comprehensive multi-phase model for erosive mass flows. The new model offers great opportunities for practitioners in solving technical, engineering problems related to erosive multi-phase mass flows.</description>
