      <title>Symplectic Representation of the Ginzburg-Landau Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the Ginzburg-Landau theory is represented on a symplectic manifold with a phase space content. The order parameter is defined by a quasi-probability amplitude, which gives rise to a quasi-probability distribution function, i.e., a Wigner-type function. The starting point is the thermal group representation of Euclidean symmetries and gauge symmetry. Well-known basic results on the behavior of a superconductor are re-derived, providing the consistency of representation. The critical superconducting current density is determined and its usual behavior is inferred. The negativety factor associated with the quasi-distribution function is analyzed, providing information about the non-classicality nature of the superconductor state in the region closest to the edge of the superconducting material.</description>

      <title>On the trapped magnetic moment in type-II superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the trapped (remanent) magnetic moment, $M_{trap}\left(H\right)$, when a small magnetic field $H$ is turned off after cooling below the superconducting transition temperature, $T_c$, or ramping a magnetic field up and down after cooling in a zero field, have advantages in difficult cases of small samples and large field-dependent backgrounds, which is relevant for hydrogen-based ultra-high-$T_{c}$ superconductors (UHTS). Until recently, there was no need for a separate paper on the trapped magnetic flux for well-known critical state models due to the simplicity of the physics involved. However, recent publications showed the need for such an analysis. This note summarizes the expectations for the Bean model with constant critical current density and the Kim model with field-dependent critical currents. It is shown that if the trapped moment is fitted to the power law, $M_{trap}\propto H^{\alpha}$, the fixed exponent $\alpha=2$ is exact for the Bean model, while Kim models show a wide interval of possible values, $2\leq\alpha\leq4$. Furthermore, accounting for reversible magnetization expands the range of possible exponents to $1\leq\alpha\leq4$. In addition, demagnetizing factors are essential and make the trapped moment orientation dependent even in isotropic materials.
  As a concrete application, it is shown that flux trapping experiments on H$_{3}$S UHTS compounds can be described well using this generalized approach, lending further support to the type-II superconducting nature of H$_{3}$S under ultra-high pressure.</description>

      <title>Magnetoresistance hysteresis in the superconduting state of Kagome CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hysteresis of magnetoresistance observed in superconductors is of great interest due to its potential connection with unconventional superconductivity. In this study, we perform electrical transport measurements on Kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ nanoflakes and uncover unusual hysteretic behaviour of magnetoresistance in the superconducting state. This hysteresis can be induced by applying either a large DC or AC current at temperatures ($T$) well below the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$). As $T$ approaches $T_{\rm c}$, similar weak hysteresis is also be detected by applying a small current. Various scenarios are discussed, with particular focus on the effects of vortex pinning and the presence of time-reversal-symmtery-breaking superconducting domains. Our findings support the latter, hinting at chiral superconductivity in Kagome superconductors.</description>

      <title>Efficient Modelling of Anharmonicity and Quantum Effects in PdCuH$_2$ with Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum nuclear effects and anharmonicity impact a wide range of functional materials and their properties. One of the most powerful techniques to model these effects is the Stochastic Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SSCHA). Unfortunately, the SSCHA is extremely computationally expensive, prohibiting its routine use. We propose a protocol that pairs machine learning interatomic potentials, which can be tailored for the system at hand via active learning, with the SSCHA. Our method leverages an upscaling procedure that allows for the treatment of supercells of up to thousands of atoms with practically minimal computational effort. The protocol is applied to PdCuH$_x$ ($x = 0-2$) compounds, chosen because previous experimental studies have reported superconducting critical temperatures, $T_\text{c}$s, as high as 17~K at ambient pressures in an unknown hydrogenated PdCu phase. We identify a $P4/mmm$ PdCuH$_2$ structure, which is shown to be dynamically stable only upon the inclusion of quantum fluctuations, as being a key contributor to the measured superconductivity. For this system, our methodology is able to reduce the computational expense for the SSCHA calculations by $\sim$96\%. The proposed protocol opens the door towards the routine inclusion of quantum nuclear motion and anharmonicity in materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Pairing amplification induced by nonadiabatic effects on the electron-phonon interaction throughout the BCS-BEC crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic effects in the electron-phonon coupling are important whenever the ratio between the phononic and the electronic energy scales, the adiabatic ratio, is non negligible. For superconducting systems, this gives rise to additional diagrams in the superconducting self-energy, the vertex and cross corrections. In this work we explore these corrections in a two-dimensional single-band system through the crossover between the weak-coupling BCS and strong-coupling Bose-Einstein regimes. By focusing on the pseudogap phase, we identify the parameter range in which the pairing amplitude is amplified by nonadiabatic effects and map them throughout the BCS-BEC crossover. These effects become stronger as the system is driven deeply in the crossover regime, for phonon frequencies of the order of the hopping energy and for large enough electron-phonon coupling. Finally, we provide the phase space regions in which the effects of nonadiabaticity are more relevant for unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Inductance, Quantum Geometry, and Superconductivity in Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) is a topic of keen interest in moir\'e systems research, and it may provide insight into the pairing mechanism of other strongly correlated materials such as high-$T_{\mathrm{c}}$ superconductors. Here, we use DC-transport and microwave circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) to measure directly the superfluid stiffness of superconducting MATBG via its kinetic inductance. We find the superfluid stiffness to be much larger than expected from conventional single-band Fermi liquid theory; rather, it aligns well with theory involving quantum geometric effects that are dominant at the magic angle. The temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness exhibits a power-law behavior, which contraindicates an isotropic BCS model; instead, the extracted power-law exponents indicate an anisotropic superconducting gap, whether interpreted using the conventional anisotropic BCS model or a quantum geometric theory of flat-band superconductivity. Moreover, the quadratic dependence of the stiffness on both DC and microwave current is consistent with Ginzburg-Landau theory. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest a connection between quantum geometry, superfluid stiffness, and unconventional superconductivity in MATBG. Finally, the combined DC-microwave measurement platform used here is applicable to the investigation of other atomically thin superconductors.</description>

      <title>Superfluid stiffness of twisted multilayer graphene superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The robustness of the macroscopic quantum nature of a superconductor can be characterized by the superfluid stiffness, $\rho_s$, a quantity that describes the energy required to vary the phase of the macroscopic quantum wave function. In unconventional superconductors, such as cuprates, the low-temperature behavior of $\rho_s$ drastically differs from that of conventional superconductors due to quasiparticle excitations from gapless points (nodes) in momentum space. Intensive research on the recently discovered magic-angle twisted graphene family has revealed, in addition to superconducting states, strongly correlated electronic states associated with spontaneously broken symmetries, inviting the study of $\rho_s$ to uncover the potentially unconventional nature of its superconductivity. Here we report the measurement of $\rho_s$ in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (TTG), revealing unconventional nodal-gap superconductivity. Utilizing radio-frequency reflectometry techniques to measure the kinetic inductive response of superconducting TTG coupled to a microwave resonator, we find a linear temperature dependence of $\rho_s$ at low temperatures and nonlinear Meissner effects in the current bias dependence, both indicating nodal structures in the superconducting order parameter. Furthermore, the doping dependence shows a linear correlation between the zero temperature $\rho_s$ and the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$, reminiscent of Uemura's relation in cuprates, suggesting phase-coherence-limited superconductivity. Our results provide strong evidence for nodal superconductivity in TTG and put strong constraints on the mechanisms of these graphene-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Magnetochiral vortex ratchet effect in two-dimensional arrays of $\varphi_0$-Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate transport in 2D arrays of multiterminal $\varphi_0$-junctions. When applying an in-plane magnetic field we observe nonreciprocal vortex depinning currents, induced by a ratchet-like pinning potential. The ratchet effect is explained as a consequence of spontaneous supercurrents that arise in the presence of next-nearest neighbor Josephson couplings. Tuning the density of vortices to commensurate values of the frustration parameter results in an enhancement of the ratchet effect. In addition, we find a surprising sign reversal of the ratchet effect near frustration 1/3.</description>

      <title>Electron-electron attraction via Coulomb correlations and possible superconductivity in a 1D electron liquid on a rigid neutralizing background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditions at which a quasi-one-dimensional (1D) electron system can be considered as a quantum liquid of impenetrable charged particles are theoretically analyzed. In the presence of an inert, neutralizing background, a motion of impenetrable electrons is shown to expose a positive charge, resulting in an effective mutual attraction of infinite range. As a result, all electrons are involved in the long-range pairing. A model of spinless fermions with infinitesimal attraction of infinite range is proposed to describe the excitation spectrum and the superconducting gap in low-density 1D electron channels. In contrast with the conventional theory, the energy gap does not contain exponentially small factors. It depends mostly on the Coulombic parameters of the system, which guides practical aspects of high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states in NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial structure of in-gap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bound states induced by a magnetic impurity in a superconductor is the essential ingredient for the possibility of engineering collective impurity states. Recently, a saddle-point approximation [Phys. Rev. B 105, 144503] revealed how the spatial form of a YSR state is controlled by an anisotropic exponential decay length, and an anisotropic prefactor, which depends on the Fermi velocity and Fermi-surface curvature. Here we analyze STM data on YSR states in NbSe$_2$, focusing on a key issue that the exponential decay length predicted theoretically from the small superconducting gap is much larger than the observed extent of YSR states. We confirm that the exponential decay can be neglected in the analysis of the anisotropy. Instead, we extract the anisotropic prefactor directly from the data, matching it to the theoretical prediction, and we establish that the theoretical expression for the prefactor alone captures the characteristic flower-like shape of the YSR state. Surprisingly, we find that up to linear order in the superconducting gap the anisotropic prefactor that determines the shape of YSR states is the same as the anisotropic response to the impurity in the underlying normal metal. Our work points out the correct way to analyze STM data on impurities in small-gap superconductors, and reveals the importance of the normal band structure's curvature and Fermi velocity in designing multi-impurity in-gap states in superconductors.</description>

      <title>High-Tc superconductor candidates proposed by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We cast the relation between chemical compositions of solid-state materials and their superconducting critical temperature (Tc) in terms of a statistical learning problem with reduced complexity. Training of query-aware similarity-based ridge regression models on experimental SuperCon data with (implicit) and without (ambient) high pressure entries achieves average Tc prediction errors of ~10 K for unseen out-of-sample materials. Subsequent utilization of the approach to scan ~153k materials in the Materials Project enables the ranking of candidates by Tc while taking into account thermodynamic stability and small band gap. Stable top three high-Tc candidate materials with large band gaps for implicit and ambient pressures are predicted to be Cs2Sn(H2N)6 (324 K), CsH5N2 (315K), Rb2Sn(H2N)6 (305 K), and H15IrBr3N5 (189 K), H12OsN5Cl3O (161 K), B10H13I (151 K), respectively. Stable top three high-Tc candidate materials with small band gaps for implicit and ambient pressures are predicted to be RbLiH12Se3N4 (255 K), CeH14Cl3O7 (246 K), Li(H3N)4 (234 K), and ReH30Ru2(NCl)10 (127 K), AlH18Ru(NF)6 (120 K), Sr(Li2P)2 (117 K), respectively.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Many-Body Quantum Correlations in Superconducting Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in superconducting circuit technology have made the fabrication of large, customizable circuits routine. This has led to their application to areas beyond quantum information and, in particular, to their use as quantum simulators. A key challenge in this effort has been the identification of the quantum states realized by these circuits. Here, we propose a probe circuit capable of reading out many-body correlations in an analog quantum simulator. Our measurement scheme, designed for many-photon states, exploits the non-linearity of the Josephson junction to measure two-point (and potentially higher-order) correlation functions of the superconducting phase operator. We demonstrate the capabilities of this design in the context of an LC-ladder with a quantum impurity. The proposed probe allows for the measurement of inherently quantum correlations, such as squeezing, and has the potential to significantly expand the scope of analog quantum simulations using superconducting circuits.</description>

Abstract: We compute the structure of flux $h/(2e)$ vortices in a $d$-wave superconductor using a continuum SU(2) gauge theory of 2 flavors of charge $e$, SU(2)-fundamental Higgs bosons. Period-2 charge order is present near the vortex center. Upon coupling the electrons to the superconducting and charge order parameters, we find that the electronic local density of states does not have a zero-bias peak, in contrast to BCS theory. But there are sub-gap peaks at positive and negative bias, and these exhibit anti-phase periodic spatial modulations, as observed in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments in the underdoped cuprates (K. Matsuba et al., J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 76, 063704 (2007)).</description>

      <title>The interplay between a pseudogap and superconductivity in a two-dimensional Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly correlated electrons systems may exhibit a variety of interesting phenomena, for instance, superconductivity and pseudogap, as is the case of cuprates and pnictides. In strongly correlated electron systems, it is considered essential to understand, not only the nature of the pseudogap, but also the relationship between superconductivity and the pseudogap. In order to address this question, in the present work, we investigated a one-band Hubbard model treated by the Green's function method within an n-pole approximation. In the strongly correlated regime, antiferromagnetic correlations give rise to nearly flat band regions in the nodal points of the quasiparticle bands. As a consequence, a pseudogap emerges at the antinodal points of the Fermi surface. The obtained results indicate that the same antiferromagnetic correlations responsible for a pseudogap, can also favor superconductivity, providing an increase in the superconducting critical temperature Tc.</description>

      <title>Intertwined superconductivity and orbital selectivity in a three-orbital Hubbard model for the iron pnictides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a three-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori model relevant for iron-based superconductors using variational wave functions, which explicitly include spatial correlations and electron pairing. We span the nonmagnetic sector ranging from a filling $n=4$, which is representative of undoped iron-based superconductors, to $n=3$. In the latter case, a Mott insulating state is found, with each orbital at half filling. In the strong-coupling regime, when the electron density is increased, we find a spontaneous differentiation between the occupation of $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals, which leads to an orbital-selective state with a nematic character that becomes stronger at increasing density. One of these orbitals stays half filled for all densities while the other one hosts (together with the $d_{xy}$ orbital) the excess of electron density. Most importantly, in this regime, long-range pairing correlations appear in the orbital with the largest occupation. Our results highlight a strong link between orbital-selective correlations, nematicity, and superconductivity, which requires the presence of a significant Hund's coupling.</description>

      <title>Why Matthiessen's rule is violated in the high-$T_{c}$ cuprate superconductors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The perfect linear-in-$T$ dc resistivity in the strange metal phase of the high-$T_{c}$ cuprate superconductors is probably the most prominent manifestation of their non-Fermi liquid nature. A major puzzle about the strange metal behavior is that there is no discernible change in the trend of the dc resistivity at a temperature when we expect the electron-phonon coupling to play an essential role. The empirical Matthiessen's rule of summation of the resistivity from different scattering channels seems to be simply violated. On the other hand, the electron-phonon coupling has long been proposed to be responsible for the various spectral anomalies observed in the cuprate superconductors. In particular, the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode of the oxygen ion in the $CuO_{2}$ plane is proposed to be responsible for the peak-dip-hump spectral shape around the anti-nodal point. Here we show that the coupling to the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode is strongly suppressed by the vertex correction from the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in the system as a result of the destructive interference between electron-phonon matrix element at momentum differ by the antiferromagnetic wave vector. In the real space scenario, such a destructive interference effect simply amounts to the fact that the electron hopping between nearest-neighboring sites is suppressed by the antiferromagnetic spin correlation between the electrons. More generally, we argue that the electron-phonon coupling strength in the cuprate superconductors should diminish with the proximity of the Mott insulating phase as a result of similar vertex correction from the electron correlation effect. We think that this offers an interpretation for the violation of the Matthiessen's rule in the dc resistivity of the strange metal phase of the cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Fermi pockets on Hund's metal surface of Sr2RuO4 induced by the correlation-enhanced spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic structure of the topmost layer in Sr2RuO4 in the close vicinity of the Fermi level is investigated by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) with a 7-eV laser. We find that the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) predicted as 100 meV by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations is enormously enhanced in a real material up to 250 meV, even more than that of bulk state (200 meV), by the electron-correlation effect increased by the octahedral rotation in the crystal structure. This causes the formation of highly orbital-mixing small Fermi pockets and reasonably explains why the orbital-selective Mott transition (OSMT) is not realized in perovskite oxides with crystal distortion. Interestingly, Hund's metal feature allows the quasiparticle generation only near EF, restricting the spectral gap opening derived by band hybridization within an extremely small binding energy (&lt; 10 meV). Furthermore, it causes coherent-incoherent crossover, making the Fermi pockets disappear at elevated temperatures. The anomalous Fermi pockets are characterized by the dichotomy of the orbital-isolating Hund's coupling and the orbital-mixing SOC, which is key to understanding the nature of Sr2RuO4.</description>

      <title>Quantum vortices in fermionic superfluids: from ultracold atoms to neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superfluid dilute neutron matter and ultracold gas, close to the unitary regime, exhibit several similarities. Therefore, to a certain extent, fermionic ultracold gases may serve as emulators of dilute neutron matter, which forms the inner crust of neutron stars and is not directly accessed experimentally. Quantum vortices are one of the most significant properties of neutron superfluid, essential for comprehending neutron stars' dynamics. The structure and dynamics of quantum vortices as a function of pairing correlations' strength are being investigated experimentally and theoretically in ultracold gases. Certain aspects of these studies are relevant to neutron stars. We provide an overview of the characteristics of quantum vortices in s-wave-type fermionic and electrically neutral superfluids. The main focus is on the dynamics of fermionic vortices and their intrinsic structure.</description>

      <title>Optical and Raman selection rules for odd-parity clean superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive selection rules in optical absorption and Raman scattering spectra, that can determine the parity of pairing order parameters under inversion symmetry in two classes of \emph{clean} superconductors: (i) chiral superconductors with strong spin-orbit couplings, (ii) singlet superconductors with negligible spin-orbit couplings. Experimentally, the inversion parity of pair wave functions can be determined by comparing the "optical gap" $\Delta_\text{op}$ in Raman and optical spectroscopy and the "thermodynamic gap" $2\Delta$ in specific heat measurements, and the selection rules apply when $\Delta_\text{op}&gt;2\Delta$. We demonstrate the selection rules in superconductivity in models of (i) doped Weyl semimetals and (ii) doped graphene. Our derivation is based on the relation between pairing symmetry and fermion projective symmetry group of a superconductor. We further derive similar selection rules for two-dimensional superconductors with 2-fold rotational symmetry, and discuss how they apply to the superconducting state in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate ion irradiation by argon or gallium as a wafer-scale post-processing method to increase disorder in superconducting thin films. We study several widely used superconductors, both single-elements and compounds. We show that ion irradiation increases normal-state resistivity in all our films, which is expected to enable tuning their superconducting properties, for example, toward higher kinetic inductance. We observe an increase of superconducting transition temperature for Al and MoSi, and a decrease for Nb, NbN, and TiN. In MoSi, ion irradiation also improves the mixing of the two materials. We demonstrate fabrication of an amorphous and homogeneous film of MoSi with uniform thickness, which is promising, e.g., for superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong laser pulses can control superconductivity, inducing non-equilibrium transient pairing by leveraging strong-light matter interaction. Here we demonstrate theoretically that equilibrium ground-state phonon-mediated superconductive pairing can be affected through the vacuum fluctuating electromagnetic field in a cavity. Using the recently developed ab initio quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory approximation, we specifically investigate the phonon-mediated superconductive behavior of MgB$_2$ under different cavity setups and find that in the strong light-matter coupling regime its superconducting transition temperature can be, in principles, enhanced by $\approx 73\%$ ($\approx 40\%$) in an in-plane (out-of-plane) polarized cavity. However, in a realistic cavity, we expect the T$_{\rm{c}}$ of MgB$_2$ can increase, at most, by $5$ K via photon vacuum fluctuations. The results highlight that strong light-matter coupling in extended systems can profoundly alter material properties in a non-perturbative way by modifying their electronic structure and phononic dispersion at the same time. Our findings indicate a pathway to the experimental realization of light-controlled superconductivity in solid-state materials at equilibrium via cavity-material engineering.</description>

      <title>Spin and bond-charge excitation spectra in correlated electron systems near antiferromagnetic phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic and bond-charge interactions can arise from the same microscopic interaction. Motivated by this observation, we compute magnetic and bond-charge excitation spectra on an equal footing by introducing a simple effective model on a square lattice, which describes antiferromagnetic and d-wave superconducting phases around half-filling on the electron-doped side. The magnetic excitation spectrum Im chi(q, omega) has strong weight around q=(pi, pi) in low energy and its intensity map exhibits a pencil-tip-like shape in q-omega space. Around q=(0,0) magnetic excitations show a steep dispersion toward the (pi, pi) and (pi,0) directions, which is very similar to a spin-wave dispersion although the system is non-magnetic. Bond-charge excitations are characterized by four different symmetries and studied for all possible couplings. Bond-charge fluctuations with three different symmetries have large spectral weight around q=(pi, pi) in a relatively low-energy region and extend widely more than the magnetic excitation spectrum. The d-wave symmetry of bond-charge excitations also has sizable spectral weight along the direction (pi/2, pi/2)-(0, 0)-(pi/2, 0) in a low-energy region and exhibits softening around q approx (0.5 pi, 0), whereas no such softening is present in the other symmetries. These results capture the essential features observed in electron-doped cuprates and may motivate an experimental test of bond-charge excitations around q=(pi, pi) on top of the strong magnetic excitations there as well as additional softening in the d-wave channel in the (pi, pi)-(pi/2, pi/2) region at low temperatures near the magnetic phase. We extend the present analysis to the hole-doped side and highlight a contrast to the electron-doped side, which includes incommensurate correlations, electronic nematic correlations, and spin and bond-charge resonance modes in the superconducting state.</description>

Abstract: In metals, low-energy effective theories are characterized by a set of coupling functions. Among them, the angle-dependent Fermi momentum specifies the size and shape of Fermi surface. Since the Fermi momentum grows incessantly under the renormalization group flow, a metallic fixed point is defined only modulo a rescaling of Fermi momentum. In this paper, we discuss the physical consequences of this projective nature of fixed points for non-Fermi liquids with hot Fermi surfaces. The first is the absence of a unique dynamical critical exponent that dictates the relative scaling between energy and momentum. The second is mismatches between the scaling dimensions of couplings and their relevancy. Nonetheless, each projective fixed point is characterized by a few marginal and relevant coupling functions, and the notion of universality survives. We illustrate our findings by charting the space of projective fixed points and extracting their universal properties for the Ising-nematic quantum critical metal beyond the patch theory. To control the theory, we use the dimensional regularization scheme that tunes the co-dimension of Fermi surface. Near the upper critical dimension, two exactly marginal coupling functions span the space of stable projective fixed points: functions that specify the shape of the Fermi surface and the angle-dependent Fermi velocity. All other coupling functions, including the Landau functions and the universal pairing interaction, are fixed by those two marginal functions. With decreasing dimensions, the forward scattering remains irrelevant while the pairing interaction becomes relevant near two dimensions. In two dimensions, it is expected that the universal superconducting fluctuations lower the symmetry of the non-Fermi liquid realized above the superconducting transition temperatures from the loop U(1) group to a proper subgroup.</description>

      <title>The Kohn-Luttinger Effect in Dense Matter and its Implications for Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Repulsive short-range interactions can induce p-wave attraction between fermions in dense matter and lead to Cooper pairing at the Fermi surface. We investigate this phenomenon, well-known as the Kohn-Luttinger effect in condensed matter physics, in dense matter with strong short-range repulsive interactions. We find that repulsive interactions required to stabilize massive neutron stars can induce p-wave pairing in neutron and quark matter. When massive vector bosons mediate the interaction between fermions, the induced interaction favors Cooper pairing in the 3P2 channel. For the typical strength of the interaction favored by massive neutron stars, the associated pairing gaps in neutrons can be in the range of 10 keV to 10 MeV. Strong and attractive spin-orbit and tensor forces between neutrons can result in repulsive induced interactions that greatly suppress the 3P2 pairing gap in neutron matter. In quark matter, the induced interaction is too small to result in pairing gaps of phenomenological relevance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (YSYK) model provides a universal theory of quantum phase transitions in metals in the presence of quenched random spatial fluctuations in the local position of the quantum critical point. It has a Fermi surface coupled to a scalar field by spatially random Yukawa interactions. We present full numerical solutions of a self-consistent disorder averaged analysis of the YSYK model in both the normal and superconducting states, obtaining electronic spectral functions, frequency-dependent conductivity, and superfluid stiffness. Our results reproduce key aspects of observations in the cuprates as analyzed by Michon $et$ $al$. (Nat. Comm. $\bf{14}$, 3033 (2023)). We also find a regime of increasing zero temperature superfluid stiffness with decreasing superconducting critical temperature, as is observed in bulk cuprates.</description>
