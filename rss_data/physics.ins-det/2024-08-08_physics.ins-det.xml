      <title>Feasibility of a directional solar neutrino measurement with the CYGNO/INITIUM experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past five decades, solar neutrino research has been pivotal in driving significant scientific advancements, enriching our comprehension of both neutrino characteristics and solar processes. Despite numerous experiments dedicated to solar neutrino detection, a segment of the lower pp spectrum remains unexplored, while the precision of measurements from the CNO cycle remains insufficient to resolve the solar abundance problem determined by the discrepancy between the data gathered from helioseismology and the forecasts generated by stellar interior models for the Sun. The CYGNO/INITIUM experiment aims to deploy a large 30 m3 directional detector for rare event searches focusing on Dark Matter. Recently, in the CYGNUS collaboration, there has been consideration for employing these time projection chamber technology in solar neutrino directional detection trough neutrino-electron elastic scattering. This is due to their potential to conduct low-threshold, high-precision measurements with spectroscopic neutrino energy reconstruction on an event-by-event basis driven by the kinematic. However, so far, no experiments have been investigated on the feasibility of this measurement using actual detector performances and background levels. Such a detector already with a volume of O(10) m3 could perform an observation of solar neutrino from the pp chain with an unprecedented low threshold, while with larger volumes it could measure the CNO cycle eventually solving the solar metallicity problem.</description>

      <title>A tunable photonic band gap resonator for axion dark matter searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions are a well-motivated dark matter candidate particle. Haloscopes aim to detect axions in the galactic halo by measuring the photon signal resulting from axions interacting with a strong magnetic field. Existing haloscopes are primarily targeting axion masses which produce microwave-range photons and rely on microwave resonators to enhance the signal power. Only a limited subset of resonator modes are useful for this process, and current cylindrical-style cavities suffer from mode mixing and crowding from other fundamental modes. The majority of these modes can be eliminated by using photonic band gap (PBG) resonators. The band gap behavior of these structures allows for a resonator with mode selectivity based on frequency. We present results from the first tunable PBG resonator, a proof-of-concept design with a footprint compatible with axion haloscopes. We have thoroughly characterized the tuning range of two versions of the structure and report the successful confinement of the operating TM$_{010}$ mode and the elimination of all TE modes within the tuning range.</description>

      <title>Summary of the trigger systems of the Large Hadron Collider experiments ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments, triggers perform the important task of selecting, in real time, the data to be recorded and saved for physics analyses. As a result, trigger strategies play a key role in extracting relevant information from the vast streams of data produced at facilities like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). As the energy and luminosity of the collisions increase, these strategies must be upgraded and maintained to suit the experimental needs. This whitepaper compiled by the SMARTHEP Early Stage Researchers presents a high-level overview and reviews recent developments of triggering practices employed at the LHC. The general trigger principles applied at modern HEP experiments are highlighted, with specific reference to the current trigger state-of-the-art within the ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb collaborations. Furthermore, a brief synopsis of the new trigger paradigm required by the upcoming high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC is provided.</description>

      <title>A Modal Analysis of Electromagnetic Fields Coupling into an Open-Ended Waveguide Mounted on a Finite Flange: Evaluation of a Rectangular Waveguide with a Square Flange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a modal analysis based on the reciprocity theorem to calculate the coupled/penetrated fields into an open-ended waveguide mounted on a finite flange. Although there is no limitation on the geometry and type of the external source, an infinitesimal dipole is chosen to produce a plane wave incident to the waveguide aperture. The proposed method relates the amplitude of each penetrated mode into the waveguide to the far-field radiation components of that mode from the waveguide aperture. The accuracy of the final result depends on the accuracy of the calculated radiated fields. The radiated field components are calculated considering the reflected fields due to the aperture and the diffracted fields due to the flange edges. For the first time, the impact of a finite flange on the penetrated fields into a waveguide is discussed comprehensively. The geometry of a rectangular waveguide mounted on a thick square flange is selected to be evaluated. The effects of changing the main parameters of the geometry on the penetrated fields are discussed rigorously in various examples. Our results are compared with 3D full-wave simulations, and an excellent agreement was found between the results while our analytical approach showing a 60 times faster performance. In addition, we compared our results with the measurement reported in a previous study.</description>

      <title>Look What You Made Me Glue: SEMGluTM Enabled Alternative Cryogenic Sample Preparation Process for Cryogenic Atom Probe Tomography Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive efforts over the past number of years have been applied to develop workflows for sample preparation of specimens for atom probe tomography at cryogenic temperatures. This is primarily due to the difficulty involved in preparing site specific lift out samples at cryogenic temperatures without the assistance of the gas injection system (GIS) as using it under cryogenic conditions leads to nonuniform and difficult to control deposition. Building on the efforts of previously developed GIS free workflows utilising redeposition techniques, this work provides an alternative approach using SEMGluTM, which is an electron beam curing adhesive that remains usable at cryogenic temperatures, to both lift out cryogenically frozen samples, and mount these samples to Si microarray posts for subsequent redeposition welding. This approach is applicable for a full cryogenic workflow but is particularly useful for non-fully cryogenic workflows such as beam sensitive samples, samples that mill easily, and samples with challenging geometries. We demonstrate atom probe analysis of silicon samples in both laser pulsing and voltage mode prepared using this workflow, with comparable analytical performance to a pre-sharpened microtip coupon. An application-based example which directly benefits from this approach, correlative Liquid Cell Transmission Electron Microscopy and cryogenic Atom Probe Tomography sample preparation, is also shown.</description>

      <title>QuSpin Zero-Field Magnetometer Characterization for the TUCAN Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The TUCAN nEDM experiment characterizes the QuSpin Zero-Field Magnetometer (QZFM) to accurately map residual fields within a large magnetically shielded room. The magnetometer's intrinsic offset was measured to be within 3 nT and stable over a period of one year. The response was shown to be within 2 percent of linearity in the zero-field regime, up to 2 nTpp, and then follows a smooth dispersion curve. Crosstalk effects induced by multisensor operation were determined to have a small effect, and inconsequential with a separation above 6 cm. These results enable the QZFM for accurate measurement of DC fields, increase the operational range of QZFM by a factor of more than an order of magnitude, and allow for higher efficiency and flexibility by green-lighting simultaneous operation of multiple QZFMs.</description>

      <title>Results from ON-OFF analysis of the Neutrinos-Angra detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Neutrinos Angra Experiment, a water-based Cherenkov detector, is located at the Angra dos Reis nuclear power plant in Brazil. Designed to detect electron antineutrinos produced in the nuclear reactor, the primary objective of the experiment is to demonstrate the feasibility of monitoring reactor activity using an antineutrino detector. This effort aligns with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) program to identify potential and novel technologies applicable to nonproliferation safeguards. Operating on the surface presents challenges such as high noise rates, necessitating the development of very sensitive, yet small-scale detectors. These conditions make the Angra experiment an excellent platform for both developing the application and gaining expertise in new technologies and analysis methods. The detector employs a water-based target doped with gadolinium to enhance its sensitivity to antineutrinos. In this work, we describe the main features of the detector and the electronics chain, including front-end and data acquisition components. We detail the data acquisition strategies and the methodologies applied for signal processing and event selection. Preliminary physics results suggest that the detector can reliably monitor reactor operations by detecting the inverse beta decay induced by electron antineutrinos from the reactor.</description>

      <title>Self-calibrating Intelligent OCT-SLO System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A unique sample independent 3D self calibration methodology is tested on a unique optical coherence tomography and multi-spectral scanning laser ophthalmoscope (OCT-SLO) hybrid system. Operators visual cognition is replaced by computer vision using the proposed novel fully automatic AI-driven system design. Sample specific automatic contrast adjustment of the beam is achieved on the pre-instructed region of interest. The AI model deduces infrared, fluorescence, and visual spectrum optical alignment by estimating pre-instructed features quantitatively. The tested approach, however, is flexible enough to utilize any apt AI model. Relative comparison with classical signal-to-noise-driven automation is shown to be 200 percent inferior and 130 percent slower than the AI-driven approach. The best spatial resolution of the system is found to be (a) 2.41 microns in glass bead eye phantom, 0.76 with STD 0.46 microns in the mouse retina in the axial direction, and (b) better than 228 line pair per millimeter (lp per mm) or 2 microns for all three spectrums, i.e., 488 nm, 840 nm, and 520 to 550 nm emission in coronal, frontal or x-y plane. Intelligent automation reduces the possibility of developing cold cataracts (especially in mouse imaging) and patient-associated discomfort due to delay during manual alignment by facilitating easy handling for swift ocular imaging and better accuracy. The automatic novel tabletop compact system provides true functional 3D images in three different spectrums for dynamic sample profiles. This is especially useful for photodynamic imaging treatment.</description>
