      <title>Quantum Transfer Learning to Boost Dementia Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dementia is a devastating condition with profound implications for individuals, families, and healthcare systems. Early and accurate detection of dementia is critical for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. While classical machine learning and deep learning approaches have been explored extensively for dementia prediction, these solutions often struggle with high-dimensional biomedical data and large-scale datasets, quickly reaching computational and performance limitations. To address this challenge, quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising paradigm, offering faster training and advanced pattern recognition capabilities. This work aims to demonstrate the potential of quantum transfer learning (QTL) to enhance the performance of a weak classical deep learning model applied to a binary classification task for dementia detection. Besides, we show the effect of noise on the QTL-based approach, investigating the reliability and robustness of this method. Using the OASIS 2 dataset, we show how quantum techniques can transform a suboptimal classical model into a more effective solution for biomedical image classification, highlighting their potential impact on advancing healthcare technology.</description>

      <title>Sporadic Federated Learning Approach in Quantum Environment to Tackle Quantum Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging paradigm that combines quantum computing and federated learning (FL) to enable decentralized model training while maintaining data privacy over quantum networks. However, quantum noise remains a significant barrier in QFL, since modern quantum devices experience heterogeneous noise levels due to variances in hardware quality and sensitivity to quantum decoherence, resulting in inadequate training performance. To address this issue, we propose SpoQFL, a novel QFL framework that leverages sporadic learning to mitigate quantum noise heterogeneity in distributed quantum systems. SpoQFL dynamically adjusts training strategies based on noise fluctuations, enhancing model robustness, convergence stability, and overall learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that SpoQFL significantly outperforms conventional QFL approaches, achieving superior training performance and more stable convergence.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Quantum Layers in Classical Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical neural networks represent a promising frontier in the search for improved machine learning models. This thesis explores the integration of quantum layers within classical convolutional neural network architectures, aiming to leverage quantum entanglement and feature mapping to enhance learning capabilities. A detailed methodology for constructing and training such hybrid models is presented, using PyTorch and Qiskit Machine Learning frameworks. Experiments investigate the performance impact of inserting quantum layers at different stages of the neural network pipeline. The results suggest that quantum components can introduce meaningful transformations even with a limited number of qubits, motivating further research into scalable quantum machine learning. The full implementation is made publicly available, and future work will focus on expanding experimental evaluations and publishing additional findings.</description>

      <title>Unfolded distillation: very low-cost magic state preparation for biased-noise qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic state distillation enables universal fault-tolerant quantum computation by implementing non-Clifford gates via the preparation of high-fidelity magic states. However, it comes at the cost of substantial logical-level overhead in both space and time. In this work, we propose a very low-cost magic state distillation scheme for biased-noise qubits. By leveraging the noise bias, our scheme enables the preparation of a magic state with a logical error rate of $3 \times 10^{-7}$, using only 53 qubits and 5.5 error correction rounds, under a noise bias of $\eta \gtrsim 5 \times 10^6$ and a phase-flip noise rate of $0.1\%$. This reduces the circuit volume by more than one order of magnitude relative to magic state cultivation for unbiased-noise qubits and by more than two orders of magnitude relative to standard magic state distillation. Moreover, our scheme provides three key advantages over previous proposals for biased-noise qubits. First, it only requires nearest-neighbor two-qubit gates on a 2D lattice. Second, the logical fidelity remains nearly identical even at a more modest noise bias of $\eta \gtrsim 80$, at the cost of a slightly increased circuit volume. Third, the scheme remains effective even at high physical phase-flip rates, in contrast to previously proposed approaches whose circuit volume grows exponentially with the error rate. Our construction is based on unfolding the $X$ stabilizer group of the Hadamard 3D quantum Reed-Muller code in 2D, enabling distillation at the physical level rather than the logical level, and is therefore referred to as $\textit{unfolded}$ distillation.</description>

      <title>Spacetime duality between sequential and measurement-feedback circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two prevalent approaches for preparing long-range entangled quantum states are (i) linear-depth sequential unitary (SU) circuits, which apply local unitary gates sequentially, and (ii) constant-depth measurement-feedback (MF) circuits, which employ mid-circuit measurements and conditional feedback based on measurement outcomes. Here, we establish that a broad class of SU and MF circuits are dual to each other under a spacetime rotation. We investigate this spacetime duality in the preparation of various long-range entangled states, including GHZ states, topologically ordered states, and fractal symmetry-breaking states. As an illustration, applying a spacetime rotation to a linear-depth SU circuit that implements a non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality, originally used to prepare a 1D GHZ state, yields a constant-depth MF circuit that implements a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry gauging map, which equivalently prepares the GHZ state. Leveraging this duality, we further propose experimental protocols that require only a constant number of qubits to measure unconventional properties of 1D many-body states. These include (i) measurement of disorder operators, which diagnose the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking, and (ii) postselection-free detection of measurement-induced long-range order, which emerges in certain symmetry-protected topological phases. We also show that measurement-induced long-range order provides a lower bound for strange correlators, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Generic Entanglement Structure in Doped Matchgate Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free fermionic Gaussian, a.k.a. matchgate, random circuits exhibit atypical behavior compared to generic interacting systems. They produce anomalously slow entanglement growth, characterized by diffusive scaling $S(t) \sim \sqrt{t}$, and evolve into volume-law entangled states at late times, $S \sim N$, which are highly unstable to measurements. Here, we investigate how doping such circuits with non-Gaussian resources (gates) restores entanglement structures of typical dynamics. We demonstrate that ballistic entanglement growth $S(t) \sim t$ is recovered after injecting an extensive total amount of non-Gaussian gates, also restoring Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations. When the evolution is perturbed with measurements, we uncover a measurement-induced phase transition between an area-law and a power-law entangled phase, $S \sim N^\alpha$, with $\alpha$ controlled by the doping. A genuine volume-law entangled phase is recovered only when non-Gaussian gates are injected at an extensive rate. Our findings bridge the dynamics of free and interacting fermionic systems, identifying non-Gaussianity as a key resource driving the emergence of non-integrable behavior.</description>

      <title>Scalable dissipative quantum error correction for discrete-variable codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative quantum error correction (QEC) autonomously protects quantum information using engineered dissipation and offers a promising alternative to error correction via measurement and feedback. However, scalability remains a challenge, as correcting high-weight errors typically requires increasing dissipation rates and exponentially many correction operators. Here, we present a scalable dissipative QEC protocol for discrete-variable codes, correcting multi-qubit errors via a trickle-down mechanism that sequentially reduces errors weight. Our construction exploits redundancy in the Knill-Laflamme conditions to design correction operators that act on multiple error subspaces simultaneously, thereby reducing the overhead from exponential to polynomial in the number of required operators. We illustrate our approach with repetition codes under biased noise, showing a fourfold improvement in the exponential suppression factor at realistic physical error rates. Our approach connects autonomous QEC for discrete-variable codes with demonstrated dissipative protocols for bosonic codes and opens up new avenues for traditional measurement-feedback QEC and fault-tolerant quantum operations.</description>

      <title>Compensating connectivity restrictions in quantum annealers via splitting and linearization techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current quantum annealing experiments often suffer from restrictions in connectivity in the sense that only certain qubits can be coupled to each other. The most common strategy to overcome connectivity restrictions so far is by combining multiple physical qubits into a logical qubit with higher connectivity, which is achieved by adding terms to the Hamiltonian. Practically, this strategy is implemented by finding a so-called minor embedding, which is in itself an NP-hard problem. In this work, we present an iterative algorithm that does not need additional qubits but instead efficiently uses the available connectivity for different parts of the problem graph in every step. We present a weak monotonicity proof and benchmark our algorithm against the default minor-embedding algorithm on the D-Wave quantum annealer and multiple simple local search variants. While most of the experiments to compare the different iterative methods are performed with simulated annealing solvers, we also confirm the practicality of our method with experiments on the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks hold promise for key distribution, private and distributed computing, and quantum sensing, among other applications. The scale of such networks for ground users is currently limited by one's ability to distribute entanglement between distant locations. This can in principle be carried out by transmitting entangled photons through optical fibers or satellites. The former is limited by fiber optic attenuation while the latter is limited by atmospheric extinction and diffraction. Here, we propose a hybrid network and protocol that outperform both ground- and satellite-based designs and lead to high-fidelity entanglement at a continental or even global scale.</description>

      <title>Learning mixed quantum states in large-scale experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and test a protocol to learn the matrix-product operator (MPO) representation of an experimentally prepared quantum state. The protocol takes as an input classical shadows corresponding to local randomized measurements, and outputs the tensors of a MPO which maximizes a suitably-defined fidelity with the experimental state. The tensor optimization is carried out sequentially, similarly to the well-known density matrix renormalization group algorithm. Our approach is provably efficient under certain technical conditions which are expected to be met in short-range correlated states and in typical noisy experimental settings. Under the same conditions, we also provide an efficient scheme to estimate fidelities between the learned and the experimental states. We experimentally demonstrate our protocol by learning entangled quantum states of up to $N = 96$ qubits in a superconducting quantum processor. Our method upgrades classical shadows to large-scale quantum computation and simulation experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of quantum systems is essential for the development of quantum technologies, particularly in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. While traditional methods for Hamiltonian learning and noise characterization often require extensive measurements and scale poorly with system size, machine learning approaches offer promising alternatives. In this work, we extend the inverse physics-informed neural network (referred to as PINNverse) framework to open quantum systems governed by Lindblad master equations. By incorporating both coherent and dissipative dynamics into the neural network training, our method enables simultaneous identification of Hamiltonian parameters and decay rates from noisy experimental data. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the approach through numerical simulations of two-qubit open systems. Our results show that PINNverse provides a scalable and noise-resilient framework for quantum system identification, with potential applications in quantum control and error mitigation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Qudit Circuit for Quench Dynamics of $2+1$D Quantum Link Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in the burgeoning field of quantum simulation for high-energy physics is the realization of scalable $2+1$D lattice gauge theories on state-of-the-art quantum hardware, which is an essential step towards the overarching goal of probing $3+1$D quantum chromodynamics on a quantum computer. Despite great progress, current experimental implementations of $2+1$D lattice gauge theories are mostly restricted to relatively small system sizes and two-level representations of the gauge and electric fields. Here, we propose a resource-efficient method for quantum simulating $2+1$D spin-$S$ $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link lattice gauge theories with dynamical matter using qudit-based quantum processors. By integrating out the matter fields through Gauss's law, we reformulate the quantum link model in a purely spin picture compatible with qudit encoding across arbitrary spatial dimensions, eliminating the need for ancillary qubits and reducing resource overhead. Focusing first on the spin-$1/2$ case, we construct explicit circuits for the full Hamiltonian and demonstrate through numerical simulations that the first-order Trotterized circuits accurately capture the quench dynamics even in the presence of realistic noise levels. Additionally, we introduce a general method for constructing coupling-term circuits for higher-spin representations $S&gt;1/2$. Compared to conventional qubit encodings, our framework significantly reduces the number of quantum resources and gate count. Our approach significantly enhances scalability and fidelity for probing nonequilibrium phenomena in higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories, and is readily amenable to implementation on state-of-the-art qudit platforms.</description>

      <title>Qrisp Implementation and Resource Analysis of a T-Count-Optimised Non-Restoring Quantum Square-Root Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient quantum arithmetic operations are essential building blocks for complex quantum algorithms, yet few theoretical designs have been implemented in practical quantum programming frameworks. This paper presents the first complete implementation of the T-count optimized non-restoring quantum square root algorithm using the Qrisp quantum programming framework. The algorithm, originally proposed by Thapliyal et al., offers better resource efficiency compared to alternative methods, achieving reduced T-count and qubit requirements while avoiding garbage output. Our implementation validates the theoretical resource estimates, confirming a T-count of 14n-14 and T-depth of 5n+3 for n-bit inputs. The modular design approach enabled by Qrisp allows construction from reusable components including reversible adders, subtractors, and conditional logic blocks built from fundamental quantum gates. The three-stage algorithm - comprising initial subtraction, iterative conditional addition/subtraction, and remainder restoration is successfully translated from algorithmic description to executable quantum code. Experimental validation across multiple test cases confirms correctness, with the circuit producing accurate integer square roots and remainders. This work demonstrates the practical realizability of resource-optimized quantum arithmetic algorithms and establishes a foundation for implementing different arithmetic operations in modern quantum programming frameworks.</description>

      <title>Probing Hadron Scattering in Lattice Gauge Theories on Qudit Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An overarching goal in the flourishing field of quantum simulation for high-energy physics is the first-principles study of the microscopic dynamics of scattering processes on a quantum computer. Currently, this is hampered by small system sizes and a restriction to two-level representations of the gauge fields in state-of-the-art quantum simulators. Here, we propose efficient experimentally feasible digital qudit quantum circuits for far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics of a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link lattice gauge theory, where the electric and gauge fields are represented as spin-$1$ operators. Using dedicated numerical simulations, we probe scattering processes in this model on these proposed circuits, focusing on meson-meson and meson-antimeson collisions. The latter are not possible with a two-level representation of the fields, highlighting the suitability of qudits in exploring scattering processes relevant to quantum electrodynamics. The probed scattering dynamics showcases rich physics, including meson flipping and a reflection-transmission transition in meson-antimeson collisions as a function of the gauge coupling strength. Our simulations, which include realistic noise models of dephasing and depolarization, show very good agreement with the exact noiseless dynamics, signaling the readiness of current qudit platforms to observe microscopic scattering dynamics with significantly shallower circuit depths than their qubit counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is the most efficient process to synthesize graphene sheets using methane as precursor, making it a strategic alternative route for the Liquefied Natural Gas market. In this reaction, tetracyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (TAH) are produced as residual and intermediary molecules. Sorting a combinatorial space of variants of TAHs by energy is a poorly studied problem needed to optimize CVD, while it is also a candidate for quantum advantage in quantum computers. We extend on Sridhara's polynomial root formula to perform block-diagonalization (hence SBD) of six TAHs using Hartree-Fock Hamiltonians with STO-3G basis set and active orbital space growing from 2 to 6 orbitals, with equal numbers for the number of active electrons. We show that the proposed compression algorithm followed by Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) allows for sorting of the molecules by ground state energy, while speeding up the VQE simulation up to tenfold and reducing its error to the $10^{-1}$ scale. The compression capability of $(1-2^{-k})\cdot 100\%$ in matrix size for $k$ qubits allows VQEs to have a broader set of applications, providing a new and necessary tool to overcome the circuit size and quantum noise limitations of large quantum processing units.</description>

      <title>Multiqubit monogamy relations beyond shadow inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite quantum systems are subject to monogamy relations that impose fundamental constraints on the distribution of quantum correlations between subsystems. These constraints can be studied quantitatively through sector lengths, defined as the average value of $m$-body correlations, which have applications in quantum information theory and coding theory. In this work, we derive a set of monogamy inequalities that complement the shadow inequalities, enabling a complete characterization of the numerical range of sector lengths for systems with $N\leq 5$ qubits in a pure state. This range forms a convex polytope, facilitating the efficient extremization of key physical quantities, such as the linear entropy of entanglement and the quantum shadow enumerators, by a simple evaluation at the polytope vertices. For larger systems ($N\geq 6$), we highlight a significant increase in complexity that neither our inequalities nor the shadow inequalities can fully capture.</description>

      <title>The thermal gauge potentials in quantum transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we present another new thermal scalar and vector gauge potentials implemented by the quantum Boltzmann equation, which originates from the interaction of conduction electrons and phonons. To accomplish this task, we derive a temperature dependent four dimensional damping force by the Taylor series expansion on the self energy of the QBE, which can be related to the thermal scalar and vector gauge potentials, especially the fourth component of the damping force, which is just a power corresponding to a new scalar potential. Based on the local equilibrium assumption, we solve the QBE order by order using the Fourier transformation method. The temperature dependent damping force and other physical observables are exhibited in the figures, the higher of the temperature, the bigger of the damping force.</description>

      <title>Efficient Classical-Processing of Constant-Depth Time Evolution Circuits in Control Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving quantum algorithms run-time performance involves several strategies such as reducing the quantum gate counts, decreasing the number of measurements, advancement in QPU technology for faster gate operations, or optimizing the classical processing. This work focuses on the latter, specifically reducing classical processing and compilation time via hardware-assisted parameterized circuit execution (PCE) for computing dynamical properties of quantum systems. PCE was previously validated for QCVV protocols, which leverages structural circuit equivalencies. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach to computing dynamical properties of quantum many-body systems using structurally equivalent time evolution circuits, specifically calculating correlation functions of spin models using constant-depth circuits generated via Cartan decomposition. Implementing this for spin-spin correlation functions in Transverse field XY (up to 6-sites) and Heisenberg spin models (up to 3-sites), we observed a run-time reduction of up to 50\% compared to standard compilation methods. This highlights the adaptability of time-evolution circuit with hardware-assisted PCE to potentially mitigate the classical bottlenecks in near-term quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Detecting Entanglement in High-Spin Quantum Systems via a Stacking Ensemble of Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable detection and quantification of quantum entanglement, particularly in high-spin or many-body systems, present significant computational challenges for traditional methods. This study examines the effectiveness of ensemble machine learning models as a reliable and scalable approach for estimating entanglement, measured by negativity, in quantum systems. We construct an ensemble regressor integrating Neural Networks (NNs), XGBoost (XGB), and Extra Trees (ET), trained on datasets of pure states and mixed Werner states for various spin dimensions. The ensemble model with stacking meta-learner demonstrates robust performance by CatBoost (CB), accurately predicting negativity across different dimensionalities and state types. Crucially, visual analysis of prediction scatter plots reveals that the ensemble model exhibits superior predictive consistency and lower deviation from true entanglement values compared to individual strong learners like NNs, even when aggregate metrics are comparable. This enhanced reliability, attributed to error cancellation and variance reduction inherent in ensembling, underscores the potential of this approach to bypass computational bottlenecks and provide a trustworthy tool for characterizing entanglement in high-dimensional quantum physics. An empirical formula for estimating data requirements based on system dimensionality and desired accuracy is also derived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise is inevitable in realistic quantum circuits. It arises randomly in space. Inspired by spatial non-uniformity of the noise, we investigate the effects of spatial modulation on purification phase transitions in a hybrid random Clifford circuit. As an efficient observable for extracting quantum entanglement in mixed states, we employ many-body negativity. The behavior of the many-body negativity well characterizes the presence of the purification phase transitions and its criticality. We find the effect of spatial non-uniformity in measurement probability on purification phase transition. The criticality of the purification phase transition changes from that of uniform probability, which is elucidated from the argument of the Harris criterion. The critical correlation length exponent $\nu$ changes from $\nu &lt; 2$ for uniform probability to $\nu &gt; 2$ for spatially modulated probability. We further investigate a setting where two-site random Clifford gate becomes spatially (quasi-)modulated. We find that the modulation induces a phase transition, leading to a different pure phase where a short-range quantum entanglement remains.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Techniques to Detect Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional spectral probes of quantum chaos require eigenvalues, and sometimes, eigenvectors of the quantum Hamiltonian. This involves computationally expensive diagonalization procedures. We test whether an unsupervised neural network can detect quantum chaos directly from the Hamiltonian matrix. We use a single-body Hamiltonian with an underlying random graph structure and random coupling constants, with a parameter that determines the randomness of the graph. The spectral analysis shows that increasing the amount of randomness in the underlying graph results in a transition from integrable spectral statistics to chaotic ones. We show that the same transition can be detected via unsupervised neural networks, or more specifically, Self-Organizing Maps by feeding the Hamiltonian matrix directly into the neural network, without any diagonalization procedure.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Magic in the quantum Ising chain via Quantum Monte Carlo tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of magic as a bipartite correlation in the quantum Ising chain across its quantum phase transition, and at finite temperature. In order to quantify the magic of partitions rigorously, we formulate a hybrid scheme that combines stochastic sampling of reduced density matrices via quantum Monte Carlo, with state-of-the-art estimators for the robustness of magic - a {\it bona fide} measure of magic for mixed states. This allows us to compute the mutual robustness of magic for partitions up to 8 sites, embedded into a much larger system. We show how mutual robustness is directly related to critical behaviors: at the critical point, it displays a power law decay as a function of the distance between partitions, whose exponent is related to the partition size. Once finite temperature is included, mutual magic retains its low temperature value up to an effective critical temperature, whose dependence on size is also algebraic. This suggests that magic, differently from entanglement, does not necessarily undergo a sudden death.</description>

      <title>Current-based metrology with two-terminal mesoscopic conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional approach to quantum parameter estimation focuses on the quantum state, deriving fundamental bounds on precision through the quantum Fisher information. In most experimental settings, however, performing arbitrary quantum measurements is highly unfeasible. In open quantum systems, an alternative approach to metrology involves the measurement of stochastic currents flowing from the system to its environment. However, the present understanding of current-based metrology is mostly limited to Markovian master equations. Considering a parameter estimation problem in a two-terminal mesoscopic conductor, we identify the key elements that determine estimation precision within the Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism. Crucially, this approach allows us to address arbitrary coupling and temperature regimes. Furthermore, we obtain analytical results for the precision in linear-response and zero-temperature regimes. For the specific parameter estimation task that we consider, we demonstrate that the boxcar transmission function is optimal for current-based metrology in all parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Generation of Four-Component Schr\"odinger Cat States via Floquet Engineering in a Hybrid Magnon-Superconductor System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four-component Schr\"odinger cat states, superpositions of four coherent states symmetrically arranged in phase space, offer rich nonclassical features and enhanced resilience to decoherence, making them promising resources for quantum information science. We propose a Floquet-engineered scheme to deterministically generate four-component Schr\"odinger cat states in a hybrid quantum system composed of two superconducting qubits, a microwave cavity, and a magnon mode. By applying periodic transverse drives to the qubits, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that conditionally displaces the magnon mode depending on the joint qubit state. Conditional measurements in the $\sigma_x$ basis project the magnon mode into nonclassical four-component cat states with high fidelity. The Wigner functions in the original frame verified the non-classicality of the four-component Schr\"odinger cat states. Results of systematically analyzing the impacts of qubit decoherence, magnon loss, and cavity dissipation demonstrate the robustness to the dissipation. The results show that this scheme can realize the generation of multi-component quantum superposition states in a scalable solid-state platform, providing a new approach for hybrid quantum information processing based on nonclassical magnon states.tates.</description>

      <title>Circular-beam approximation for quantum channels in the turbulent atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of quantum states of light in free-space channels is strongly influenced by atmospheric turbulence, posing a significant challenge for quantum communication. The transmittance in such channels randomly fluctuates. This effect is commonly described by the probability distribution of transmittance (PDT). The elliptic-beam approximation provides an analytical model for the PDT, showing good agreement with experimental and simulation data within a specific range of channel parameters. In this work, we introduce the circular-beam approximation -- a simplified alternative that offers satisfactory accuracy while significantly reducing computational complexity. We also present an alternative technique for evaluating the parameters of this model based on the first two moments of transmittance. This approach notably extends the applicability range of our PDT model, offering a practical tool for characterizing atmospheric channels in quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Optimized Measurements of Rabi model in a linear potential under Strong Doppler shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing quantum resources in the atomic external degrees of freedom--particularly matter-wave states with broad momentum spreads--holds significant potential for enhancing the sensitivity of Kasevich-Chu atom gravimeters at the standard quantum limit. However, a fully quantum-mechanical investigation of the critical Doppler effect inherent to this approach remains lacking. Employing the SU(2) Lie group theory, we derive a generic Riccati equation governing the unitary dynamics of the Rabi model within a linear potential and analyze the Doppler effect impact on Rabi oscillations because of the strong coupling between the internal and external states. Furthermore, by integrating Fisher information theory, we specifically demonstrate the near-universality and high metrological gain of phase rotation measurement protocols under strong Doppler broadening. This theoretical work provides insightful implications for boarder generalization, such as extensions to finite-temperature scenarios or multi-pulse sequences--exemplified by the $\pi/2-\pi-\pi/2$ pulse sequence characteristic of Kasevich-Chu atom gravimeters. Thus, this work lays a theoretical foundation for developing high-sensitivity, noise-resistant atom gravimeters leveraging external-state quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Practical Subarchitectures for Optimal Quantum Layout Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Layout Synthesis (QLS) maps a logical quantum circuit to a physical quantum platform. Optimal QLS minimizes circuit size and depth, which is essential to reduce the noise on current quantum platforms. Optimal QLS is an NP-hard problem, so in practice, one maps a quantum circuit to a subset of the complete quantum platform. However, to guarantee optimality, one still has to consider exponentially many subarchitectures.
  We introduce an effective method to enumerate relevant subarchitectures. This reduces the number of considered subarchitectures, as well as the number of expensive subgraph isomorphism checks, thus boosting Optimal QLS with subarchitectures. To do so, we assume a fixed number of ancilla qubits that can be used in the mapping. We guarantee optimality of the quantum layout, for the selected ancilla bound.
  We evaluate our technique on a number of benchmarks and compare it with state-of-the-art Optimal QLS tools with and without using subarchitectures.</description>

      <title>Trap-to-trap free falls with an optically levitated nanoparticle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform free-fall experiments with a charge-neutral, optically levitated nanoparticle. This is achieved using an optical tweezer that can be rapidly toggled on and off and vertically displaced, enabling the particle to be released and recaptured after each free fall. The particle is insensitive to electric fields due to its charge neutrality and, during free evolution, is not subject to photon recoil heating. We achieve free-fall durations of up to 0.25 ms and observe a nearly two hundred-fold increase in the particle's position uncertainty at recapture. The current limit on the free-fall time arises from the performance of the initial cooling step. By implementing linear feedback techniques and reducing the background pressure, we expect to perform millisecond-scale free-fall experiments in ultra-high vacuum, opening new opportunities for generating large delocalizations of levitated objects.</description>

      <title>A Modular PyTheus Quantum Network Interpreter: Automated Analysis and Visualization of Optimized Quantum Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a modular interpreter for PyTheus-optimized quantum networks that automatically analyzes and visualizes complex quantum architectures discovered through automated optimization. The interpreter addresses the critical challenge of understanding machine-designed quantum networks by providing robust algorithms for functional role identification, graph-theoretical analysis, and physically meaningful visualization across the major classes of PyTheus-generated networks. Our interpreter accepts both file-based and in-memory network representations, automatically identifies sources, detectors, beam splitters, and ancillas through priority-based classification, and generates coordinated native graph plots and optical table representations. We demonstrate the interpreter's capabilities through two complementary approaches: (1) analysis of a newly developed five-node quantum key distribution network that reveals distributed source architecture and dual-role node functionality, and (2) comprehensive validation using existing PyTheus examples including W4 state generation, heralded Bell state preparation, and GHZ state networks. The interpreter successfully handles complex connectivity patterns across diverse quantum network architectures within the tested classes, avoids visualization artifacts, and provides validation mechanisms for architectural consistency. Our primary contribution is the development of robust modular interpretation algorithms that can analyze the major classes of PyTheus-generated quantum networks, enabling better understanding of automated quantum architecture design.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kramers-Henneberger Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Kramers-Henneberger transformation connects, via a series of unitary transformations, the dynamics of a quantum particle of mass $m$ located in a trap at position $\alpha(t)$, with the dynamics of a charge $e$ moving in an electric field $e{\cal{E}}(t)=-m\ddot{\alpha}(t)$ within the dipole approximation. In this paper, we extend the classical Kramers-Henneberger transformation to the quantum electrodynamic and quantum optical realm, by explicitly treating the trap location quantum mechanically, thus taking into account the quantum fluctuations of the time-dependent displacement force. Compared to the classical case, we show that quantum electrodynamic corrections appear, and we propose an optomechanical realization for the quantized position of the trap to show that such corrections can manifest in state-of-the-art experiments. These results open the path to novel quantum simulation of quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics of attoscience and ultrafast physics by using ultracold trapped atoms and ions.</description>

      <title>Dark-state photonic entanglement filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preserving entanglement in the presence of decoherence remains a major challenge for quantum technologies. Recent proposals [M.A. Selim et al., Science 387, 1424 (2025)] have employed photonic filters based on anti-parity-time symmetry to recover certain entangled states, but these approaches require intricate, symmetry-constrained waveguide architectures and precise bath engineering. In this work, we show that such strict non-Hermitian symmetry constraints are not necessary for entanglement filtering. Instead, we identify post-selection and the emergence of dark states -- arising naturally through destructive interference in simple photonic settings -- as the essential mechanisms. By avoiding the need for special bath engineering or non-Hermitian symmetries, our approach significantly simplifies the design and architecture, enhances universality, and extends applicability beyond previously studied dimer configurations. We demonstrate this concept using minimal waveguide network designs, offering a broadly accessible route to robust entanglement filtering.</description>

      <title>Geometry of quantum states and chaos-integrability transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the geometry of quantum states associated with classes of random matrix Hamiltonians, in particular ensembles that show integrability to chaotic transition in terms of the nearest neighbour energy level spacing distribution. In the case that the total Hamiltonian contains a single parameter, the distance between two states is captured by the fidelity susceptibility, whereas, when the total Hamiltonian contains multiple parameters, this distance is given by the quantum metric tensor. Since the fieldity susceptibility is closely related to the two-point correlation function, we first calculate the relevant correlation functions of a random matrix belonging to the Gaussian unitary ensemble in terms of the spectral form factor of the total Hamiltonian, show how to obtain the fidelity susceptibility from this correlation function, and explain the role played by energy level correlation. Next, by performing suitable coordinate transformations, we solve the geodesic equations corresponding to the quantum metric tensor obtained from an integrability-breaking random matrix Hamiltonian and obtain the geodesic distance between two points on the parameter manifold to show that any point far away from the integrable phase can be reached by a finite value of this distance. Finally, we obtain and discuss different properties of the fidelity susceptibility associated with Hamiltonians belonging to another random matrix ensemble which shows integrability to chaos transition, namely the Gaussian $\beta$-ensembles with general values of the Dyson index $\beta$, and show that the fidelity susceptibility shares generic features with the first class of Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Emulation of Self-Consistent Non-Hermitian Quantum Formalisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard quantum mechanics predicts the non-conservation of state norms and probability when the fundamental requirement of the Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian is relaxed. Biorthogonal quantum mechanics, or the more general metric formalism, provides a rigorous formulation of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics wherein norms and probabilities are conserved. The key feature is that the Hilbert space is endowed with a non-trivial dynamical metric. Beyond theoretical considerations, the physical implementation of the metric formalism remains unaddressed. In this work, we propose novel operator dilation schemes, which show that the self-consistent non-Hermitian quantum mechanics can be accessed in physical platforms via an embedding in closed Hermitian systems. Using digital quantum simulators, we present a proof of principle and the first experimental evidence for the dynamical metric engendered by non-Hermiticity in a qubit. Our work ushers in a new paradigm in the quantum simulation of non-Hermitian systems.</description>

Abstract: Atomic vapors, manipulated and probed by light and other electromagnetic fields, constitute versatile and powerful quantum systems for sensing applications. Atoms are identical, isolatable, interfaceable, and intelligible. These features, coupled with the relative simplicity with which quantum properties can be exploited in state preparation and detection using modern laser and electro-optic tools, make atoms very attractive for sensing applications.

      <title>Mechanical Squeezed-Fock Qubit: Towards Quantum Weak-Force Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical qubits offer unique advantages over other qubit platforms, primarily in terms of coherence time and possibilities for enhanced sensing applications, but their potential is constrained by the inherently weak nonlinearities and small anharmonicity of nanomechanical resonators. We propose to overcome this shortcoming by using squeezed Fock states of phonons in a parametrically driven nonlinear mechanical oscillator. We find that, under two-phonon driving, squeezed Fock states become eigenstates of a Kerr-nonlinear mechanical oscillator, featuring an energy spectrum with exponentially enhanced and tunable anharmonicity, such that the transitions to higher energy states are exponentially suppressed. This enables us to encode the mechanical qubit within the ground and first excited squeezed Fock states of the driven mechanical oscillator. This kind of mechanical qubit is termed mechanical squeezed-Fock qubit. We also show that our mechanical qubit can serve as a quantum sensor for weak forces, with its resulting sensitivity increased by at least one order of magnitude over that of traditional mechanical qubits. The proposed mechanical squeezed-Fock qubit provides a powerful quantum phonon platform for quantum sensing and information processing.</description>

      <title>Quantum-to-Classical Transition via Single-Shot Generalized Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-to-classical transition for finite-dimensional systems is widely considered to occur continuously, yet the mechanism underlying the intermediate stage remains unclear. In this work, we address this challenge by adopting an operational framework to bridge discrete generalized coherent state positive-operator-valued measurements and continuous isotropic depolarizing channels. Our unified treatment reveals how dimensionality and decoherence rate collectively govern the quantum-to-classical transition. Notably, we demonstrate that a single-shot generalized measurement can eliminate most negative quasi-probabilities in phase space for finite-dimensional systems. Furthermore, we propose quantum circuit implementations achievable with current state-of-the-art quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Technical Review on RF-Amplifiers for Quantum Computer Circuits: New Architectures of Josephson Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson Parametric Amplifiers (JPAs) are key components in quantum information processing due to their ability to amplify weak quantum signals with near-quantum-limited noise performance. This is essential for applications such as qubit readout, quantum sensing, and communication, where signal fidelity and coherence preservation are critical. Unlike CMOS and HEMT amplifiers used in conventional RF systems, JPAs are specifically optimized for millikelvin (mK) cryogenic environments. CMOS amplifiers offer good integration but perform poorly at ultra-low temperatures due to high noise. HEMT amplifiers provide better noise performance but are power-intensive and less suited for mK operation. JPAs, by contrast, combine low power consumption with ultra-low noise and excellent cryogenic compatibility, making them ideal for quantum systems. The first part of this study compares these RF amplifier types and explains why JPAs are preferred in cryogenic quantum applications. The second part focuses on the design and analysis of JPAs based on both single Josephson junctions and junction arrays. While single-junction JPAs utilize nonlinear inductance for amplification, they suffer from gain compression, limited dynamic range, and sensitivity to fabrication variations. To overcome these challenges, this work explores JPA designs using Josephson junction arrays. Arrays distribute the nonlinear response, enhancing power handling, linearity, impedance tunability, and coherence while reducing phase noise. Several advanced JPA architectures are proposed, simulated, and compared using quantum theory and CAD tools to assess performance trade-offs and improvements over conventional designs.</description>

      <title>Discrete solitons in Rydberg atom chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solitons - localized wave packets that travel without spreading - play a central role in understanding transport and properties of nonlinear systems, from optical fibers to fluid dynamics. In quantum many-body systems, however, such robust excitations are typically destroyed by thermalization. Here, we theoretically demonstrate the existence of solitonic excitations in high-energy states of Rydberg atom chains in the regime of strong nearest-neighbor Rydberg blockade. These localized wave packets propagate directionally atop a special class of reviving initial states related to quantum many-body scars and are capable of carrying energy. Exhibiting long coherence times, these states constitute a novel type of non-ergodic quantum dynamics and can be efficiently implemented on Rydberg atom simulators. In addition to a phenomenological description of solitons, we identify their counterpart in a classical nonlinear dynamical system obtained from a variational projection of the quantum dynamics. We demonstrate the potential use of solitons in quantum information transfer and conjecture their relevance for the anomalous energy transport reported in numerical studies of Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Gravity-mediated entanglement via infinite-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a wave of recent interest in detecting the quantum nature of gravity with table-top experiments that witness gravitationally mediated entanglement. Central to these proposals is the assumption that any mediator capable of generating entanglement must itself be nonclassical. However, previous arguments for this have modelled classical mediators as finite, discrete systems such as bits, which excludes physically relevant continuous and infinite-dimensional systems such as those of classical mechanics and field theory. In this work, we close this gap by modelling classical systems as commutative unital C*-algebras, arguably encompassing all potentially physically relevant classical systems. We show that these systems cannot mediate entanglement between two quantum systems A and B, even if A and B are themselves infinite-dimensional or described by arbitrary unital C*-algebras (as in Quantum Field Theory), composed with an arbitrary C*-tensor product. This result reinforces the conclusion that the observation of gravity-induced entanglement would require the gravitational field to possess inherently non-classical features.</description>

      <title>A superinductor in a deep sub-micron integrated circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superinductors are circuit elements characterised by an intrinsic impedance in excess of the superconducting resistance quantum ($R_\text{Q}\approx6.45~$k$\Omega$), with applications from metrology and sensing to quantum computing. However, they are typically obtained using exotic materials with high density inductance such as Josephson junctions, superconducting nanowires or twisted two-dimensional materials. Here, we present a superinductor realised within a silicon integrated circuit (IC), exploiting the high kinetic inductance ($\sim 1$~nH/$\square$) of TiN thin films native to the manufacturing process (22-nm FDSOI). By interfacing the superinductor to a silicon quantum dot formed within the same IC, we demonstrate a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (rfSET), the most widely used sensor in semiconductor-based quantum computers. The integrated nature of the rfSET reduces its parasitics which, together with the high impedance, yields a sensitivity improvement of more than two orders of magnitude over the state-of-the-art, combined with a 10,000-fold area reduction. Beyond providing the basis for dense arrays of integrated and high-performance qubit sensors, the realization of high-kinetic-inductance superconducting devices integrated within modern silicon ICs opens many opportunities, including kinetic-inductance detector arrays for astronomy and the study of metamaterials and quantum simulators based on 1D and 2D resonator arrays.</description>

      <title>Topology-Enhanced Superconducting Qubit Networks for In-Sensor Quantum Information Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of topology on the magnetic response of inductively coupled superconducting flux-qubit networks. Using exact diagonalization methods and linear response theory, we compare the magnetic response of linear and cross-shaped array geometries, used as paradigmatic examples. We find that the peculiar coupling matrix in cross-shaped arrays yields a significant enhancement of the magnetic flux response compared to linear arrays, this network-topology effect arising from cooperative coupling among the central and the peripheral qubits. These results establish quantitative design criteria for function-oriented superconducting quantum circuits, with direct implications for advancing performance in both quantum sensing and quantum information processing applications. Concerning the latter, by exploiting the non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics of such arrays, we demonstrate their suitability for quantum reservoir computing technology. This dual functionality suggests a novel platform in which the same device serves both as a quantum-limited electromagnetic sensor and as a reservoir capable of signal processing, enabling integrated quantum sensing and processing architectures.</description>

      <title>Robust and efficient estimation of global quantum properties under realistic noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring global quantum properties -- such as the fidelity to complex multipartite states -- is both an essential and experimentally challenging task. Classical shadow estimation offers favorable sample complexity, but typically relies on many-qubit circuits that are difficult to realize on current platforms. We propose the robust phase shadow scheme, a measurement framework based on random circuits with controlled-Z as the unique entangling gate type, tailored to architectures such as trapped ions and neutral atoms. Leveraging tensor diagrammatic reasoning, we rigorously analyze the induced circuit ensemble and show that phase shadows match the performance of full Clifford-based ones. Importantly, our approach supports a noise-robust extension via purely classical post-processing, enabling reliable estimation under realistic, gate-dependent noise where existing techniques often fail. Additionally, by exploiting structural properties of random stabilizer states, we design an efficient post-processing algorithm that resolves a key computational bottleneck in previous shadow protocols. Our results enhance the practicality of shadow-based techniques, providing a robust and scalable route for estimating global properties in noisy quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Resources for bosonic metrology: quantum-enhanced precision from a superselection rule perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optics and atomic systems are prominent platforms for exploiting quantum-enhanced precision in parameter estimation. However, not only are quantum optical and atomic systems often treated separately, but even within quantum optics, identifying optimal probes (quantum states) and evolutions (parameter-dependent dynamics) typically relies on case-by-case analyses. Mode, and sometimes only particle entanglement, can yield quantum enhancement of precision in continuous- and discrete-variable regimes, yet a clear connection between these regimes remains elusive. In this work, we present a unified framework for quantum metrology that encompasses all known precision-enhancing regimes using bosonic resources. We introduce a superselection rule compliant representation of the electromagnetic field that explicitly incorporates the phase reference, enforcing total particle number conservation. This approach provides a description of the electromagnetic field which is formally equivalent to the one employed in atomic systems, and we show how it encompasses both the discrete and the continuous limits of quantum optics. Within this framework, we consistently recover established results while offering a coherent physical interpretation of the quantum resources responsible for precision enhancement. Moreover, we develop general strategies to optimize precision using arbitrary multimode entangled probe states. Finally, our formalism readily accommodates noise, measurement strategies and non-unitary evolutions, extending its applicability to realistic experimental scenarios.</description>

Abstract: High fidelity state transfer is an important ingredient of distributed quantum information processing. We present and analyse results on perfect and quasi-perfect state transfer with linear spin chains incorporating non-uniform on-site energies. The motivation is maintenance of coupling uniformity, which could be beneficial for some physical implementations. We relate this coupling uniformity to a particle in a discrete potential analogue. Our analysis further considers the statistical variation in couplings and on-site energies, as a function of increasing chain site number N.</description>

      <title>Local nanoscale probing of electron spins using NV centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Substitutional nitrogen atoms in a diamond crystal (P1 centers) are, on one hand, a resource for creation of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, that have been widely employed as nanoscale quantum sensors. On the other hand, P1's electron spin is a source of paramagnetic noise that degrades the NV's performance by shortening its coherence time. Accurate quantification of nitrogen concentration is therefore essential for optimizing diamond-based quantum devices. However, bulk characterization methods based on optical absorption or electron paramagnetic resonance often overlook local variations in nitrogen content. In this work, we use a helium ion microscope to fabricate nanoscale NV center ensembles at predefined sites in a diamond crystal containing low concentrations of nitrogen. We then utilize these NV-based probes to measure the local nitrogen concentration on the level of 230 ppb (atomic parts per billion) using the double electron-electron resonance (DEER) technique. Moreover, by comparing the DEER spectra with numerical simulations, we managed to determine the concentration of other unknown paramagnetic defects created during the ion implantation, reaching 15 ppb depending on the implantation dose.</description>

      <title>Simple ways of preparing qudit Dicke states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dicke states are permutation-invariant superpositions of qubit computational basis states, which play a prominent role in quantum information science. We consider here two higher-dimensional generalizations of these states: $SU(2)$ spin-$s$ Dicke states and $SU(d)$ Dicke states. We present various ways of preparing both types of qudit Dicke states on a qudit quantum computer, using two main approaches: a deterministic approach, based on exact canonical matrix product state representations; and a probabilistic approach, based on quantum phase estimation. The quantum circuits are explicit and straightforward, and are arguably simpler than those previously reported.</description>

      <title>Long-time storage of a decoherence-free subspace logical qubit in a dual-type quantum memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum memory is an essential element for quantum computation, quantum network and quantum metrology. Previously, a single-qubit quantum memory with a coherence time of about an hour has been realized in a dual-species setup where a coolant ion provides sympathetic cooling for a memory ion of different species. However, the frequent random position hopping between the ions in the room-temperature trap limits the technique there only applicable to single-qubit storage. Here we report a multi-ion quantum memory in a cryogenic trap based on the dual-type scheme, and demonstrate a coherence time above two hours for a logical qubit encoded in the decoherence-free subspace, i.e. two-ion entangled states, after correcting the dominant leakage error. Our scheme alleviates the necessity of an ultra-stable frequency reference for the stored qubit, and has a preferable scalability owing to the same mass of the metastable-state memory ions and the ground-state coolant ion.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Volatility from the P\"oschl-Teller Potential and Hyperbolic Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This investigation establishes a formal equivalence between the generalized Black-Scholes equation under a Quadratic Normal Volatility (QNV) specification and the stationary Schr\"odinger equation for a hyperbolic P\"oschl-Teller potential. A sequence of canonical transformations maps the financial pricing operator to a quantum Hamiltonian, revealing the volatility smile as a direct manifestation of diffusion on a hyperbolic manifold whose geometry is classified by the discriminant of the QNV polynomial. We perform a complete spectral analysis of the financial Hamiltonian, deriving its discrete and continuous spectra and constructing the pricing kernel from the resulting eigenfunctions, which are given by classical special functions. This analytical framework, grounded in a gauge-theoretic perspective, furnishes a non-trivial benchmark for derivative pricing and provides a fundamental geometric interpretation of market anomalies. Future research trajectories toward integrable systems and formal field-theoretic analogies are identified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The flavor space of particles produced in collider environments contains informative quantum correlations. We present a systematic approach for constructing the complete flavor density matrix for a meson and antimeson system ($M \bar M$) in the Bloch vector space at a given time $t$, which can be at or after production. We point out that the $B_s^0$ and $K^0$ systems are superior to the $B^0_d$ and $D^0$ systems for quantum tomography because of their flavor oscillation and decay properties. Performing quantum tomography for the $M \bar M$ system can facilitate the study of production mechanisms, decoherence phenomena, quantum information variables, and potential new sources of CP violation.</description>

      <title>Projective Representations, Bogomolov Multiplier, and Their Applications in Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a pedagogical review of projective representations of finite groups and their physical applications in quantum many-body systems. Some of our physical results are new. We begin with a self-contained introduction to projective representations, highlighting the role of group cohomology, representation theory, and classification of irreducible projective representations. We then focus on a special subset of cohomology classes, known as the Bogomolov multiplier, which consists of cocycles that are symmetric on commuting pairs but remain nontrivial in group cohomology. Such cocycles have important physical implications: they characterize (1+1)D SPT phases that cannot be detected by string order parameters and give rise, upon gauging, to distinct gapped phases with completely broken non-invertible $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We construct explicit lattice models for these phases and demonstrate how they are distinguished by the fusion rules of local order parameters. We show that a pair of completely broken $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ SSB phases host nontrivial interface modes at their domain walls. As an example, we construct a lattice model where the ground state degeneracy on a ring increases from 32 without interfaces to 56 with interfaces.</description>

      <title>Space of conformal boundary conditions from the view of higher Berry phase: Flow of Berry curvature in parametrized BCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the connection between two subjects: the space of conformal boundary conditions in boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) and the space of gapped systems characterized by higher Berry phases. We explore this connection by analyzing multi-parameter spectral flow in Dirac fermion BCFTs with continuously parametrized conformal boundary conditions, which are introduced by coupling a CFT to a family of gapped systems. When the gapped systems belong to a nontrivial higher Berry class, the associated conformal boundary conditions induce a flow of the ordinary Berry curvature, resulting in a Chern number pump in the Fock space of the BCFT. This phenomenon is the BCFT analog of Berry curvature flow in one-dimensional parametrized gapped systems, where the flow occurs in real space. Building on this correspondence, we introduce the notions of higher Berry curvature and higher Berry invariants within the BCFT framework. Our results provide a new perspective for studying the topological properties of families of conformal boundary states and gapped ground states: if a family of gapped states belongs to a nontrivial higher Berry class, then the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonians exhibit a multi-parameter spectral flow that carries Berry curvature in the Fock space.</description>

      <title>Spin relaxation in a polariton fluid: quantum hydrodynamic approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity polaritons, the elementary excitations appearing in quantum microcavities in the strong-coupling regime, reveal clear signatures of quantum collective behavior. The combination of unique spin structure and strong nonlinear response opens the possibility of direct experimental observation of a plethora of nontrivial optical polarization phenomena. Spin relaxation processes are of crucial importance here. However, a mathematical formalism for their coherent description is still absent. In the present paper, based on the quantum hydrodynamics approach for a two-component liquid, we derive the set of the corresponding equations where both energy and spin relaxation terms appear naturally. We analyze in detail how these terms affect the dynamics of spinor polariton droplets in the external magnetic field and the dispersion of elementary excitations of a uniform polariton condensate. Although we focus on the case of cavity polaritons, our approach can be applied to other cases of spinor bosonic condensates, where the processes of spin relaxation play a major role.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuits must be error-resilient, yet LLMs like Granite-20B-Code and StarCoder often output flawed Qiskit code. We fine-tuned a 32 B model with two RL methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO), using a richly annotated synthetic dataset. On the Qiskit HumanEval benchmark, ORPO reaches 56.29\% Pass@1 ($\approx+10$ pp over Granite-8B-QK) and GRPO hits 49\%, both beating all general-purpose baselines; on the original HumanEval they score 65.90\% and 63.00\%. GRPO excels on basic tasks (42/54), ORPO on intermediate ones (41/68), and neither solves the five advanced tasks, highlighting clear gains yet room for progress in AI-assisted quantum programming.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method has shown great potential as a general-purpose quantum impurity solver, as its numerical errors can be well-controlled and it is flexible to be applied on both the imaginary- and real-time axis. However, a major limitation of it is that its computational cost grows exponentially with the number of impurity flavors. In this work, we propose a multi-flavor extension of it to overcome this limitation. The key insight is that to calculate multi-time correlation functions on one or a few impurity flavors, one could integrate out the degrees of freedom of the rest flavors before hand, which could greatly simplify the calculation. The idea is particularly effective for quantum impurity problems with diagonal hybridization function, i.e., each impurity flavor is coupled to an independent bath, a setting which is commonly used in the field. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our method for the imaginary time evolution of impurity problems with up to three impurity orbitals, i.e., 6 flavors, and benchmark our results against continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Our method paves the way of scaling up tensor network algorithms to solve large-scale quantum impurity problems.</description>

      <title>Towards a fictitious magnetic field trap for both ground and Rydberg state $^{87}$Rb atoms via the evanescent field of an optical nanofibre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold Rydberg atoms, known for their long lifetimes and strong dipole-dipole interactions that lead to the Rydberg blockade phenomenon, are among the most promising platforms for quantum simulations, quantum computation and quantum networks. However, a major limitation to the performance of Rydberg atom-based platforms is dephasing, which can be caused by atomic motion within the trap. Here, we propose a trap for $^{87}$Rb cold atoms that confines both the electronic ground state and a Rydberg state, engineered to minimize the differential light shifts between the two states. This is achieved by combining a fictitious magnetic field induced by optical nanofibre guided light and an external bias magnetic field. We calculate trap potentials for the cases of one- and two-guided modes with quasi-linear and quasi-circular polarisations, and calculate trap depths and trap frequencies for different values of laser power and bias fields. Moreover, we discuss the impact of the quadrupole polarisability of the Rydberg atoms on the trap potential and demonstrate how the size of a Rydberg atom influences the ponderomotive potential generated by the nanofibre-guided light field. This work expands on the idea of light-induced fictitious magnetic field traps and presents a practical approach for creating quantum networks using Rydberg atoms integrated with optical nanofibres to generate 1D atom arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new scheme for detecting wave-like dark matter (DM) using Rydberg atoms is proposed. Recent advances in trapping and manipulating Rydberg atoms make it possible to use Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays for DM detection. We present a simple and innovative experimental procedure that searches for excitations of trapped Rydberg atoms due to DM-induced electric field. A scan over DM mass is enabled with the use of the Zeeman and diamagnetic shifts of energy levels under an applied external magnetic field. Taking dark photon DM as an example, we demonstrate that our proposed experiment can have high sensitivity enough to probe previously unexplored regions of the parameter space of dark photon coupling strengths and masses.</description>

Abstract: The experimental verification of the quantum nature of gravity represents a milestone in quantum gravity research. Recently, interest has grown for testing it via gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE). Here, we propose a space-based interferometer inspired by the LISA Pathfinder (LPF). Unlike the LPF, our design employs two smaller gold-platinum test masses, each weighing the milligram scale, surrounded by a shield below 2 K, and positioned side by side with a millimeter scale separation. This configuration enables the detection of GIE through simultaneous measurements of differential and common-mode motions. We simulate quantum measurements of these modes taking into account gas damping, black-body radiation, and cosmic-ray collisions to estimate the integration time for GIE detection. Our results show that GIE can be demonstrated with a few modifications to the LPF setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum technologies are seen as transformative, with a potential to revolutionize fields like drug discovery and machine learning. Public engagement is crucial to align these developments with societal needs and foster acceptance. This study measured the impact of an exhibit about quantum technologies at the 2024 Lowlands music festival (n = 812). Pre- and post-surveys assessed changes in attitude, concern, interest and subjective knowledge. Results showed an increase in subjective knowledge but a decrease in interest, possibly due to reduced novelty or increased perceived difficulty. These findings underscore the effectiveness of exhibits as outreach tools in informal settings and highlight the critical role of maintaining novelty and emphasizing the relevance of quantum technologies in future outreach efforts. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of assessing outreach effectiveness to ensure that objectives are successfully achieved.</description>

Although apparently simple, this optimal control problem is not easy to solve and we resort to various elaborated methods of optimal control theory. We finally show its relationships to two problems in physics: the computation of the ground state for 1D Schr{\"o}dinger operators with a finite potential well, and the optimal dynamical Kapitza stabilization problem.</description>

      <title>The Hudson theorem in LCA groups and infinite quantum spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The celebrated Hudson theorem states that the Gaussian functions in $\mathbb{R}^d$ are the only functions whose Wigner distribution is everywhere positive. Motivated by quantum information theory, D. Gross proved an analogous result on the Abelian group $\mathbb{Z}_d^n$, for $d$ odd - corresponding to a system of $n$ qudits - showing that the Wigner distribution is nonnegative only for the so-called stabilizer states. Extending this result to the thermodynamic limit of finite-dimensional systems naturally leads us to consider general $2$-regular LCA groups that possess a compact open subgroup, where the issue of the positivity of the Wigner distribution is currently an open problem. We provide a complete solution to this question by showing that if the map $x\mapsto 2x$ is measure-preserving, the functions whose Wigner distribution is nonnegative are exactly the subcharacters of second degree, up to translation and multiplication by a constant. Instead, if the above map is not measure-preserving, the Wigner distribution always takes negative values. We discuss in detail the particular case of infinite sums of discrete groups and infinite products of compact groups, which correspond precisely to infinite quantum spin systems. Further examples include $n$-adic systems, where $n\geq 2$ is an arbitrary integer (not necessarily a prime), as well as solenoid groups.</description>

Abstract: Krylov complexity has emerged as an important tool in the description of quantum information and, in particular, quantum chaos. Here we formulate Krylov complexity $K(t)$ for quantum mechanical systems as a path integral, and argue that at large times, for classical chaotic systems with at least two minima of the potential, that have a plateau for $K(t)$, the value of the plateau is described by quantum mechanical instantons, as is the case for standard transition amplitudes. We explain and test these ideas in a simple toy model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove automorphic equivalence within gapped phases of infinitely extended lattice fermion systems (as well as spin systems) with super-polynomially decaying interactions. As a simple application, we prove a version of Goldstone's theorem for such systems: if an infinite volume interaction is invariant under a continuous symmetry, then any gapped ground state is also invariant under that symmetry.</description>

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have great potential in solving the ground state of various many-body problems. However, several key challenges remain to be overcome before NNs can tackle problems and system sizes inaccessible with more established tools. Here, we present a general and efficient method for learning the NN representation of an arbitrary many-body complex wave function. Having reached overlaps as large as $99.9\%$ for as many as $25$ particles, we employ our neural wave function for pre-training to effortlessly solve the fractional quantum Hall problem for $20$ electrons with Coulomb interactions and realistic Landau-level mixing.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Quantum Relaxation via Temporary Reset: A Mpemba-Inspired Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Slow relaxation processes spanning widely separated timescales pose fundamental challenges for probing steady-state properties and engineering functional quantum systems, such as quantum heat engines and quantum computing devices. We introduce a universal quantum reset protocol that enables exponential acceleration of relaxation in general Markovian open quantum systems. The protocol induces a quantum Mpemba effect, wherein systems initialized farther from equilibrium can relax faster than those closer to it, and crucially, this acceleration persists even when the slowest decaying Lindbladian modes form complex-conjugate pairs. Unlike previous approaches, which typically target a single mode, our protocol eliminates multiple relaxation modes simultaneously. Specifically, using a simple depolarizing channel, we show that the relaxation of a dissipative transverse-field Ising chain can be significantly accelerated, underscoring the experimental feasibility of the protocol. This framework provides a versatile and experimentally feasible tool for controlling quantum relaxation timescales, with broad implications for quantum thermodynamics, computation, and state preparation.</description>

      <title>Quantum HyperNetworks: Training Binary Neural Networks in Quantum Superposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary neural networks, i.e., neural networks whose parameters and activations are constrained to only two possible values, offer a compelling avenue for the deployment of deep learning models on energy- and memory-limited devices. However, their training, architectural design, and hyperparameter tuning remain challenging as these involve multiple computationally expensive combinatorial optimization problems. Here we introduce quantum hypernetworks as a mechanism to train binary neural networks on quantum computers, which unify the search over parameters, hyperparameters, and architectures in a single optimization loop. Through classical simulations, we demonstrate that our approach effectively finds optimal parameters, hyperparameters and architectural choices with high probability on classification problems including a two-dimensional Gaussian dataset and a scaled-down version of the MNIST handwritten digits. We represent our quantum hypernetworks as variational quantum circuits, and find that an optimal circuit depth maximizes the probability of finding performant binary neural networks. Our unified approach provides an immense scope for other applications in the field of machine learning.</description>

Abstract: Clustering is one of the most important tools for analysis of large datasets, and perhaps the most popular clustering algorithm is Lloyd's algorithm for $k$-means. This algorithm takes $n$ vectors $V=[v_1,\dots,v_n]\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times n}$ and outputs $k$ centroids $c_1,\dots,c_k\in\mathbb{R}^d$; these partition the vectors into clusters based on which centroid is closest to a particular vector. We present a classical $\varepsilon$-$k$-means algorithm that performs an approximate version of one iteration of Lloyd's algorithm with time complexity $\tilde{O}\big(\frac{\|V\|_F^2}{n}\frac{k^{2}d}{\varepsilon^2}(k + \log{n})\big)$, exponentially improving the dependence on the data size $n$ and matching that of the "$q$-means" quantum algorithm originally proposed by Kerenidis, Landman, Luongo, and Prakash (NeurIPS'19). Moreover, we propose an improved $q$-means quantum algorithm with time complexity $\tilde{O}\big(\frac{\|V\|_F}{\sqrt{n}}\frac{k^{3/2}d}{\varepsilon}(\sqrt{k}+\sqrt{d})(\sqrt{k} + \log{n})\big)$ that quadratically improves the runtime of our classical $\varepsilon$-$k$-means algorithm in several parameters. Our quantum algorithm does not rely on quantum linear algebra primitives of prior work, but instead only uses QRAM to prepare simple states based on the current iteration's clusters and multivariate quantum amplitude estimation. Finally, we provide classical and quantum query lower bounds, showing that our algorithms are optimal in most parameters.</description>

      <title>From barren plateaus through fertile valleys: Conic extensions of parameterised quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimisation via parameterised quantum circuits is the prevalent technique of near-term quantum algorithms. However, the omnipresent phenomenon of barren plateaus - parameter regions with vanishing gradients - sets a persistent hurdle that drastically diminishes its success in practice. In this work, we introduce an approach - based on non-unitary operations - that favours jumps out of a barren plateau into a fertile valley. These operations are constructed from conic extensions of parameterised unitary quantum circuits, relying on mid-circuit measurements and a small ancilla system. We further reduce the problem of finding optimal jump directions to a low-dimensional generalised eigenvalue problem. As a proof of concept we incorporate jumps within state-of-the-art implementations of the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA). We demonstrate the extensions' effectiveness on QAOA through extensive simulations, showcasing robustness against barren plateaus and highly improved sampling probabilities of optimal solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18963v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exploration of new problem classes for quantum computation is an active area of research. In this paper, we introduce and solve a novel problem class related to dynamics on large-scale networks relevant to neurobiology and machine learning. Specifically, we ask if a network can sustain inherent dynamic activity beyond some arbitrary observation time or if the activity ceases through quiescence or saturation via an epileptic-like state. We show that this class of problems can be formulated and structured to take advantage of quantum superposition and solved efficiently using a coupled workflow between the Grover and Deutsch-Jozsa quantum algorithms. To do so, we extend their functionality to address the unique requirements of how input (sub)sets into the algorithms must be mathematically structured while simultaneously constructing the inputs so that measurement outputs can be interpreted as meaningful properties of the network dynamics. This, in turn, allows us to answer the question we pose.</description>

Abstract: The Purcell effect describes the modification of the spontaneous decay rate in the presence of electromagnetic media and bodies. In this work, we shed light on the dependencies and magnitude of this effect for chiral materials. Using the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics and Fermi's golden rule, we study a chiral bulk medium with and without local-field corrections, an idealised chiral mirror and a chiral surface. The results imply that the chiral effect is greatest for large transition frequencies, molecules with large optical rotatory strength and media with a strong cross-susceptibility. In the case of a half space, short distances from the molecule to the interface additionally enhance the effect.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Thermalization via Participation Ratio in Disordered Bosonic Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study thermalization in a disordered one-dimensional interacting bosonic system described by the Aubry-Andre model using full exact diagonalization. We find a broad chaotic energy window where the system's eigenstates satisfy the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), demonstrated by the smooth energy dependence of observables like entanglement entropy and local particle number, whose fluctuations decrease with system size. Dynamically, we investigate the equilibration of initial Fock states and find that thermalization is not universal. The key finding is a direct and nontrivial correlation between an initial state's delocalization in the energy eigenbasis quantified by the Participation Ratio (PR) and its subsequent equilibration. States with a high PR consistently evolve toward the microcanonical ensemble prediction, whereas those exhibiting a low PR display deviations whose magnitude inversely correlates with the PR value. This connection is quantitatively confirmed by the trace distance, providing a powerful, experimentally relevant diagnostic for predicting which initial states will reach thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing combined with machine learning (ML) is a highly promising research area, with numerous studies demonstrating that quantum machine learning (QML) is expected to solve scientific problems more effectively than classical ML. In this work, we present Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM), a QML architecture, and demonstrate its effectiveness in drug discovery. We evaluate QLSTM on five benchmark datasets (BBBP, BACE, SIDER, BCAP37, T-47D), and observe consistent performance gains over classical LSTM, with ROC-AUC improvements ranging from 3% to over 6%. Furthermore, QLSTM exhibits improved predictive accuracy as the number of qubits increases, and faster convergence than classical LSTM under the same training conditions. Notably, QLSTM maintains strong robustness against quantum computer noise, outperforming noise-free classical LSTM in certain settings. These findings highlight the potential of QLSTM as a scalable and noise-resilient model for scientific applications, particularly as quantum hardware continues to advance in qubit capacity and fidelity.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian entanglement dip from scaling-induced exceptional criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well established that the entanglement entropy of a critical system generally scales logarithmically with system size. Yet, in this work, we report a new class of non-Hermitian critical transitions that exhibit dramatic divergent dips in their entanglement entropy scaling, strongly violating conventional logarithmic behavior. Dubbed scaling-induced exceptional criticality (SIEC), it transcends existing non-Hermitian mechanisms such as exceptional bound states and non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE)-induced gap closures, which are nevertheless still governed by logarithmic entanglement scaling. Key to SIEC is its strongly scale-dependent spectrum, where eigenbands exhibit an exceptional crossing only at a particular system size. As such, the critical behavior is dominated by how the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) sweeps through the exceptional crossing with increasing system size, and not just by the gap closure per se. We provide a general approach for constructing SIEC systems based on the non-local competition between heterogeneous NHSE pumping directions, and show how a scale-dependent GBZ can be analytically derived to excellent accuracy. Beyond 1D free fermions, SIEC is expected to occur more prevalently in higher-dimensional or even interacting systems, where antagonistic NHSE channels generically proliferate. SIEC-induced entanglement dips generalize straightforwardly to kinks in other entanglement measures such as Renyi entropy, and serve as spectacular demonstrations of how algebraic and geometric singularities in complex band structures manifest in quantum information.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing has brought a paradigm change in computer science, where non-classical technologies have promised to outperform their classical counterpart. Such an advantage was only demonstrated for tasks without practical applications, still out of reach for the state-of-art quantum technologies. In this context, a promising strategy to find practical use of quantum computers is to exploit hybrid quantum-classical models, where a quantum device estimates a hard-to-compute quantity, while a classical optimizer trains the parameters of the model. In this work, we demonstrate that single photons and linear optical networks are sufficient for implementing Variational Quantum Algorithms, when the problem specification, or ansatz, is tailored to this specific platform. We show this by a proof-of-principle demonstration of a variational approach to tackle an instance of a factorization task, whose solution is encoded in the ground state of a suitable Hamiltonian. This work which combines Variational Quantum Algorithms with hardware efficient ansatzes for linear-optics networks showcases a promising pathway towards practical applications for photonic quantum platforms.</description>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning is one of the many potential applications of quantum computing, each of which is hoped to provide some novel computational advantage. However, quantum machine learning applications often fail to outperform classical approaches on real-world classical data. The ability of these models to generalize well from few training data points is typically considered one of the few definitive advantages of this approach. In this work, we will instead focus on encoding schemes and their effects on various machine learning metrics. Specifically, we focus on real-world data encoding to demonstrate differences between quantum encoding strategies for several real-world datasets and the classification model standard, LightGBM. In particular, we apply the following encoding strategies, including three standard approaches and two modified approaches: Angle, Amplitude, IQP, Entangled Angle, and Alternative IQP. As these approaches require either a significant number of qubits or gates to encode larger datasets, we perform feature selection to support the limited computing power of quantum simulators. This feature selection is performed through a quantum annealing enhanced approach that builds on a QUBO formulation of the problem. In this work, we provide a preliminary demonstration that quantum machine learning with the IQP encoding and LightGBM produce statistically equivalent results for a large majority of the assigned learning tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving high-precision measurements on near-term quantum devices is critical for advancing quantum computing applications. Quantum computers suffer from high readout errors, making quantum simulations with high accuracy requirements particularly challenging. This paper implements practical techniques to reach accuracies essential for quantum chemistry by addressing key overheads and noise sources. Specifically, we leverage locally biased random measurements for reducing shot overhead, repeated settings with parallel quantum detector tomography for reducing circuit overhead and mitigating readout errors, and blended scheduling for mitigating time-dependent noise. We demonstrate these techniques via molecular energy estimation of the BODIPY molecule on a Hartree-Fock state on an IBM Eagle r3, obtaining a reduction in measurement errors by an order of magnitude from 1-5% to 0.16%. These strategies pave the way for more reliable quantum computations, particularly for applications requiring precise molecular energy calculations.</description>

Abstract: Quantum repeaters are an essential building block for realizing long-distance quantum communications. However, due to the fragile nature of quantum information, these repeaters suffer from loss and operational errors. Prior works have classified repeaters into three broad categories based on their use of probabilistic or near-deterministic methods to mitigate these errors. Besides differences in classical communication times, these approaches also vary in technological complexity, with near-deterministic methods requiring more advanced hardware. Recent increases in memory availability and advances in multiplexed entanglement generation motivate a fresh comparison of one-way and two-way repeater architectures.
  In this work, we present a two-way repeater protocol that combines multiplexing with application-aware distillation, designed for a setting where sufficient high-quality memory resources are available -- reflecting architectural assumptions expected in large-scale network deployments. We introduce a recursive formulation to track the full probability distribution of Bell pairs in multiplexed two-way repeater architectures, enabling the performance analysis of multiplexed repeater schemes which use probabilistic $n$-to-$k$ distillation. Using this framework, we compare the proposed two-way protocol with one-way schemes in parameter regimes previously believed to favour the latter, and find that the two-way architecture consistently outperforms one-way protocols while requiring lower technological and resource overheads.</description>

      <title>Graphical Framework for Non-Gaussian Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a graphical method to describe and analyze non-Gaussian quantum states using a hypergraph framework. These states are pivotal resources for quantum computing, communication, and metrology, but their characterization is hindered by their complex high-order correlations. The framework encapsulates transformation rules for a series of typical Gaussian unitary operation and local quadrature measurement, offering a visually intuitive tool for manipulating such states through experimentally feasible pathways. Notably, we develop methods for the generation of complex hypergraph states with more or higher-order hyperedges from simple structures through Gaussian operations only, facilitated by our graphical rules. We present illustrative examples on the preparation of non-Gaussian states rooted in these graph-based formalisms, revealing their potential to advance continuous-variable general quantum computing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Absorbing state phase transitions beyond directed percolation in dissipative quantum state preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00819v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that absorbing state phase transitions where the absorbing state itself exhibits long-range phase coherence can lead to critical behavior distinct from directed percolation. To do this, we investigate a simple, purely dissipative quantum reaction-diffusion model, which may also be viewed as a dissipative quantum state preparation procedure for the (generalized) W state with errors. The "error" Lindblad jump operators preserve the W state as a dark state, but nonetheless act to decohere the system and induce the phase transition. We find cases where the preparation protocol is either fragile or robust against weak error quantum jump rates and show that local remnants of the coherence persist in the decohering phase. The distinct critical behavior stems from the spreading of coherence throughout the system at the critical point.</description>

      <title>Spoofing of Quantum Channels Enables Low-Rank Projective Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to characterise and discern quantum channels is a crucial aspect of noisy quantum technologies. In this work, we explore the problem of distinguishing quantum channels when limited to sub-exponential resources, framed as von Neumann (projective) measurements. We completely characterise equivalence classes of quantum channels with different Kraus ranks that have the same marginal distributions under compatible projective measurements. In doing so, we explicitly identify gauge freedoms which can be varied without changing those compatible marginal outcome distributions, opening new avenues for quantum channel simulation, variational quantum channels, as well as novel adversarial strategies in noisy quantum device certification. Specifically, we show how a Sinkhorn-like algorithm enables us to find the minimum admissible Kraus rank that generates the correct outcome marginals. For a generic $d$-dimensional quantum system, this lowers the Kraus rank from $d^2$ to the theoretical minimum of $d$. For up to $d = 20$, we numerically demonstrate our findings, for which the code is available and open source. Finally, we provide an analytic algorithm for the special case of spoofing Pauli channels.</description>

      <title>Quantum tree generator improves QAOA state-of-the-art for the knapsack problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), specifically tailored to the knapsack problem. We combine the recently proposed quantum tree generator as an efficient state preparation circuit for all feasible solutions to the knapsack problem with the framework of Grover-mixer QAOA to form the first representative of Amplitude Amplification-mixer QAOA (AAM-QAOA). On hard benchmark sets with up to 20 knapsack items, we demonstrate our method's improved performance over the current state-of-the-art Copula-QAOA. However, for larger instance sizes, both approaches fail to deliver better outcomes than greedily packing items in descending value-to-weight ratio, at least for the considered circuit depths. For sufficiently high circuit depths, however, we can prove that AAM-QAOA will eventually be able to sample the optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Dynamic parameterized quantum circuits: expressive and barren-plateau free</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical optimization of parameterized quantum circuits is a widely studied methodology for the preparation of complex quantum states, as well as the solution of machine learning and optimization problems. However, it is well known that many proposed parameterized quantum circuit architectures suffer from drawbacks which limit their utility, such as their classical simulability or the hardness of optimization due to a problem known as "barren plateaus". We propose and study a class of dynamic parameterized quantum circuit architectures. These are parameterized circuits containing intermediate measurements and feedforward operations. In particular, we show that these architectures:
  1. Provably do not suffer from barren plateaus. 2. Are expressive enough to describe arbitrarily deep unitary quantum circuits. 3. Are competitive with state of the art methods for preparing ground states and facilitating the representation of nontrivial thermal states.
  These features make the proposed architectures promising candidates for a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Harvesting stabilizer entropy and non-locality from a quantum field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The harvesting of quantum resources from the vacuum state of a quantum field is a central topic in relativistic quantum information. While several proposals for the harvesting of entanglement from the quantum vacuum exist, less attention has been paid to other quantum resources, such as non-stabilizerness, commonly dubbed {\em magic} and quantified by the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE). In this work, we show how to harvest SRE from the vacuum state of a massless field using accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detectors in Minkowski spacetime. In particular, one can harvest a particular non-local form of SRE that cannot be erased by local unitary operations. This non-local SRE is a fundamental quantity to study the interplay between entanglement and non-stabilizer resources. We conclude our work with an analysis of the CHSH inequalities: when restricting to stabilizer measurements, i.e. Pauli measurements, one cannot extract a violation from the quantum field.</description>

      <title>Dissipating quartets of excitations in a superconducting circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade, autonomous stabilization of bosonic qubits has emerged as a promising approach for hardware-efficient protection of quantum information. However, applying these techniques to more complex encodings than the Schr\"odinger cat code requires exquisite control of high-order wave mixing processes. The challenge is to enable specific multiphotonic dissipation channels while avoiding unintended non-linear interactions. In this work, we leverage a genuine six-wave mixing process enabled by a near Kerr-free Josephson element to enforce dissipation of quartets of excitations in a high-impedance superconducting resonator. Owing to residual non-linearities stemming from stray inductances in our circuit, this dissipation channel is only effective when the resonator holds a specific number of photons. Applying it to the fourth excited state of the resonator, we show an order of magnitude enhancement of the state decay rate while only marginally impacting the relaxation and coherence of lower energy states. Given that stray inductances could be strongly reduced through simple modifications in circuit design and that our methods can be adapted to activate even higher-order dissipation channels, these results pave the way toward the dynamical stabilization of four-component Schr\"odinger cat qubits and even more complex bosonic qubits.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine Coupling Constants on Quantum Computers: Performance, Errors, and Future Prospects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first implementation and computation of electron spin resonance isotropic hyperfine coupling constants (HFCs) on quantum hardware. As illustrative test cases, we compute the HFCs for the hydroxyl radical (OH$^{\bullet}$), nitric oxide (NO$^{\bullet}$), and the triplet hydroxyl cation (OH$^{+}$). Our approach integrates the qubit-ADAPT method with unrestricted orbital optimization in an active space framework. To accurately measure the necessary spin one-electron reduced density matrices on current hardware, we employ a combination of error mitigation, error suppression, and post-selection, including our in-house developed ansatz-based readout and gate error mitigation. The HFCs obtained from the quantum hardware experiments align with results from unrestricted complete active space self-consistent field calculations on classical hardware. These results mark a significant step towards leveraging quantum computing for chemically relevant molecular properties and highlight the critical role of multi-method error strategies in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</description>

      <title>A quantum search method for quadratic and multidimensional knapsack problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving combinatorial optimization problems is a promising application area for quantum algorithms in real-world scenarios. In this work, we extend the "Quantum Tree Generator" (QTG), previously proposed for the 0-1 Knapsack Problem, to the 0-1 Quadratic Knapsack Problem (QKP) and the Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MDKP). The QTG constructs a superposition of all feasible solutions for a given instance and can therefore be utilized as a promising state preparation routine within amplitude amplification to produce high-quality solutions. Previously, QTG-based search was tested on the 0-1 Knapsack Problem, where it demonstrated the potential for practical quantum advantage, once quantum computers with a few hundred logical and fully connected qubits are available. Here, we evaluate the algorithm's performance on QKP and MDKP against the classical solver Gurobi. To facilitate large-scale evaluations, we employ an advanced benchmarking technique that enables runtime predictions for instances with up to 2000 variables for QKP and up to 1500 variables and 100 constraints for MDKP. Our results indicate that QTG-based search can produce high-quality solutions with competitive runtimes for QKP. However, its performance declines for MDKP, highlighting the challenges quantum algorithms face when tackling highly constrained optimization problems.</description>

Abstract: We present an extension of K-P time-optimal quantum control solutions using global Cartan $KAK$ decompositions for geodesic-based solutions. Extending recent time-optimal constant-$\theta$ control results, we integrate Cartan methods into equivariant quantum neural network (EQNN) for quantum control tasks. We show that a finite-depth limited EQNN ansatz equipped with Cartan layers can replicate the constant-$\theta$ sub-Riemannian geodesics for K-P problems. We demonstrate how for certain classes of control problem on Riemannian symmetric spaces, gradient-based training using an appropriate cost function converges to certain global time-optimal solutions when satisfying simple regularity conditions. This generalises prior geometric control theory methods and clarifies how optimal geodesic estimation can be performed in quantum machine learning contexts.</description>

      <title>Identifying Protein Co-regulatory Network Logic by Solving B-SAT Problems through Gate-based Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is growing awareness that the success of pharmacologic interventions on living organisms is significantly impacted by context and timing of exposure. In turn, this complexity has led to an increased focus on regulatory network dynamics in biology and our ability to represent them in a high-fidelity way, in silico. Logic network models show great promise here and their parameter estimation can be formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) that is well-suited to the often sparse, incomplete data in biology. Unfortunately, even in the case of Boolean logic, the combinatorial complexity of these problems grows rapidly, challenging the creation of models at physiologically-relevant scales. That said, quantum computing, while still nascent, facilitates novel information-processing paradigms with the potential for transformative impact in problems such as this one. In this work, we take a first step at actualizing this potential by identifying the structure and Boolean decisional logic of a well-studied network linking 5 proteins involved in the neural development of the mammalian cortical area of the brain. We identify the protein-protein connectivity and binary decisional logic governing this network by formulating it as a Boolean Satisfiability (B-SAT) problem. We employ Grover's algorithm to solve the NP-hard problem faster than the exponential time complexity required by deterministic classical algorithms. Using approaches deployed on both quantum simulators and actual noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, we accurately recover several high-likelihood models from very sparse protein expression data. The results highlight the differential roles of data types in supporting accurate models; the impact of quantum algorithm design as it pertains to the mutability of quantum hardware; and the opportunities for accelerated discovery enabled by this approach.</description>

      <title>Cross-Problem Parameter Transfer in Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm: A Machine Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most promising candidates to achieve the quantum advantage in solving combinatorial optimization problems. The process of finding a good set of variational parameters in the QAOA circuit has proven to be challenging due to multiple factors, such as barren plateaus. As a result, there is growing interest in exploiting parameter transferability, where parameter sets optimized for one problem instance are transferred to another that could be more complex either to estimate the solution or to serve as a warm start for further optimization. But can we transfer parameters from one class of problems to another? Leveraging parameter sets learned from a well-studied class of problems could help navigate the less studied one, reducing optimization overhead and mitigating performance pitfalls. In this paper, we study whether pretrained QAOA parameters of MaxCut can be used as is or to warm start the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) circuits. Specifically, we design machine learning models to find good donor candidates optimized on MaxCut and apply their parameters to MIS acceptors. Our experimental results show that such parameter transfer can significantly reduce the number of optimization iterations required while achieving comparable approximation ratios.</description>

Quantum states with high Schmidt numbers provide a larger advantage in various quantum information processing tasks compared to quantum states with low Schmidt numbers.

      <title>Variational Quantum Simulations of a Two-Dimensional Frustrated Transverse-Field Ising Model on a Trapped-Ion Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers are an ideal platform to study the ground state properties of strongly correlated systems due to the limitation of classical computing techniques particularly for systems exhibiting quantum phase transitions. While the error rates of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers are still high, simulating strongly correlated systems on such devices and extracting information of possible phases may be within reach. The frustrated transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) is such a system with multiple ordered magnetic phases. In this study, we simulate a two-dimensional frustrated TFIM with next-nearest-neighbor spin-exchange interactions at zero temperature. The competition between the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic coupling gives rise to frustration in the system. Moreover, the presence of quantum fluctuations makes the ground-state phase profile even richer. We use the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to compute the phases on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions for a system of 16 sites (qubits). The trained VQE circuits are compared to exact diagonalization, allowing us to extract error measures of VQE. We focus on the ground-state phase transitions of this model, where VQE succeeds in finding the dominant magnetic phases. The optimized VQE circuits are then executed on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer without using any error mitigation techniques. Our experiments show near perfect recovery of the magnetic phases of the frustrated model through ground-state energy, the energy derivative, and the spin correlation functions. Thus, we show that the trapped-ion quantum processor is able to achieve reliable simulations of a strongly correlated system within the limitations of the VQE approach.</description>

Abstract: Optically levitated nanoparticles in vacuum provide a highly sensitive platform for probing weak light-matter interactions. In this work, we present an interference-based method to amplify the optical force exerted by a weak field on a nanoscale particle trapped in an optical tweezer. By allowing the weak field to interfere with the strong trapping beam, we significantly enhance the optical force compared to the case without interference. This amplified optical force enables the detection of the weak field through the particle's motion, reaching picowatt-level sensitivity under moderate vacuum conditions. We further discuss the potential of this approach for developing an ultrasensitive, nondestructive detector of light fields and for exploring optomechanical interactions at the single-photon level.</description>

Abstract: Accurate computation of multiple eigenvalues of quantum Hamiltonians is essential in quantum chemistry, materials science, and molecular spectroscopy. Estimating excited-state energies is challenging for classical algorithms due to exponential scaling with system size, posing an even harder problem than ground-state calculations. We present a quantum algorithm for estimating eigenvalues and singular values of parameterized matrix families, including solving generalized eigenvalue problems that frequently arise in quantum simulations. Our method uses quantum amplitude amplification and phase estimation to identify matrix eigenvalues by locating minima in the singular value spectrum. We demonstrate our algorithm by proposing a quantum-computing formulation of the pseudospectral collocation method for the Schr\"odinger equation. We estimate fault-tolerant quantum resource requirements for the quantum collocation method, showing favorable scaling in the size of the problem $N$ (up to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{N})$) compared to classical implementations with $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, for certain well-behaved potentials. Additionally, unlike the standard collocation method, which results in a generalized eigenvalue problem requiring matrix inversion, our algorithm circumvents the associated numerical instability by scanning a parameterized matrix family and detecting eigenvalues through singular value minimization. This approach is particularly effective when multiple eigenvalues are needed or when the generalized eigenvalue problem involves a high condition number. In the fault-tolerant era, our method may thus be useful for simulating high-dimensional molecular systems with dense spectra involving highly excited states, such as those encountered in molecular photodynamics or quasi-continuum regimes in many-body and solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable quantum interference in integrated lithium niobate nanophotonics</title>

Abstract: Photonics has emerged as one of the leading platforms for the implementation of real-world-applicable quantum technologies, enabling secure communication, enhanced sensing capabilities, as well as resolving previously intractable computational challenges. However, to harness the full potential of the photonics platform, several engineering feats need to be accomplished, among those is the quest for a scalable source of pure single photons. While single photon sources can be implemented in a variety of different ways, integrated lithium niobate stands out as a prime contender for a monolithic quantum photonics platform, given its second-order nonlinearity and proven classical scalability. Despite the extensive effort put into developing the platform, integrating suitable photon pair sources remains a hurdle limiting the scalability of quantum photonic systems in lithium niobate. We engineer three-wave-mixing in a nanophotonic lithium niobate device, integrating multiple near-perfect spectrally separable heralded single photon sources. By mixing photons generated via the developed sources, we show bosonic interference between indistinguishable photons, a crucial interaction for many photonic quantum computing protocols. This demonstration of the first proof-of-principle multi-source interference in integrated lithium niobate contributes to developing a truly scalable quantum photonics platform.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase estimation based filtering: performance analysis and application to low-energy spectral calculation</title>

Abstract: Filtering is an important technique in quantum computing used for isolating or enhancing some specific states of quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we analyze the performance of filters based on the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm, in which filtering removes states associated with bitstrings in the ancilla register above a given threshold. We show that when the conventional rectangular window function is used for the QPE input state, the resulting filter function exhibits an oscillating behavior known as the Gibbs phenomenon. We also show that in the case of the sine and Kaiser windows, this phenomenon is suppressed. Furthermore, we perform numerical simulations to compare the number of necessary queries to the Hamiltonian time evolution operation of for the QPE-based filtering algorithm and the quantum eigenvalue transformation of unitary matrices with real polynomials (QETU). We find that the number of queries required for Kaiser window-based filtering is comparable to that for QETU with optimized phase angles. As an application of the QPE-based filter, we also study a two-step algorithm for low-energy spectral simulations, composed of a coarse grid for filtering and a fine grid for obtaining final high-resolution spectra. As a benchmark of the proposed scheme for realistic continuous spectra, we present the density-of-states (DOS) calculation of antiferromagnetic type-II MnO in a one-particle approximation.</description>

      <title>Utility-Scale Quantum Computation of Ground-State Energy in a 100+ Site Planar Kagome Antiferromagnet via Hamiltonian Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present experimental quantum computation of the ground-state energy in a 103-site flat Kagome lattice under the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (KAFH), with IBM's Heron r1 and Heron r2 quantum processors. For spin-1/2 KAFH, our per-site ground-state energy estimate is $-0.417\,J$, which, under open-boundary corrections, matches the energy in the thermodynamic limit, i.e., $-0.4386\,J$. To achieve this, we used a hybrid approach that splits the conventional Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) into local (classical) and global (quantum) components for efficient hardware utilization. More importantly, we introduce a Hamiltonian engineering strategy that increases coupling on defect triangles to mimic loop-flip dynamics, allowing us to simplify the ansatz while retaining computational accuracy. Using a single-repetition, hardware-efficient ansatz, we entangle up to 103 qubits with high fidelity to determine the Hamiltonian's lowest eigenvalue. This work demonstrates the scalability of VQE for frustrated 2D systems and lays the foundation for future studies using deeper ansatz circuits and larger lattices on utility quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Flexible Readout and Unconditional Reset for Superconducting Multi-Qubit Processors with Tunable Purcell Filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity qubit readout and reset while preserving qubit coherence is essential for quantum error correction and other advanced quantum algorithms. Here, we design and experimentally demonstrate a scalable architecture employing frequency-tunable nonlinear Purcell filters, enabling flexible readout and fast unconditional reset of multiple superconducting qubits. Our readout protocol dynamically adjusts the effective linewidth of the readout resonator through a tunable Purcell filter, optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio during measurement while suppressing photon noise during idle periods. We achieve a readout fidelity of $99.3\%$ without any quantum-limited amplifier, even with a small dispersive shift. Moreover, by leveraging a reset channel formed via the adjacent coupling between the filter and the coupler, we realize unconditional qubit reset of both leakage-induced $|2\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ states within 200 ns and reset of the $|1\rangle$ state alone within 75 ns, with error rates $\leq 1\%$. The filter also mitigates both photon-induced dephasing and the Purcell effect, thereby preserving qubit coherence. This scalable Purcell filter architecture shows exceptional performance in qubit readout, reset, and protection, marking it as a promising hardware component for advancing fault-tolerant quantum computing systems.</description>

Abstract: We extend from the hyperfinite setting to general von Neumann algebras Mosonyi and Ogawa's (2015) and Mosonyi and Hiai's (2023) results showing the operational interpretation of sandwiched relative R\'enyi entropy in the strong converse of hypothesis testing. The specific task is to distinguish between two quantum states given many copies. We use a reduction method of Haagerup, Junge, and Xu (2010) to approximate relative entropy inequalities in an arbitrary von Neumann algebra by those in finite von Neumann algebras. Within these finite von Neumann algebras, it is possible to approximate densities via finite spectrum operators, after which the quantum method of types reduces them to effectively commuting subalgebras. Generalizing beyond the hyperfinite setting shows that the operational meaning of sandwiched R\'enyi entropy is not restricted to the matrices but is a more fundamental property of quantum information. Furthermore, applicability in general von Neumann algebras opens potential new connections to random matrix theory and the quantum information theory of fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Witnessing nonlocality in quantum network of continuous-variable systems by generalized quasiprobability functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian measurements can not be used to witness nonlocality in Gaussian states as well as the network nonlocality in networks of continuous-variable (CV) systems. Thus special non-Gaussian measurements have to be utilized.
  In the present paper, we first propose a kind of nonlinear Bell-type inequality that is applicable to quantum networks of both finite or infinite dimensional systems. Violation of the inequality will witness the network nonlocality. This inequality allows us to propose a method of the supremum strategy for detecting network nonlocality in CV systems with source states being any multipartite multi-mode Gaussian states according to the configurations of the networks by utilizing non-Gaussian measurements based on generalized quasiprobability functions. The nonlinear Bell-type inequalities for CV networks, which depend solely on the generalized quasiprobability functions of Gaussian states, are straightforward to construct and implement. As illustrations, we propose the corresponding nonlinear Bell-type inequalities for any chain, star, tree-shaped and cyclic networks in CV systems with source states being $(1+1)$-mode Gaussian states. The examples show that this approach works well for witnessing the nonlocality in networks of CV systems. Particularly, a thorough discussion is given for the entanglement swapping network. Our study provide a strong signature for the network nonlocality nature of CV systems and lead to precise recipes for its experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Quantum Singular Value Transformation for Solving the Time-Dependent Maxwell's Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09686v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations of the form $\mathbf{A}{\frac{\mathbf{\partial f}}{\mathbf{\partial x}}} = \mathbf{B}\mathbf{f}$, based on the Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT). The algorithm uses block-encoding of $A$ and applies an 21st-degree polynomial approximation to the inverse function $f(x) = 1/x$, enabling relatively shallow quantum circuits implemented on 9 qubits, including two ancilla qubits, corresponding to a grid size of 128 points. Phase angles for the QSVT circuit were optimized classically using the Adagrad gradient-based method over 100 iterations to minimize the solution cost. This approach was simulated in PennyLane and applied to solve a 1D benchmark case of Maxwell's equations in free space, with a Gaussian pulse as the initial condition, where the quantum-computed solution showed high fidelity of more than 99.9% when compared to the normalized classical solution. Results demonstrate the potential of QSVT-based linear solvers on simulators with full quantum state access. However, practical hardware implementations face challenges because accessing the complete quantum state is infeasible. This limitation restricts applicability to cases where only $O({poly}(n))$ observables are needed. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of using quantum algorithms, such as QSVT, to solve linear systems of equations, and they point to the need for the development of measurement-efficient algorithms for near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Optimal quantum transport on a ring via locally monitored chiral quantum walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In purely coherent transport on finite networks, destructive interference can significantly suppress transfer probabilities, which can only reach high values through careful fine-tuning of the evolution time or tailored initial-state preparations. We address this issue by investigating excitation transfer on a ring, modeling it as a locally monitored continuous-time chiral quantum walk. Chirality, introduced through time-reversal symmetry breaking, imparts a directional bias to the coherent dynamics and can lift dark states. Local monitoring, implemented via stroboscopic projective measurements at the target site, provides a practical detection protocol without requiring fine-tuning of the evolution time. By analyzing the interplay between chirality and measurement frequency, we identify optimal conditions for maximizing the asymptotic detection probability. The optimization of this transfer protocol relies on the spectral properties of the Perron-Frobenius operator, which capture the asymptotic non-unitary dynamics, and on the analysis of dark states. Our approach offers a general framework for enhancing quantum transport in monitored systems.</description>

Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum systems exhibit unique properties and hold significant promise for diverse applications, yet their dynamical simulation poses a particular challenge due to intrinsic openness and non-unitary evolution. Here, we introduce a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm based on Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) for simulating the dynamics of arbitrary time-dependent non-Hermitian systems. Notably, this approach constitutes a natural extension of the quantum imaginary-time evolution (QITE) algorithm. This algorithm combines the advantages of both classical and quantum computation and exhibits good applicability and adaptability, making it promising for simulating arbitrary non-Hermitian systems such as PT-symmetric systems, non-physical processes, and open quantum systems. To validate the algorithm, we applied it to the dynamic simulation of open quantum systems and achieved the desired results.</description>

      <title>Cutting Slack: Quantum Optimization with Slack-Free Methods for Combinatorial Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constraint handling remains a key bottleneck in quantum combinatorial optimization. While slack-variable-based encodings are straightforward, they significantly increase qubit counts and circuit depth, challenging the scalability of quantum solvers. In this work, we investigate a suite of Lagrangian-based optimization techniques including dual ascent, bundle methods, cutting plane approaches, and augmented Lagrangian formulations for solving constrained combinatorial problems on quantum simulators and hardware. Our framework is applied to three representative NP-hard problems: the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), the Multi-Dimensional Knapsack Problem (MDKP), and the Maximum Independent Set (MIS).
  We demonstrate that MDKP and TSP, with their inequality-based or degree-constrained structures, allow for slack-free reformulations, leading to significant qubit savings without compromising performance. In contrast, MIS does not inherently benefit from slack elimination but still gains in feasibility and objective quality from principled Lagrangian updates. We benchmark these methods across classically hard instances, analyzing trade-offs in qubit usage, feasibility, and optimality gaps. Our results highlight the flexibility of Lagrangian formulations as a scalable alternative to naive QUBO penalization, even when qubit savings are not always achievable. This work provides practical insights for deploying constraint-aware quantum optimization pipelines, with applications in logistics, network design, and resource allocation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the applicability of quantum annealing to the approximation task of curve fitting. To this end, we consider a function that shall approximate a given set of data points and is written as a finite linear combination of standardized functions, e.g., orthogonal polynomials. Consequently, the decision variables subject to optimization are the coefficients of that expansion. Although this task can be accomplished classically, it can also be formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem, which is suited to be solved with quantum annealing. Given the size of the problem stays below a certain threshold, we find that quantum annealing yields comparable results to the classical solution. Regarding a real-world use case, we discuss the problem to find an optimized speed profile for a vessel using the framework of dynamic programming and outline how the aforementioned approximation task can be put into play.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastability and its relaxation mechanisms challenge our understanding of the stability of quantum many-body systems, revealing a gap between the microscopic dynamics of the individual components and the effective descriptions used for macroscopic observables. We observe excited self-ordered subradiant patterns in a quantum gas coupled to two optical cavities and report lifetimes far beyond the system's typical timescales. These patterns eventually decay through an abrupt transition reordering the atoms into a superradiant phase. Ab-initio theory fully captures this macroscopic behavior, revealing that the subradiant patterns are stabilized by photon-mediated long-range interactions, thereby manifesting universal features of metastability characteristic of long-range interacting systems, as in astrophysics and plasma physics. Our work sheds light on the microscopic mechanisms stabilizing quantum states of matter and highlights the potential of photon-mediated forces for engineering correlations in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic molecular nanojunctions exhibit opto-mechanical coupling at the nanoscale, enabling intertwined optical, vibrational and electronic phenomena. Here, we demonstrate plasmon-mediated phonon pumping, driven by inelastic electron hopping in conductive molecules, which results in strong Raman nonlinearity at the light intensities almost three orders of magnitude lower than in the conventional opto-mechanical systems and up to four-fold enhancement of the effective Raman polarizability due to vibrational electron-phonon coupling, as confirmed by the significant increase in anti-Stokes Raman scattering intensity, indicating enhanced vibrational occupancy. We also developed a microscopic framework of opto-mechanical electron-phonon coupling in molecular nanojunctions based on the Marcus electron hopping. Systematically varying electrical conductance of the molecules in the junction and laser intensity, we observed the transition between a photo-assisted tunneling regime and an electron hopping process. Our findings provide a microscopic description for vibrational, optical, and electronic phenomena in plasmonic nanocavities important for efficient phonon lasing, representing the first attempt to exploit conductive molecules as quantum-mechanical oscillators.</description>

      <title>Fibonacci-Modulation-Induced Multiple Topological Anderson Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We uncover the emergence of multiple topological Anderson insulators (TAIs) in a 1D spin-orbit coupled (SOC) chain driven by Fibonacci modulation, transforming a trivial band structure into a cascade of topologically nontrivial phases. This intriguing phenomenon is marked by the appearance of zero-energy modes and transitions in the $\mathcal{Z}_2$ topological quantum number. Strikingly, as the SOC amplitude decreases, the number of TAI phases grows, a behavior intricately linked to the fractal structure of the energy spectrum induced by Fibonacci modulation. Unlike conventional TAI phases, which exhibit fully localized eigenstates, the wave functions in the Fibonacci-modulated TAI phases exhibit multifractal behavior. Furthermore, this model can be experimentally realized in a Bose-Einstein condensate along the momentum lattice, where its topological transitions and multifractal properties can be probed through quench dynamics.

      <title>How to Minimize the Decoherence Caused by Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an experimentalist, Alice, who creates a quantum superposition of a charged or massive body outside of a black hole (or, more generally, in the presence of a Killing horizon). It was previously shown that emission of soft photons/gravitons into the black hole will result in the decoherence of the components of the superposition if it is held open for a sufficiently long span of time. However, at any finite time, $t_c$, during the process, it is not obvious how much decoherence has irrevocably occurred. Equivalently, it is not obvious how much information an observer inside the black hole can extract about Alice's superposition prior to time $t_c$. In this paper, we solve for the optimal experimental protocol to be followed by Alice for $t &gt; t_c$ so as to minimize the decoherence of the components of her superposition. More precisely, given the entangling radiation that has passed through the horizon prior to the cross-section $\mathcal C$ corresponding to the time $t = t_c$ in Alice's lab, we determine the "optimal purification" of this radiation beyond $\mathcal C$ such that the global quantum state of the radiation through the horizon has maximal overlap (quantum fidelity) with the Hartle-Hawking or Unruh vacuum. Due to the intricate low frequency entanglement structure of the quantum field theory vacuum state, we find this optimal purification to be nontrivial. In particular, even if Alice has already "closed" her superposition by bringing the components back together, we find that she can decrease the net decoherence of the components of her superposition somewhat by re-opening it and performing further manipulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum tomography of the superfluid-insulator transition for a mesoscopic atomtronic ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a phase-space perspective for the analysis of the superfluid-insulator transition for finite-size Bose-Hubbard circuits. We explore how the eigenstates parametrically evolve as the inter-particle interaction is varied, paying attention to the fingerprints of chaos at the quantum phase-transition. Consequently, we demonstrate that the tomographic spectrum reflects the existence of mixed-regions of chaos and quasi-regular motion in phase-space. This tomographic semiclassical approach is much more efficient and informative compared to the traditional "level statistics" inspection. Of particular interest is the characterization of the fluctuations that are exhibited by the many-body eigenstates. In this context, we associate with each eigenstate a Higgs measure for the identification of amplitude modes of the order-parameter. Finally we focus on the formation of the lowest Goldstone and Higgs bands.</description>

      <title>$\eta$ regularisation and the functional measure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit Fujikawa's path integral formulation of the chiral anomaly and develop a generalised framework for systematically defining a regularised functional measure. This construction extends the $\eta$ regularisation scheme to operator language, making the connection between spectral asymmetry and measure transformation fully explicit. Before recovering Fujikawa's expression for the chiral anomaly from the regularised measure, we explore the deeper number-theoretic structure underlying the ill-defined spectral sum associated with the anomaly, interpreting it through the lens of smoothed asymptotics. Our approach unifies two complementary perspectives: the analytic regularisation of Fujikawa and the topological characterisation given by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. We further investigate how the measure transforms under changes to the regularisation scale and derive a function $\iota_E(\Lambda)$ that encodes this dependence, showing how its Mellin moments govern the appearance of divergences. Finally, we comment on the conceptual relationship between the regularised measure, $\eta$ regularisation, and the generalised Schwinger proper-time formalism, with a particular focus on the two-dimensional Schwinger model.</description>

      <title>Surface hopping simulations show valley depolarization driven by exciton-phonon resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonances between excitonic transitions and nuclear coordinates have been shown to drive a variety of excited-state dynamical phenomena in molecular systems. Here, we report mixed quantum--classical simulations showing similar resonances to primarily contribute to valley depolarization in monolayer MoS$_2$. The applied simulation framework combines reciprocal-space surface hopping with microscopic models of the quasiparticle band structure, electron--hole interactions, and carrier--phonon interactions, parametrized against ab initio calculations. This enables low-cost excited-state dynamics simulations that are microscopic, non-Markovian, and non-perturbative in the carrier--phonon interaction. The framework furthermore retains explicit information on transient phonon occupancies, through which we show a resonance between the dominant optical phonon branch and the lowest exciton band to largely drive valley depolarization, by activating a Maialle--Silva--Sham mechanism. Resulting valley polarization times are consistent with experimental measurements across temperatures.</description>

      <title>Enantiosensitive locking of photoelectron spin and cation orientation</title>

Abstract: Chirality describes the asymmetry between an object and its mirror image, underpinning diverse functionalities across all scales of matter - from molecules and aggregates to thin films and bulk chiral materials. A particularly intriguing example is chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where chiral structures orient electron spins enantio-sensitively. Despite extensive research, the fundamental origin of spin-chirality coupling, the unexpectedly large magnitude of the CISS effect, and the possible role of electromagnetic fields remain unclear. Here, we address these issues by examining the simplest scenario: spin-resolved photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules. We uncover two universal geometric mechanisms of spin-selective photodynamics, arising solely from electric-dipole interactions and previously unrecognized. These mechanisms operate effectively even in amorphous chiral media under isotropic illumination and persist at weak spin-orbit coupling, underscoring fundamental aspects of spin-chirality interplay. We further identify an unreported phenomenon central to CISS: locking of photoelectron spin orientation to molecular geometry. Our findings provide a unified geometric framework with broad implications, extending from CISS and asymmetric catalysis to spin textures in chiral crystals and chiral quantum materials such as Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>The Integral Decimation Method for Quantum Dynamics and Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The solutions to many problems in the mathematical, computational, and physical sciences often involve multidimensional integrals. A direct numerical evaluation of the integral incurs a computational cost that is exponential in the number of dimensions, a phenomenon called the curse of dimensionality. The problem is so substantial that one usually employs sampling methods, like Monte Carlo, to avoid integration altogether. Here, we derive and implement a quantum algorithm to compress a multidimensional integrand into a product of matrix-valued functions - a spectral tensor train - changing the computational complexity of integration from exponential to polynomial. The algorithm compresses the integrand by applying a sequence of quantum gates to an unentangled quantum state, where each term corresponds to a body-ordered term in the potential. Because it allows for the systematic elimination of small contributions to the integral through decimation, we call the method integral decimation. The functions in the spectral basis are analytically differentiable and integrable, and in applications to the partition function, integral decimation numerically factorizes an interacting system into a product of noninteracting ones. We illustrate integral decimation by evaluating the absolute free energy and entropy of a chiral XY model as a continuous function of temperature. We also compute the nonequilibrium time-dependent reduced density matrix of a quantum chain with between two and forty levels, each coupled to colored noise. When other methods provide numerical solutions to these models, they quantitatively agree with integral decimation. When conventional methods become intractable, integral decimation can be a powerful alternative.</description>

      <title>Future prospect of anisotropic 2D tin sulfide (SnS) for emerging electronic and quantum device applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The family of anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) emerging materials is rapidly evolving due to their low crystal symmetry and in-plane structural anisotropy. Among these, 2D tin sulfide (SnS) has gained significant attention because of its distinctive crystalline symmetry and the resulting extraordinary anisotropic physical properties. This perspective explores recent developments in anisotropic 2D SnS. In particular, it highlights advances in isolating high-quality SnS monolayers (1L-SnS) and in applying advanced techniques for anisotropic characterization. The discussion continues with an overview of the anisotropic optical and electronic properties of SnS, followed by recent progress in emerging electronic device applications, including energy conversion &amp; storage, neuromorphic (synaptic) systems, spintronics and quantum technologies. In addition to presenting significant research findings on SnS, this perspective outlines current limitations and discusses emerging opportunities and future prospects for its application in quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement a compile toolchain from Q# to QASM 3.0 including a full-featured lexer and parser implementation, as well as a compiler that supports a subset of Q# features. The lexer, parser and compiler are shown to work with various input Q# programs and the implementation is compared against existing Q# compile tools. Unlike the Microsoft implementation of the official Q# compile toolchain, our implementation is written in TypeScript in order to port functionality to web environments.</description>

      <title>From Bound States to Quantum Spin Models: Chiral Coherent Dynamics in Topological Photonic Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological photonic systems offer a robust platform for guiding light in the presence of disorder, but their interplay with quantum emitters remains a frontier for realizing strongly correlated quantum states. Here, we explore a ring-shaped Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) photonic lattice interfaced with multiple quantum emitters to control topologically protected chiral quantum dynamics. Using a full microscopic model that includes cascaded Lindblad dynamics and chiral emitter-bath couplings, we reveal how the topology of the bath mediates nonreciprocal, long-range interactions between emitters. These interactions lead to rich manybody spin phenomena, including robust coherence, directional energy transfer, and emergent double N\'eel ordering, captured by an effective spin Hamiltonian derived from the system topology. We show that topological bound states enable unidirectional emission, protect coherence against dissipation, and imprint nontrivial entanglement and mutual information patterns among the emitters. In particular, we showed that under circularly polarized excitation, the emitters not only inherit spin angular momentum from the field but also serve as transducers that coherently launch the spin-orbit-coupled topological photonic modes into the far field. Our results establish a direct bridge between topological photonic baths and emergent quantum magnetism, positioning this architecture as a promising testbed for studying chiral quantum optics, topologically protected entangled states, and long-range quantum coherence.</description>

      <title>Efficient Preparation of Fermionic Superfluids in an Optical Dipole Trap through Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a reinforcement learning (RL) based control framework for optimizing evaporative cooling in the preparation of strongly interacting degenerate Fermi gases of Li6. Using a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, the system autonomously explores a high-dimensional parameter space to learn optimal cooling trajectories. Compared to conventional exponential ramps, our method achieves up to 130% improvement in atomic density within a 0.5 second, revealing non-trivial control strategies that balance fast evaporation and thermalization. While our current optimization focuses on the evaporation stage, future integration of other cooling stages, such as grey molasses cooling, could further extend RL to the full preparation pipeline. Our result highlights the promise of RL as a general tool for closed-loop quantum control and automated calibration in complex atomic physics experiments.</description>
