      <title>A systematic search for tectonic tremor and low-frequency earthquakes in the Atacama segment of the Chilean subduction zone (24$^\circ$S-31$^\circ$S) turns up empty</title>

Abstract: Subduction megathrusts release stress not only seismically through earthquakes, but also through creep and transient slow deformation, called slow slip events (SSEs). Understanding the interplay between fast and slow slip is essential for illuminating the deformation processes on the subduction interface. The Chilean subduction margin, while one of the most seismically active regions worldwide, has few reports of SSEs. Furthermore, there are no comprehensive reports of tectonic tremors or low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs), seismic signals typically accompanying SSEs, tracking deformation at small spatial and temporal scales. Here, we perform a systematic search for tectonic tremors and LFEs in the Atacama segment in Northern Chile, a region hosting both shallow and deep SSEs. Using dense seismic networks, we investigate 3.5 years between November 2020 and February 2024. Due to the network geometry, we focus on deep tremor and LFEs. We apply two orthogonal methods, envelope correlation for tremor search and deep learning detection for LFEs, to generate initial catalogs. To validate the potential detections, we use clustering, matched filtering, heuristics, and extensive manual inspection. While our initial search provides numerous candidates, after verification, we find no evidence for tectonic tremor or LFEs in the region. In contrast, our approaches successfully recover tremors and LFEs in two reference regions outside Chile with known tremor and LFE activity. Our observations show that tremors and LFEs in Northern Chile are either of lower moment rate than in other regions, have substantially longer recurrence rates, or are absent altogether, potentially due to the cold subduction.</description>

      <title>An oceanic basin oscillation-driving mechanism for tides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tides represent the daily alternations of high and low waters along coastlines and in oceans, and the current theory (termed the gravitational forcing mechanism) explains them as a manifestation of the response of ocean water to the Moon's (Sun's) gravitational force. However, although the purely hydrodynamic models representing the current theory have been widely tested over global ocean,their tidal elevation accuracies are generally low. This implies an uncertainty as to whether the gravitational forcing mechanism is the best explanation for tides. In this study, we present a new theory (termed the oceanic basin oscillation-driving mechanism), in which tides are explained as a manifestation of oscillating ocean basin that is intricately linked to the elongated spinning solid Earth due to the Moon (Sun). Based on this new theory, we develop an algebraic tide model and test it using 11-year observations from 33 bottom pressure stations over the Pacific Ocean, the average Root Mean Square (RMS) deviation of tidal elevation predicted by this model against observation is 7.54 cm. Using a ratio of M2 elevation RMS of ocean tide model EOT11a and its total tidal elevation RMS as a reference, we estimate the total tidal elevation RMS of six purely hydrodynamic models (i.e.,Hallberg Isopycnal Model, OSU Tidal Inversion software-GN ,STORMTIDE model, OSU Tidal Inversion Software-ERB,STM-1B, and HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model to be 59.93, 51.64, 57.05, 38.56, 86.92, and 53.56 cm, respectively.</description>
