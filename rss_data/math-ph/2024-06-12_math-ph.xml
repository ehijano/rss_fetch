      <title>Bifurcation analysis of figure-eight choreography in the three-body problem based on crystallographic point groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the bifurcation analysis of figure-eight choreography by irreducible real orthogonal representations of its symmetry groups based on variational principle of the action. There are four types of bifurcation solutions in the sequence of the bifurcation cascade: (i) the trivial type represented by trivial representation, (ii) the two-fold type by non-trivial one-dimensional representation, (iii) the three-fold and (iv) the six-fold types by two-dimensional irreducible representations. As numerical examples, we present four new bifurcation solutions: non-symmetric choreographic solution of the two-fold type, non-planar solution of the two-fold type, $y$-axis symmetric solution of the three-fold type, and non-symmetric solution of the six-fold type.</description>

      <title>Effective Polaron Dynamics of an Impurity Particle Interacting with a Fermi Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of a homogeneous ideal Fermi gas coupled to an impurity particle on a three-dimensional box with periodic boundary condition. For large Fermi momentum $k_\text{F}$, we prove that the effective dynamics is generated by a Fr\"ohlich-type polaron Hamiltonian, which linearly couples the impurity particle to an almost-bosonic excitation field. Moreover, we prove that the effective dynamics can be approximated by an explicit coupled coherent state. Our method is applicable to two relevant settings: first, an interaction coupling $\lambda=1$ and masses of order 1 for time scales of order $k_\text{F}^{-1}$; second to the case of $\lambda=k_\text{F}^{-1}$ and a heavy Fermi gas with masses of order $k_\text{F}$ for time scales of order 1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a new class of infinite-dimensional Frobenius manifolds on the spaces of pairs of meromorphic functions that are defined on specific regions of the Riemann sphere. We demonstrate that the principal hierarchy of these Frobenius manifolds serves as an extension of the genus-zero universal Whitham hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Bessel potentials and Green functions on pseudo-Euclidean spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review properties of Bessel potentials, that is, inverse Fourier transforms of (regularizations of) $\frac{1}{(m^2+p^2)^{\frac{\mu}{2}}}$ on a pseudoEuclidean space with signature $(q,d-q)$. We are mostly interested in the Lorentzian signature $(1,d-1)$, and the case $\mu=2$, related to the Klein-Gordon equation $(-\Box+m^2)f=0$. We analyze properties of various ``two-point functions'', which play an important role in Quantum Field Theory, such as the retarded/advanced propagators or Feynman/antiFeynman propagators. We consistently use hypergeometric functions instead of Bessel functions, which makes most formulas much more transparent. We pay attention to distributional properties of various Bessel potentials. We include in our analysis the ``tachyonic case'', corresponding to the ``wrong'' sign in the Klein-Gordon equation.</description>

      <title>Conformable Derivative Approach to Granular Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proper modeling of complex systems requires innovative mathematical tools. In this sense, we sought to use deformed or fractal derivatives for studying the dynamics of systems, particularly those, such as granular gases, in which the description of the dynamics can be done by using the stretched exponential probability densities. In this contribution we draw up three results of this application of mathematical tools. The first result shows that when we use constraints with finite momentum and the principle of maximum entropy, the Kohlrausch--Williams--Watts function, known as stretched exponential, emerges naturally and in a simpler way, when compared to results in the literature. Next, we obtain generalized expressions for the Langevin equation, as well as its solutions for three different deformed derivatives, including those connected with nonaddictive statistical mechanics. The Haff's-like law for granular gases are obtained. Next, we calculate the partition function $Z$ for a granular gas system by building up the probability density in terms of the stretched exponential function. From this partition function, we determine the internal energy of the system as well as the specific heat, both dependent on temperature. The consistency with classical approach of kinetic theory for ideal gases was verified.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamilton-Jacobi Theory, Spectral Path Integrals and Exact-WKB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new way to perform path integrals in quantum mechanics by using a quantum version of Hamilton-Jacobi theory. In classical mechanics, Hamilton-Jacobi theory is a powerful formalism, however, its utility is not explored in quantum theory beyond the correspondence principle. The canonical transformation enables one to set the new Hamiltonian to constant or zero, but keeps the information about solution in Hamilton's characteristic function. To benefit from this in quantum theory, one must work with a formulation in which classical Hamiltonian is used. This uniquely points to phase space path integral. However, the main variable in HJ-formalism is energy, not time. Thus, we are led to consider Fourier transform of path integral, spectral path integral, $\tilde Z(E)$. This admits a representation in terms of a quantum Hamilton's characteristic functions for perturbative and non-perturbative periodic orbits, generalizing Gutzwiller's sum. This results in a path integral derivation of exact quantization conditions, complementary to the exact WKB analysis of differential equations. We apply these to generic $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetric multi-well potential problems and point out some new instanton effects, e.g., the level splitting is generically a multi-instanton effect, unlike double-well.</description>

Abstract: Inverse scattering problem for an operator, which is a sum of the operator of the third derivative and of an operator of multiplication by a real function, is solved. The main closed system of equations of inverse problem is obtained. This system contains scattering coefficients and bound state elements as independent parameters.

Abstract: We show that the $i$-dimensional plaqutte random-cluster model with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}_q$ is dual to a $(d-i)$-dimensional plaquette random cluster model. In addition, we explore boundary conditions, infinite volume limits, and uniqueness for these models. For previously known results, we provide new proofs that rely more on the tools of algebraic topology.</description>

      <title>Geometric representations of braid and Yang-Baxter gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brick-wall circuits composed of the Yang-Baxter gates are integrable. It becomes an important tool to study the quantum many-body system out of equilibrium. To put the Yang-Baxter gate on the quantum computer, it has to be decomposed into the native gates of quantum computers. It is favorable to apply the least number of native two-qubit gates to construct the Yang-Baxter gate. We study the geometric representations of all X-type braid gates and their corresponding Yang-Baxter gates via the Yang-Baxterization. We find that the braid and Yang-Baxter gates can only exist on certain edges and faces of the two-qubit tetrahedron. We identify the parameters by which the braid and Yang-Baxter gates are the Clifford gate, the matchgate, and the dual-unitary gate. The geometric representations provide the optimal decompositions of the braid and Yang-Baxter gates in terms of other two-qubit gates. We also find that the entangling powers of the Yang-Baxter gates are determined by the spectral parameters. Our results provide the necessary conditions to construct the braid and Yang-Baxter gates on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Topological linear response of hyperbolic Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between the electromagnetic Hall response and band topological invariants in hyperbolic Chern insulators by deriving a hyperbolic analog of the Thouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-den Nijs (TKNN) formula. By generalizing the Kubo formula to hyperbolic lattices, we show that the Hall conductivity is quantized to $-e^2C_{ij}/h$, where $C_{ij}$ is the first Chern number. Through a flux-threading argument, we provide an interpretation of the Chern number as a topological invariant in hyperbolic band theory. We demonstrate that, although it receives contributions from both Abelian and non-Abelian Bloch states, the Chern number can be calculated solely from Abelian states, resulting in a tremendous simplification of the topological band theory. Finally, we verify our results numerically by computing various Chern numbers in the hyperbolic Haldane model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a family of algebras defined using a locally-finite endomorphism called a braiding map. When the braiding map is semi-simple, the algebra is a generalized vertex algebra, while when the braiding map is locally-nilpotent we have a logarithmic vertex algebra. We describe a method that associates to these algebras non-local Poisson vertex algebras, and we use this relation to build a new example of a generalized vertex algebra motivated by the non-linear Schr\"odinger non-local Poisson vertex algebra</description>

      <title>A hyperbolic Kac-Moody Calogero model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.06519v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new kind of quantum Calogero model is proposed, based on a hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebra. We formulate nonrelativistic quantum mechanics on the Minkowskian root space of the simplest rank-3 hyperbolic Lie algebra $AE_3$ with an inverse-square potential given by its real roots and reduce it to the unit future hyperboloid. By stereographic projection this defines a quantum mechanics on the Poincar\'e disk with a unique potential. Since the Weyl group of $AE_3$ is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ extension of the modular group PSL(2,$\mathbb{Z}_2$), the model is naturally formulated on the complex upper half plane, and its potential is a real modular function. We present and illustrate the relevant features of $AE_3$, give some approximations to the potential and rewrite it as an (almost everywhere convergent) Poincar\'e series. The standard Dunkl operators are constructed and investigated on Minkowski space and on the hyperboloid. In the former case find that their commutativity is obstructed by rank-2 subgroups of hyperbolic type (the simplest one given by the Fibonacci sequence), casting doubt on the integrability of the model. An appendix with Don Zagier investigates the computability of the potential. We foresee applications to cosmological billards and to quantum chaos.</description>

Abstract: We provide sufficient conditions such that the time evolution of a mesoscopic tight-binding open system with a local Hartree-Fock non-linearity converges to a self-consistent non-equilibrium steady state, which is independent of the initial condition from the "small sample". We also show that the steady charge current intensities are given by Landauer-B\"uttiker-like formulas, and make the connection with the case of weakly self-interacting many-body systems.</description>

      <title>An Analog of the Rothe Method for Some Ill-Posed Problems for Parabolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical method of Rothe (1930) proves existence and uniqueness theorems for initial boundary value problems for parabolic equations using the explicit finite difference scheme with respect to time. On the other hand, time dependent experimental data are always collected on discrete time grids, and the grid step size cannot be arranged to be infinitely small. The same is true for numerical studies. Therefore, this motivates a study of both unique continuation problems and coefficient inverse problems for parabolic equations, written in the form of finite differences with respect to time and without allowing the grid step size to tend to zero. We call this "t-finite difference framework" (TFD). Dissimilarities with the classical Rothe method are named as well. A long standing open question addressed for the first time, although within the TFD framework. A specific applied example of monitoring epidemics using boundary measurements is discussed. In particular, a numerical method for this problem is constructed and its global convergence is proven.</description>

Abstract: We examine the heap of linear connections on anchored vector bundles and Lie algebroids. Naturally, this covers the example of affine connections on a manifold. We present some new interpretations of classical results via this ternary structure of connections. Endomorphisms of linear connections are studied, and their ternary structure, in particular the endomorphism truss, is explicitly presented. We remark that the use of ternary structures in differential geometry is novel and that the endomorphism truss of linear connections provides a concrete geometric example of a truss.</description>

Abstract: An irreducible complete atomic OML of infinite height cannot both be algebraic and have the covering property. However, Kalmbach's construction provides an example of such an OML that is algebraic and has the 2-covering property, and Keller's construction provides an example of such an OML that has the covering property and is completely hereditarily atomic. Completely hereditarily atomic OMLs generalize algebraic OMLs suitably to quantum predicate logic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mysterious phenomena of revivals in linear dispersive periodic equations was discovered first experimentally in optics in the 19th century, then rediscovered several times by theoretical and experimental investigations. While the term has been used systematically and consistently by many authors, there is no consensus on a rigorous definition. In this paper, we describe revivals modulo a regularity condition in a large class of Schr\"odinger's equations with complex bounded potentials. As we show, at rational times the solution is given explicitly by finite linear combinations of translations and dilations of the initial datum, plus an additional continuous term.</description>

Electric and magnetic fields are non-uniform. According to the exact expression for the wave function, the search for two types of the Wigner functions is conducted. The first function is the usual Wigner function with a modified momentum. The second Wigner function is constructed on the basis of the Weyl-Stratonovich transform in papers [Phys. Rev. A 35 2791 (1987)] or [Phys. Rev. B 99 014423 (2019)]. It turns out that the second function, unlike the first one, has areas of negative values for wave functions with the Gaussian distribution (Hudson's theorem). An example of electromagnetic quantum system described by a non-Gaussian wave function has successfully been found. The second Wigner function is positive over the whole phase space for the non-Gaussian wave function. This result is analogous to the Hudson theorem for the gage-invariant Wigner function.
  On the one hand, knowing the Wigner functions allows one to find the distribution of the mean momentum vector field and the energy spectrum of the quantum system. On the other hand, within the framework of the Wigner-Vlasov formalism, the mean momentum distribution and the magnitude of the energy are initially known. Consequently, the mean momentum distributions and energy values obtained according to the Wigner functions can be compared with the exact momentum distribution and energy values. This paper presents this comparison and describes the differences. The Vlasov-Moyal approximation of average acceleration flow has been built in phase space for a quantum system with electromagnetic field. The obtained approximation makes it possible to cut the Vlasov chain off at the second equation and also to analyze the Boltzmann H-function evolution.</description>

      <title>The pseudospectrum of an operator with Bessel-type singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the asymptotic structure of the pseudospectrum of the singular Sturm-Liouville operator $L=\partial_x(f\partial_x)+\partial_x$ subject to periodic boundary conditions on a symmetric interval, where the coefficient $f$ is a regular odd function that has only a simple zero at the origin. The operator $L$ is closely related to a remarkable model examined by Davies in 2007, which exhibits surprising spectral properties balancing symmetries and strong non-self-adjointness. In our main result, we derive a concrete construction of classical pseudo-modes for $L$ and give explicit exponential bounds of growth for the resolvent norm in rays away from the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of free-fermion systems, signal processing and algebraic combinatorics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper offers a review of recent studies on the entanglement of free-fermion systems on graphs that take advantage of methods pertaining to signal processing and algebraic combinatorics. On the one hand, a parallel with time and band limiting problems is used to obtain a tridiagonal matrix commuting with the chopped correlation matrix in bispectral situations and on the other, the irreducible decomposition of the Terwilliger algebra arising in the context of $P$-polynomial association schemes is seen to yield a simplifying framework.</description>

Abstract: I introduce a systematic procedure for constructing complete and independent sets of interactions of fields transforming under exotic representations of SU(N), in particular the SU(3) gauge group of QCD. It uncovers errors in previous results, starting with interactions of four fields including a single sextet.</description>

      <title>Spectral continuum in the Rabi-Stark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rabi-Stark model is a non-linear generalization of the quantum Rabi model including the dynamical Stark shift as a tunable term, which can be realized via quantum simulation on a cavity QED platform. When the Stark coupling becomes equal to the mode frequency, the spectrum changes drastically, a transition usually termed "spectral collapse" because numerical studies indicate an infinitely degenerate ground state. We show that the spectrum extends continuously from a threshold value up to infinity. A set of normalizable states are embedded in the continuum which furnishes an unexpected analogy to the atomic Stark effect. Bound states and continuum can be obtained analytically through two equally justified, but different confluence processes of the associated differential equation in Bargmann space. Moreover, these results are obtained independently using a method based on adiabatic elimination of the spin degree of freedom and corroborated through large-scale numerical checks.</description>

      <title>Axial Anomalies of Maximally Supersymmetric Tensor Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit anomalies of $(4,0)$ and $(3,1)$ maximally supersymmetric tensor theories in $d=6$. A $(4,0)$ on-shell tensor multiplet descends to that of the $d=5$ maximal supergravity upon a dimensional reduction, hypothesized to offer a strong-coupled UV completion of the latter in the same sense of $(2,0)$ theories as the UV completion of $d=5$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ pure Yang-Mills. The gravitational anomalies, found to be nonvanishing, had been computed, although its relevance in the absence of the $d=6$ metric is not obvious. We perform a comprehensive anomaly computation for $(4,0)$ and $(3,1)$ tensor supermultiplets, respectively, for $Sp(4)$ and $Sp(3)\times Sp(1)$ $R$-symmetry anomalies and the mixed $R$-gravitational anomaly thereof, and find that anomalies involving $R$-symmetries cancel out identically. We close with questions on how to address the anomaly in this class of theories with no general covariance.</description>

      <title>From Entanglement to Universality: A Multiparticle Spacetime Algebra Approach to Quantum Computational Gates Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alternative mathematical explorations in quantum computing can be of great scientific interest, especially if they come with penetrating physical insights. In this paper, we present a critical revisitation of our geometric (Clifford) algebras (GAs) application in quantum computing as originally presented in [C. Cafaro and S. Mancini, Adv. Appl. Clifford Algebras 21, 493 (2011)]. Our focus is on testing the usefulness of geometric algebras (GAs) techniques in two applications to quantum computing. First, making use of the geometric algebra of a relativistic configuration space (a.k.a., multiparticle spacetime algebra or MSTA), we offer an explicit algebraic characterization of one- and two-qubit quantum states together with a MSTA description of one- and two-qubit quantum computational gates. In this first application, we devote special attention to the concept of entanglement, focusing on entangled quantum states and two-qubit entangling quantum gates. Second, exploiting the previously mentioned MSTA characterization together with the GA depiction of the Lie algebras SO(3;R) and SU(2;C) depending on the rotor group formalism, we focus our attention to the concept of universality in quantum computing by reevaluating Boykin's proof on the identification of a suitable set of universal quantum gates. At the end of our mathematical exploration, we arrive at two main conclusions. Firstly, the MSTA perspective leads to a powerful conceptual unification between quantum states and quantum operators. More specifically, the complex qubit space and the complex space of unitary operators acting on them merge in a single multivectorial real space. Secondly, the GA viewpoint on rotations based on the rotor group carries both conceptual and computational upper hands compared to conventional vectorial and matricial methods.</description>
