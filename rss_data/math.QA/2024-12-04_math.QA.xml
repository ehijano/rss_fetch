      <title>Infinitesimal $\mathcal{R}$-matrices for some families of Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a bialgebra $H$ such that the associated trivial topological bialgebra $H[[\hbar]]$ admits a quasitriangular structure $\tilde{\mathcal{R}}=\mathcal{R}(1\otimes 1+\hbar\chi+\mathcal{O}(\hbar^2))$, one gets a distinguished element $\chi \in H \otimes H$ which is an infinitesimal $\mathcal{R}$-matrix, according to the definition given in [1]. In this paper we classify infinitesimal $\mathcal{R}$-matrices for some families of well-known Hopf algebras, among which are the generalized Kac-Paljutkin Hopf algebras $H_{2n^2}$, the Radford Hopf algebras $H_{(r,n,q)}$, and the Hopf algebras $E(n)$.</description>

      <title>Garsideness properties of structure groups of set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.03176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exists a multiplicative homomorphism from the braid group B to the Temperley-Lieb algebra TL. Moreover, the homomorphic images in TL of the simple elements form a basis for the vector space underlying TL. In analogy with the case of B, there exists a multiplicative homomorphism from the structure group G of a non-degenerate, involutive set-theoretic solution to an algebra, which extends to a homomorphism of algebras. We construct a finite basis of the underlying vector space of the image of G using the Garsideness properties of the solution.</description>

      <title>Topological Cosets via Anyon Condensation and Applications to Gapped $\mathrm{\bf{QCD_{2}}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coset construction of two-dimensional conformal field theory (2D CFT) defines a 2D CFT by taking the quotient of two previously known chiral algebras. In this work, we use the methods of non-abelian (non-invertible) anyon condensation to describe 2D topological cosets, defined by the special case where the quotient of chiral algebras is a conformal embedding. In this case, the coset has zero central charge, and the coset theory is thus purely topological. Using non-abelian anyon condensation we describe in general the spectrum of line and local operators as well as their fusion, operator product expansion, and the action of the lines on local operators. An important application of our results is to QCD$_{2}$ with massless fermions in any representation that leads to a gapped phase, where topological cosets (conjecturally) describe the infrared fixed point. We discuss several such examples in detail. For instance, we find that the $Spin(8)_{1}/SU(3)_{3}$ and $Spin(16)_{1}/Spin(9)_{2}$ topological cosets appearing at the infrared fixed point of appropriate QCD$_{2}$ theories are described by $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$ triality and $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathrm{Rep(S_{3})}$ fusion categories respectively. Additionally, using this setup, we argue that chiral $Spin(8)$ QCD$_{2}$ with massless chiral fermions in the vectorial and spinorial representations is not only gapped, but moreover trivially gapped, with a unique ground state.</description>

      <title>On the Realization of quantum gates coming from the Tracy-Singh product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tracy-Singh product of matrices permits to construct a new gate $c \boxtimes c'$ from two $2$-qudit gates $c$ and $c'$. If $c$ and $c'$ are both Yang-Baxter gates, then $c \boxtimes c'$ is also a Yang-Baxter gate, and if at least one of them is entangling, then $c \boxtimes c'$ is also entangling. A natural question arises about the realisation of these gates, $c \boxtimes c'$, in terms of local and universal gates. In this paper, we consider this question and describe this realisation.</description>

      <title>Self-Dual Gauge Theory from the Top Down</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of dualities between certain non-supersymmetric self-dual gauge theories on a large class of $4d$ self-dual asymptotically flat backgrounds, and the large $N$ limit of an independently defined $2d$ chiral defect CFT. Our construction goes via twisted holography for the type I topological string on a Calabi-Yau five-fold which fibres over twistor space. In particular, we show that single-trace operators of the $2d$ defect CFT are in bijection with states of the celestial chiral algebra. We match the operator products of these states with the collinear splitting amplitudes of the self-dual gauge theory up to one-loop. Assigning vacuum expectations to central operators in the boundary theory computes bulk amplitudes on self-dual backgrounds. We are able to extract form factors from these amplitudes, which we use to give a simple closed formula for certain $n$-point two-loop all $+$ amplitudes in $\mathrm{SU}(K) \times \mathrm{SU}(R)$ gauge theory coupled to bifundamental massless fermions.</description>

      <title>Eleven-dimensional supergravity as a Calabi-Yau twofold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a generalization of Poisson-Chern-Simons theory, defined on any supermanifold equipped with an appropriate filtration of the tangent bundle. Our construction recovers interacting eleven-dimensional supergravity in Cederwall's formulation, as well as all possible twists of the theory, and does so in a uniform and geometric fashion. Among other things, this proves that Costello's description of the maximal twist is the twist of eleven-dimensional supergravity in its pure spinor description. It also provides a pure spinor lift of the interactions in the minimally twisted theory. Our techniques enhance the BV formulation of the interactions of each theory to a homotopy Poisson structure by defining a compatible graded-commutative product; this suggests interpretations in terms of deformations of geometric structures on superspace, and provides some concrete evidence for a first-quantized origin of the theories.</description>
