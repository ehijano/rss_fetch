      <title>Thiol post-translational modifications modulate allosteric regulation of the OpcA-G6PDH complex through conformational gate control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyanobacteria require ultra-fast metabolic switching to maintain reducing power balance during environmental fluctuations. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), catalyzing the rate-limiting step of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP), provides essential NADPH and metabolic intermediates for biosynthetic processes and redox homeostasis. In cyanobacteria, the unique redox-sensitive protein OpcA acts as a metabolic switch for G6PDH, enabling rapid adjustment of reducing power generation from glycogen catabolism and resulting in precise regulation of carbon flux between anabolic and catabolic pathways. While the redox-sensitive cysteine structures of OpcA are known to regulate G6PDH, the detailed mechanisms of how redox post-translational modifications (PTMs) influence OpcA's allosteric effects on G6PDH structures and function remain elusive. To investigate this mechanism, we utilized computational modeling combined with experimental redox proteomics using Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 as a model system. Redox proteomics captured modified cysteine residues under light/dark or circadian shifts. Computational simulation revealed that thiol PTMs near the OpcA-G6PDH interface are crucial to allosteric regulation of regions affecting the G6PDH activity, including a potential gate region for substrate ingress and product egress, as well as critical hydrogen bond networks within the active site. These PTMs promote rapid metabolic switching by enhancing G6PDH catalytic activity when OpcA is oxidized. This study provides evidence for novel molecular mechanisms that elucidate the importance of thiol PTMs of OpcA in modulating G6PDH structure and function in an allosteric manner, demonstrating how PTM-level regulation provides a critical control mechanism that enables cyanobacteria to rapidly adapt to environmental fluctuations through precise metabolic fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>What exactly is 'active matter'?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the study of active matter has developed into one of the most rapidly growing subfields of condensed matter physics, more and more kinds of physical systems have been included in this framework. While the word 'active' is often thought of as referring to self-propelled particles, it is also applied to a large variety of other systems such as non-polar active nematics or certain particles with non-reciprocal interactions. Developing novel forms of active matter, as attempted, e.g., in the framework of quantum active matter, requires a clear idea of what active matter is. Here, we critically discuss how the understanding of active matter has changed over time, what precisely a definition of 'active matter' can look like, and to what extent it is (still) possible to define active matter in a way that covers all systems that are commonly understood as active matter while distinguishing them from other driven systems. Moreover, we discuss the definition of an 'active field theory', where 'active' is used as an attribute of a theoretical model rather than of a physical system. We show that the usage of the term 'active' requires agreement on a coarse-grained viewpoint. We discuss the meaning of 'active' both in general terms and via the specific examples of chemically driven particles, ultrasound-driven particles, active nematics, particles with non-reciprocal interactions, intracellular phase separation, and quantum active matter.</description>

      <title>Exploring the role of sample thickness for hyperspectral microscopy tissue discrimination through Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in multispectral (MS) and hyperspectral (HS) microscopy have focused on sensor and system improvements, yet sample processing remains overlooked. We conducted an analysis of the literature, revealing that 40 percent of studies do not report sample thickness. Among those that did report it, the vast majority, 98 percent, used 2 to 10 micrometer samples. This study investigates the impact of unstained sample thickness on MS/HS image quality through light transport simulations. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted on various tissue types (i.e., breast, colorectal, liver, and lung). The simulations revealed that thin samples reduce tissue differentiation, while higher thicknesses (approximately 500 micrometers) improve discrimination, though at the cost of reduced light intensity. These findings highlight the need to study and optimize sample thickness for enhanced tissue characterization and diagnostic accuracy in MS/HS microscopy.</description>

      <title>Counting Chemical Isomers with Multivariate Generating Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counting the number of isomers of a chemical molecule is one of the formative problems of graph theory. However, recent progress has been slow, and the problem has largely been ignored in modern network science. Here we provide an introduction to the mathematics of counting network structures and then use it to derive results for two new classes of molecules. In contrast to previously studied examples, these classes take additional chemical complexity into account and thus require the use of multi-variate generating functions. The results illustrate the elegance of counting theory, highlighting it as an important tool that should receive more attention in network science.</description>

      <title>Molecular adhesion assay for biopolymer systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular adhesion plays a central role in many biological systems, yet existing methods to quantify adhesive strength often struggle to bridge the gap between single-molecule resolution and biologically relevant environments. Here, we present a scalable micromagnetic bead-based adhesion assay capable of quantifying detachment forces under physiologically meaningful conditions. Designed to probe mucoadhesion in the context of mucociliary clearance, our system applies controlled magnetic forces to ligand-coated beads adhered to functionalized substrates and tracks detachment events using high-speed microscopy and calibrated z-displacement mapping. The platform combines substrate- and bead-side surface chemistry control with high-throughput imaging and in situ force calibration via Stokes drag. We demonstrate the ability to distinguish sub-nanonewton to nanonewton force regimes across a range of bead-substrate pairings, including COOH-COOH, PEG-PEG, and cell culture-derived human bronchial epithelial (HBE) mucus interactions. Surface functionalization was validated via fluorescence imaging and zeta potential measurements, while detachment forces were used to estimate binding energy and infer dissociation constants. This assay enables detailed characterization of multivalent, force-sensitive adhesive interactions and offers a powerful new approach for studying bioadhesive systems, including mucus-pathogen interactions and drug delivery materials.</description>

      <title>Fractional Brownian motion with mean-density interaction: a myopic self-avoiding fractional stochastic process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractional Brownian motion is a Gaussian stochastic process with long-range correlations in time; it has been shown to be a useful model of anomalous diffusion. Here, we investigate the effects of mutual interactions in an ensemble of particles undergoing fractional Brownian motion. Specifically, we introduce a mean-density interaction in which each particle in the ensemble is coupled to the gradient of the total, time-integrated density produced by the entire ensemble. We report the results of extensive computer simulations for the mean-squared displacements and the probability densities of particles undergoing one-dimensional fractional Brownian motion with such a mean-density interaction. We find two qualitatively different regimes, depending on the anomalous diffusion exponent $\alpha$ characterizing the fractional Gaussian noise. The motion is governed by the interactions for $\alpha &lt; 4/3$ whereas it is dominated by the fractional Gaussian noise for $\alpha &gt; 4/3$. We develop a scaling theory explaining our findings. We also discuss generalizations to higher space dimensions and nonlinear interactions, the relation of our process to the ``true'' or myopic self-avoiding walk, as well as applications to the growth of strongly stochastic axons (e.g., serotonergic fibers) in vertebrate brains.</description>
