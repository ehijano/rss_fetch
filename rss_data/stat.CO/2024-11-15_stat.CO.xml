      <title>fdesigns: Bayesian Optimal Designs of Experiments for Functional Models in R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the R package fdesigns that implements a methodology for identifying Bayesian optimal experimental designs for models whose factor settings are functions, known as profile factors. This type of experiments which involve factors that vary dynamically over time, presenting unique challenges in both estimation and design due to the infinite-dimensional nature of functions. The package fdesigns implements a dimension reduction method leveraging basis functions of the B-spline basis system. The package fdesigns contains functions that effectively reduce the design problem to the optimisation of basis coefficients for functional linear functional generalised linear models, and it accommodates various options. Applications of the fdesigns package are demonstrated through a series of examples that showcase its capabilities in identifying optimal designs for functional linear and generalised linear models. The examples highlight how the package's functions can be used to efficiently design experiments involving both profile and scalar factors, including interactions and polynomial effects.</description>

      <title>On the Selection Stability of Stability Selection and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stability selection is a widely adopted resampling-based framework for high-dimensional structure estimation and variable selection. However, the concept of 'stability' is often narrowly addressed, primarily through examining selection frequencies, or 'stability paths'. This paper seeks to broaden the use of an established stability estimator to evaluate the overall stability of the stability selection framework, moving beyond single-variable analysis. We suggest that the stability estimator offers two advantages: it can serve as a reference to reflect the robustness of the outcomes obtained and help identify an optimal regularization value to improve stability. By determining this value, we aim to calibrate key stability selection parameters, namely, the decision threshold and the expected number of falsely selected variables, within established theoretical bounds. Furthermore, we explore a novel selection criterion based on this regularization value. With the asymptotic distribution of the stability estimator previously established, convergence to true stability is ensured, allowing us to observe stability trends over successive sub-samples. This approach sheds light on the required number of sub-samples addressing a notable gap in prior studies. The 'stabplot' package is developed to facilitate the use of the plots featured in this manuscript, supporting their integration into further statistical analysis and research workflows.</description>

      <title>Gaussian process modelling of infectious diseases using the Greta software package and GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian process are a widely-used statistical tool for conducting non-parametric inference in applied sciences, with many computational packages available to fit to data and predict future observations. We study the use of the Greta software for Bayesian inference to apply Gaussian process regression to spatio-temporal data of infectious disease outbreaks and predict future disease spread. Greta builds on Tensorflow, making it comparatively easy to take advantage of the significant gain in speed offered by GPUs. In these complex spatio-temporal models, we show a reduction of up to 70\% in computational time relative to fitting the same models on CPUs. We show how the choice of covariance kernel impacts the ability to infer spread and extrapolate to unobserved spatial and temporal units. The inference pipeline is applied to weekly incidence data on tuberculosis in the East and West Midlands regions of England over a period of two years.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical mixtures of Unigram models for short text clustering: the role of Beta-Liouville priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a variant of the Multinomial mixture model tailored for the unsupervised classification of short text data. Traditionally, the Multinomial probability vector in this hierarchical model is assigned a Dirichlet prior distribution. Here, however, we explore an alternative prior--the Beta-Liouville distribution--which offers a more flexible correlation structure than the Dirichlet. We examine the theoretical properties of the Beta-Liouville distribution, focusing on its conjugacy with the Multinomial likelihood. This property enables the derivation of update equations for a CAVI (Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference) variational algorithm, facilitating the approximate posterior estimation of model parameters. Additionally, we propose a stochastic variant of the CAVI algorithm that enhances scalability. The paper concludes with data examples that demonstrate effective strategies for setting the Beta-Liouville hyperparameters.</description>
