      <title>Foveated Compression for Immersive Telepresence Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immersive televisualization is important both for telepresence and teleoperation, but resolution and fidelity are often limited by communication bandwidth constraints. We propose a lightweight method for foveated compression of immersive televisualization video streams that can be easily integrated with common video codecs, reducing the required bandwidth if eye tracking data is available. Specifically, we show how to spatially adjust the Quantization Parameter of modern block-based video codecs in a adaptive way based on eye tracking information. The foveal region is transmitted with high fidelity while quality is reduced in the peripheral region, saving bandwidth. We integrate our method with the NimbRo avatar system, which won the ANA Avatar XPRIZE competition. Our experiments show that bandwidth can be reduced to a third without sacrificing immersion. We analyze transmission fidelity with qualitative examples and report quantitative results.</description>

      <title>Beyond Text: Multimodal Jailbreaking of Vision-Language and Audio Models through Perceptually Simple Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet remain critically vulnerable to adversarial attacks that exploit weaknesses in cross-modal processing. We present a systematic study of multimodal jailbreaks targeting both vision-language and audio-language models, showing that even simple perceptual transformations can reliably bypass state-of-the-art safety filters. Our evaluation spans 1,900 adversarial prompts across three high-risk safety categories harmful content, CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear), and CSEM (Child Sexual Exploitation Material) tested against seven frontier models. We explore the effectiveness of attack techniques on MLLMs, including FigStep-Pro (visual keyword decomposition), Intelligent Masking (semantic obfuscation), and audio perturbations (Wave-Echo, Wave-Pitch, Wave-Speed). The results reveal severe vulnerabilities: models with almost perfect text-only safety (0\% ASR) suffer &gt;75\% attack success under perceptually modified inputs, with FigStep-Pro achieving up to 89\% ASR in Llama-4 variants. Audio-based attacks further uncover provider-specific weaknesses, with even basic modality transfer yielding 25\% ASR for technical queries. These findings expose a critical gap between text-centric alignment and multimodal threats, demonstrating that current safeguards fail to generalize across cross-modal attacks. The accessibility of these attacks, which require minimal technical expertise, suggests that robust multimodal AI safety will require a paradigm shift toward broader semantic-level reasoning to mitigate possible risks.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Multimodal Consensus for Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity, which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels, enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CMC.</description>

      <title>GMFVAD: Using Grained Multi-modal Feature to Improve Video Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD). Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the reduction of redundant information.</description>

      <title>Causal Debiasing for Visual Commonsense Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets, comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore, we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across different datasets.</description>

      <title>DMC$^3$: Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction for Egocentric Video Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction (DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples. Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the \textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Cross-modal Representation Bias for Multicultural Image-to-Recipe Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images, while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual multicultural datasets.</description>

      <title>Open-o3 Video: Grounded Video Reasoning with Explicit Spatio-Temporal Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3 have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers, allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets, STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision. On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance, raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and improving answer reliability.</description>

      <title>Rebalancing Contrastive Alignment with Bottlenecked Semantic Increments in Text-Video Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12499v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in text-video retrieval has been largely driven by contrastive learning. However, existing methods often overlook the effect of the modality gap, which causes anchor representations to undergo in-place optimization (i.e., optimization tension) that limits their alignment capacity. Moreover, noisy hard negatives further distort the semantics of anchors. To address these issues, we propose GARE, a Gap-Aware Retrieval framework that introduces a learnable, pair-specific increment $\Delta_{ij}$ between text $t_i$ and video $v_j$, redistributing gradients to relieve optimization tension and absorb noise. We derive $\Delta_{ij}$ via a multivariate first-order Taylor expansion of the InfoNCE loss under a trust-region constraint, showing that it guides updates along locally consistent descent directions. A lightweight neural module conditioned on the semantic gap couples increments across batches for structure-aware correction. Furthermore, we regularize $\Delta$ through a variational information bottleneck with relaxed compression, enhancing stability and semantic consistency. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that GARE consistently improves alignment accuracy and robustness, validating the effectiveness of gap-aware tension mitigation.

      <title>Epistemic-aware Vision-Language Foundation Model for Fetal Ultrasound Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable.
