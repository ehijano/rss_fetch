      <title>Epsilon-Minimax Solutions of Statistical Decision Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A decision rule is epsilon-minimax if it is minimax up to an additive factor epsilon. We present an algorithm for provably obtaining epsilon-minimax solutions of statistical decision problems. We are interested in problems where the statistician chooses randomly among I decision rules. The minimax solution of these problems admits a convex programming representation over the (I-1)-simplex. Our suggested algorithm is a well-known mirror subgradient descent routine, designed to approximately solve the convex optimization problem that defines the minimax decision rule. This iterative routine is known in the computer science literature as the hedge algorithm and it is used in algorithmic game theory as a practical tool to find approximate solutions of two-person zero-sum games. We apply the suggested algorithm to different minimax problems in the econometrics literature. An empirical application to the problem of optimally selecting sites to maximize the external validity of an experimental policy evaluation illustrates the usefulness of the suggested procedure.</description>

      <title>Estimating Peer Effects Using Partial Network Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the estimation of peer effects through social networks when researchers do not observe the entire network structure. Special cases include sampled networks, censored networks, and misclassified links. We assume that researchers can obtain a consistent estimator of the distribution of the network. We show that this assumption is sufficient for estimating peer effects using a linear-in-means model. We provide an empirical application to the study of peer effects on students' academic achievement using the widely used Add Health database, and show that network data errors have a large downward bias on estimated peer effects.</description>

      <title>Posterior inference of attitude-behaviour relationships using latent class choice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The link between attitudes and behaviour has been a key topic in choice modelling for two decades, with the widespread application of ever more complex hybrid choice models. This paper proposes a flexible and transparent alternative framework for empirically examining the relationship between attitudes and behaviours using latent class choice models (LCCMs). Rather than embedding attitudinal constructs within the structural model, as in hybrid choice frameworks, we recover class-specific attitudinal profiles through posterior inference. This approach enables analysts to explore attitude-behaviour associations without the complexity and convergence issues often associated with integrated estimation. Two case studies are used to demonstrate the framework: one on employee preferences for working from home, and another on public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines. Across both studies, we compare posterior profiling of indicator means, fractional multinomial logit (FMNL) models, factor-based representations, and hybrid specifications. We find that posterior inference methods provide behaviourally rich insights with minimal additional complexity, while factor-based models risk discarding key attitudinal information, and fullinformation hybrid models offer little gain in explanatory power and incur substantially greater estimation burden. Our findings suggest that when the goal is to explain preference heterogeneity, posterior inference offers a practical alternative to hybrid models, one that retains interpretability and robustness without sacrificing behavioural depth.</description>

      <title>On the Identification of Diagnostic Expectations: Econometric Insights from DSGE Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides the first econometric evidence for diagnostic expectations (DE) in DSGE models. Using the identification framework of Qu and Tkachenko (2017), I show that DE generate dynamics unattainable under rational expectations (RE), with no RE parameterization capable of matching the volatility and persistence patterns implied by DE. Consequently, DE are not observationally equivalent to RE and constitute an endogenous source of macroeconomic fluctuations, distinct from both structural frictions and exogenous shocks. From an econometric perspective, DE preserve overall model identification but weaken the identification of shock variances. To ensure robust conclusions across estimation methods and equilibrium conditions, I extend Bayesian estimation with Sequential Monte Carlo sampling to the indeterminacy domain. These findings advance the econometric study of expectations and highlight the macroeconomic relevance of diagnostic beliefs.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Bayesian Inference: Strange Attractors as Risk Models for Black Swan Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new risk modeling framework where chaotic attractors shape the geometry of Bayesian inference. By combining heavy-tailed priors with Lorenz and Rossler dynamics, the models naturally generate volatility clustering, fat tails, and extreme events. We compare two complementary approaches: Model A, which emphasizes geometric stability, and Model B, which highlights rare bursts using Fibonacci diagnostics. Together, they provide a dual perspective for systemic risk analysis, linking Black Swan theory to practical tools for stress testing and volatility monitoring.</description>

      <title>Functional Regression with Nonstationarity and Error Contamination: Application to the Economic Impact of Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a functional regression model with nonstationary dependent and explanatory functional observations, in which the nonstationary stochastic trends of the dependent variable are explained by those of the explanatory variable, and the functional observations may be error-contaminated. We develop novel autocovariance-based estimation and inference methods for this model. The methodology is broadly applicable to economic and statistical functional time series with nonstationary dynamics. To illustrate our methodology and its usefulness, we apply it to the evaluation of the global economic impact of climate change, an issue of intrinsic importance.</description>

      <title>Macroeconomic Spillovers of Weather Shocks across U.S. States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the short-run effects of weather-related disasters on local economic activity and cross-border spillovers that operate through economic linkages between U.S. states. To this end, we use emergency declarations triggered by natural disasters and estimate their effects using a monthly Global Vector Autoregressive (GVAR) model for U.S. states. Impulse responses highlight the nationwide effects of weather-related disasters that hit individual regions. Taking into account economic linkages between states allows capturing much stronger spillovers than those associated with mere spatial proximity. The results underscore the importance of geographic heterogeneity for impact evaluation and the critical role of supply-side propagation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Identification and Estimation of Simultaneous Equation Models Using Higher-Order Cumulant Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying structural parameters in linear simultaneous-equation models is a longstanding challenge. Recent work exploits information in higher-order moments of non-Gaussian data. In this literature, the structural errors are typically assumed to be uncorrelated so that, after standardizing the covariance matrix of the observables (whitening), the structural parameter matrix becomes orthogonal -- a device that underpins many identification proofs but can be restrictive in econometric applications. We show that neither zero covariance nor whitening is necessary. For any order $h&gt;2$, a simple diagonality condition on the $h$th-order cumulants alone identifies the structural parameter matrix -- up to unknown scaling and permutation -- as the solution to an eigenvector problem; no restrictions on cumulants of other orders are required. This general, single-order result enlarges the class of models covered by our framework and yields a sample-analogue estimator that is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent, asymptotically normal, and easy to compute. Furthermore, when uncorrelatedness is intrinsic -- as in vector autoregressive (VAR) models -- our framework provides a transparent overidentification test. Monte Carlo experiments show favorable finite-sample performance, and two applications -- "Returns to Schooling" and "Uncertainty and the Business Cycle" -- demonstrate its practical value.</description>
