      <title>Augmentation through Laundering Attacks for Audio Spoof Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent text-to-speech (TTS) developments have made voice cloning (VC) more realistic, affordable, and easily accessible. This has given rise to many potential abuses of this technology, including Joe Biden's New Hampshire deepfake robocall. Several methodologies have been proposed to detect such clones. However, these methodologies have been trained and evaluated on relatively clean databases. Recently, ASVspoof 5 Challenge introduced a new crowd-sourced database of diverse acoustic conditions including various spoofing attacks and codec conditions. This paper is our submission to the ASVspoof 5 Challenge and aims to investigate the performance of Audio Spoof Detection, trained using data augmentation through laundering attacks, on the ASVSpoof 5 database. The results demonstrate that our system performs worst on A18, A19, A20, A26, and A30 spoofing attacks and in the codec and compression conditions of C08, C09, and C10.</description>

      <title>Restorative Speech Enhancement: A Progressive Approach Using SE and Codec Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In challenging environments with significant noise and reverberation, traditional speech enhancement (SE) methods often lead to over-suppressed speech, creating artifacts during listening and harming downstream tasks performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach called Restorative SE (RestSE), which combines a lightweight SE module with a generative codec module to progressively enhance and restore speech quality. The SE module initially reduces noise, while the codec module subsequently performs dereverberation and restores speech using generative capabilities. We systematically explore various quantization techniques within the codec module to optimize performance. Additionally, we introduce a weighted loss function and feature fusion that merges the SE output with the original mixture, particularly at segments where the SE output is heavily distorted. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in enhancing speech quality under adverse conditions. Audio demos are available at: https://sophie091524.github.io/RestorativeSE/.</description>

      <title>Frozen Large Language Models Can Perceive Paralinguistic Aspects of Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As speech becomes an increasingly common modality for interacting with large language models (LLMs), it is becoming desirable to develop systems where LLMs can take into account users' emotions or speaking styles when providing their responses. In this work, we study the potential of an LLM to understand these aspects of speech without fine-tuning its weights. To do this, we utilize an end-to-end system with a speech encoder; the encoder is trained to produce token embeddings such that the LLM's response to an expressive speech prompt is aligned with its response to a semantically matching text prompt where the speaker's emotion has also been specified. We find that this training framework allows the encoder to generate tokens that capture both semantic and paralinguistic information in speech and effectively convey it to the LLM, even when the LLM remains completely frozen. We also explore training on additional emotion and style-related response alignment tasks, finding that they further increase the amount of paralinguistic information explicitly captured in the speech tokens. Experiments demonstrate that our system is able to produce higher quality and more empathetic responses to expressive speech prompts compared to several baselines.</description>

      <title>HRTF Estimation using a Score-based Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a head-related transfer function (HRTF) estimation method which relies on a data-driven prior given by a score-based diffusion model. The HRTF is estimated in reverberant environments using natural excitation signals, e.g. human speech. The impulse response of the room is estimated along with the HRTF by optimizing a parametric model of reverberation based on the statistical behaviour of room acoustics. The posterior distribution of HRTF given the reverberant measurement and excitation signal is modelled using the score-based HRTF prior and a log-likelihood approximation. We show that the resulting method outperforms several baselines, including an oracle recommender system that assigns the optimal HRTF in our training set based on the smallest distance to the true HRTF at the given direction of arrival. In particular, we show that the diffusion prior can account for the large variability of high-frequency content in HRTFs.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous sound classification with the Broad Sound Taxonomy and Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic sound classification has a wide range of applications in machine listening, enabling context-aware sound processing and understanding. This paper explores methodologies for automatically classifying heterogeneous sounds characterized by high intra-class variability. Our study evaluates the classification task using the Broad Sound Taxonomy, a two-level taxonomy comprising 28 classes designed to cover a heterogeneous range of sounds with semantic distinctions tailored for practical user applications. We construct a dataset through manual annotation to ensure accuracy, diverse representation within each class and relevance in real-world scenarios. We compare a variety of both traditional and modern machine learning approaches to establish a baseline for the task of heterogeneous sound classification. We investigate the role of input features, specifically examining how acoustically derived sound representations compare to embeddings extracted with pre-trained deep neural networks that capture both acoustic and semantic information about sounds. Experimental results illustrate that audio embeddings encoding acoustic and semantic information achieve higher accuracy in the classification task. After careful analysis of classification errors, we identify some underlying reasons for failure and propose actions to mitigate them. The paper highlights the need for deeper exploration of all stages of classification, understanding the data and adopting methodologies capable of effectively handling data complexity and generalizing in real-world sound environments.</description>

      <title>A Critical Assessment of Visual Sound Source Localization Models Including Negative Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of Visual Sound Source Localization (VSSL) involves identifying the location of sound sources in visual scenes, integrating audio-visual data for enhanced scene understanding. Despite advancements in state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, we observe three critical flaws: i) The evaluation of the models is mainly focused in sounds produced by objects that are visible in the image, ii) The evaluation often assumes a prior knowledge of the size of the sounding object, and iii) No universal threshold for localization in real-world scenarios is established, as previous approaches only consider positive examples without accounting for both positive and negative cases. In this paper, we introduce a novel test set and metrics designed to complete the current standard evaluation of VSSL models by testing them in scenarios where none of the objects in the image corresponds to the audio input, i.e. a negative audio. We consider three types of negative audio: silence, noise and offscreen. Our analysis reveals that numerous SOTA models fail to appropriately adjust their predictions based on audio input, suggesting that these models may not be leveraging audio information as intended. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the range of maximum values in the estimated audio-visual similarity maps, in both positive and negative audio cases, and show that most of the models are not discriminative enough, making them unfit to choose a universal threshold appropriate to perform sound localization without any a priori information of the sounding object, that is, object size and visibility.</description>

      <title>MOSEL: 950,000 Hours of Speech Data for Open-Source Speech Foundation Model Training on EU Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of foundation models (FMs), coupled with regulatory efforts addressing their risks and impacts, has sparked significant interest in open-source models. However, existing speech FMs (SFMs) fall short of full compliance with the open-source principles, even if claimed otherwise, as no existing SFM has model weights, code, and training data publicly available under open-source terms. In this work, we take the first step toward filling this gap by focusing on the 24 official languages of the European Union (EU). We collect suitable training data by surveying automatic speech recognition datasets and unlabeled speech corpora under open-source compliant licenses, for a total of 950k hours. Additionally, we release automatic transcripts for 441k hours of unlabeled data under the permissive CC-BY license, thereby facilitating the creation of open-source SFMs for the EU languages.</description>

      <title>Takin-VC: Zero-shot Voice Conversion via Jointly Hybrid Content and Memory-Augmented Context-Aware Timbre Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot voice conversion (VC) aims to transform the source speaker timbre into an arbitrary unseen one without altering the original speech content.While recent advancements in zero-shot VC methods have shown remarkable progress, there still remains considerable potential for improvement in terms of improving speaker similarity and speech naturalness.In this paper, we propose Takin-VC, a novel zero-shot VC framework based on jointly hybrid content and memory-augmented context-aware timbre modeling to tackle this challenge. Specifically, an effective hybrid content encoder, guided by neural codec training, that leverages quantized features from pre-trained WavLM and HybridFormer is first presented to extract the linguistic content of the source speech. Subsequently, we introduce an advanced cross-attention-based context-aware timbre modeling approach that learns the fine-grained, semantically associated target timbre features. To further enhance both speaker similarity and real-time performance, we utilize a conditional flow matching model to reconstruct the Mel-spectrogram of the source speech. Additionally, we advocate an efficient memory-augmented module designed to generate high-quality conditional target inputs for the flow matching process, thereby improving the overall performance of the proposed system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Takin-VC method surpasses state-of-the-art zero-shot VC systems, delivering superior performance in terms of both speech naturalness and speaker similarity.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Byte-Pair Encoding on Monophonic and Polyphonic Symbolic Music: A Focus on Musical Phrase Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) is an algorithm commonly used in Natural Language Processing to build a vocabulary of subwords, which has been recently applied to symbolic music. Given that symbolic music can differ significantly from text, particularly with polyphony, we investigate how BPE behaves with different types of musical content. This study provides a qualitative analysis of BPE's behavior across various instrumentations and evaluates its impact on a musical phrase segmentation task for both monophonic and polyphonic music. Our findings show that the BPE training process is highly dependent on the instrumentation and that BPE "supertokens" succeed in capturing abstract musical content. In a musical phrase segmentation task, BPE notably improves performance in a polyphonic setting, but enhances performance in monophonic tunes only within a specific range of BPE merges.</description>

      <title>TIGER: Time-frequency Interleaved Gain Extraction and Reconstruction for Efficient Speech Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, much speech separation research has focused primarily on improving model performance. However, for low-latency speech processing systems, high efficiency is equally important. Therefore, we propose a speech separation model with significantly reduced parameters and computational costs: Time-frequency Interleaved Gain Extraction and Reconstruction network (TIGER). TIGER leverages prior knowledge to divide frequency bands and compresses frequency information. We employ a multi-scale selective attention module to extract contextual features, while introducing a full-frequency-frame attention module to capture both temporal and frequency contextual information. Additionally, to more realistically evaluate the performance of speech separation models in complex acoustic environments, we introduce a dataset called EchoSet. This dataset includes noise and more realistic reverberation (e.g., considering object occlusions and material properties), with speech from two speakers overlapping at random proportions. Experimental results showed that models trained on EchoSet had better generalization ability than those trained on other datasets to the data collected in the physical world, which validated the practical value of the EchoSet. On EchoSet and real-world data, TIGER significantly reduces the number of parameters by 94.3% and the MACs by 95.3% while achieving performance surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) model TF-GridNet. This is the first speech separation model with fewer than 1 million parameters that achieves performance comparable to the SOTA model.</description>

      <title>SonicSim: A customizable simulation platform for speech processing in moving sound source scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The systematic evaluation of speech separation and enhancement models under moving sound source conditions typically requires extensive data comprising diverse scenarios. However, real-world datasets often contain insufficient data to meet the training and evaluation requirements of models. Although synthetic datasets offer a larger volume of data, their acoustic simulations lack realism. Consequently, neither real-world nor synthetic datasets effectively fulfill practical needs. To address these issues, we introduce SonicSim, a synthetic toolkit de-designed to generate highly customizable data for moving sound sources. SonicSim is developed based on the embodied AI simulation platform, Habitat-sim, supporting multi-level adjustments, including scene-level, microphone-level, and source-level, thereby generating more diverse synthetic data. Leveraging SonicSim, we constructed a moving sound source benchmark dataset, SonicSet, using the Librispeech, the Freesound Dataset 50k (FSD50K) and Free Music Archive (FMA), and 90 scenes from the Matterport3D to evaluate speech separation and enhancement models. Additionally, to validate the differences between synthetic data and real-world data, we randomly selected 5 hours of raw data without reverberation from the SonicSet validation set to record a real-world speech separation dataset, which was then compared with the corresponding synthetic datasets. Similarly, we utilized the real-world speech enhancement dataset RealMAN to validate the acoustic gap between other synthetic datasets and the SonicSet dataset for speech enhancement. The results indicate that the synthetic data generated by SonicSim can effectively generalize to real-world scenarios. Demo and code are publicly available at https://cslikai.cn/SonicSim/.</description>

      <title>Inclusive ASR for Disfluent Speech: Cascaded Large-Scale Self-Supervised Learning with Targeted Fine-Tuning and Data Augmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems often falter while processing stuttering-related disfluencies -- such as involuntary blocks and word repetitions -- yielding inaccurate transcripts. A critical barrier to progress is the scarcity of large, annotated disfluent speech datasets. Therefore, we present an inclusive ASR design approach, leveraging large-scale self-supervised learning on standard speech followed by targeted fine-tuning and data augmentation on a smaller, curated dataset of disfluent speech. Our data augmentation technique enriches training datasets with various disfluencies, enhancing ASR processing of these speech patterns. Results show that fine-tuning wav2vec 2.0 with even a relatively small, labeled dataset, alongside data augmentation, can significantly reduce word error rates for disfluent speech. Our approach not only advances ASR inclusivity for people who stutter, but also paves the way for ASRs that can accommodate wider speech variations.</description>

      <title>DiffSSD: A Diffusion-Based Dataset For Speech Forensics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion-based speech generators are ubiquitous. These methods can generate very high quality synthetic speech and several recent incidents report their malicious use. To counter such misuse, synthetic speech detectors have been developed. Many of these detectors are trained on datasets which do not include diffusion-based synthesizers. In this paper, we demonstrate that existing detectors trained on one such dataset, ASVspoof2019, do not perform well in detecting synthetic speech from recent diffusion-based synthesizers. We propose the Diffusion-Based Synthetic Speech Dataset (DiffSSD), a dataset consisting of about 200 hours of labeled speech, including synthetic speech generated by 8 diffusion-based open-source and 2 commercial generators. We also examine the performance of existing synthetic speech detectors on DiffSSD in both closed-set and open-set scenarios. The results highlight the importance of this dataset in detecting synthetic speech generated from recent open-source and commercial speech generators.</description>

      <title>Moshi: a speech-text foundation model for real-time dialogue</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Moshi, a speech-text foundation model and full-duplex spoken dialogue framework. Current systems for spoken dialogue rely on pipelines of independent components, namely voice activity detection, speech recognition, textual dialogue and text-to-speech. Such frameworks cannot emulate the experience of real conversations. First, their complexity induces a latency of several seconds between interactions. Second, text being the intermediate modality for dialogue, non-linguistic information that modifies meaning -- such as emotion or non-speech sounds -- is lost in the interaction. Finally, they rely on a segmentation into speaker turns, which does not take into account overlapping speech, interruptions and interjections. Moshi solves these independent issues altogether by casting spoken dialogue as speech-to-speech generation. Starting from a text language model backbone, Moshi generates speech as tokens from the residual quantizer of a neural audio codec, while modeling separately its own speech and that of the user into parallel streams. This allows for the removal of explicit speaker turns, and the modeling of arbitrary conversational dynamics. We moreover extend the hierarchical semantic-to-acoustic token generation of previous work to first predict time-aligned text tokens as a prefix to audio tokens. Not only this "Inner Monologue" method significantly improves the linguistic quality of generated speech, but we also illustrate how it can provide streaming speech recognition and text-to-speech. Our resulting model is the first real-time full-duplex spoken large language model, with a theoretical latency of 160ms, 200ms in practice, and is available at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/moshi.</description>

      <title>VoxHakka: A Dialectally Diverse Multi-speaker Text-to-Speech System for Taiwanese Hakka</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01548</link>

Abstract: This paper introduces VoxHakka, a text-to-speech (TTS) system designed for Taiwanese Hakka, a critically under-resourced language spoken in Taiwan. Leveraging the YourTTS framework, VoxHakka achieves high naturalness and accuracy and low real-time factor in speech synthesis while supporting six distinct Hakka dialects. This is achieved by training the model with dialect-specific data, allowing for the generation of speaker-aware Hakka speech. To address the scarcity of publicly available Hakka speech corpora, we employed a cost-effective approach utilizing a web scraping pipeline coupled with automatic speech recognition (ASR)-based data cleaning techniques. This process ensured the acquisition of a high-quality, multi-speaker, multi-dialect dataset suitable for TTS training. Subjective listening tests conducted using comparative mean opinion scores (CMOS) demonstrate that VoxHakka significantly outperforms existing publicly available Hakka TTS systems in terms of pronunciation accuracy, tone correctness, and overall naturalness. This work represents a significant advancement in Hakka language technology and provides a valuable resource for language preservation and revitalization efforts.</description>

      <title>Just ASR + LLM? A Study on Speech Large Language Models' Ability to Identify and Understand Speaker in Spoken Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, we have observed a rapid advancement in speech language models (SpeechLLMs), catching up with humans' listening and reasoning abilities. SpeechLLMs have demonstrated impressive spoken dialog question-answering (SQA) performance in benchmarks like Gaokao, the English listening test of the college entrance exam in China, which seemingly requires understanding both the spoken content and voice characteristics of speakers in a conversation. However, after carefully examining Gaokao's questions, we find the correct answers to many questions can be inferred from the conversation transcript alone, i.e.\ without speaker segmentation and identification. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models Qwen-Audio and WavLLM on both Gaokao and our proposed "What Do You Like?" dataset shows a significantly higher accuracy in these context-based questions than in identity-critical questions, which can only be answered reliably with correct speaker identification. The results and analysis suggest that when solving SQA, the current SpeechLLMs exhibit limited speaker awareness from the audio and behave similarly to an LLM reasoning from the conversation transcription without sound. We propose that tasks focused on identity-critical questions could offer a more accurate evaluation framework of SpeechLLMs in SQA.</description>

      <title>Beyond Single-Audio: Advancing Multi-Audio Processing in Audio Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various audio-LLMs (ALLMs) have been explored recently for tackling different audio tasks simultaneously using a single, unified model. While existing evaluations of ALLMs primarily focus on single-audio tasks, real-world applications often involve processing multiple audio streams simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose the first multi-audio evaluation (MAE) benchmark that consists of 20 datasets from 11 multi-audio tasks encompassing both speech and sound scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on MAE demonstrate that the existing ALLMs, while being powerful in comprehending primary audio elements in individual audio inputs, struggling to handle multi-audio scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel multi-audio-LLM (MALLM) to capture audio context among multiple similar audios using discriminative learning on our proposed synthetic data. The results demonstrate that the proposed MALLM outperforms all baselines and achieves high data efficiency using synthetic data without requiring human annotations. The proposed MALLM opens the door for ALLMs towards multi-audio processing era and brings us closer to replicating human auditory capabilities in machines.</description>

      <title>Integrating Text-to-Music Models with Language Models: Composing Long Structured Music Pieces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent music generation methods based on transformers have a context window of up to a minute. The music generated by these methods are largely unstructured beyond the context window. With a longer context window, learning long scale structures from musical data is a prohibitively challenging problem. This paper proposes integrating a text-to-music model with a large language model to generate music with form. We discuss our solutions to the challenges of such integration. The experimental results show that the proposed method can generate 2.5-minute-long music that is highly structured, strongly organized, and cohesive.</description>
