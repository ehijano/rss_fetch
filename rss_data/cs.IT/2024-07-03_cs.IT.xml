      <title>Characterizing positive-rate key-cast (and multicast network coding) with eavesdropping nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multi-source multi-terminal key-dissemination, here called ``key-cast,'' introduced by the authors in [ITW2022], network nodes hold independent random bits, and one seeks a communication scheme that allows all terminal nodes to share a secret key K. The work at hand addresses positive (albeit, arbitrarily small) rate key-cast under the security requirement that no single non-terminal network node can gain information about the shared key K; this scenario is useful in cryptographic settings. Specifically, key-dissemination protocols based on secure multicast network coding are designed. The analysis presented yields two combinatorial characterizations. In each, we assume a network in which an eavesdropper may access any individual network node. The first characterization captures all networks that support positive-rate secure multicast; computing the secure-multicast capacity in the setting studied is a known open problem. The second characterizes all networks that support positive-rate secure key-cast.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Dimensions via Learning Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the algorithmic dimensions (i.e., the lower and upper asymptotic densities of information) of infinite binary sequences in terms of the inability of learning functions having an algorithmic constraint to detect patterns in them. Our pattern detection criterion is a quantitative extension of the criterion that Zaffora Blando used to characterize the algorithmically random (i.e., Martin-L\"of random) sequences. Our proof uses Lutz's and Mayordomo's respective characterizations of algorithmic dimension in terms of gales and Kolmogorov complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bent functions are maximally nonlinear Boolean functions with an even number of variables, which include a subclass of functions, the so-called hyper-bent functions whose properties are stronger than bent functions and a complete classification of hyper-bent functions is elusive and inavailable.~In this paper,~we solve an open problem of Mesnager that describes hyper-bentness of hyper-bent functions with multiple trace terms via Dillon-like exponents with coefficients in the extension field~$\mathbb{F}_{2^{2m}}$~of this field~$\mathbb{F}_{2^{m}}$. By applying M\"{o}bius transformation and the theorems of hyperelliptic curves, hyper-bentness of these functions are successfully characterized in this field~$\mathbb{F}_{2^{2m}}$ with~$m$~odd integer.</description>

      <title>Secure Semantic Communication via Paired Adversarial Residual Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter explores the positive side of the adversarial attack for the security-aware semantic communication system. Specifically, a pair of matching pluggable modules is installed: one after the semantic transmitter and the other before the semantic receiver. The module at transmitter uses a trainable adversarial residual network (ARN) to generate adversarial examples, while the module at receiver employs another trainable ARN to remove the adversarial attacks and the channel noise. To mitigate the threat of semantic eavesdropping, the trainable ARNs are jointly optimized to minimize the weighted sum of the power of adversarial attack, the mean squared error of semantic communication, and the confidence of eavesdropper correctly retrieving private information. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme is capable of fooling the eavesdropper while maintaining the high-quality semantic communication.</description>

      <title>Abstract Markov Random Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov random fields are known to be fully characterized by properties of their information diagrams, or I-diagrams. In particular, for Markov random fields, regions in the I-diagram corresponding to disconnected vertex sets in the graph vanish. Recently, I-diagrams have been generalized to F-diagrams, for a larger class of functions F satisfying the chain rule beyond Shannon entropy, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and cross-entropy. In this work, we generalize the notion and characterization of Markov random fields to this larger class of functions F and investigate preliminary applications.
  We define F-independences, F-mutual independences, and F-Markov random fields and characterize them by their F-diagram. In the process, we also define F-dual total correlation and prove that its vanishing is equivalent to F-mutual independence. We then apply our results to information functions F that are applied to probability distributions. We show that if the probability distributions are Markov random fields for the same graph, then we formally recover the notion of an F-Markov random field for that graph. We then study the Kullback-Leibler divergence on specific Markov chains, leading to a visual representation of the second law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>On the distance distributions of single-orbit cyclic subspace codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {A cyclic subspace code is a union of the orbits of subspaces contained in it. In a recent paper, Gluesing-Luerssen et al. (Des. Codes Cryptogr. 89, 447-470, 2021) showed that the study of the distance distribution of a single orbit cyclic subspace code is equivalent to the study of its intersection distribution. In this paper we have proved that in the orbit of a subspace $U$ of $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$ that has the stabilizer $\mathbb{F}_{q^t}^*(t \neq n)$, the number of codeword pairs $(U,\alpha U)$ such that $\dim(U\cap \alpha U)=i$ for any $i,~ 0\leq i &lt; \dim(U)$, is a multiple of $q^t(q^t+1)$, if $\frac{n}{t}$ is an odd number. In the case of even $\frac{n}{t}$, if $U$ contains $\frac{q^{2tm}-1}{q^{2t}-1}~ (m\geq 0)$ distinct cyclic shifts of $\mathbb{F}_{q^{2t}}$, then the number of codeword pairs $(U,\alpha U)$ with intersection dimension $2tm$ is equal to $q^t+rq^t(q^t+1)$, for some non-negative integer $r$; and the number of codeword pairs $(U,\alpha U)$ with intersection dimension $i,~(i\neq 2tm)$ is a multiple of $q^t(q^t+1)$. Some examples have been given to illustrate the results presented in the paper.</description>

      <title>Linearization of optimal rates for independent zero-error source and channel problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-error coding encompasses a variety of source and channel problems where the probability of error must be exactly zero. The zero-error constraint differs from the vanishing-error constraint, the latter only requires the probability of error to go to zero when the block length of the code goes to infinity. Here, many problems change from a statistical nature to a combinatorial one, which is tied to the encoder's lack of knowledge about what is observed by the decoder. In this paper, we investigate two unsolved zero-error problems: the source coding with side information and the channel coding. We focus our attention on families of independent problems for which the distribution decomposes into a product of distributions, corresponding to solved zero-error problems. A crucial step is the linearization property of the optimal rate, which does not always hold in the zero-error regime, unlike in the vanishing error regime. By generalizing recent results of Wigderson and Zuiddam, and of Schrijver, we derive a condition under which the linearization properties of the complementary graph entropy H and of the zero-error capacity C0 for the AND product of graph and for the disjoint union of graphs are all equivalent. This provides new single-letter characterization of H and C0, for example when the graph is a product of perfect graphs, which is not perfect in general, and for the class of graphs obtain by the product of a perfect graph G with the pentagon graph C5. By building on Haemers result, we also show that the linearization of the complementary graph entropy does not hold for the product of the Schl\"afli graph with its complementary graph.</description>

      <title>Coding-Enhanced Cooperative Jamming for Secret Communication in Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter investigates the secret communication problem for a fluid antenna system (FAS)-assisted wiretap channel, where the legitimate transmitter transmits an information-bearing signal to the legitimate receiver, and at the same time, transmits a jamming signal to interfere with the eavesdropper (Eve). Unlike the conventional jamming scheme, which usually transmits Gaussian noise that interferes not only with Eve but also with the legitimate receiver, in this letter, we consider that encoded codewords are transmitted to jam Eve. Then, by employing appropriate coding schemes, the legitimate receiver can successfully decode the jamming signal and then cancel the interference, while Eve cannot, even if it knows the codebooks. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate through port selection and power control. Although the problem is non-convex, we show that the optimal solution can be found. Simulation results show that by using the FAS technique and the proposed jamming scheme, the secrecy rate of the system can be significantly increased.</description>

      <title>A New Achievable Region of the $K$-User MAC Wiretap Channel with Confidential and Open Messages Under Strong Secrecy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the achievable region of a $K$-user discrete memoryless (DM) multiple access wiretap (MAC-WT) channel, where each user transmits both secret and open messages. All these messages are intended for Bob, while Eve is only interested in the secret messages. In the achievable coding strategy, the confidential information is protected by open messages and also by the introduction of auxiliary messages. When introducing an auxiliary message, one has to ensure that, on one hand, its rate is large enough for protecting the secret message from Eve and, on the other hand, the resulting sum rate (together with the secret and open message rate) does not exceed Bob's decoding capability. This yields an inequality structure involving the rates of all users' secret, open, and auxiliary messages. To obtain the rate region, the auxiliary message rates must be eliminated from the system of inequalities. A direct application of the Fourier-Motzkin elimination procedure is elusive since a) it requires that the number of users $K$ is explicitly given, and b) even for small $K = 3, 4, \ldots$, the number of inequalities becomes extremely large. We prove the result for general $K$ through the combined use of Fourier-Motzkin elimination procedure and mathematical induction. This paper adopts the strong secrecy metric, characterized by information leakage. To prove the achievability under this criterion, we analyze the resolvability region of a $K$-user DM-MAC channel. In addition, we show that users with zero secrecy rate can play different roles and use different strategies in encoding their messages. These strategies yield non-redundant rate inequalities. By considering all possible coding strategies, we provide a new achievable region for the considered channel, and show that it strictly improves those already known in the existing literature by considering a specific example.</description>

Abstract: We consider the coding problem in the Stiefel manifold with chordal distance. After considering various low-dimensional instances of this problem, we use Rankin's bounds on spherical codes to prove upper bounds on the minimum distance of a Stiefel code, and then we construct several examples of codes that achieve equality in these bounds.</description>

      <title>To Switch or Not to Switch? Balanced Policy Switching in Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) -- finding the optimal behaviour (also referred to as policy) maximizing the collected long-term cumulative reward -- is among the most influential approaches in machine learning with a large number of successful applications. In several decision problems, however, one faces the possibility of policy switching -- changing from the current policy to a new one -- which incurs a non-negligible cost (examples include the shifting of the currently applied educational technology, modernization of a computing cluster, and the introduction of a new webpage design), and in the decision one is limited to using historical data without the availability for further online interaction. Despite the inevitable importance of this offline learning scenario, to our best knowledge, very little effort has been made to tackle the key problem of balancing between the gain and the cost of switching in a flexible and principled way. Leveraging ideas from the area of optimal transport, we initialize the systematic study of policy switching in offline RL. We establish fundamental properties and design a Net Actor-Critic algorithm for the proposed novel switching formulation. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on multiple benchmarks of the Gymnasium.</description>

      <title>Message-Relevant Dimension Reduction of Neural Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying relevant interactions between neural populations is a prominent question in the analysis of high-dimensional neural recordings. However, existing dimension reduction methods often discuss communication in the absence of a formal framework, while frameworks proposed to address this gap are impractical in data analysis. This work bridges the formal framework of M-Information Flow with practical analysis of real neural data. To this end, we propose Iterative Regression, a message-dependent linear dimension reduction technique that iteratively finds an orthonormal basis such that each basis vector maximizes correlation between the projected data and the message. We then define 'M-forwarding' to formally capture the notion of a message being forwarded from one neural population to another. We apply our methodology to recordings we collected from two neural populations in a simplified model of whisker-based sensory detection in mice, and show that the low-dimensional M-forwarding structure we infer supports biological evidence of a similar structure between the two original, high-dimensional populations.</description>

      <title>DMH-HARQ: Reliable and Open Latency-Constrained Wireless Transport Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extreme requirements for high reliability and low latency in the upcoming Sixth Generation (6G) wireless networks are challenging the design of multi-hop wireless transport networks. Inspired by the advent of the virtualization concept in the wireless networks design and openness paradigm as fostered by the O-RAN Alliance, we target a revolutionary resource allocation scheme to improve the overall transmission efficiency.
  In this paper, we investigate the problem of multi-hop decode-and-forward (DF) relaying in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime, and propose a DMH-HARQ scheme, which maximizes the end-to-end (E2E) communication reliability in the wireless transport network. We also propose an integer dynamic programming (DP) algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal DMH-HARQ strategy. Constrained within a certain time frame to accomplish E2E transmission, our proposed approach is proven to outperform the conventional listening-based cooperative ARQ, as well as any static HARQ strategy, regarding the E2E reliability. It is applicable without dependence on special delay constraint, and is particularly competitive for long-distance transport network with many hops.</description>

      <title>Doeblin Coefficients and Related Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Doeblin coefficients are a classical tool for analyzing the ergodicity and exponential convergence rates of Markov chains. Propelled by recent works on contraction coefficients of strong data processing inequalities, we investigate whether Doeblin coefficients also exhibit some of the notable properties of canonical contraction coefficients. In this paper, we present several new structural and geometric properties of Doeblin coefficients. Specifically, we show that Doeblin coefficients form a multi-way divergence, exhibit tensorization, and possess an extremal trace characterization. We then show that they also have extremal coupling and simultaneously maximal coupling characterizations. By leveraging these characterizations, we demonstrate that Doeblin coefficients act as a nice generalization of the well-known total variation (TV) distance to a multi-way divergence, enabling us to measure the "distance" between multiple distributions rather than just two. We then prove that Doeblin coefficients exhibit contraction properties over Bayesian networks similar to other canonical contraction coefficients. We additionally derive some other results and discuss an application of Doeblin coefficients to distribution fusion. Finally, in a complementary vein, we introduce and discuss three new quantities: max-Doeblin coefficient, max-DeGroot distance, and min-DeGroot distance. The max-Doeblin coefficient shares a connection with the concept of maximal leakage in information security; we explore its properties and provide a coupling characterization. On the other hand, the max-DeGroot and min-DeGroot measures extend the concept of DeGroot distance to multiple distributions.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks with Blockage Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18621v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Communication-sensing integration represents an up-and-coming area of research, enabling wireless networks to simultaneously perform communication and sensing tasks. However, in urban cellular networks, the blockage of buildings results in a complex signal propagation environment, affecting the performance analysis of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. To overcome this obstacle, this paper constructs a comprehensive framework considering building blockage and employs a distance-correlated blockage model to analyze interference from line of sight (LoS), non-line of sight (NLoS), and target reflection cascading (TRC) links. Using stochastic geometric theory, expressions for signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and coverage probability for communication and sensing in the presence of blockage are derived, allowing for a comprehensive comparison under the same parameters. The research findings indicate that blockage can positively impact coverage, especially in enhancing communication performance. The analysis also suggests that there exists an optimal base station (BS) density when blockage is of the same order of magnitude as the BS density, maximizing communication or sensing coverage probability.</description>

      <title>A Field-Theoretic View of Unlabeled Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01175</link>

Abstract: Unlabeled sensing is the problem of solving a linear system of equations, where the right-hand-side vector is known only up to a permutation. In this work, we study fields of rational functions related to symmetric polynomials and their images under a linear projection of the variables; as a consequence, we establish that the solution to an n-dimensional unlabeled sensing problem with generic data can be obtained as the unique solution to a system of n + 1 polynomial equations of degrees 1, 2, . . . , n + 1 in n unknowns. Besides the new theoretical insights, this development offers the potential for scaling up algebraic unlabeled sensing algorithms.</description>

      <title>On the Counting of Involutory MDS Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal branch number of MDS matrices has established their importance in designing diffusion layers for various block ciphers and hash functions. As a result, numerous matrix structures, including Hadamard and circulant matrices, have been proposed for constructing MDS matrices. Also, in the literature, significant attention is typically given to identifying MDS candidates with optimal implementations or proposing new constructions across different orders. However, this paper takes a different approach by not emphasizing efficiency issues or introducing novel constructions. Instead, its primary objective is to enumerate Hadamard MDS and involutory Hadamard MDS matrices of order $4$ within the field $\mathbb{F}_{2^r}$. Specifically, it provides an explicit formula for the count of both Hadamard MDS and involutory Hadamard MDS matrices of order $4$ over $\mathbb{F}_{2^r}$. Additionally, the paper presents the counts of order $2$ MDS matrices and order $2$ involutory MDS matrices over $\mathbb{F}_{2^r}$. Finally, leveraging these counts of order $2$ matrices, an upper bound is derived for the number of all involutory MDS matrices of order $4$ over $\mathbb{F}_{2^r}$.</description>

      <title>Zero-error communication under discrete-time Markovian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider an open quantum system with (discrete-time) Markovian dynamics. Our task is to store information in the system in such a way that it can be retrieved perfectly, even after the system is left to evolve for an arbitrarily long time. We show that this is impossible for classical (resp. quantum) information precisely when the dynamics is mixing (resp. asymptotically entanglement breaking). Furthermore, we provide tight universal upper bounds on the minimum time after which any such dynamics `scrambles' the encoded information beyond the point of perfect retrieval. On the other hand, for dynamics that are not of this kind, we show that information must be encoded inside the peripheral space associated with the dynamics in order for it to be perfectly recoverable at any time in the future. This allows us to derive explicit formulas for the maximum amount of information that can be protected from noise in terms of the structure of the peripheral space of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerance of the [[8,1,4]] non-CSS code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the fault-tolerance of the not-so-well known [[8,1,4]] non-CSS code and study the logical error rates of the code.
  To do so, we adopt the procedure of the bare ancilla method presented by Brown et al.
  We choose the encoding procedure for stabilizer codes given by Gottesman and modify it to suit the setting of a class of non-CSS codes.
  We consider two types of noise models for this study, namely the depolarizing noise and anisotropic noise to depict the logical error rates obtained in decoding.</description>
