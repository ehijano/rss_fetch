      <title>Observational parameters of Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs) are a recently discovered class of short-period pulsating variable stars. In this work, we present new information on these stars based on photometric and spectroscopic data obtained for known and new objects detected by the OGLE survey. BLAPs are evolved objects with pulsation periods in the range of 3--75 min, stretching between subdwarf B-type stars and upper main-sequence stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. In general, BLAPs are single-mode stars pulsating in the fundamental radial mode. Their phase-folded light curves are typically sawtooth shaped, but light curves of shorter-period objects are more rounded and symmetric, while many longer-period objects exhibit an additional bump. The long-term OGLE observations show that the period change rates of BLAPs are usually of the order of 10^-7 per year and in a quarter of the sample are negative. An exception is the triple-mode object OGLE-BLAP-030, which changes its dominant period much faster, at a rate of about +4.6 x 10^-6 per year. The spectroscopic data indicate that the BLAPs form a homogeneous group in the period, surface gravity, and effective temperature spaces. However, we observe a split into two groups in terms of helium-to-hydrogen content. The atmospheres of the He-enriched BLAPs are more abundant in metals (about five times) than the atmosphere of the Sun. We discover that the BLAPs obey a period--gravity relationship and we use the distance to OGLE-BLAP-009 to derive a period--luminosity relation. Most of the stars observed in the OGLE Galactic bulge fields seem to reside in the bulge, while the remaining objects likely are in the foreground Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>Spinning solar jets explained through the interplay between plasma sheets and vortex columns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bunches of swaying and spinning plasma jets in the solar atmosphere - the spicules - exhibit a variety of complex dynamics that are clearly observed in the images of the solar limb. Utilizing three-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamics (rMHD) simulation data, we uncover another facet of a forest of spicules that turns out to be a manifestation of the two-dimensional plasma drapery, instead of one-dimensional conical spikes. This fluted morphology is observed in other contexts like molecular clouds, auroras, and coronal loops. Further, using a sequence of high-cadence line-of-sight integrated images, generated from our simulation, we obtain multiple episodes of spinning amongst clusters of synthetic spicules, also reported in observations near the solar limb. This perception of rotation, according to our findings, is associated with hot swirling plasma columns, extending to coronal heights - that we label as coronal swirling conduits (CoSCo).</description>

      <title>Resonance of low-frequency electromagnetic and ion-sound modes in the solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parker Solar Probe measurements have recently shown that coherent fast magnetosonic and Alfv\'{e}n ion-cyclotron waves are abundant in the solar wind and can be accompanied by higher-frequency electrostatic fluctuations. In this letter we reveal the nonlinear process capable of channelling the energy of low-frequency electromagnetic to higher-frequency electrostatic fluctuations observed aboard Parker Solar Probe. We present Hall-MHD simulations demonstrating that low-frequency electromagnetic fluctuations can resonate with the ion-sound mode, which results in steepening of plasma density fluctuations, electrostatic spikes and harmonics in the electric field spectrum. The resonance can occur around the wavenumber determined by the ratio between local sound and Alfv\'{e}n speeds, but only in the case of {\it oblique} propagation to the background magnetic field. The resonance wavenumber, its width and steepening time scale are estimated, and all indicate that the revealed two-wave resonance can frequently occur in the solar wind. This process can be a potential channel of energy transfer from cyclotron resonant ions producing the electromagnetic fluctuations to Landau resonant ions and electrons absorbing the energy of the higher-frequency electrostatic fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Unveiling very young O stars. Two Galactic O2V((f*))z in Westerlund 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: O-type stars are known to significantly contribute to both the dynamics and evolution of galaxies. Massive and luminous, they probably control and regulate the galaxies star formation rates. For this work I performed a redetermination of the spectral types and effective temperatures of the Galactic O-type stars MSP182, MSP183, MSP199, VPHAS-01338, and VPHAS-01273. From a careful examination of the spectral features present in the blue optical spectral region, it was possible to identify several nitrogen lines usually only seen in the blue optical spectra of O2-O3 stars. From the nitrogen ionic equivalent width ratios measured in the spectra of MSP182, MSP183, MSP199, VPHAS-01338, and VPHAS-01273, and in those of standard stars of the O2-O4 spectral types, earlier spectral types and hotter effective temperature values were derived. Two O2V, together with three new O3V stars, are now firmly identified in the Westerlund 2 region. Besides RFS1 in NGC3603, the O2 stars found in Westerlund 2 are the only other exemplars known to date in the Milky Way. From the nitrogen equivalent width line ratios measured in the spectra of standard stars of the O2-O4 spectral types, linear relations between the NIV4058-NIII4640 ratio and the effective temperature in the 47000K-51000K range were derived. Based on my spectroscopic analysis of the science targets and the use of a HRD, a mean heliocentric distance of 5kpc to Westerlund 2 was computed, a result that is in line with the mean heliocentric distance of 5.3(1.5) kpc obtained from the associated Gaia DR3 parallaxes and distances. The Westerlund 2 massive stars studied in this work probably share a common evolutionary process that might be representative of the evolutionary ages of a large fraction of the cluster's O-type stellar population, which seems to be much younger than 1 Myrs.</description>

      <title>Young Stellar Objects in NGC 346: A JWST NIRCam/MIRI Imaging Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a JWST imaging survey with NIRCam and MIRI of NGC 346, the brightest star-forming region in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). By combining aperture and point spread function (PSF) photometry of eleven wavelength bands across these two instruments, we have detected more than 200,000 unique sources. Using near-infrared (IR) color analysis, we observe various evolved and young populations, including 196 young stellar objects (YSOs) and pre-main sequence stars suitable for forthcoming spectroscopic studies. We expand upon this work, creating mid-IR color-magnitude diagrams and determining color cuts to identify 833 reddened sources which are YSO candidates. We observe that these candidate sources are spatially associated with regions of dusty, filamentary nebulosity. Furthermore, we fit model YSO spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to a selection of sources with detections across all of our MIRI bands. We classify with a high degree of confidence 23 YSOs in this sample and estimate their radii, bolometric temperatures, luminosities, and masses. We detect YSOs approaching 1 solar mass, the lowest-mass extragalactic YSOs confirmed to date.</description>

      <title>Rapidly-rotating Population III stellar models as a source of primary nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first stars might have been fast rotators. This would have important consequences for their radiative, mechanical and chemical feedback. We discuss the impact of fast initial rotation on the evolution of massive Population III models and on their nitrogen and oxygen stellar yields. We explore the evolution of Population III stars with initial masses in the range of 9Msol &lt; Mini &lt; 120Msol starting with an initial rotation on the Zero Age Main Sequence equal to 70% of the critical one. We find that with the physics of rotation considered here, our rapidly-rotating Population III stellar models do not follow a homogeneous evolution. They lose very little mass in case mechanical winds are switched on when the surface rotation becomes equal or larger than the critical velocity. Impact on the ionising flux appears modest when compared to moderately-rotating models. Fast rotation favours, in models with initial masses above ~20Msol, the appearance of a very extended intermediate convective zone around the H-burning shell during the core He-burning phase. This shell has important consequences on the sizes of the He- and CO-cores and thus impacts the final fate of stars. Moreover, it has a strong impact on nucleosynthesis boosting the production of primary 14N. Fast initial rotation impacts significantly the chemical feedback of Population III stars. Observations of extremely metal-poor stars and/or starbursting regions are essential to provide constraints on the properties of the first stars.</description>

      <title>Long-term stellar activity of M dwarfs: A combined K2 and TESS study of two early M-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of the rotation and activity of M type stars are essential to enhance our understanding of stellar dynamos and angular momentum evolution. Using the outstanding photometric capabilities of space telescopes rotation signals even with low amplitudes can be investigated in up to now unrivaled detail. By combining data of K2 and the TESS prime mission the star spot activity of M dwarfs can be monitored on half a decade timescale. In the framework of our study on the rotation-activity relation for bright and nearby M dwarfs we also aim at an investigation of the long-term activity. While K2 was observing fields distributed around the ecliptic plane, the TESS prime mission was oriented along a line of ecliptic longitude with one camera centered on an ecliptic pole. Due to these different observing strategies, the overlap between K2 and the TESS prime mission is marginal. However, 45 stars from our sample were observed with both missions of which two early M-type stars that fulfill our selection criteria, EPIC 202059229 and EPIC 245919787, were analyzed in more detail. We found that for both stars the rotation period did not change while the rotational phase did change for EPIC 245919787 by ~0.2. The amplitude of the spot induced variability changed for both stars but more significant for EPIC 245919787. By comparing the cumulative flare frequency distributions we found that the flare activity for EPIC 202059229 is unchanged while it slightly changes for EPIC 245919787 between the K2 and TESS epochs. Using a combination of light curves from K2 and TESS that span a baseline up to 4.5 years we could measure significant differential rotation for EPIC 245919787. Furthermore, we show that combining missions like K2 and TESS is a promising method for detecting stellar activity cycles.</description>

      <title>Time-domain analysis of multi-waveband flares from AD Leonis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio bursts of magnetically active stars reveal the intensity and activity of the stellar magnetic field. They may also be related to the planets around the stars. We monitored a radio-active star, AD Leonis, 3000 seconds per day for 17 days in November 2020, and 5000 seconds per day for 5 days in July 2023 with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Based on the simultaneous flux increases in Stokes I and Stokes V, one left-hand circular polarized radio burst is identified. The $\sim50\%$ degree of circular polarization indicates the burst being originated from non-thermal radiation related to the stellar magnetic field. Combining the newly discovered burst with previous observations of radio and X-ray bursts from AD Leonis, we did a periodicity analysis for the 49 bursts in total. No periodicity with confidence level $&gt;3\sigma$ is found, while a candidate period of 3.04 days at $\approx 2\sigma$ confidence level is presented and discussed. Results of recent FAST observations and the periodicity analysis suggest a more compact campaign of observation toward this source, from which a more optimistic result of period search could be achieved.</description>

      <title>The First Estimation of the Ambipolar Diffusivity Coefficient from Multi-Scale Observations of the Class 0/I Protostar, HOPS-370</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protostars are born in magnetized environments. As a consequence, the formation of protostellar disks can be suppressed by the magnetic field efficiently removing angular momentum of the infalling material. Non-ideal MHD effects are proposed to as one way to allow protostellar disks to form. Thus, it is important to understand their contributions in observations of protostellar systems. We derive an analytical equation to estimate the ambipolar diffusivity coefficient at the edge of the protostellar disk in the Class 0/I protostar, HOPS-370, for the first time, under the assumption that the disk radius is set by ambipolar diffusion. Using previous results of the protostellar mass, disk mass, disk radius, density and temperature profiles and magnetic field strength, we estimate the ambipolar diffusivity coefficient to be $1.7^{+1.5}_{-1.4}\times10^{19}\,\mathrm{cm^{2}\,s^{-1}}$. We quantify the contribution of ambipolar diffusion by estimating its dimensionless Els\"{a}sser number to be $\sim1.7^{+1.0}_{-1.0}$, indicating its dynamical importance in this region. We compare to chemical calculations of the ambipolar diffusivity coefficient using the Non-Ideal magnetohydrodynamics Coefficients and Ionisation Library (NICIL), which is consistent with our results. In addition, we compare our derived ambipolar diffusivity coefficient to the diffusivity coefficients for Ohmic dissipation and the Hall effect, and find ambipolar diffusion is dominant in our density regime. These results demonstrate a new methodology to understand non-ideal MHD effects in observations of protostellar disks. More detailed modeling of the magnetic field, envelope and microphysics, along with a larger sample of protostellar systems is needed to further understand the contributions of non-ideal MHD.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Solar Center-to-Limb Radial-Velocity Variability with SDO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar photospheric inhomogeneities are a significant source of noise which currently precludes the discovery of Earth-mass planets orbiting Sun-like stars with the radial-velocity (RV) method. To complement several previous studies which have used ground- and spaced-based facilities to characterize the RV of the Sun, we here characterize the center-to-limb variability (CLV) of solar RVs arising from various solar-surface inhomogeneities observed by SDO/HMI and SDO/AIA. By using various SDO observables to classify pixels and calculate line-of-sight velocities as a function of pixel classification and limb angle, we show that each identified feature type, including the umbrae and penumbrae of sunspots, quiet-Sun magnetoconvective cells, magnetic network, and plage, exhibit distinct and complex CLV signatures, including a notable limb-angle dependence in the observed suppression of convective blueshift for magnetically active regions. We discuss the observed distributions of velocities by identified region type and limb angle, offer interpretations of the physical phenomena that shape these distributions, and emphasize the need to understand the RV signatures of these regions as astrophysical signals, rather than simple (un)correlated noise processes.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Retrievals of the Phase-resolved Spectra of Irradiated Brown Dwarfs WD-0137B and EPIC-2122B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an atmospheric retrieval analysis of HST/WFC3/G141 spectroscopic phase curve observations of two brown dwarfs, WD-0137B and EPIC-2122B, in ultra-short period orbits around white dwarf hosts. These systems are analogous to hot and ultra-hot Jupiter systems, enabling a unique and high-precision comparison to exoplanet systems. We use the PETRA retrieval suite to test various analysis setups, including joint-phase retrievals, multiple temperature structures, and non-uniform abundances. We find that WD-0137B has a dayside that closely resembles that of other ultra-hot Jupiters with inverted temperature structures and H$^-$ opacity, but quickly transitions to a mostly non-inverted temperature structure on the nightside. Meanwhile, EPIC-2122B's atmosphere remains inverted at all constrained longitudes, with dominant H$^-$ opacity. Retrievals with multiple temperature profiles and non-uniform vertical abundances were generally not statistically justified for this dataset, but retrievals with dayside-dilution factors were found to be justified. Retrieving all phases simultaneously with a linear combination of a dayside and nightside atmosphere was found to be an adequate representation of the entire phase-curve once a longitudinal temperature gradient free parameter was included in the retrieval. Comparing to global circulation models, we attribute behavior in the 1D retrievals to the inclined viewing geometry of the systems, which results in always-visible irradiated and inverted portions of the atmosphere "contaminating" spectra measured from the nightside hemisphere. This study sheds light on the similarities between these irradiated brown dwarf systems and hot and ultra-hot Jupiters, but also their unique differences, including the influence of the inclined viewing geometry.</description>

      <title>The impact of different magnetic braking prescriptions on the evolution of LMXBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the evolution of low-mass close binary systems under different magnetic braking (MB) prescriptions. We study binaries with a neutron star accretor. During mass transfer episodes, these systems emit X-rays and are known as Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs). When mass transfer stops, they can be observed as binary pulsars. Additionally, some of these systems can experience mass transfer while having orbital periods of less than 1 hr, thus evolving into ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs). The evolution of LMXBs depends on their capability to lose angular momentum and maintain stable mass transfer. Among the angular momentum loss mechanisms, MB is one important, and still uncertain phenomenon. The standard MB prescription faces some problems when calculating LMXB evolution, leading to, e.g., a fine-tuning problem in the formation of UCXBs. Recent studies proposed new MB prescriptions, yielding diverse outcomes. Here, we investigate the effects of three novel MB prescriptions on the evolution of LMXBs using our stellar code. We found that all MB prescriptions considered allow the formation of binaries with orbital periods spanning from less than one hour to more than tens of days. Remarkably, our results enable the occurrence of wide systems even for the MB law that causes the strongest angular momentum losses and very high mass transfer rates. We found that models computed with the strongest MB prescription reach the UCXB state starting from a wider initial orbital period interval. Finally, we discuss and compare our results with observations and previous studies performed on this topic.</description>

      <title>Heavy Dark Matter in White Dwarfs: Multiple-Scattering Capture and Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an improved treatment for the scattering of heavy dark matter from the ion constituents of a white dwarf. In the heavy dark matter regime, multiple collisions are required for the dark matter to become gravitationally captured. Our treatment incorporates all relevant physical effects including the dark matter trajectories, nuclear form factors, and radial profiles for the white dwarf escape velocity and target number densities. Our capture rates differ by orders of magnitude from previous estimates, which have typically used approximations developed for dark matter scattering in the Earth. We also compute the time for the dark matter to thermalize in the center of the white dwarf, including in-medium effects such as phonon emission and absorption from the ionic lattice in the case where the star has a crystallized core. We find much shorter thermalization timescales than previously estimated, especially if the white dwarf core has crystallized. We illustrate the importance of our improved approach by determining the cross section required for accumulated asymmetric dark matter to self-gravitate.</description>

      <title>TESS Free-floating Planet Candidate Is Likely a Stellar Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of a terrestrial-mass free-floating planet candidate in the light curve of the star TIC 107150013 observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has recently been announced. A short-duration (~0.5 day), low-amplitude (~0.06 mag) brightening in the TESS light curve was interpreted as a short-timescale gravitational microlensing event. However, the purported event occurred far from the Galactic center and the Galactic plane (l~ 239 deg, b ~ -5 deg), on a relatively nearby (~3.2 kpc) star, making the microlensing interpretation unlikely. Here, we report the archival photometric observations of TIC 107150013 collected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2018 through 2020. The archival OGLE light curve reveals periodic variability indicative of starspots on the surface of the star. The presence of starspots indicates magnetic activity of the star, which may also manifest as stellar flares. We interpret the brightening of TIC 107150013 seen in the TESS data as the stellar flare. We present similar flaring stars detected in the archival OGLE data, mimicking short-timescale, low-amplitude microlensing events. Such stars may be a source of non-negligible false positive detections in the planned space-based microlensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Host star properties of hot, warm and cold Jupiters in the solar neighborhood from \textit{Gaia} DR3: clues to formation pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Giant planets exhibit diverse orbital properties, hinting at their distinct formation and dynamic histories. In this paper, using $\textit{Gaia}$ DR3, we investigate if and how the orbital properties of Jupiters are linked to their host star properties, particularly their metallicity and age. We obtain metallicities for main sequence stars of spectral type F, G, and K, hosting hot, warm, and cold Jupiters with varying eccentricities. We compute the velocity dispersion of host stars of these three groups using kinematic information from $\textit{Gaia}$ DR3 and obtain average ages using velocity dispersion-age relation. We find that host stars of hot Jupiters are relatively metal-rich ([Fe/H]=$0.18 \pm 0.13$) and young ( median age $3.97 \pm 0.51$ Gyr) compared to the host stars of cold Jupiters in nearly circular orbits, which are relatively metal-poor ($0.03 \pm 0.18$) and older (median age $6.07 \pm 0.79$ Gyr). Host stars of cold Jupiters in high eccentric orbits, on the other hand, show metallicities similar to that of the hosts of hot Jupiters, but are older, on average (median age $6.25 \pm 0.92$ Gyr). The similarity in metallicity between hosts of hot Jupiters and hosts of cold Jupiters in high eccentric orbits supports high eccentricity migration as the potential origin of hot Jupiters, with the latter serving as the progenitors. However, the average age difference between them suggests that the older hot Jupiters may have been engulfed by the star in a timescale of $\sim 6$ Gyr. This allows us to estimate the value of stellar tidal quality factor $Q'_\ast\sim10^{6\pm1}$.</description>

      <title>J-PLUS: Bayesian object classification with a strum of BANNJOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With its 12 optical filters, the Javalambre-Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) provides an unprecedented multicolor view of the local Universe. The third data release (DR3) covers 3,192 deg$^2$ and contains 47.4 million objects. However, the classification algorithms currently implemented in its pipeline are deterministic and based solely on the sources morphology. Our goal is classify the sources identified in the J-PLUS DR3 images into stars, quasi-stellar objects (QSOs), and galaxies. For this task, we present BANNJOS, a machine learning pipeline that uses Bayesian neural networks to provide the probability distribution function (PDF) of the classification. BANNJOS is trained on photometric, astrometric, and morphological data from J-PLUS DR3, Gaia DR3, and CatWISE2020, using over 1.2 million objects with spectroscopic classification from SDSS DR18, LAMOST DR9, DESI EDR, and Gaia DR3. Results are validated using $1.4 10^5$ objects and cross-checked against theoretical model predictions. BANNJOS outperforms all previous classifiers in terms of accuracy, precision, and completeness across the entire magnitude range. It delivers over 95% accuracy for objects brighter than $r = 21.5$ mag, and ~90% accuracy for those up to $r = 22$ mag, where J-PLUS completeness is &lt; 25%. BANNJOS is also the first object classifier to provide the full probability distribution function (PDF) of the classification, enabling precise object selection for high purity or completeness, and for identifying objects with complex features, like active galactic nuclei with resolved host galaxies. BANNJOS has effectively classified J-PLUS sources into around 20 million galaxies, 1 million QSOs, and 26 million stars, with full PDFs for each, which allow for later refinement of the sample. The upcoming J-PAS survey, with its 56 color bands, will further enhance BANNJOS's ability to detail each source's nature.</description>

      <title>STELLA lightcurves of energetic pair instability supernovae in the context of SN2018ibb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SN2018ibb is a recently observed hydrogen poor super-luminous supernova which appears to be powered by the decay of $30\;\rm{M_\odot}$ of radioactive nickel. This supernova has been suggested to show hybrid signatures of a pair instability supernova and an interacting supernova. In a previous paper, we found that rotating, metal enriched pair instability supernova progenitors appeared to check both of these boxes. In this paper, we model the lightcurves of the pair instability supernovae using STELLA. We find that the STELLA models can explain the overall shape of the bolometric lightcurve of SN2018ibb, though not specific morphological features such as the luminosity peak or the bump at roughly three hundred days after the peak. We also estimate the contribution from interaction, and find that with relatively low wind velocities, the circum-stellar medium originating from the stellar winds is consistent with the evidence for interaction in the spectra. The observed values of the photosphere velocity in the hundred days after peak luminosity are similar to the STELLA models, but the deceleration is lower. This leads to the biggest inconsistency which is the black body temperature of SN2018ibb being much hotter than any of the STELLA models. We note that this high temperature (and the flat velocity) may be difficult to reconcile with the long rise time of SN2018ibb, but nevertheless conclude that if it is accurate, this discrepancy represents a challenge for SN2018ibb being a robust PISN candidate. This result is noteworthy given the lack of other scenarios for this supernova.</description>

      <title>A candidate period of 4.605 day for FRB 20121102A and one possible implication of its origin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A firm establishment of the presence or the lack of periodicity in repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is crucial for determining their origins. Here we compile 1145 radio bursts of FRB 20121102A with fluence larger than 0.15 Jy ms from observations using the Five-hundredmeter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, Arecibo Observatory, Green Bank Telescope, Effelsberg Telescope, MeerKAT Telescope, Lovell Telescope, Deep Space Network 70 m radio telescopes, Very Large Array, and the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope spanning the time interval of MJD 57175-58776. A quasi-period of $157.1_{-4.8}^{+5.2}$ day and a candidate quasi-period of $4.605_{-0.010}^{+0.003}$ day are found through the phase-folding probability binomial analysis. The former is consistent with previous findings and the latter is new. The 4.605 day periodicity is more obvious in high-energy bursts with fluence larger than $10^{38}$ erg. The presence of these (candidate) quasi-periods, together with the corresponding width of burst accumulation in the phase space, are consistent with the bursts' originating from a binary degenerate star system with a close-by planet around the primary neutron star.</description>

      <title>An exact analytical solution for the weakly magnetized flow around an axially symmetric paraboloid, with application to magnetosphere models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.07419v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotationally symmetric bodies with longitudinal cross sections of parabolic shape are frequently used to model astrophysical objects, such as magnetospheres and other blunt objects, immersed in interplanetary or interstellar gas or plasma flows. We discuss a simple formula for the potential flow of an incompressible fluid around an elliptic paraboloid whose axis of symmetry coincides with the direction of incoming flow. Prescribing this flow, we derive an exact analytical solution to the induction equation of ideal magnetohydrodynamics for the case of an initially homogeneous magnetic field of arbitrary orientation being passively advected in this flow. Our solution procedure employs Euler potentials and Cauchy's integral formalism based on the flow's stream function and isochrones. Furthermore, we use a particular renormalization procedure that allows us to generate more general analytical expressions modeling the deformations experienced by arbitrary scalar or vector-valued fields embedded in the flow as they are advected first towards and then past the parabolic obstacle. Finally, both the velocity field and the magnetic field embedded therein are generalized from incompressible to mildly compressible flow, where the associated density distribution is found from Bernoulli's principle.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of 3D Convective Urca Simulations to Changes in Urca Reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A proposed setting for thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae is a white dwarf that has gained mass from a companion to the point of carbon ignition in the core. There is a simmering phase in the early stages of burning that involves the formation and growth of a core convection zone. One aspect of this phase is the convective Urca process, a linking of weak nuclear reactions to convection that may alter the composition and structure of the white dwarf. Convective Urca is not well understood and requires 3D fluid simulations to realistically model. Additionally, the convection is relatively slow (Mach number less than 0.005) so a low-Mach method is needed to make simulating computationally feasible. Using the MAESTROeX low-Mach hydrodynamics code, we investigate recent changes to how the weak reactions are modeled in the convective Urca simulations. We present results that quantify the changes to the reaction rates and their impact on the evolution of the simulation.</description>

      <title>VELOcities of CEpheids (VELOCE) I. High-precision radial velocities of Cepheids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This first VELOCE data release comprises 18,225 high-precision RV measurements of 258 bona fide classical Cepheids on both hemispheres collected mainly between 2010 and 2022, alongside 1161 additional observations of 164 other stars. The median per-observation RV uncertainty is 0.037 km/s, and some reach 0.002 km/s. Non-variable standard stars characterize RV zero-point stability and provide a base for future cross-calibrations. We determined zero-point differences between VELOCE and 31 literature data sets using template fitting and measured linear period changes of 146 Cepheids. Seventy six spectroscopic binary Cepheids and 14 candidates are identified using VELOCE data alone and are investigated in detail in a companion paper (VELOCE II). Several new insights into Cepheid pulsations were obtained, including: a) the most detailed description of the Hertzsprung progression by RVs; b) the identification of double-peaked bumps in the RV curve; c) clear evidence that virtually all Cepheids feature spectroscopic variability signals that lead to modulated RV variability. We identified 36 such stars, of which 4 also exhibit orbital motion. Linear radius variations depend strongly on pulsation period and a steep increase in slope of the $\Delta$R/p versus logP-relation is found near 10d, challenging the existence of a tight relation between Baade-Wesselink projection factors and pulsation periods. We investigated the accuracy of RV time series measurements, v$_\gamma$, and RV amplitudes published in Gaia's DR3 and determined an average offset of 0.65 \pm 0.11 km/s relative to VELOCE. We recommend adopting a single set of template correlation parameters for distinct classes of large-amplitude variable stars to avoid systematic offsets in v$_\gamma$ among stars belonging to the same class. Peak-to-peak amplitudes of Gaia RVs exhibit significant (16%) dispersion compared to VELOCE. [abridged]</description>

      <title>Is the compact object associated with HESS J1731-347 a strange quark star?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07485v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analysis of the central compact object within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347 suggests that it has a small radius and, even more interestingly, a mass of the order or smaller than one solar mass. This raises the question of which astrophysical process could lead to such a small mass, since the analysis of various types of SN explosions indicate that is it not possible to produce a neutron star with a mass smaller than about $1.17 M_\odot$. Here we show that masses of the order or smaller than one solar mass can be obtained in the case of strange quark stars and that it is possible to build a coherent model explaining not only the mass and the radius of that object, but also its slow cooling suggested in various analyses. We also show that an astrophysical path exists which leads to the formation of such an object, and we discuss the role played in that scenario by strangelets assumed to constitute the dark matter.</description>

      <title>Fingering convection in a spherical shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use 123 three dimensional direct numerical simulations to study fingering convection in non-rotating spherical shells. We investigate the scaling behaviour of the flow lengthscale, the non-dimensional heat and compositional fluxes $Nu$ and $Sh$ and the mean convective velocity over the fingering convection instability domain defined by $1 \leq R_\rho &lt; Le$, $R_\rho$ being the ratio of density perturbations of thermal and compositional origins and $Le$ the Lewis number. We show that the chemical boundary layers are marginally unstable and adhere to the laminar Prandtl-Blasius model, hence explaining the asymmetry between the inner and outer spherical shell boundary layers. We develop scaling laws for two asymptotic regimes close to the two edges of the instability domain, namely $R_\rho \lesssim Le$ and $R_\rho \gtrsim 1$. For the former, we develop novel power laws of a small parameter $\epsilon$ measuring the distance to onset, which differ from theoretical laws published to date in Cartesian geometry. For the latter, we find that the Sherwood number $Sh$ gradually approaches a scaling $Sh\sim Ra_\xi^{1/3}$ when $Ra_\xi \gg 1$; and that the P\'eclet number accordingly follows $Pe \sim Ra_\xi^{2/3} |Ra_T|^{-1/4}$, $Ra_\xi$ being the chemical Rayleigh number. When the Reynolds number exceeds a few tens, we report on a secondary instability which takes the form of large-scale toroidal jets which span the entire spherical domain. Jets distort the fingers resulting in Reynolds stress correlations, which in turn feed the jet growth until saturation. This nonlinear phenomenon can yield relaxation oscillation cycles.</description>

      <title>Time-varying double-peaked emission lines following the sudden ignition of the dormant galactic nucleus AT2017bcc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a pan-chromatic study of AT2017bcc, a nuclear transient that was discovered in 2017 within the skymap of a reported burst-like gravitational wave candidate, G274296. It was initially classified as a superluminous supernova, and then reclassified as a candidate tidal disruption event. Its optical light curve has since shown ongoing variability with a structure function consistent with that of an active galactic nucleus, however earlier data shows no variability for at least 10 years prior to the outburst in 2017. The spectrum shows complex profiles in the broad Balmer lines: a central component with a broad blue wing, and a boxy component with time-variable blue and red shoulders. The H$\alpha$ emission profile is well modelled using a circular accretion disc component, and a blue-shifted double Gaussian which may indicate a partially obscured outflow. Weak narrow lines, together with the previously flat light curve, suggest that this object represents a dormant galactic nucleus which has recently been re-activated. Our time-series modelling of the Balmer lines suggests that this is connected to a disturbance in the disc morphology, and we speculate this could involve a sudden violent event such as a tidal disruption event involving the central supermassive black hole, though this cannot be confirmed, and given an estimated black hole mass of $\gtrsim10^7-10^8$ M$_\odot$ instabilities in an existing disc may be more likely. Although we find that the redshifts of AT2017bcc ($z=0.13$) and G274296 ($z&gt;0.42$) are inconsistent, this event adds to the growing diversity of both nuclear transients and multi-messenger contaminants.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of Density Fluctuations in the Solar Wind at 1 au</title>

Abstract: A well-known property of solar wind plasma turbulence is the observed anisotropy of the autocorrelations, or equivalently the spectra, of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations. Here we explore the related but apparently not well-studied issue of the anisotropy of plasma density fluctuations in the energy-containing and inertial ranges of solar wind turbulence. Using 10 years (1998-2008) of in situ data from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) mission, we find that for all but the fastest wind category, the density correlation scale is slightly larger in directions quasi-parallel to the large-scale mean magnetic field as compared to quasi-perpendicular directions. The correlation scale in fast wind is consistent with isotropic. The anisotropy as a function of the level of correlation is also explored. We find at small correlation levels, i.e., at energy-containing scales and larger, the density fluctuations are close to isotropy for fast wind, and slightly favor more rapid decorrelation in perpendicular directions for slow and medium winds. At relatively smaller (inertial range) scales where the correlation values are larger, the sense of anisotropy is reversed in all speed ranges, implying a more "slab-like" structure, especially prominent in the fast wind samples. We contrast this finding with published results on velocity and magnetic field correlations.</description>

      <title>NGC1856: Using machine learning techniques to uncover detailed stellar abundances from MUSE data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first application of the novel approach based on data-driven machine learning methods applied to Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) field data to derive stellar abundances of star clusters. MUSE has been used to target more than 10,000 fields, and it is unique in its ability to study dense stellar fields such as stellar clusters providing spectra for each individual star. We use MUSE data of the extragalactic young stellar cluster NGC 1856, located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We present the individual stellar [Fe/H] abundance of 327 cluster members in addition to [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [C/Fe], [Ni/Fe], and [Cr/Fe] abundances of subsample sets. Our results match the LMC abundances obtained in the literature for [Mg/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [Ni/Fe], and [Cr/Fe]. This study is the first to derive [Si/Fe] and [C/Fe] abundances for this cluster. The revolutionary combination of integral-field spectroscopy and data-driven modeling will allow us to understand the chemical enrichment of star clusters and their host galaxies in greater detail expanding our understanding of galaxy evolution.</description>
