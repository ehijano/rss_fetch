      <title>On the Entire Structure of the Energy Bands of 1D Moir\'{e} Superchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a general model of two atomic chains forming a moir\'{e} pattern due to a small mismatch in their lattice spacings, given by $\theta = (a_{1} - a_{2})/a_{2}$. Assuming arbitrary single-band dispersion relations $\varepsilon_{1}(p)$ and $\varepsilon_{2}(q)$ for the chains, along with an arbitrary inter-chain coupling term $T(x)$, we show that the entire spectrum of such a one-dimensional moir\'{e} superchain is governed by a single three-term recurrence (TTR) relation. We analyze this TTR relation using the discrete WKB method and demonstrate how the entire structure of the spectrum as well as emergence of flat bands can be easily identified from a pair of upper and lower potential functions of the TTR relation. We also comment on the chiral limit of the moir\'{e} superchain, which can be viewed, in some sense, as a 1D analog of the chiral limit of Twisted Bilayer Graphene.</description>

      <title>Many-body perturbation theory for moir\'{e} systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'{e} systems such as magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene have attracted significant attention due to their ability to host correlated phenomena including superconductivity and strongly correlated insulating states. By defining the single-particle Green's function in the band basis, we systematically develop a many-body perturbation theory framework to address correlations beyond the usual mean-field Hartree-Fock approaches. As a specific example, we first analyze twisted bilayer graphene within the Hartree-Fock approximation. We derive analytical solutions for symmetry-breaking states at integer fillings and the finite-temperature metal-insulator transition that closely match previously known numerical results in the literature. Moving beyond Hartree-Fock, we incorporate self-consistent GW corrections demonstrating that first-order diagrams significantly overestimate the filling-dependent fluctuations in the electronic compressibility. This framework provides a comprehensive pathway for exploring strong electronic correlations in moir\'{e} systems beyond mean-field, giving new insights into the interplay of symmetry breaking and electron correlations.</description>

      <title>Detection of chiral spin fluctuations driven by frustration in Mott insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically ordered states, such as chiral spin liquids, have been proposed as candidates that host fractionalized excitations. However, detecting chiral character or proximity to these non-trivial states remains a challenge. Resonant Raman scattering can be a powerful tool for detecting chiral fluctuations, as the $A_{2g}$ channel probes excitations with broken time-reversal symmetry and local chiral order. Here, we use exact diagonalization to characterize the resonant $A_{2g}$ channel, alongside two-magnon scattering in $B_{1g}$ and $E_g$ channels, for the Hubbard model on lattices with increasing levels of geometric spin frustration, where tuning the incident energy near the Mott gap reveals strong chiral spin excitation intensity. Increased spin frustration in the Mott insulator results in an overall softening of the Raman $A_{2g}$ response, indicating a tendency toward low energy chiral-chiral fluctuations in Mott insulators with magnetic frustration and proximity to chiral spin liquid states that can potentially be tuned by external perturbations.</description>

      <title>Non-linear integral equations for the XXX spin-1/2 quantum chain with non-diagonal boundary fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The XXX spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain with non-diagonal boundary
  fields represents a cornerstone model in the study of integrable systems
  with open boundaries. Despite its significance, solving this model exactly
  has remained a formidable challenge due to the breaking of $U(1)$
  symmetry. Building on the off-diagonal Bethe Ansatz (ODBA), we derive a set
  of nonlinear integral equations (NLIEs) that encapsulate the exact spectrum
  of the model.
  For $U(1)$ symmetric spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chains such NLIEs involve two
  functions $a(x)$ and $\bar{a}(x)$ coupled by an integration kernel with
  short-ranged elements. The solution functions show characteristic features
  for arguments at some length scale which grows logarithmically with system
  size $N$.
  For the non $U(1)$ symmetric case, the equations involve a novel third
  function $c(x)$, which captures the inhomogeneous contributions of the
  $T$-$Q$ relation. The kernel elements coupling this function to the
  standard ones are long-ranged and lead for the ground-state to a winding
  phenomenon. In $\log(1+a(x))$ and $\log(1+\bar a(x))$ we observe a
  sudden change by $2\pi$i at a characteristic scale $x_1$ of the
  argument. Other features appear at a value $x_0$ which is of order $\log N$.
  These two length scales, $x_1$ and $x_0$, are independent: their ratio
  $x_1/x_0$ is large for small $N$ and small for large $N$. Explicit
  solutions to the NLIEs are obtained numerically for these limiting cases,
  though intermediate cases ($x_1/x_0 \sim 1$) present computational
  challenges.
  This work lays the foundation for studying finite-size corrections and
  conformal properties of other integrable spin chains with non-diagonal
  boundaries, opening new avenues for exploring boundary effects in quantum
  integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Hund flat band in a frustrated spinel oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic flat bands associated with quenched kinetic energy and heavy electron mass have attracted great interest for promoting strong electronic correlations and emergent phenomena such as high-temperature charge fractionalization and superconductivity. Intense experimental and theoretical research has been devoted to establishing the rich non-trivial metallic and heavy fermion phases intertwined with such localized electronic states. Here, we investigate the transition metal oxide spinel LiV2O4, an enigmatic heavy fermion compound lacking localized f orbital states. We use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and dynamical mean field theory to reveal a new kind of correlation-induced flat band with suppressed inter-atomic electron hopping arising from intra-atomic Hund coupling. The appearance of heavy quasiparticles is ascribed to a proximate orbital-selective Mott state characterized by fluctuating local moments as evidenced by complementary magnetotransport measurements. The spectroscopic fingerprints of long-lived quasiparticles and their disappearance with increasing temperature further support the emergence of a high-temperature bad metal state observed in transport data. This work resolves a long-standing puzzle on the origin of heavy fermion behavior and unconventional transport in LiV2O4. Simultaneously, it opens a new path to achieving flat bands through electronic interactions in d-orbital systems with geometrical frustration, potentially enabling the realization of exotic phases of matter such as the fractionalized Fermi liquids.</description>

      <title>Finite-Temperature Kinetic Ferromagnetism in the Square Lattice Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the exact phase diagram of the Fermi-Hubbard model remains poorly understood despite decades of progress, nearly 60 years ago, Nagaoka proved that a single dopant in an otherwise half-filled Hubbard system can bring about ferromagnetism through kinetic means. The phenomenon was recently observed with ultracold atoms in triangular optical lattices. Here, we explore the kinetic ferromagnetism within the square lattice Hubbard model and its strong-coupling counterpart, the $t-J$ model, at finite temperatures in the thermodynamic limit via numerical linked-cluster expansions. We find evidence of ferromagnetic Nagaoka polarons at dopings up to $\sim 30\%$ away from half filling for a variety of interaction strengths and at temperatures as low as $0.2$ of the hopping energy. We map out the boundaries of this phase through analyzing various correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary dynamical mean-field approach for Anderson-Hubbard model with off-diagonal disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports a theoretical framework that combines the auxiliary coherent potential approximation (ACPA-DMFT) with dynamical mean-field theory to study strongly correlated and disordered electronic systems with both diagonal and off-diagonal disorders. In this method, by introducing an auxiliary coupling space with extended local degree of freedom,the diagonal and off-diagonal disorders are treated in a unified and self-consistent framework of coherent potential approximation, within which the dynamical mean-field theory is naturally combined to handle the strongly correlated Anderson-Hubbard model. By using this approach, we compute matsubara Green's functions for a simple cubic lattice at finite temperatures and derive impurity spectral functions through the maximum entropy method. Our results reveal the critical influence of off-diagonal disorder on Mott-type metal-insulator transitions. Specifically, a reentrant phenomenon is identified, where the system transitions between insulating and metallic states under varying interaction strengths. The ACPA-DMFT method provides an efficient and robust computational method for exploring the intricate interplay of disorder and strong correlations.</description>

      <title>Two Channel Multi impurity Kondo model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasua-Yoisida interaction in two channel Kondo impurity systems is a relevant perturbation when the number of impurities N is greater than 3. We find a new critical point with anomalous dimensions 1/(N+1) for the spin operator and the Sommerfeld coefficient of the specific heat scales as $\gamma \sim T^{- \frac{3}{N+1}} Inter-channel hybridization plays the role of the most relevant operator at this fixed point having anomalous dimensions (N-1)/(2N+2)$. The critical point universal properties are relevant to many strong correlation problems, such as impurity placed in a Majorana metal and the multichannel Kondo lattice model of heavy fermion materials. We discuss relevance of our results for cluster DMFT studies of quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Classification of Gapped Domain Walls of Topological Orders in 2+1 dimensions: A Levin-Wen Model Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel systematic construction of gapped domain walls (GDWs) within the Levin-Wen (LW) model, advancing our understanding of topological phases. By gluing two LW models along their open sides in a compatible way, we achieve a complete GDW classification by subsets of bulk input data, encompassing $e$-$m$ exchanging GDWs. A generalized bimodule structure is introduced to capture domain-wall excitations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that folding along any GDW yields a gapped boundary (GB) described by a Frobenius algebra of the input UFC for the folded model, thus bridging GDW and GB classifications within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Global Structure in the Presence of a Topological Defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the global structure of topological defects which wrap a submanifold $F\subset M$ in a quantum field theory defined on a closed manifold $M$. The Pontryagin-Thom construction oversees the interplay between the global structure of $F$ and the global structure of $M$. We will employ this construction to two distinct mathematical frameworks with physical applications. The first framework is the concept of a characteristic structure, consisting of the data of pairs of manifolds $(M,F)$ where $F$ is Poincar\'e dual to some characteristic class. This concept is discussed in the mathematics literature, and shown here to have meaningful physical interpretations related to defects. In our examples we will mainly focus on the case where $M$ is 4-dimensional and $F$ has codimension 2. The second framework uses obstruction theory and the fact that spontaneously broken finite symmetries leave behind domain walls, to determine the conditions on which dimensions a higher-form finite symmetry can spontaneously break. We explicitly study the cases of higher-form $\mathbb Z/2$ symmetry, but the method can be generalized to other groups.</description>

      <title>Pairing phase diagram for electron-doped cuprates in the square-lattice $t-U-V$ Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by significant discrepancies between experimental observations of electron-doped cuprates and numerical results of the Hubbard model, we investigate the role of nearest-neighbor (NN) electron interactions $V$ by studying the $t-U-V$ model on square lattices. Upon doping $\delta$= 0.153, by using constrained path quantum Monte Carlo (CPQMC) method, we find that NN electron attraction $V$ can notably drive an exotic $p$-wave spin-triplet pairing, while the NN electron repulsion $V$ will suppress the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave ($d$-wave) pairing and triggers the $d_{xy}$-wave pairing. Especially in the intermediate coupling regime, as NN repulsion increases, the intensity of $d_{xy}$-wave pairing also increases, further suppressing the presence of $d$-wave pairing, which may help explain the notable suppression of $d$-wave pairing in electron-doped cuprate superconductors. Besides the pairing phase, we also find that the NN electron attraction $V$ has no significant effect on spin density wave (SDW) and charge density wave (CDW), but repulsion $V$ significantly enhanced CDW and suppressed SDW. Our study suggests the $t-U-V$ Hubbard model can serve as the minimal model to capture the essential physics of the electron-doped cuprates. Notably, for $V/U \sim 1/4 - 1/3$, the results align more closely with the experimentally observed behavior of electron-doped systems, potentially explaining the shrinkage of $d$-wave superconductivity region and the decrease of superconducting temperature.</description>

      <title>Scrambling Enabled Entropy Accumulation in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In closed quantum many-body systems, initially localized information spreads throughout the system and becomes highly complex. This phenomenon, known as information scrambling, is closely related to entropy growth and quantum thermalization. Recent studies have shown that dissipation in open systems can hinder information scrambling, driving the system into a dissipative phase when the system-bath coupling is strong. However, the signature of this scrambling transition in entropy dynamics remains unexplored. In this work, we unveil a novel phenomenon in open quantum systems, termed entropy accumulation, which occurs exclusively within the scrambling phase. We consider a setup in which a probe is weakly coupled to a system that is already interacting with a bath. We calculate the increase in the second R\'enyi entropy induced by an external impulse on the system, after tracing out the probe. Despite the system-probe coupling being weak, the entropy continues to increase and eventually saturates at a finite value due to operator growth. In contrast, the entropy increase is limited by the coupling strength in the dissipative phase. The theoretical prediction is derived from both general arguments and an explicit example using generalized Boltzmann equations. Our results offer new insights into the intriguing relationship between entropy dynamics and information scrambling in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of a spin model with an extensive degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the role played by extensive degeneracy in shaping the nature of the quantum dynamics of a one-dimensional spin model for both ramp and periodic drive protocols. The model displays an extensive degenerate manifold of states for a specific value of one of the parameters of its Hamiltonian. We study a linear ramp which takes the spin model through this degenerate point and show that it leads to a deviation from the usual Kibble-Zurek behavior. We also study the St\"uckelberg oscillations in such a model for a ramp which passes twice through the degenerate point. Our study indicates that such oscillations are strongly suppressed leading to a distinct behavior compared to those arising from double passage through a quantum critical point. Finally, we study the periodic dynamics of the model and show, for a large drive amplitude, the existence of special drive frequencies at which the system exhibits an approximate emergent $U(1)$ symmetry. We study the effect of this emergent symmetry on the correlators of the driven system and demonstrate the existence of dynamic symmetry restoration at these frequencies. We study the fate of the emergent symmetry when the drive amplitude is decreased and discuss possible experiments to test our theory.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of ac-driven quantum transport and minimal excitations in the fractional quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the challenges of achieving minimal excitations in the fractional quantum Hall effect and addressing Hong-Ou-Mandel -type setups under ac drives when the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid description is adopted. We apply the unifying non-equilibrium perturbative approach to weak backscattering through a quantum point contact in a two or three terminal geometry such as the "anyon collider". We show that the photoassisted noise is always higher than the photoassisted current, thus is super-Poissonian. This is an alternative theorem to Levitov's one, violated in the TLL model, thus questioning the expression "photoassisted". In the two-terminal geometry, we analyze carefully the validity domain of the perturbative approach and the possibility to achieve the quantum regime close to frequency locking, where singularities give access to the fractional charge. Then we show the persistence of equilibrium contributions to photoassisted noise that prevent access to zero-temperature and Poissonian limits under Lorentzian pulses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prior works on similar setups, as well as "Leviton crystallization" where the zero-temperature limit is inappropriate, may be unreliable. Our findings are also applicable to Hall interferometers, coherent conductors, and Josephson or phase-slip junctions strongly coupled to an ohmic environment under an ac bias.</description>

      <title>Semi-Deterministic and Stochastic Sampling of Feynman Diagrams with 1/N$_f$ Expansions</title>

Abstract: We introduce a family of (semi) bold-line series, assisted with $1/\text{N}_{f}$ expansions, with $\text{N}_{f}$ being the number of fermion flavours. If there is no additional $\mathrm{N}_{f}$ cut, the series reduces to the RPA series in the density-density channel, complementary to the particle-hole and particle-particle channels introduced in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{102}, 195122]. We performed extensive benchmarks for density, energy and pressure with $\mathrm{t}-\mathrm{t}'$ $\mathrm{SU}(\mathrm{N}_{f})$ Hubbard model on square lattice and honeycomb lattices over a wide range of numerical methods. For benchmark purposes, we also implement bare-$\mathrm{U}$ symmetry-broken perturbation series for the 2D SU(2) Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice. We find difficulties simulating grand potentials with different shift parameters even at high temperatures and weak interactions, while in general find encouraging results for density simulations. We believe the search for optimal shift parameters is feasible, while we leave this problem for future studies. Nevertheless, the $1/\mathrm{N}_{f}$ series could proves efficacious for grand potential computations where symmetry broken bare-U expansion grapples with considerable challenges.</description>

      <title>Quantum loops in the 1T transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Loop arrangements and their quantum superpositions describe several interesting many-particle states. We propose that they also describe bonding in a class of transition metal dichalcogenides. We present an effective quantum loop model for monolayers with 1T structure and a d$^2$ valence electron configuration: materials of the form MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W and X=S, Se, Te) and AM$'$Y$_2$ (A = Li, Na; M$'$ = V, Nb and Y = O, S, Se). Their t$_{2g}$ orbitals exhibit strongly directional overlaps between neighbouring atoms, favouring the formation of valence bonds. A transition metal atom forms two valence bonds, each with one of its neighbours. When connected, these bonds form loops that cover the triangular lattice. We construct a minimal Rokhsar-Kivelson-like model with resonance processes that cut and reconnect loops that run in proximity. The resulting dynamics is more constrained than in traditional quantum dimer models, with a `bending' constraint that arises from orbital structure. In the resulting phase diagram, we find phases that resemble distorted phases seen in materials, viz., the 1T$'$ and trimerized phases. As a testable prediction, we propose that a single d$^1$ or d$^3$ impurity will terminate a loop and give rise to a long-ranged texture. For example, a Ti/Cr defect in LiVO$_2$ will produce one or more domain walls that propagate outward from the impurity. We discuss the possibility of a loop liquid phase that can emerge in these materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel collinear magnetic phase, termed ``altermagnetism,'' has recently been uncovered, characterized by zero net magnetization and momentum-dependent collinear spin-splitting. To understand the intriguing physical effects of altermagnets and explore their potential applications, it is crucial to analyze both the geometric and spin configurations of altermagnetic Fermi surfaces. Here, we conduct a comprehensive study of the quasiparticle interference (QPI) effects induced by both nonmagnetic and magnetic impurities in metallic altermagnets, incorporating the influence of Zeeman splitting and spin-orbit coupling. By examining the QPI patterns for various spin polarizations of magnetic impurities and different spin-probe channels, we identify a series of distinctive signatures that can be used to characterize altermagnetic Fermi surfaces. These predicted signatures can be directly compared with experimental results obtained through spin-resolved scanning tunneling spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Out-of-phase Plasmon Excitations in the Trilayer Cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within a homologous series of cuprate superconductors, variations in the stacking of CuO$_2$ layers influence the collective charge dynamics through the long-range Coulomb interactions. We use O $K$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering to reveal plasmon excitations in the optimally-doped trilayer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$. The observed plasmon exhibits nearly $q_z$-independent dispersion and a large excitation gap of approximately 300 meV. This mode is primarily ascribed to the $\omega_{-}$ mode, where the charge density on the outer CuO$_2$ sheets oscillates out of phase while the density in the inner sheet remains unaltered at $q_z=0$. The intensity of the acoustic $\omega_3$ mode is relatively weak and becomes vanishingly small near $(q_x, q_y)=(0, 0)$. This result highlights a qualitative change in the eigenmode of the dominant low-energy plasmon with the number of CuO$_2$ layers.</description>

      <title>Magnetic transition in marcasite FeTe$_{2}$ induced by the competition between crystal field splitting and Coulomb repulsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic ground states in crystalline systems are significant for both fundamental condensed matter physics and practical materials engineering. Marcasite FeTe$_{2}$, characterized as a small-gap semiconductor, exhibits anomalous magnetic behaviors in low-temperature experiments. In this study, first-principles density functional theory calculations combined with scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy are employed to investigate the magnetic ground state of marcasite FeTe$_{2}$. It is revealed that the competition between crystal field splitting and Coulomb repulsion plays the key role in the formation of localized magnetic moments in FeTe$_{2}$. The ground state of FeTe$_{2}$ bulk is confirmed to be nonmagnetic, while the previously observed magnetic responses of FeTe$_{2}$ are suggested to be related to the magnetic Fe atoms on the crystal surfaces. Our work proposes a straightforward theoretical criterion for determining ground-state magnetism of various localized-moment systems.</description>

      <title>Directly imaging spin polarons in a kinetically frustrated Hubbard system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of quasiparticles in quantum many-body systems underlies the rich phenomenology in many strongly interacting materials. In the context of doped Mott insulators, magnetic polarons are quasiparticles that usually arise from an interplay between the kinetic energy of doped charge carriers and superexchange spin interactions. However, in kinetically frustrated lattices, itinerant spin polarons - bound states of a dopant and a spin-flip - have been theoretically predicted even in the absence of superexchange coupling. Despite their important role in the theory of kinetic magnetism, a microscopic observation of these polarons is lacking. Here we directly image itinerant spin polarons in a triangular lattice Hubbard system realised with ultracold atoms, revealing enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations in the local environment of a hole dopant. In contrast, around a charge dopant, we find ferromagnetic correlations, a manifestation of the elusive Nagaoka effect. We study the evolution of these correlations with interactions and doping, and use higher-order correlation functions to further elucidate the relative contributions of superexchange and kinetic mechanisms. The robustness of itinerant spin polarons at high temperature paves the way for exploring potential mechanisms for hole pairing and superconductivity in frustrated systems. Furthermore, our work provides microscopic insights into related phenomena in triangular lattice moir\'{e} materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a variational approach to explore quasiparticle excitations in interacting quantum many-body systems, motivated by the potential in leveraging near-term noisy intermediate scale quantum devices for quantum state preparation. By exploiting translation invariance and potentially other abelian symmetries of the many-body Hamiltonian, we extend the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approach to construct spatially localized quasiparticle states that encode information on the whole excited band, allowing us to achieve quantum parallelism. We benchmark the proposed algorithm via numerical simulations performed on the one-dimension transverse field Ising chain. We show that VQE can capture both the magnon quasiparticles of the paramagnetic phase, and the topologically non-trivial domain wall excitations in the ferromagnetic regime. We show that the localized quasiparticle states constructed with VQE contain accessible information on the full band of quasiparticles, and provide valuable insight into the way interactions renormalize the bare spin flip or domain wall excitations of the simple, trivially solvable limits of the model. These results serve as important theoretical input towards utilizing quantum simulators to directly access the quasiparticles of strongly interacting quantum systems, as well as to gain insight into crucial experimentally measured properties directly determined by the nature of these quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic mixed state topological order in a stabilizer system under stochastic decoherence: Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking from percolation point of view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering quantum orders in mixed many-body systems is an ongoing issue. Very recently, the notion of an intrinsic mixed state topologically-ordered (IMTO) state was proposed. As a concrete example, we observe the emergence of IMTO by studying the toric code system under stochastic maximal decoherence by $ZX$-diagonal type projective measurement without monitoring. We study how the toric code state changes to an IMTO state at the level of the averaged quantum trajectories. This phase transition is understood from the viewpoint of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of 1-form weak symmetry, that is, the IMTO is characterized by the symmetry restoration from the SSB, which comes from the proliferation of anyons. To understand the emergent IMTO, order and disorder parameters of 1-form symmetry are numerically studied by stabilizer simulation. The present study clarifies the existence of two distinct microscopic string operators for the fermionic anyons, that leads to distinct fermionic strong and weak 1-form symmetries, and also the obtained critical exponents indicate strong relation between IMTO and percolation.</description>

      <title>Disentangling critical quantum spin chains with Clifford circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clifford circuits can be utilized to disentangle quantum states with polynomial cost, thanks to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. Based on this idea, the Clifford circuits augmented matrix product states (CAMPS) method, which is a seamless integration of Clifford circuits within the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm, was proposed recently and was shown to be able to reduce entanglement in various quantum systems. In this work, we further explore the power of the CAMPS method in critical spin chains described by conformal field theories (CFTs) in the scaling limit. We find that the optimized disentanglers correspond to {\it duality} transformations, which significantly reduce the entanglement entropy in the ground state. For the critical quantum Ising spin chain governed by the Ising CFT with self-duality, the Clifford circuits found by CAMPS coincide with the duality transformation, i.e., the Kramers-Wannier self-duality in the critical Ising chain. It reduces the entanglement entropy by mapping the free conformal boundary condition to the fixed one. In the more general case of the XXZ chain, the CAMPS gives rise to a duality transformation mapping the model to the quantum Ashkin-Teller spin chain. Our results highlight the potential of the framework as a versatile tool for uncovering hidden dualities and simplifying the entanglement structure of critical quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial strain tuning of electronic and spin excitations in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_{c,\text{onset}} &gt; 40$ K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) thin films under in-plane biaxial compressive strain underscores the pivotal role of epitaxial strain in tuning exotic electronic states and provides a unique platform for investigating the superconducting mechanisms in nickelate superconductors. Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to probe the strain-dependent electronic and spin excitations in LNO thin films with biaxial strain ranging from $\epsilon\approx-1.04\%$ to $1.91\%$. Compared with the bulk crystal, the LNO thin film grown on LaAlO$_3$ (with $\epsilon\approx-1.04\%$) exhibits similar $dd$ excitations and enhanced spin excitation bandwidth. In contrast, the 0.4 eV and 1.6 eV $dd$ excitations associated with the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$ orbital, along with the spin excitations, are significantly suppressed in the film grown on SrTiO$_3$ ($\varepsilon\approx1.91\%$). The $c$-axis compression and the reduced out-of-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle, induced by in-plane tensile strain in LNO/SrTiO$_3$ broaden the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$ bandwidth and decrease the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization, thereby suppressing the $dd$ excitations. The evolution of spin excitations reflects significant changes in the interlayer exchange coupling $J_z$, which can be attributed to the strain-tuned Ni-O-Ni bond angle. Since superconductivity is observed only in films with in-plane compressive strain ($\epsilon\sim-2\%$), the strain-dependent spin correlations align with the emergence of superconductivity, providing indirect evidence for spin-fluctuation-mediated unconventional superconductivity in LNO.</description>
