      <title>Metrics sonification: The introduction of new ways to present bibliometric data using publication data of Loet Leydesdorff as an example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The visualization of publication and citation data is popular in bibliometrics. Although less common, the representation of empirical data as sound is an alternative form of presentation (in other fields than bibliometrics). In this representation, the data are mapped into sound and listened to by an audience. Approaches for the sonification of data have been developed in many fields since decades. Since sonification has several advantages for the presentation of data, this study is intended to introduce sonification to bibliometrics named as 'metrics sonification'. Metrics sonification is defined as the sonification of bibliometric information (measurements, data or results) for their empirical analysis and/or presentation. In this study, we used metadata of publications by Loet Leydesdorff (named as Loet in the following) to sonify their properties. Loet was a giant in the field of scientometrics, who passed away in 2023. The track based on Loet's publications can be listened to on SoundCloud using the following link: https://on.soundcloud.com/oxBTA32x4EgwvKVz5. The track has been composed in F minor; this key was chosen to express the sad occasion. The quantitative part of the track includes a parameter mapping (a sonification) of three properties of his publications: (1) publication output, (2) open access publication, and (3) citation impact of publications. The qualitative part (spoken audio) focuses on explanations of the parameter mapping and descriptions of the mapped papers (based on their titles and abstracts). The sonification of Loet's publications presented in this study is only one possible type of metrics sonification application. As the great number of projects from other disciplines have demonstrated, many other types of applications are possible in bibliometrics.</description>

      <title>Coconut Libtool: Bridging Textual Analysis Gaps for Non-Programmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of big and ubiquitous data, professionals and students alike are finding themselves needing to perform a number of textual analysis tasks. Historically, the general lack of statistical expertise and programming skills has stopped many with humanities or social sciences backgrounds from performing and fully benefiting from such analyses. Thus, we introduce Coconut Libtool (www.coconut-libtool.com/), an open-source, web-based application that utilizes state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) technologies. Coconut Libtool analyzes text data from customized files and bibliographic databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, and Lens. Users can verify which functions can be performed with the data they have. Coconut Libtool deploys multiple algorithmic NLP techniques at the backend, including topic modeling (LDA, Biterm, and BERTopic algorithms), network graph visualization, keyword lemmatization, and sunburst visualization. Coconut Libtool is the people-first web application designed to be used by professionals, researchers, and students in the information sciences, digital humanities, and computational social sciences domains to promote transparency, reproducibility, accessibility, reciprocity, and responsibility in research practices.</description>

      <title>Thanking the World: Exploring Gender-Based Differences in Acknowledgment Patterns and Support Systems in Theses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on acknowledgment sections of scientific papers has gained significant attention, but there remains a dearth of studies examining acknowledgments in the context of Electronic Theses and Dissertations. This paper addresses this gap by investigating the sources of support for male and female researchers in completing their master's or doctoral theses, focusing on the discipline of Library and Information Science. We utilize a novel method of extracting the various types of support systems that are acknowledged in 1252 ETDs using RoBERTa-based models. The most prominent forms of support acknowledged by researchers are academic, moral, financial, and religious support. While there are no significant gender-based differences in religious and financial support, the ratio of academic to moral support acknowledged by researchers shows strong gender-based variation. Additionally, advisors display a preference for supervising same-gender researchers. By comprehending the nuances of support systems and the unique challenges faced by researchers of different genders, we can foster a more inclusive and supportive academic environment. The insights gained from this research have implications for improving mentoring practices and promoting gender equality in academia.</description>

      <title>The Impact of AI on Academic Research and Publishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies like ChatGPT, have significantly impacted academic writing and publishing through their ability to generate content at levels comparable to or surpassing human writers. Through a review of recent interdisciplinary literature, this paper examines ethical considerations surrounding the integration of AI into academia, focusing on the potential for this technology to be used for scholarly misconduct and necessary oversight when using it for writing, editing, and reviewing of scholarly papers. The findings highlight the need for collaborative approaches to AI usage among publishers, editors, reviewers, and authors to ensure that this technology is used ethically and productively.</description>

      <title>Text Analysis of ETDs in ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (PQDT) Global (2016-2018)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The information explosion in the form of ETDs poses the challenge of management and extraction of appropriate knowledge for decision-making. Thus, the present study forwards a solution to the above problem by applying topic mining and prediction modeling tools to 263 ETDs submitted to the PQDT Global database during 2016-18 in the field of library science. This study was divided into two phases. The first phase determined the core topics from the ETDs using Topic-Modeling-Tool (TMT), which was based on latent dirichlet allocation (LDA), whereas the second phase employed prediction analysis using RapidMinerplatform to annotate the future research articles on the basis of the modeled topics. The core topics (tags) for the studied period were found to be book history, school librarian, public library, communicative ecology, and informatics followed by text network and trend analysis on the high probability cooccurred words. Lastly, a prediction model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was created in order to accurately predict the placement of future ETDs going to be submitted to PQDT Global under the five modeled topics (a to e). The tested dataset against the trained data set for the predictive performed perfectly.</description>

      <title>Which topics are best represented by science maps? An analysis of clustering effectiveness for citation and text similarity networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A science map of topics is a visualization that shows topics identified algorithmically based on the bibliographic metadata of scientific publications. In practice not all topics are well represented in a science map. We analyzed how effectively different topics are represented in science maps created by clustering biomedical publications. To achieve this, we investigated which topic categories, obtained from MeSH terms, are better represented in science maps based on citation or text similarity networks. To evaluate the clustering effectiveness of topics, we determined the extent to which documents belonging to the same topic are grouped together in the same cluster. We found that the best and worst represented topic categories are the same for citation and text similarity networks. The best represented topic categories are diseases, psychology, anatomy, organisms and the techniques and equipment used for diagnostics and therapy, while the worst represented topic categories are natural science fields, geographical entities, information sciences and health care and occupations. Furthermore, for the diseases and organisms topic categories and for science maps with smaller clusters, we found that topics tend to be better represented in citation similarity networks than in text similarity networks.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Deception: Establishing a Taxonomic Framework for Disinformation within Scientific Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disinformation spreads among the public and in scientific discourse through the actions of individuals, organizations, and governments that distort scholarly communications, media narratives, and institutional trust. This taxonomy introduces a structured framework and specialized set of definitions to elucidate the key participants, platforms, and strategies employed in the propagation of disinformation. Enhanced comprehension of the mechanisms and pathways of scientific disinformation equips journalists and policymakers with the tools necessary to more effectively recognize and address these issues. The authors developed this taxonomy of disinformation through a multi-faceted approach, encompassing a literature review, expert review, and case study analysis. The literature review revealed a scarcity of taxonomical models amidst prevalent algorithmic detection studies. Subsequently, an expert review process refined our taxonomy through collaborative analysis of twenty-two cases of identified disinformation, categorized by their methods, motives, and impacts. Finally, we validated and fine-tuned our taxonomy through detailed case studies of twelve diverse disinformation instances, assessing the taxonomy's effectiveness in capturing the essential characteristics of each case and making necessary adjustments to ensure its relevance and accuracy in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Promotional Language and the Adoption of Innovative Ideas in Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How are the merits of innovative ideas communicated in science? Here we conduct semantic analyses of grant application success with a focus on scientific promotional language, which has been growing in frequency in many contexts and purportedly may convey an innovative idea's originality and significance. Our analysis attempts to surmount limitations of prior studies by examining the full text of tens of thousands of both funded and unfunded grants from three leading public and private funding agencies: the NIH, the NSF, and the Novo Nordisk Foundation, one of the world's largest private science foundations. We find a robust association between promotional language and the support and adoption of innovative ideas by funders and other scientists. First, the percentage of promotional language in a grant proposal is associated with up to a doubling of the grant's probability of being funded. Second, a grant's promotional language reflects its intrinsic level of innovativeness. Third, the percentage of promotional language predicts the expected citation and productivity impact of publications that are supported by funded grants. Lastly, a computer-assisted experiment that manipulates the promotional language in our data demonstrates how promotional language can communicate the merit of ideas through cognitive activation. With the incidence of promotional language in science steeply rising, and the pivotal role of grants in converting promising and aspirational ideas into solutions, our analysis provides empirical evidence that promotional language is associated with effectively communicating the merits of innovative scientific ideas.</description>
