      <title>Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background from Highly-Eccentric Stellar-Mass Binaries in the Milli-hertz Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many gravitational wave (GW) sources are expected to have non-negligible eccentricity in the millihertz band. These highly eccentric compact object binaries may commonly serve as a progenitor stage of GW mergers, particularly in dynamical channels where environmental perturbations bring a binary with large initial orbital separation into a close pericenter passage, leading to efficient GW emission and a final merger. This work examines the stochastic GW background from highly eccentric ($e\gtrsim 0.9$), stellar-mass sources in the mHz band. Our findings suggest that these binaries can contribute a substantial GW power spectrum, potentially exceeding the LISA instrumental noise at $\sim 3-7$~mHz. This stochastic background is likely to be dominated by eccentric sources within the Milky Way, thus introducing anisotropy and time dependence in LISA's detection. However, given efficient search strategies to identify GW transients from highly eccentric binaries, the unresolvable noise level can be substantially lower, approaching $\sim 2$ orders of magnitude below the LISA noise curve. Therefore, we highlight the importance of characterizing stellar-mass GW sources with extreme eccentricity, especially their transient GW signals in the millihertz band.</description>

      <title>The extreme coronal line emitter AT 2022fpx: Varying optical polarization properties and late-time X-ray flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes have been known to disrupt passing stars, producing outbursts called tidal disruption events (TDEs). TDEs have recently gained attention due to their unique dynamics and emission processes, which are still not fully understood. Especially, the so-called optical TDEs, are of interest as they often exhibit delayed or obscured X-ray emission from the accretion disk, making the origin of the prompt emission unclear. In this paper, we present the optical photo-, spectro-, and polarimetry of a recent TDE candidate AT 2022fpx, in addition to accompanying monitoring observations in ultraviolet and X-rays. The optical spectra of AT 2022fpx show Bowen fluorescence as well as highly-ionized iron emission lines, which are characteristic of extreme coronal line emitters. Additionally, the source exhibits variable but low-polarized emission at the outburst peak, with a clear rotation of the polarization angle. X-ray emission observed later in the decay appear flare-like but is consistent with constant temperature black-body emission. The overall outburst decay is slower than for typical TDEs, and resembles more the ones seen from Bowen fluorescence flares. These observations suggest that AT 2022fpx could be a key source in linking different long-lived TDE scenarios. Its unique characteristics, such as the extreme coronal line emission, variable polarization, and the delayed X-ray flare, can be attributed to the outer shock scenario or a clumpy torus surrounding the supermassive black hole. Further studies, especially in the context of multi-wavelength observations, are crucial to fully understand the dynamics and emission mechanisms of these intriguing astrophysical events.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning Classification and Parameter Inference of Rotational Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test Deep-Learning (DL) techniques for the analysis of rotational core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) gravitational-wave (GW) signals by performing classification and parameter inference of the GW strain amplitude ($D \cdot \Delta h $) and the maximum (peak) frequency $(f_\textrm{peak})$, attained at core bounce. Our datasets are built from a catalog of numerically generated CCSN waveforms assembled by Richers 2017. Those waveforms are injected into noise from the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors corresponding to the O2 and O3a observing runs. For a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) above 5, our classification network using time series detects Galactic CCSN GW signals buried in detector noise with a false positive rate (FPR) of 0.10% and a 98% accuracy, being able to detect all signals with SNR&gt;10. The inference of $f_\textrm{peak}$ is more accurate than for $D \cdot \Delta h $, particularly for our datasets with the shortest time window (0.25 s) and for a minimum SNR=15. From the calibration plots of predicted versus true values of the two parameters, the standard deviation ($\sigma$) and the slope deviation with respect to the ideal value are computed. We find $\sigma_{D \cdot \Delta h}$ = 52.6cm and $\sigma_{f_\textrm{peak}}$ = 18.3Hz, with respective slope deviations of 11.6% and 8.3%. Our best model is also tested on waveforms from a recent CCSN catalog built by Mitra 2023, different from the one used for the training. For these new waveforms the true values of the two parameters are mostly within the 1$\sigma$ band around the network's predicted values. Our results show that DL techniques hold promise to infer physical parameters of Galactic rotational CCSN even in the presence of real (non-Gaussian) noise conditions from current GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of Non-Thermal Pulsed Emission from Eight MeV Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the properties of pulsed X-ray emission from eight MeV pulsars using XMM-Newton, NICER, NuSTAR and HXMT data. For the five among eight MeV pulsars, the X-ray spectra can be fitted by a broken-power law model with a break energy of $\sim5-10$ keV. The photon index below and above break energy are $\sim 1$ and $\sim 1.5$, respectively. In comparison with the X-ray emission of the $Fermi$-LAT pulsars, the MeV pulsars have a harder spectrum and ahigher radiation efficiency in 0.3-10 keV energy bands. By assuming the isotropic emission, the emission efficiency in the keV-MeV bands is estimated to be $\eta_{MeV}\sim 0.01-0.1$, and it is similar to the efficiency of GeV emission of the $Fermi$-LAT pulsars that have similar spin-down power. To explain the observed efficiency of the MeV pulsars, we estimate the required pair multiplicity as $10^{4-7}$ that depends on the emission process (curvature radiation or synchrotron radiation) and the location in the magnetosphere. The large multiplicity indicates that the secondary pairs that are created by a pair-creation process of the GeV photons produce the X-ray/soft gamma-ray emissions of the MeV pulsars. We speculate that the difference between the MeV pulsars and $Fermi$-LAT pulsars is attributed to the difference in viewing angle measured from the spin-axis, if the emission originates from a region inside the light cylinder (canonical gap model) or the difference in the inclination angle of the magnetic axis, if the emission is produced from equatorial current sheet outside the light cylinder.</description>

      <title>Constraining Mass Transfer Models with Galactic Neutron Star$-$White Dwarf Binaries as Gravitational Wave Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron star$-$white dwarf (NSWD) binaries are one of the most abundant sources of gravitational waves (GW) in the Milky Way. These GW sources are the evolutionary products of primordial binaries that experienced many processes of binary interaction. We employ a binary population synthesis method to investigate the properties of Galactic NSWD binaries detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). In this paper, only the NSWD systems with a COWD or ONeWD component are included. We consider various models related to mass transfer efficiencies during primordial binary evolution, supernova explosion mechanisms at NS formation, common envelope ejection efficiencies, and critical WD masses that determining the stability of mass transfer between WDs and NSs. Based on our calculations, we estimate that tens to hundreds of LISA NSWD binaries exist in the Milky Way. We find that the detection of LISA NSWD binaries is able to provide profound insights into mass transfer efficiencies during the evolution of primordial binaries and critical WD masses during mass transfer from a WD to an NS.</description>

      <title>Constraining primordial black holes as dark matter using AMS-02 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are the plausible candidates for the cosmological dark matter. Theoretically, PBHs with masses $M_{\rm PBH}$ in the range of $4\times10^{14}\sim 10^{17}\,{\rm g}$ can emit sub-GeV electrons and positrons through Hawking radiation. Some of these particles could undergo diffusive reacceleration during their propagation in the Milky Way, resulting in acceleration up to the GeV level. This falls within the observation energy range of AMS-02. In this work, we utilize AMS-02 data to constrain the PBH abundance $f_{\rm PBH}$ employing the reacceleration mechanism. Our findings reveal that the limit is more stringent than those derived from Voyager 1 for nearly $\mathcal{O}(1)$ at $M_{\rm PBH}\sim10^{16}\,{\rm g}$ under the assumption of a monochromatic PBH mass distribution. The constraints are even more robust in a more realistic scenario involving a log-normal mass distribution of PBHs. Moreover, we explore the impact of varying propagation parameters and solar modulation potential within reasonable ranges, and find that such variations have minimal effects on the final results.</description>

      <title>A Multiwavelength Machine-learning Approach to Classifying X-ray Sources in the Fields of Unidentified 4FGL-DR4 sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large fraction of Fermi-LAT sources in the 4th Fermi LAT 14-year Catalog (4FGL) still remain unidentified (unIDed). We continued to improve our machine learning pipeline (MUWCLASS) and used it to classify 1206 X-ray sources located within the extent of 73 unIDed 4FGL sources with Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) observations included in the Chandra Source Catalog 2.0. Recent improvements to our pipeline include astrometric corrections, probabilistic cross-matching to lower-frequency counterparts, and a more realistic oversampling method. X-ray sources are classified into 8 broad pre-determined astrophysical classes defined in the updated training dataset which we also release. The classifications give 115 plausible X-ray counterparts to 45 GeV sources. We present details of the machine learning classification, describe the pipeline improvements, and perform additional spectral and variability analysis for brighter sources. We identify 3 GeV sources as isolated neutron star candidates, 1 as an X-ray binary candidate, 16 as active galactic nucleus candidates, 7 sources are associated with star-forming regions, and 9 are ambiguous cases. For the remaining 37 unIDed 4FGL sources, we could not identify any plausible counterpart in X-rays or they are too close to the Galactic Center. Finally, we outline the observational strategies and further improvements in the pipeline that can lead to more accurate classifications.</description>

      <title>High-energy extension of the gamma-ray band observable with an electron-tracking Compton camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the MeV gamma-ray band is a promising energy-band window in astrophysics, the current situation of MeV gamma-ray astronomy significantly lags behind those of the other energy bands in angular resolution and sensitivity. An electron-tracking Compton camera (ETCC), a next-generation MeV detector, is expected to revolutionize the situation. An ETCC tracks each Compton-recoil electron with a gaseous electron tracker and determines the incoming direction of each gamma-ray photon; thus, it has a strong background rejection power and yields a better angular resolution than classical Compton cameras. Here, we study ETCC events in which the Compton-recoil electrons do not deposit all energies to the electron tracker but escape and hit the surrounding pixel scintillator array (PSA). We developed an analysis method for this untapped class of events and applied it to laboratory and simulation data. We found that the energy spectrum obtained from the simulation agreed with that of the actual data within a factor of 1.2. We then evaluated the detector performance using the simulation data. The angular resolution for the new-class events was found to be twice as good as in the previous study at the energy range 1.0--2.0~MeV, where both analyses overlap. We also found that the total effective area is dominated by the contribution of the double-hit events above an energy of 1.5~MeV. Notably, applying this new method extends the sensitive energy range with the ETCC from 0.2--2.1 MeV in the previous studies to up to 3.5~MeV. Adjusting the PSA dynamic range should improve the sensitivity in even higher energy gamma-rays. The development of this new analysis method would pave the way for future observations by ETCC to fill the MeV-band sensitivity gap in astronomy.</description>

      <title>Spatial Variations and Breaks in the Optical-NIR spectra of the Pulsar and PWN in SNR 0540-69.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supernova remnant SNR 0540-69.3, twin of the Crab Nebula, offers an excellent opportunity to study the continuum emission from a young pulsar and pulsar-wind nebula (PWN). We present observations taken with the VLT instruments MUSE and X-shooter in the wavelength range 3000-25,000 \r{A}, which allow us to study spatial variations of the optical spectra, along with the first near-infrared (NIR) spectrum of the source. We model the optical spectra with a power law (PL) $F_\nu\propto\nu^{-\alpha}$ and find clear spatial variations (including a torus-jet structure) in the spectral index across the PWN. Generally, we find spectral hardening toward the outer parts, from $\alpha\sim1.1$ to $\sim0.1$, which may indicate particle reacceleration by the PWN shock at the inner edge of the ejecta or alternatively time variability of the pulsar wind. The optical-NIR spectrum of the PWN is best described by a broken PL, confirming that several breaks are needed to model the full spectral energy distribution of the PWN, suggesting the presence of more than one particle population. Finally, subtracting the PWN contribution from the pulsar spectrum we find that the spectrum is best described with a broken-PL model with a flat and a positive spectral index, in contrast to the Crab pulsar that has a negative spectral index and no break in the optical. This might imply that pulsar differences propagate to the PWN spectra.</description>

      <title>Proper motion of Cygnus loop shock filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determined shock speed in the Galactic supernova remnant Cygnus Loop, using proper motion of its optical filaments and the latest estimate for its distance. The proper motion was measured by comparing H$\alpha$ images of the remnant observed in two epochs: 1993 (Kitt Peak National Observatory) and 2018/2019 (National Astronomical Observatory Rozhen and Astronomical station Vidojevica). We derived shock speed for 35 locations along different filaments, which is twice as much as in earlier studies of north-eastern part of Cygnus Loop. For the first time, we have measured shock speed of radiative filaments in this region. Three of the analyzed locations where we measured proper motion of filaments are radiative, based on their presence in [SII] images from the second epoch. The other filaments are non-radiative. The speed we obtained for the non-radiative filaments is in the range of 240-650 $\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, with an estimate for the uncertainty of 70 $\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. These values are mostly in agreement with previous studies. The radiative filaments have lower speed of 100-160$\pm${70} $\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, which is in agreement with the assumption that they are older in evolutionary terms. This clear distinction between the speed of the two types of filaments proves that the [SII] emission can be used for identifying radiative filaments in supernova remnants.</description>

      <title>Neutrino fluxes from different classes of galactic sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the neutrino flux from different kinds of galactic sources and compare it with the recently diffuse neutrino flux detected by IceCube. We find that the flux from these sources may contribute to ~ 20% of the IceCube neutrino flux. Most of the sources selected in this work populate the southern hemisphere, therefore a detector like KM3NeT could help in resolving the sources out of the observed diffused galactic neutrino flux.</description>

      <title>Swift monitoring of GK Persei during the 2018 dwarf nova outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The old nova and intermediate polar (IP) GK Persei underwent one of its recurrent dwarf nova (DN) outbursts in 2018. We proposed monitoring it in UV and X-rays with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, starting less than six days after the eruption, until 16 days after the eruption ended. For the first time we could follow the decay to minimum light UV and X-rays. We present the timing and spectral analysis, comparing the results with the previous outbursts and with the quiescent status. We confirm the spin modulation in X-rays with a period 351.325(9) s, only in the 2-10 keV range. The period was not detected in the 0.3-2 keV range and in the UV band, suggesting that the soft portion of the X-ray spectrum in GK Per does not originate near the poles, but in a wind or circumstellar material. The amplitude of the modulation was less prominent than in 2015, a fact that seems correlated with a lower average mass accretion rate. The spectral fits are consistent with a mass accretion rate increasing by a factor of 2 from rise to maximum and decreasing during the return to minimum, following the trend of the modulation amplitude. The maximum plasma temperature is higher than the Swift XRT energy range of 0.3-10 keV, thus it is not well constrained, but our spectral fits indicate that it may have varied irregularly during the outburst.</description>

      <title>Using Gaussian Processes to detect AGN flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key feature of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is their variability across all wavelengths. Typically, AGN vary by a few tenths of a magnitude or more over periods lasting from hours to years. By contrast, extreme variability of AGN -- large luminosity changes that are a significant departure from the baseline variability -- are known as AGN flares. These events are rare and their timescales poorly constrained, with most of the literature focusing on individual events. It has been suggested that extreme AGN variability including flares can provide insights into the accretion processes in the disk. With surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) promising millions of transient detections per night in the coming decade, there is a need for fast and efficient classification of AGN flares. The problem with the systematic detection of AGN flares is the requirement to detect them against a stochastically variable baseline; the ability to define a signal as a significant departure from the ever-present variability is a statistical challenge. Recently, Gaussian Processes (GPs) have revolutionised the analysis of time-series data in many areas of astronomical research. They have, however, seen limited uptake within the field of transient detection and classification. Here we investigate the efficacy of Gaussian Processes to detect AGN flares in both simulated and real optical light curves. We show that GP analysis can successfully detect AGN flares with a false-positive rate of less than seven per cent, and we present examples of AGN light curves that show extreme variability.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric Bayesian reconstruction of Galactic magnetic fields using Information Field Theory: The inclusion of line-of-sight information in ultra-high energy cosmic ray backtracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged) Ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are extremely energetic charged particles with energies surpassing $10^{18}$ eV. Their sources remain elusive, obscured by deflections caused by the Galactic magnetic field (GMF). This challenge is further complicated by our limited understanding of the three-dimensional structure of the GMF, as current GMF observations consist primarily of quantities integrated along the line-of-sight (LOS). Nevertheless, data from upcoming stellar polarisation surveys along with Gaia's stellar parallax data are expected to yield local GMF measurements.. In this work, we employ methods of Bayesian statistical inference in order to sample the posterior distribution of the GMF within part of the Galaxy. By assuming a known rigidity and arrival direction of an UHECR, we backtrack its trajectory through various GMF configurations drawn from the posterior distribution. Our objective is to rigorously evaluate our algorithm's performance in scenarios that closely mirror the setting of expected future applications. In pursuit of this, we condition the posterior to synthetic integrated LOS measurements of the GMF, in addition to synthetic local POS-component measurements. In this proof of concept work, we assume the ground truth to be a magnetic field produced by a dynamo simulation of the Galactic ISM. Our results demonstrate that for all locations of the observed arrival direction on the POS, our algorithm is able to substantially update our knowledge on the original arrival direction of UHECRs with rigidity $E/Z = 5 \times 10^{19}$ eV, even in the case of complete absence of LOS information. If integrated data is included in the inference, then the regions of the celestial sphere where the maximum error occurs diminishes greatly. Even in those regions the maximum error is diminished by a factor of about $3$ in the specific setting studied.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Line Searches with the Cherenkov Telescope Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monochromatic gamma-ray signals constitute a potential smoking gun signature for annihilating or decaying dark matter particles that could relatively easily be distinguished from astrophysical or instrumental backgrounds. We provide an updated assessment of the sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) to such signals, based on observations of the Galactic centre region as well as of selected dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We find that current limits and detection prospects for dark matter masses above 300 GeV will be significantly improved, by up to an order of magnitude in the multi-TeV range. This demonstrates that CTA will set a new standard for gamma-ray astronomy also in this respect, as the world's largest and most sensitive high-energy gamma-ray observatory, in particular due to its exquisite energy resolution at TeV energies and the adopted observational strategy focussing on regions with large dark matter densities. Throughout our analysis, we use up-to-date instrument response functions, and we thoroughly model the effect of instrumental systematic uncertainties in our statistical treatment. We further present results for other potential signatures with sharp spectral features, e.g.~box-shaped spectra, that would likewise very clearly point to a particle dark matter origin.</description>

      <title>Improving the Cosmological Constraints by Inferring the Formation Channel of Extreme-mass-ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme-mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) could be detected by space-borne gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), TianQin and Taiji. In general, locating EMRIs by space-borne GW detectors can help us select the candidate host galaxies which can be used to infer the cosmic expansion history. In this paper, we show that the localization information of EMRIs can also be used to select the candidate host AGNs which can be used to infer the formation channel of the EMRIs and extract more precisely the redshift probability distributions of the EMRIs. Using the EMRIs that are expected to be detected by TianQin and LISA and the galaxy catalog that can be provided by the Chinese Space Station Telescope for the analysis, we find that TianQin can constrain the Hubble-Lema\^itre constant $H_0$ to a precision of about $3\%-8\%$ and the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0$ to about $10\%-40\%$, the network composed of TianQin and LISA can improve the precisions of $H_0$ and $w_0$ to about $0.4\% - 7\%$ and $4\%-20\%$, respectively, without considering the effects of AGNs. Furthermore, combining the detected EMRIs with AGN catalog by the statistical framework of likelihood-ratio-based, we find TianQin can establish the EMRI-AGN correlation with about $500$ EMRIs if all of the EMRIs indeed originate in AGNs, and the TianQin+LISA network can reduce this required number to about $30$. Once the EMRI-AGN correlation is confirmed, the combination of the EMRIs and AGN catalog can significantly improve the constraints on the cosmological parameters. These results demonstrate the potentials of using EMRIs as well as galaxy and AGN catalogs to constrain the cosmological parameters and astrophysical models.</description>

      <title>Constraining the PG 1553+113 binary hypothesis: interpreting hints of a new, 22-year period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PG 1553+113 is a well-known blazar exhibiting evidence of a $\sim\! 2.2$-yr quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in radio, optical, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray bands. Since QPO mechanisms often predict multiple QPOs, we search for a second QPO in its historical optical light curve covering a century of observations. Despite challenging data quality issues, we find hints of a $21.8 \pm 4.7$ yr oscillation. On its own, this $\sim\! 22$-yr period has a modest statistical significance of $1.6\sigma$ when accounting for the look-elsewhere effect. However, the joint significance of both the $2.2$- and $22$-yr periods arising from colored noise alone is $\sim 3.6\sigma$. The next peak of the 22-yr oscillation is predicted to occur around July 2025. We find that such a $\sim\,$10:1 relation between two periods can arise in the gas dynamics of a plausible supermassive black hole binary model of PG 1553+113. While the 22-yr QPO is preliminary, an interpretation of PG 1553+113's two QPOs in this binary model suggests that the binary engine has a mass ratio $\gtrsim 0.2$, an eccentricity $\lesssim 0.1$, and accretes from a disk with characteristic aspect ratio $\sim 0.03$. The putative binary radiates nHz gravitational waves, but the amplitude is $\sim10-100$ times too low for detection by foreseeable pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>Streaming instability in neutron star magnetospheres: No indication of soliton-like waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent radiation of pulsars, magnetars, and fast radio bursts could, in theory, be interpreted as radiation from solitons and soliton-like waves. The solitons are meant to contain a large number of electric charges confined on long time-scales and may radiate strongly by coherent curvature emission. However, solitons are also known to undergo a wave collapse, which may cast doubts on the correctness of the soliton radio emission models of neutron stars.
  We investigate the evolution of the caviton type of solitons self-consistently formed by the relativistic streaming instability and compare their apparent stability in 1D calculations with more generic 2D cases, in which the solitons are seen to collapse. Three representative cases of beam Lorentz factors and plasma temperatures are studied to obtain soliton dispersion properties. We utilized 1D electrostatic and 2D electromagnetic relativistic particle-in-cell simulations at kinetic microscales.
  We found that no solitons are generated by the streaming instability in the 2D simulations. Only superluminal L-mode (relativistic Langmuir) waves are produced during the saturation of the instability, but these waves have smaller amplitudes than the waves in the 1D simulations. The amplitudes tend to decrease after the instability has saturated, and only waves close to the light line, $\omega = c k$, remain. Solitons in the 1D approach are stable for $\gamma_\mathrm{b} \gtrsim 60$, but they disappear for low beam Lorentz factor $\gamma_\mathrm{b} &lt; 6$.
  Our examples show that the superluminal soliton branch that is formed in 1D simulations will not be generated by the relativistic streaming instability when more dimensional degrees of freedom are present - unless one can show that there are alternative plasma mechanisms for the soliton generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae are sources of powerful gravitational waves (GWs). We assess the possibility of extracting information about the equation of state (EOS) of high density matter from the GW signal. We use the bounce and early post-bounce signals of rapidly rotating supernovae. A large set of GW signals is generated using general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations for various EOS models. The uncertainty in the electron capture rate is parametrized by generating signals for six different models. To classify EOSs based on the GW data, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Even with the uncertainty in the electron capture rates, we find that the CNN models can classify the EOSs with an average accuracy of about 87 percent for a set of four distinct EOS models.</description>

      <title>The impact of asymmetric dark matter on the thermal evolution of nucleonic and hyperonic compact stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of asymmetric fermionic dark matter (DM) on the thermal evolution of neutron stars (NSs), considering a scenario where DM interacts with baryonic matter (BM) through gravity. Employing the two-fluid formalism, our analysis reveals that DM accrued within the NS core exerts an inward gravitational pull on the outer layers composed of BM. This gravitational interaction results in a noticeable increase in baryonic density within the core of the NS. Consequently, it strongly affects the star's thermal evolution by triggering an early onset of the direct Urca (DU) processes, causing an enhanced neutrino emission and rapid star cooling. Moreover, the photon emission from the star's surface is modified due to a reduction of radius. We demonstrate the effect of DM gravitational pull on nucleonic and hyperonic DU processes that become kinematically allowed even for NSs of low mass. We then discuss the significance of observing NSs at various distances from the Galactic center. Given that the DM distribution peaks toward the Galactic center, NSs within this central region are expected to harbor higher fractions of DM, potentially leading to distinct cooling behaviors.</description>

Abstract: Radio emission from pulsars can be used to map out their distances through dispersion measure (DM), which quantifies the amount of radio pulse dispersion. However, this method relies on accurately modelling the free electron density in the line of sight. Here, we present a detailed study of the multiwavelength emission from PSR J1720$-$0534, a black widow compact binary millisecond pulsar discovered in 2021, which the latest electron density model of the Galaxy (Yao et al. 2017) places at only 191 pc. We obtained and analysed deep multiwavelength observations in the $\gamma$-ray (Fermi-Large Area Telescope, 2008-2022), optical (Las Cumbres Observatory, 2.7 h), near-infrared (Nordic Optical Telescope, 3.5 h), and X-ray (Swift-X-Ray Telescope, 10 ks) bands. We found no significant detection of $\gamma$-ray, optical, near-infrared, or X-ray counterparts around the radio-timing position of PSR J1720$-$0534, which we thus nickname 'the invisible black widow'. Employing the most constraining near-infrared limit ($J&gt;23.4$ mag), we established a lower limit on the source distance, $d&gt;1.1$ kpc, assuming conservative properties for the black widow companion star. This distance lower limit differs drastically (by a factor of more than 5) from the Yao et al. DM distance estimate. We attribute this difference to the inclusion in the Yao et al. model of a large and dense component towards the North Polar Spur. Considering our results and recent parallax distances to other pulsars in this direction, we argue that such a local and large component in the electron density model of the Galaxy is unnecessary.</description>

      <title>The Bulk Properties of Isolated Neutron Stars Inferred from the Gravitational Redshift Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurements of the bulk properties of most isolated neutron stars (INSs) are challenging tasks. Tang et al. (2020) have developed a new method, based on the equation of state (EoS) of neutron star (NS) material constrained by the observational data, to infer the gravitational masses of a few INSs whose gravitational redshifts are available. However, in that work, the authors only considered the constraints on the EoS from nuclear experiments/theories and the gravitational wave data of GW170817; the possible phase transition has not been taken into account. In this work, we adopt three EoS models (including the one incorporates a first-order strong phase transition) that are constrained by the latest multimessenger NS data, including in particular the recent mass\textendash radius measurements of two NSs by Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer, to update the estimation of the gravitational masses of RBS 1223, RX J0720.4-3125, and RX J1856.5-3754. In comparison to our previous approach, the new constraints are tighter, and the gravitational masses are larger by about $0.1M_\odot$. All the inferred gravitational masses are within the range of the NS masses measured in other ways. We have also calculated the radius, tidal-deformability, and moment of inertia of these sources. The inclusion of the first-order strong phase transition has little influence on modifying the results.</description>

      <title>Multimessenger Constraints on Radiatively Decaying Axions from GW170817</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The metastable hypermassive neutron star produced in the coalescence of two neutron stars can copiously produce axions that radiatively decay into $\mathcal{O}(100)$~MeV photons. These photons can form a fireball with characteristic temperature smaller than $1\rm\, MeV$. By relying on X-ray observations of GW170817/GRB 170817A with CALET CGBM, Konus-Wind, and Insight-HXMT/HE, we present new bounds on the axion-photon coupling for axion masses in the range $1$-$400\,\rm MeV$. We exclude couplings down to $5\times 10^{-11}\,\rm GeV^{-1}$, complementing and surpassing existing constraints. Our approach can be extended to any feebly-interacting particle decaying into photons.</description>

      <title>Dynamical tidal response of non-rotating relativistic stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the tidal response of neutron stars is crucial to connecting gravitational wave observations of binaries to ultra-dense nuclear physics. Most current models of the tidal response of relativistic stars either assume a static response model, or use phenomenological models inspired by Newtonian gravity. In this work, we present a general formalism for computing the linear dynamical tidal response function of relativistic, spherically symmetric stars. Our formalism incorporates stratification due to thermal and chemical imbalances, allowing one to study the effects of g modes on the tidal response function. We also describe how to incorporate sources of dissipation due to shear and bulk viscosity. To showcase the utility of our approach, we present several applications for polytropic stars in general relativity. We show how our formalism can capture the dynamical tidal resonance due to the f and g modes of inviscid stars and explore the sensitivity of the dynamical tidal response to the compactness of the star. We also compute the dissipative tidal deformability due to bulk and shear viscous dissipation. We find that, for the same viscous profile, the shear viscous tidal lag parameter is 100-1000 times larger than the dimensionless bulk viscous tidal lag parameter.</description>
