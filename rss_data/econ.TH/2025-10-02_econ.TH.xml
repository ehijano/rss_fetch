      <title>Elicitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analyst is tasked with producing a statistical study. The analyst is not monitored and is able to manipulate the study. He can receive payments contingent on his report and trusted data collected from an independent source, modeled as a statistical experiment. We describe the information that can be elicited with appropriately shaped incentives, and apply our framework to a variety of common statistical models. We then compare experiments based on the information they enable us to elicit. This order is connected to, but different from, the Blackwell order. Data preferred for estimation are also preferred for elicitation, but not conversely. Our results shed light on how using data as incentive generator in payment schemes differs from using data for statistical inference.</description>

      <title>Capital Games and Growth Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine formal games that we call "capital games" in which player payoffs are known, but their payoffs are not guaranteed to be von Neumann-Morgenstern utilities. In capital games, the dynamics of player payoffs determine their utility functions. Different players can have different payoff dynamics. We make no assumptions about where these dynamics come from, but implicitly assume that they come from the players' actions and interactions over time. We define an equilibrium concept called "growth equilibrium" and show a correspondence between the growth equilibria of capital games and the Nash equilibria of standard games.</description>

      <title>Exploring the conditions for sustainability with open-ended innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can sustained open-ended technological progress preserve natural resources in a finite planet? We address this question on the basis of a stylized model with genuine open-ended technological innovation, where an innovation event corresponds to a random draw of a technology in the space of the parameters that define how it impacts the environment and how it interacts with the population. Technological innovation is endogenous because an innovation may invade if it satisfies constraints which depend on the state of the environment and of the population. We find that open-ended innovation leads either to a sustainable future where global population saturates and the environment is preserved, or to exploding population and a vanishing environment. What drives the transition between these two phases is not the level of environmental impact of technologies, but rather the demographic effects of technologies and labor productivity. Low demographic impact and high labor productivity (as in several western countries today) result in a Schumpeterian dynamics where new "greener" technologies displace older ones, thereby reducing the overall environmental impact. In this scenario, global population saturates to a finite value, imposing strong selective pressure on technological innovation. When technologies contribute significantly to demographic growth and/or labor productivity is low, technological innovation runs unrestrained, population grows unbounded, while the environment collapses. As such, our model captures subtle feedback effects between technological progress, demography and sustainability that rationalize and align with empirical observations of a demographic transition and the environmental Kuznets curve, without deriving it from profit maximization based on individual incentives.</description>

      <title>Exploring Network-Knowledge Graph Duality: A Case Study in Agentic Supply Chain Risk Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with the complex, multi-modal, and network-native data underlying financial risk. Standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) oversimplifies relationships, while specialist models are costly and static. We address this gap with an LLM-centric agent framework for supply chain risk analysis. Our core contribution is to exploit the inherent duality between networks and knowledge graphs (KG). We treat the supply chain network as a KG, allowing us to use structural network science principles for retrieval. A graph traverser, guided by network centrality scores, efficiently extracts the most economically salient risk paths. An agentic architecture orchestrates this graph retrieval alongside data from numerical factor tables and news streams. Crucially, it employs novel ``context shells'' -- descriptive templates that embed raw figures in natural language -- to make quantitative data fully intelligible to the LLM. This lightweight approach enables the model to generate concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time without costly fine-tuning or a dedicated graph database.</description>

      <title>Costly Multidimensional Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.00487v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A screening instrument is costly if it is socially wasteful and productive otherwise. A principal screens an agent with multidimensional private information and quasilinear preferences that are additively separable across two components: a one-dimensional productive component and a multidimensional costly component. Can the principal improve upon simple one-dimensional mechanisms by also using the costly instruments? We show that if the agent has preferences between the two components that are positively correlated in a suitably defined sense, then simply screening the productive component is optimal. The result holds for general type and allocation spaces, and allows for nonlinear and interdependent valuations. We discuss applications to monopoly pricing, bundling, and labor market screening.</description>

      <title>Construct to Commitment: The Effect of Narratives on Economic Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how government-led narratives through mass media evolve from construct, a mechanism for framing expectations, into commitment, a sustainable pillar for growth. We propose the "Narratives-Construct-Commitment (NCC)" framework outlining the mechanism and institutionalization of narratives, and formalize it as a dynamic Bayesian game. Using the Innovation-Driven Development Strategy (2016) as a case study, we identify the narrative shock from high-frequency financial data and trace its impact using local projection method. By shaping expectations, credible narratives institutionalize investment incentives, channel resources into R&amp;D, and facilitate sustained improvements in total factor productivity (TFP). Our findings strive to provide insights into the New Quality Productive Forces initiative, highlighting the role of narratives in transforming vision into tangible economic growth.</description>

      <title>Stochastically Structured Reservoir Computers for Financial and Economic System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a methodology for identifying and simulating financial and economic systems using stochastically structured reservoir computers (SSRCs). The framework combines structure-preserving embeddings with graph-informed coupling matrices to model inter-agent dynamics while enhancing interpretability. A constrained optimization scheme guarantees compliance with both stochastic and structural constraints. Two empirical case studies, a nonlinear stochastic dynamic model and regional inflation network dynamics, demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in capturing complex nonlinear patterns and enabling interpretable predictive analysis under uncertainty.</description>
