      <title>Safe Human Robot Navigation in Warehouse Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) in industrial environments, particularly warehouses, has revolutionized logistics and operational efficiency. However, ensuring the safety of human workers in dynamic, shared spaces remains a critical challenge. This work proposes a novel methodology that leverages control barrier functions (CBFs) to enhance safety in warehouse navigation. By integrating learning-based CBFs with the Open Robotics Middleware Framework (OpenRMF), the system achieves adaptive and safety-enhanced controls in multi-robot, multi-agent scenarios. Experiments conducted using various robot platforms demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in avoiding static and dynamic obstacles, including human pedestrians. Our experiments evaluate different scenarios in which the number of robots, robot platforms, speed, and number of obstacles are varied, from which we achieve promising performance.</description>

      <title>Learning Generalizable Skills from Offline Multi-Task Data for Multi-Agent Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning cooperative multi-agent policy from offline multi-task data that can generalize to unseen tasks with varying numbers of agents and targets is an attractive problem in many scenarios. Although aggregating general behavior patterns among multiple tasks as skills to improve policy transfer is a promising approach, two primary challenges hinder the further advancement of skill learning in offline multi-task MARL. Firstly, extracting general cooperative behaviors from various action sequences as common skills lacks bringing cooperative temporal knowledge into them. Secondly, existing works only involve common skills and can not adaptively choose independent knowledge as task-specific skills in each task for fine-grained action execution. To tackle these challenges, we propose Hierarchical and Separate Skill Discovery (HiSSD), a novel approach for generalizable offline multi-task MARL through skill learning. HiSSD leverages a hierarchical framework that jointly learns common and task-specific skills. The common skills learn cooperative temporal knowledge and enable in-sample exploitation for offline multi-task MARL. The task-specific skills represent the priors of each task and achieve a task-guided fine-grained action execution. To verify the advancement of our method, we conduct experiments on multi-agent MuJoCo and SMAC benchmarks. After training the policy using HiSSD on offline multi-task data, the empirical results show that HiSSD assigns effective cooperative behaviors and obtains superior performance in unseen tasks.</description>

      <title>Formation Shape Control using the Gromov-Wasserstein Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a formation shape control algorithm, in the optimal control framework, for steering an initial population of agents to a desired configuration via employing the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. The underlying dynamical system is assumed to be a constrained linear system and the objective function is a sum of quadratic control-dependent stage cost and a Gromov-Wasserstein terminal cost. The inclusion of the Gromov-Wasserstein cost transforms the resulting optimal control problem into a well-known NP-hard problem, making it both numerically demanding and difficult to solve with high accuracy. Towards that end, we employ a recent semi-definite relaxation-driven technique to tackle the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. A numerical example is provided to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Static and Repeated Cooperative Games for the Optimization of the AoI in IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless sensing and the internet of things (IoT) are nowadays pervasive in 5G and beyond networks, and they are expected to play a crucial role in 6G. However, a centralized optimization of a distributed system is not always possible and cost-efficient. In this paper, we analyze a setting in which two sensors collaboratively update a common server seeking to minimize the age of information (AoI) of the latest sample of a common physical process. We consider a distributed and uncoordinated setting where each sensor lacks information about whether the other decides to update the server. This strategic setting is modeled through game theory (GT) and two games are defined: i) a static game of complete information with an incentive mechanism for cooperation, and ii) a repeated game over a finite horizon where the static game is played at each stage. We perform a mathematical analysis of the static game finding three Nash Equilibria (NEs) in pure strategies and one in mixed strategies. A numerical simulation of the repeated game is also presented and novel and valuable insight into the setting is given thanks to the definition of a new metric, the price of delayed updates (PoDU), which shows that the decentralized solution provides results close to the centralized optimum.</description>

      <title>Energy Minimization for Participatory Federated Learning in IoT Analyzed via Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet of Things requires intelligent decision making in many scenarios. To this end, resources available at the individual nodes for sensing or computing, or both, can be leveraged. This results in approaches known as participatory sensing and federated learning, respectively. We investigate the simultaneous implementation of both, through a distributed approach based on empowering local nodes with game theoretic decision making. A global objective of energy minimization is combined with the individual node's optimization of local expenditure for sensing and transmitting data over multiple learning rounds. We present extensive evaluations of this technique, based on both a theoretical framework and experiments in a simulated network scenario with real data. Such a distributed approach can reach a desired level of accuracy for federated learning without a centralized supervision of the data collector. However, depending on the weight attributed to the local costs of the single node, it may also result in a significantly high Price of Anarchy (from 1.28 onwards). Thus, we argue for the need of incentive mechanisms, possibly based on Age of Information of the single nodes.</description>

      <title>GateLens: A Reasoning-Enhanced LLM Agent for Automotive Software Release Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of software release decisions is critical, particularly in safety-critical domains like automotive systems. Precise analysis of release validation data, often presented in tabular form, plays a pivotal role in this process. However, traditional methods that rely on manual analysis of extensive test datasets and validation metrics are prone to delays and high costs. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but face challenges in analytical reasoning, contextual understanding, handling out-of-scope queries, and processing structured test data consistently; limitations that hinder their direct application in safety-critical scenarios. This paper introduces GateLens, an LLM-based tool for analyzing tabular data in the automotive domain. GateLens translates natural language queries into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions and then generates optimized Python code. It outperforms the baseline system on benchmarking datasets, achieving higher F1 scores and handling complex and ambiguous queries with greater robustness. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the RA module, with performance dropping sharply when omitted. Industrial evaluations reveal that GateLens reduces analysis time by over 80% while maintaining high accuracy and reliability. As demonstrated by presented results, GateLens achieved high performance without relying on few-shot examples, showcasing strong generalization across various query types from diverse company roles. Insights from deploying GateLens with a partner automotive company offer practical guidance for integrating AI into critical workflows such as release validation. Results show that by automating test result analysis, GateLens enables faster, more informed, and dependable release decisions, and can thus advance software scalability and reliability in automotive systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Inverse Reinforcement Learning in Real World Unstructured Pedestrian Crowds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social robot navigation in crowded public spaces such as university campuses, restaurants, grocery stores, and hospitals, is an increasingly important area of research. One of the core strategies for achieving this goal is to understand humans' intent--underlying psychological factors that govern their motion--by learning their reward functions, typically via inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Despite significant progress in IRL, learning reward functions of multiple agents simultaneously in dense unstructured pedestrian crowds has remained intractable due to the nature of the tightly coupled social interactions that occur in these scenarios \textit{e.g.} passing, intersections, swerving, weaving, etc. In this paper, we present a new multi-agent maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning algorithm for real world unstructured pedestrian crowds. Key to our approach is a simple, but effective, mathematical trick which we name the so-called tractability-rationality trade-off trick that achieves tractability at the cost of a slight reduction in accuracy. We compare our approach to the classical single-agent MaxEnt IRL as well as state-of-the-art trajectory prediction methods on several datasets including the ETH, UCY, SCAND, JRDB, and a new dataset, called Speedway, collected at a busy intersection on a University campus focusing on dense, complex agent interactions. Our key findings show that, on the dense Speedway dataset, our approach ranks 1st among top 7 baselines with &gt;2X improvement over single-agent IRL, and is competitive with state-of-the-art large transformer-based encoder-decoder models on sparser datasets such as ETH/UCY (ranks 3rd among top 7 baselines).</description>
