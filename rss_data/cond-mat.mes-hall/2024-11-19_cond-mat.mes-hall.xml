      <title>Systematic characterization of nanoscale $h$-BN quantum sensor spots created by helium-ion microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nanosized boron vacancy ($V_\mathrm{B}^-$) defect spot in hexagonal boron nitride ($h$-BN) is promising for a local magnetic field quantum sensor. One of its advantages is that a helium-ion microscope can make a spot at any location in an $h$-BN flake with nanometer accuracy. In this study, we investigate the properties of the created nanosized $V_\mathrm{B}^-$ defect spots by systematically varying three conditions: the helium-ion dose, the thickness of the $h$-BN flakes, and the substrate on which the $h$-BN flakes are attached. The physical background of the results obtained is successfully interpreted using Monte Carlo calculations. From the findings obtained here, a guideline for their optimal creation conditions is obtained to maximize its performance as a quantum sensor concerning sensitivity and localization.</description>

      <title>Three-body Fermi liquid corrections for an infinite-$U$ SU($N$) Anderson impurity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the three-body Fermi liquid effects in the SU($N$) Anderson impurity model in the strong interaction limit where the occupation number $N_d^{}$ of the impurity levels varies over the range of $0&lt;N_d^{}&lt;1$. The three-body correlation of impurity electrons contributes to the next-to-leading order terms of transport coefficients at low energies when the electron-hole symmetry, the time-reversal symmetries, or both are broken by external fields or potentials. Using the numerical renormalization group approach, we calculate the differential conductance and the nonlinear current noise through quantum dots, as well as the thermal conductivity of both quantum dots and magnetic alloys. Specifically, we focus on the SU(2) and SU(4) cases and demonstrate how the three-body contributions evolve in the limit of $U\to\infty$, across the $1/N$-filling Kondo regime and the valence fluctuation regime. Our results clarify how the three-body correlation affects low-energy transport, with a crucial dependence on the occupation number $N_d^{}$. We also show that the three-body correlation strongly couples with asymmetries in the tunnel couplings between quantum dots and reservoirs; in particular it significantly affects the nonlinear current through the quarter-filling Kondo state for $N=4$.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Chiral Majorana Edge States and Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces in Two-Dimensional Nonsymmorphic Dirac Semimetal/Superconductor Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac semimetals are renowned for the host of singular symmetry-protected band degeneracies which can give rise to other exotic phases. In this work, we consider a two-dimensional Dirac semimetal stabilized by PT symmetry and nonsymmorphic symmetries. We find that an out-of-plane Zeeman field can lift the Dirac points and transform the system into a Chern insulator with chiral edge states. By placing the nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal in proximity to an s-wave superconductor, we uncover that chiral topological superconductors with large Chern numbers can be achieved. In addition, we find that topologically-protected Bogoliubov Fermi surface can also emerge in this system, due to the coexistence of inversion symmetry and particle-hole symmetry. Notably, we find that the chiral Majorana edge state persists even when the Chern number becomes ill-defined due to the appearance of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. The impact of these Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces on the thermal Hall effects is also investigated. Our study not only identifies a class of materials capable of realizing topological Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces through conventional s-wave superconductivity, but also uncovers an exotic phase where chiral Majorana edge states and Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces coexist.</description>

      <title>Real space quantum metric of solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By acting the projector to the filled lattice eigenstates on a specific position, or applying local electron annihilation operator on the many-body ground state, one can construct a quantum state localized around a specific position in a solid. The overlap of two such local states at slightly different positions defines a quantum metric in real space, which manifests even in systems as simple as particles in a box. For continuous systems like electron gas, this metric weighted by the density gives the momentum variance of electrons, which is readily measurable by ARPES. The presence of disorder curves the real space manifold and gives rise to various differential geometrical quantities like Riemann tensor and Ricci scalar, indicating the possibility of engineering differential geometrical properties by disorder, as demonstrated by lattice models of 2D metals and topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Direct imprinting of arbitrary spin textures using programmable structured light in a semiconductor two-dimensional electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise control of spatial spin structures, such as spin helices, is critical for advancing spintronic devices, particularly in non-volatile, low-power information storage and processing. Conventional techniques, including transient spin grating spectroscopy and spatial- and time-resolved Kerr rotation microscopy, are limited by fixed optical grating periods and uniform light polarization, respectively, which constrain the flexibility of spin helix generation. Here, we introduce a novel approach utilizing structured light to directly imprint spatial spin structures in a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well. This method allows for the precise control over the wave number and configuration of the spin helices, overcoming the limitations of previous techniques. Experiments conducted using pump-probe Kerr rotation microscopy combined with a programmable spatial light modulator revealed the efficient and tunable generation of spin helices. This approach is broadly applicable not only to semiconductors but also to magnetic thin films and 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Emergence of giant spin-orbit torque in a two-dimensional hole gas on the hydrogen-terminated diamond surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) carrier systems exhibit various significant physical phenomena for electronics and spintronics, where one of the most promising traits is efficient spin-to-charge conversion stemming from their Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction. Meanwhile, a nuisance in quests of promising materials for spintronics application is that vast majority of the investigated platforms consists of rare and/or toxic elements, such as Pt and Te, which hinders progress of spin conversion physics in view of element strategy and green technology. Here, we show the emergence of giant spin-orbit torque driven by 2D hole gas at the surface of hydrogen-terminated diamond, where the constituent substances are ubiquitous elements, carbon and hydrogen. The index of its spin torque efficiency at room temperature is several times greater than that of rare metal, Pt, the benchmark system/element for spin-to-charge conversion. Our finding opens a new pathway for more sustainable spintronics and spin-orbitronics applications, with efficient spin-orbit torque employing ubiquitous non-toxic elements.</description>

      <title>Theory of three-terminal Andreev spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a concise theoretical framework for the equilibrium three-terminal Josephson effect in spin-orbit-interacting systems, inspired by recent experiments on an InAs/Al heterostructure [Phys. Rev. X 14, 031024 (2024)]. We develop an analytical model to capture the essential low-energy physics of the system and examine its potential as an Andreev spin qubit, while also reconciling some findings of Ref. [Phys. Rev. B 90, 155450 (2014)]. Our analysis of the transitions between the Andreev levels in the junction shows that, in an idealized scenario, the transition between the lowest pair of pseudo-spin-split Andreev levels is blocked by pseudo-spin conservation. We demonstrate that to operate the system as an Andreev spin qubit, leveraging the significant spin splitting observed experimentally, additional ingredients such as external magnetic filed or magnetic impurities are required. Finally, we apply our model to investigate the coupling between two such qubits, mediated by supercurrent.</description>

      <title>Observation of giant nonlinear Hall conductivity in Bernal bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a system of two-dimensional electrons, a combination of broken symmetry, interactions, and nontrivial topology can conspire to give rise to a nonlinear transport regime, where electric current density scales as the square of electric field. This regime has become a venue for exciting discoveries such as the nonlinear Hall effect and diode-like nonreciprocal transport. However, interpretation of experimental data is challenging in the nonlinear regime as DC transport is described by a rank-3 conductivity tensor with 6 free parameters. Here, we resolve this challenge by analytically solving for the nonlinear potential distribution across the disk sample for an arbitrary linear and nonlinear conductivity tensors. This allows us to unambiguously extract all components of the nonlinear tensor from experimental measurement. Using this novel tool, we identify giant nonlinear Hall effect in Bernal bilayer graphene. Our methodology provides the first systematic framework for interpreting nonlinear transport and uncovers a new route towards understanding quasi-2D materials.</description>

      <title>Visualizing incommensurate inter-valley coherent states in rhombohedral trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ABC-stacked rhombohedral graphene multilayers exhibit a wide variety of electronic ground states characterized by broken isospin symmetry and superconductivity. Recently, indirect evidence of inter-valley coherent (IVC) order has been reported in rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG), with possible implications for the origin of superconductivity. Here, we report the direct visualization of IVC order in RTG using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Tuning the chemical potential through the Van Hove singularity near the edge of the valence band, we observe a cascade of phase transitions associated with the formation of half- and quarter-metal states. IVC phases, distinguished by an enlarged real space unit cell, are directly imaged near both the high- and low-density boundaries of the half-metal phase. At high hole density, we precisely reconstruct the IVC band structure through quasiparticle interference. Intriguingly, the charge density modulations reveal a C3-symmetric incommensurate IVC order that agrees with the recent prediction of an IVC-crystal phase. Our findings demonstrate that IVC phases are a widespread symmetry-broken ground state within graphene systems.</description>

      <title>Thickness-dependent Topological Phases and Flat Bands in Rhombohedral Multilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhombohedral multilayer graphene has emerged as an extraordinary platform for investigating exotic quantum states, such as superconductivity and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects, mainly due to the existence of topological surface flatbands. Despite extensive research efforts, a systematic spectroscopic investigation on the evolution of its electronic structure from thin layers to bulk remains elusive. Using state-of-the-art angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with submicron spatial resolution, we directly probe and trace the thickness evolution of the topological electronic structures of rhombohedral multilayer graphene. As the layer number increases, the gapped subbands transform into the 3D Dirac nodes that spirals in the momentum space; while the flatbands are constantly observed around Fermi level, and eventually evolve into the topological drumhead surface states. This unique thickness-dependent topological phase transition can be well captured by the 3D generalization of 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain in thin layers, to the topological Dirac nodal spiral semimetal in the bulk limit. Our findings establish a solid foundation for exploring the exotic quantum phases with nontrivial topology and correlation effects in rhombohedral multilayer graphene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A source which generates sustained terahertz electromagnetic radiation (oscillator) controllable by an applied voltage is proposed. The structure consists of a nanocomposite slab containing metal nanorods enclosed between two graphene sheets which are electrostatically gated. The principle of its operation is based on a positive feedback which the nanorods polarization experiences from the radiation reflected by the graphene mirrors. The proposed approach can provide a microscopic source of monochromatic polarized terahertz radiation of power sufficient for biomedical and security applications.</description>

      <title>Scaled tight binding model for a two dimensional electron gas at the (001) LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The progress in the fabrication of nanoscale systems based on the two-dimensional electron gas at the interface between LaAlO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$ (LAO/STO) has created an increased demand for simulations of these nanostructures, which typically range in size from tens to hundreds of nanometers. Due to the low lattice constant of LAO/STO, approximately 0.394 nm, these calculations become extremely time-consuming. Here, we present a scaled tight-binding approximation defined on a mesh with size that can be several times larger than in the ordinary approach. The scaled model is analyzed within the context of quantum transport simulations and electronic structure calculations. Our findings demonstrate that the scaled model closely aligns with the ordinary one up to a scaling factor of 8. These results pave the way for more efficient simulations of LAO/STO nanostructures with realistic sizes relevant to experimental applications.</description>

      <title>Giant Heat Flux Effect in Non-Chiral Transmission Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11495v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of heat transport in non-chiral transmission lines (TLs) of quantum Hall edge channels coupled to Ohmic contacts (OCs), where heat transport is driven by charge fluctuations in the heat Coulomb blockade regime. This framework challenges conventional paradigms by revealing a giant heat flux effect-a significant amplification in heat transport arising from non-trivial fluctuation-dissipation relations. Through a Langevin-based approach, we derive the effective noise power in the chiral currents, which underlies this enhanced heat flux. Our findings predict clear experimental signatures unique to non-chiral TLs as well as providing insights into finite-frequency effects, showing crossovers to more conventional diffusive behavior. This work offers a perspective on feedback mechanisms in quasi-1D heat transport with implications for dissipation control in low-dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Exploiting epitaxial strained germanium for scaling low noise spin qubits at the micron-scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disorder in the heterogeneous material stack of semiconductor spin qubit systems introduces noise that compromises quantum information processing, posing a challenge to coherently control large-scale quantum devices. Here, we exploit low-disorder epitaxial strained quantum wells in Ge/SiGe heterostructures grown on Ge wafers to comprehensively probe the noise properties of complex micron-scale devices comprising of up to ten quantum dots and four rf-charge sensors arranged in a two-dimensional array. We demonstrate an average charge noise of $\sqrt{S_{0}}=0.3(1)$ $\mu\mathrm{eV}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at 1 Hz across different locations on the wafer, providing a benchmark for quantum confined holes. We then establish hole-spin qubit control in these heterostructures and extend our investigation from electrical to magnetic noise through spin echo measurements. Exploiting dynamical decoupling sequences, we quantify the power spectral density components arising from the hyperfine interaction with $^{73}$Ge spinful isotopes and identify coherence modulations associated with the interaction with the $^{29}$Si nuclear spin bath near the Ge quantum well. We estimate an integrated hyperfine noise amplitude $\sigma_f$ of 180(8) kHz from $^{73}$Ge and of 47(5) kHz from $^{29}$Si, underscoring the need for full isotopic purification of the qubit host environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stationary Dirac equation $(p\cdot\sigma)\psi=E\psi$, confined to a two-dimensional (2D) region, supports states propagating along the boundary and decaying exponentially away from the boundary. These edge states appear on the 2D surface of a 3D topological insulator, where massless fermionic quasiparticles are governed by the Dirac equation and confined by a magnetic insulator. We show how the continuous system can be simulated on a 2D square lattice, without running into the fermion-doubling obstruction. For that purpose we adapt the existing tangent fermion discretization on an unbounded lattice to account for a lattice termination that simulates the magnetic insulator interface.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Sondheimer oscillations of conductivity in thin cadmium crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11586v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decades ago, Sondheimer discovered that the electric conductivity of metallic crystals hosting ballistic electrons oscillates with magnetic field. These oscillations, periodic in magnetic field and the period proportional to the sample thickness, have been understood in a semi-classical framework. Here, we present a study of longitudinal and transverse conductivity in cadmium single crystals with thickness varying between 12.6 to 475 $\mu$m. When the magnetic field is sufficiently large or the sample sufficiently thick, the amplitude of oscillation falls off as $B^{-4}$ as previously reported. In contrast, the ten first oscillations follow a $B^{-2.5}e^{-B/B_0}$ field dependence and their amplitude is set by the quantum of conductance, the sample thickness, the magnetic length and the Fermi surface geometry. We demonstrate that they are beyond the semi-classical picture, as the exponential prefactor indicates quantum tunneling between distinct quantum states. We draw a picture of these quantum oscillations, in which the linear dispersion of the semi-Dirac band in the cadmium plays a crucial role. The oscillations arise by the intersection between the lowest Landau tube and flat toroids on the Fermi surface induced by confinement. Positive and negative corrections to semi-classical magneto-conductance can occur by alternation between destructive and constructive interference in phase-coherent helical states. The quantum limit of Sondheimer oscillations emerges as another manifestation of Aharanov-Bohm flux quantization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Valleytronics is an emerging technology exploiting the anisotropy of electron populations in multiple energy degenerate conduction band minima (valleys) in semiconductors for information storage and processing. To compete with conventional electronics, universal and fast methods for controlling and reading the valley quantum number of electrons have to be developed. Addressing the inequivalent conduction band valleys based on optical selection rules has been demonstrated in two-dimensional crystals with broken time-reversal symmetry. However, selective optical manipulation with electron populations in inequivalent valleys has not been possible in many technologically important semiconductor materials that possess multiple conduction band minima, including silicon and diamond. Here we demonstrate an ultrafast technique allowing to generate and read valley polarized population of electrons in bulk semiconductors on sub-picosecond time scales. The principle is based on unidirectional intervalley scattering of electrons accelerated by oscillating electric field of linearly polarized infrared femtosecond pulses. The degree of valley polarization is measured via polarization anisotropy of Drude absorption of a delayed infrared probe pulse allowing us to directly characterize intervalley scattering times in silicon and diamond at different temperatures. Our results pave the way towards room temperature valleytronic devices working at terahertz frequencies that will be compatible with contemporary silicon-based technology.</description>

      <title>Spin texture tunability in Mn$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$Bi$_2$Te$_4$ through varying Ge Concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-resolved dispersion dependencies for the topological insulator Mn$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$Bi$_2$Te$_4$ in the $\bar{\rm K}\bar{\Gamma}\bar{\rm K}'$ path of the Brillouin zone were studied by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy using laser radiation (Laser Spin-ARPES) with variation of the concentration of substitutional Ge atoms (x from 0.1 to 0.8) for in-plane ($s_x$) and out-of-plane ($s_z$) spin orientation. The formation of Rashba-like states is shown, which shift to lower energies with increasing Ge concentration. In the region of Ge concentrations from 50% to 75%, the contribution of these states to the formed spin-dependent dispersions becomes predominant. A pronounced in-plane ($s_y$) spin polarization, asymmetric for opposite $\pm k_\parallel$ directions, is revealed for the Dirac cone states, while the Rashba-like states exhibit a pronounced asymmetry in both in-plane ($s_y$) and out-of-plane ($s_z$) spin polarizations. Theoretical calculations confirmed the asymmetric polarization of the Rashba-like states formed in the $\bar{\rm K}\bar{\Gamma}\bar{\rm K}'$ path of the BZ, simultaneously for in-plane and out-of-plane spin orientation. Constant energy maps for Rashba-like states show a pronounced $s_z$ spin component along the $\bar{\Gamma}\bar{\rm K}$ direction, with a sign change as the contour crosses the $\bar{\Gamma}\bar{\rm M}$ direction. The observed spin polarization can influence the development of spin devices based on magnetic topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Suppressing Si Valley Excitation and Valley-Induced Spin Dephasing for Long-Distance Shuttling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scalable protocol for suppressing errors during electron spin shuttling in silicon quantum dots. The approach maps the valley Hamiltonian to a Landau-Zener problem to model the nonadiabatic dynamics in regions of small valley splitting. An optimization refines the shuttling velocity profile over a single small segment of the shuttling path. The protocol reliably returns the valley state to the ground state at the end of the shuttle, disentangling the spin and valley degrees of freedom, after which a single virtual $z$-rotation on the spin compensates its evolution during the shuttle. The time cost and complexity of the error suppression is minimal and independent of the distance over which the spin is shuttled, and the maximum velocities imposed by valley physics are found to be orders of magnitude larger than current experimentally achievable shuttling speeds. This protocol offers a chip-scale solution for high-fidelity quantum transport in silicon spin-based quantum computing devices.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field Characterization of edge currents in quantum spin Hall insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators are materials with nontrivial topological properties, characterized by helical edge currents. In 2D strips, the application of a bias voltage along the edge generates a magnetization that can be measured using quantum sensors and magnetometry techniques. In this work, we calculate the magnetic field in the vicinity of the edge and explore the potential role of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as local probes for the characterization of QSH edge states in topological insulators. We characterize the magnetic field near the edges produced by both electron currents and spin accumulation at the edge. We focus on identifying the position from the edge at which the effects of spin accumulation become detectable. We observe that a larger gap between the conduction and valence bands, along with a lower Fermi velocity, results in a stronger magnetic field, with the detectable spin accumulation being more concentrated near the edge. Conversely, a smaller gap results in a slight reduction in the magnetic field magnitude, but the field associated with spin accumulation becomes detectable further from the edge. This work provides insights that could be useful for the characterization of topological materials and the development of novel electro-optical devices.</description>

      <title>Phase-field Modelling of Anisotropic Solid-State Dewetting on Patterned Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a phase-field model for simulating the solid-state dewetting of anisotropic crystalline films on non-planar substrates. This model exploits two order parameters to trace implicitly the crystal free surface and the substrate profile in both two and three dimensions. First, we validate the model by comparing numerical simulation results for planar substrates with those obtained by a conventional phase-field approach and by assessing the convergence toward the equilibrium shape predicted by the Winterbottom construction. We then explore non-planar geometries, examining the combined effects of surface-energy anisotropies and parameters controlling the contact angle. Our findings reveal that crystalline particles on curved supports lose self-similarity and exhibit a volume-dependent apparent contact angle, with opposite trends for convex versus concave profiles. Additionally, we investigate the migration of faceted particles on substrates with variable curvature. Applying this model to experimentally relevant cases like spheroidal and pit-patterned substrates demonstrates various behaviors that could be leveraged to direct self-assembly of nanostructures, from ordered nanoparticles to interconnected networks with complex topology.</description>

      <title>A New Direction for First-Principles Device Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continued miniaturization of semiconductor devices, represented by Moore's law, has reached the atomic scale limit, requiring nanoscale quantum mechanical effects to be included in device simulations without empirical parameters. For this purpose, a method that combines density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) theory has been established as the standard approach for atomic-scale device simulations. However, the DFT-NEGF scheme has several inherent weaknesses due to the underlying Landauer or grand canonical viewpoint. To overcome these challenges, over the years, we have developed an alternative approach, the multi-space constrained-search DFT (MS-DFT) formalism. The central starting point of this development is the replacement of the Landauer picture by the multi-space excitation viewpoint or the mapping of the quantum transport process to the energy- and position-space electron excitation within a (micro)canonical ensemble device model. This change in the viewpoint leads to several fundamental advantages of MS-DFT over its DFT-NEGF counterparts, such as the variational determination of non-equilibrium total energy, the explicit extraction of quasi-Fermi level distributions, and the possibility of faithfully modeling finite 2D electrodes. In this article, we highlight the key features and applications of the MS-DFT formalism.</description>

      <title>Visualization of Mesoscopic Conductivity Fluctuations in Amorphous Semiconductor Thin-Film Transistors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge transport in amorphous semiconductors is considerably more complicated than process in crystalline materials due to abundant localized states. In addition to device-scale characterization, spatially resolved measurements are important to unveil electronic properties. Here, we report gigahertz conductivity mapping in amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (a-IGZO) thin-film transistors by microwave impedance microscopy (MIM), which probes conductivity without Schottky barrier's influence. The difference between dc and microwave conductivities reflects the efficacy of the injection barrier in an accumulation-mode transistor. The conductivity exhibits significant nanoscale inhomogeneity in the subthreshold regime, presumably due to trapping and releasing from localized states. The characteristic length scale of local fluctuations, as determined by autocorrelation analysis, is about 200 nm. Using random-barrier model, we can simulate the spatial variation of potential landscape, which underlies the mesoscopic conductivity distribution. Our work provides an intuitive way to understand the charge transport mechanism in amorphous semiconductors at microscopic level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bare silicon dimers on hydrogen-terminated Si(100) have two dangling bonds. These are atomically localized regions of high state density near to and within the bulk silicon band gap. We studied bare silicon dimers as monomeric units. Silicon dimer wires are much more stable than wires composed of individual dangling bonds. Dimer wires composed of 1 to 5 dimers were intentionally fabricated and characterised by STM techniques combined with density functional theory to provide detailed insights into geometric and electronic structure. Structural and dynamic qualities displayed by short wires were shown to be similar to the characteristics of a relatively long 37 dimer wire. Rather than adding two states into the band gap, experiment and theory reveal that each dimer adds one empty state into the gap and one filled state into the valence bands. Coupling among these states provides a conduction pathway with small bulk coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The photodynamics of diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers limits their performance in many quantum technologies. Quenching of photoluminescence, which degrades NV readout, is commonly ascribed to a dark state that is not fully understood. Using a nanoscale cavity to generate intense infrared fields that quench NV emission nonlinearly with field intensity, we show that the dark state is accessed by two-photon pumping into the $^4A_2$ quartet state of the neutrally charged NV (NV$^0$). We constrain this state's energy relative to the NV$^0$ ground-state ($^2E$) to $&gt;0.58$\,eV and the recombination energy threshold to the NV$^-$ ground state ($^3A_2$) to $&lt;2.01$ eV. Furthermore, we show that accessing this state allows sensing of local infrared fields. This new understanding will allow predictions of the limits of NV technologies reliant upon intense fields, including levitated systems, spin--optomechanical devices, and absorption--based magnetometers.</description>

      <title>Layer thickness and substrate effects on superconductivity in epitaxial FeSe films on BLG/SiC(0001)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The layered nature and simple structure of FeSe reveal this iron-based superconductor as a unique building block for the design of artificial heterostructure materials. While superconductivity develops in ultrathin films of FeSe on SrTiO3 substrates, it remains unclear whether it can be developed on more chemically inert, layered materials such as graphene. Here, we report on the characterization of the structural, chemical and electronic properties of few-layer FeSe on bilayer graphene grown on SiC(0001) using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). STM imaging of our FeSe films with thicknesses up to three layers exhibit the tetragonal crystal structure of bulk FeSe, which is supported by XPS spectra consistent with the FeSe bulk counterpart. While our STS measurements at 340 mK reveal a metallic character for few-layer FeSe on BLG/SiC(0001), they show an absence of superconductivity, as the low-lying electronic structure exhibits a spatially anisotropic dip-like feature robust against magnetic fields. Superconductivity in FeSe/BLG/SiC(0001), however, emerges for thicker films with a transition temperature of 6 K. Our results underscore the significance of the substrate as key factor driving the suppression superconductivity in FeSe in the 2D limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interference under chiral-mirror-like symmetry and propose its application to non-adiabatic topological transport of edge states. Protected by this symmetry, complete destructive interference emerges and can be characterized through occupation probability. This symmetry-protected LZSM interference enables state transitions to be achieved within remarkably short time scales. To demonstrate our mechanism, we provide two distinctive two-level systems as examples and survey them in detail. By tuning evolution speed or increasing holding time, the complete destructive interferences are observed. Furthermore, we make use of this mechanism for topological edge states of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain by taking them as an isolated two-level system. Through carefully designed time sequences, we construct symmetry-protected LZSM interference of topological edge states, enabling non-adiabatic topological transport. Our work unveils an alternative way to study quantum control, quantum state transfer, and quantum communication via non-adiabatic topological transport.</description>

      <title>Prolonging Carrier Lifetime in P-type 4H-SiC Epilayer by Thermal Oxidation and Hydrogen Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A minority carrier lifetime of 25.46 $\mu$s in a P-type 4H-SiC epilayer has been attained through sequential thermal oxidation and hydrogen annealing. Thermal oxidation can enhance the minority carrier lifetime in the 4H-SiC epilayer by reducing carbon vacancies. However, this process also generates carbon clusters with limited diffusivity and contributes to the enlargement of surface pits on the 4H-SiC. High-temperature hydrogen annealing effectively reduces stacking fault and dislocation density. Moreover, electron spin resonance analysis indicates a significant reduction in carbon vacancy defects after hydrogen annealing. The mechanisms of the elimination of carbon vacancies by hydrogen annealing include the decomposition of carbon clusters formed during thermal oxidation and the low-pressure selective etching by hydrogen, which increases the carbon content on the 4H-SiC surface and facilitates carbon diffusion. Consequently, the combination of thermal oxidation and hydrogen annealing eliminates carbon vacancies more effectively, substantially enhancing the minority carrier lifetime in P-type 4H-SiC. This improvement is advantageous for the application of high-voltage SiC bipolar devices.</description>

      <title>The Mechanism of Spin-Phonon Relaxation in Endohedral Metallofullene Single Molecule Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the first-ever investigation of spin-phonon coupling mechanisms in fullerene-based single-molecule magnets (SMMs) using ab initio CASSCF combined with DFT calculations. While lanthanide-based SMMs, particularly those with DyIII ions, are known for their impressive blocking temperatures and relaxation barriers, endohedral metallofullerene (EMFs) offer a unique platform for housing low-coordinated lanthanides within rigid carbon cages. We have explored the spin dynamics of in DyScS@C82 exhibiting among the highest blocking temperature (TB) reported. Through our computational analysis, we reveal that while the fullerene cage enhances crystal field splitting and provides structural stability without significantly contributing to spin-relaxation-driving low-energy phonons, the internal ionic motion emerges as the primary factor controlling spin relaxation and limiting blocking temperature. This computational investigation into the spin dynamics of EMF-based SMMs provides key insights into their magnetic behaviour for the first time an</description>

      <title>Effect of Hubbard U corrections on the electronic and magnetic properties of 2D materials: A high-throughput study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic investigation of the role of Hubbard U corrections in electronic structure calculations of two-dimensional (2D) materials containing 3d transition metals. Specifically, we use density functional theory (DFT) with the PBE and PBE+U approximations to calculate the crystal structure, band gaps, and magnetic parameters of 638 monolayers. Based on a comprehensive comparison to experiments we first establish that inclusion of the U correction worsens the accuracy for the lattice constant. Consequently, PBE structures are used for subsequent property evaluations. The band gaps show significant dependence on the U-parameter. In particular, for 134 (21%) of the materials the U parameter leads to a metal-insulator transition. For the magnetic materials we calculate the magnetic moment, magnetic exchange coupling, and magnetic anisotropy parameters. In contrast to the band gaps, the size of the magnetic moments shows only weak dependence on U. Both the exchange energies and magnetic anisotropy parameters are systematically reduced by the U correction. On this basis we conclude that the Hubbard U correction will lead to lower predicted Curie temperatures in 2D materials. All the calculated properties are available in the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB).</description>

      <title>Twisted Type-II Rashba Homobilayer: A Platform for Tunable Topological Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of topological flat bands in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers and multilayer graphene has sparked significant research interest. We propose a new platform for realizing tunable topological moire flat bands: twisted type-II Rashba homobilayers. The interplay between Rashba spin-orbit coupling and interlayer interactions generates an effective pseudo-antiferromagnetic field, opening a gap within the Dirac cone with non-zero Berry curvature. Using twisted BiTeI bilayers as an example, we predict the emergence of flat topological bands with a remarkably narrow bandwidth (below 20 meV). Notably, the system undergoes a transition from a valley Hall insulator to a quantum spin Hall insulator as the twisting angle increases. This transition arises from a competition between the twisting-driven effective spin-orbit coupling and sublattice onsite energies presented in type-II Rashba moir\'e structures. The high tunability of Rashba materials in terms of the spin-orbit coupling strength, interlayer interaction, and twisting angle expands the range of materials suitable for realizing and manipulating correlated topological properties.</description>

      <title>Picocavity-enhanced Raman spectroscopy of physisorbed H2 and D2 molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) of H2 and D2 molecules physisorbed within a plasmonic picocavity at a cryogenic temperature (10 K). The intense Raman peaks resulting from the rotational and vibrational transitions are observed at sub-nanometer gap distances of the junction formed by a Ag tip and Ag(111) surface. We clarify that the predominant contribution of the electromagnetic field enhancement of the picocavity to the detection of a single hydrogen molecule. The gap-distance dependent TERS reveals not only the evolution of the picocavity field, but also the interaction between the molecule and tip/surface, which exhibit nontrivial isotope effects. A significant red-shift and peak broadening of the H-H stretching as the gap distance decreases, while the D-D stretching mode is unaffected. A combination of density functional theory and reduced-dimension models reveals that a distinct anharmonicity in the mode potential of H2 is one cause of the anomalous red-shift, whereas D2 has less anharmonicity due to the geometric isotope effect.</description>

      <title>Thermal Activation Signatures of the Anderson Insulator and the Wigner Solid forming near $\nu=1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When interactions overcome disorder, integer quantum Hall plateaus support topological phases with different bulk insulators. In the center of the $\nu=1$ plateau the bulk is an Anderson-type insulator, while in the flanks of the plateau the bulk is the integer quantum Hall Wigner solid. We find that the activation energy along the $\nu=1$ plateau exhibits a very dramatic non-monotonic dependence on the magnetic field, a dependence that is strongly correlated with the stability regions of the two phases. Furthermore, the activation energy has an unexpected minimum at the boundary between the Anderson insulator and the Wigner solid. Our findings constrain the theory of the integer quantum Hall Wigner solid, determine its thermodynamic properties, and reveal novel behavior at the boundary between the Anderson insulator and the Wigner solid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interferometry has underpinned a century of discoveries, ranging from the disproval of the ether theory to the detection of gravitational waves, offering insights into wave dynamics with unrivalled precision through the measurement of phase relationships. In electronics, phase-sensitive measurements can probe the nature of transmissive topological and quantum states, but are only possible using complex device structures in magnetic fields. Here we demonstrate electronic interferometry in a single-molecule device through the study of non-equilibrium Fano resonances. We show the phase difference between an electronic orbital and a coupled Fabry-Perot resonance are tuneable through electric fields, and consequently it is possible to read out quantum information in the smallest devices, offering new avenues for the coherent manipulation down to single molecules.</description>

      <title>Toward a Better Understanding of the Photothermal Heating of High-Entropy-Alloy Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical approach, for the first time, to investigate optical and photothermal properties of high-entropy alloy nanoparticles with a focus on FeCoNi-based alloys. We systematically analyze the absorption spectra of spherical nanoparticles composed of pure metals and alloys in various surrounding media. Through comparison with experimental data, we select appropriate dielectric data for the constituent elements to accurately compute absorption spectra for FeCoNi-based high-entropy-alloy nanoparticles. Then, we predict the temperature rise over time within a substrate comprised of Fe nanoparticles exposed to solar irradiation and find quantitative agreement with experimental data for FeCoNi nanoparticles reported in previous studies. The striking similarity between the optical and photothermal behaviors of FeCoNi nanoparticles and their pure iron counterparts suggests that iron nanoparticles can effectively serve as a model for understanding the optical and thermal response of FeCoNi-based alloy nanoparticles. These findings offer a simplified approach for theoretical modeling of complex high-entropy alloys and provide valuable insights into their nanoscale optical behavior.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic properties of bridging transitions in sinusoidally-shaped slits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study bridging transitions that emerge between two sinusoidally-shaped walls of amplitude $A$, wavenumber $k$, and mean separation $L$. The focus is on weakly corrugated walls to examine the properties of bridging transitions in the limit when the walls become flat. The reduction of walls roughness can be achieved in two ways which we show differ qualitatively: a) By decreasing $k$, (i.e., by increasing the system wavelength), which induces a continuous phenomenon associated with the growth of bridging films concentrated near the system necks, the thickness of with the thickness of these films diverging as $\sim k^{-2/3}$ in the limit of $k\to0$. Simultaneously, the location of the transition approaches that of capillary condensation in an infinite planar slit of an appropriate width as $\sim k^{2/3}$; b) in contrast, the limit of vanishing walls roughness by reducing $A$ cannot be considered in this context, as there exists a minimal value $A_{\rm min}(k,L)$ of the amplitude below which bridging transition does not occur. On the other hand, for amplitudes $A&gt;A_{\rm min}(k,L)$, the bridging transition always precedes global condensation in the system. These predictions, including the scaling property $A_{\rm min}\propto kL^2$, are verified numerically using density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Strongly Magnetically Tuned Exciton-Polaritons in van der Waals CrSBr</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnetic semiconductors offer an ideal platform to achieve exciton-polaritons correlated with magnetic orders for developing solid-state quantum, spintronic, and photonic devices. However, in the as-demonstrated systems, the coupling strength, light velocity, and effective mass of exciton-polaritons are almost inert to the external magnetic field. Here, we report the experimental observation of giant magnetic tuning of B exciton-polaritons in vdW magnet CrSBr crystals. The Rabi splitting energy is tuned up to 100 meV within a moderate 0.45 T in-plane magnetic field due to changes in excitonic states during the spin transitions. Besides, the light velocity and effective mass of exciton-polaritons are tuned by 10.3% and 26.1% below 100 meV of exciton energy. Further, the strong coupling persists at room temperature, controlled by temperature-tailored exciton-magnon and exciton-phonon coupling. These results advance the development of on-demand strong coupling systems for spin-correlated quantum optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11585v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-Dirac fermions are massless in one direction and massive in the perpendicular directions. Such quasiparticles have been proposed in various contexts in condensed matter. Using first principles calculations, we identify a pair of semi-Dirac bands in the electronic structure of hexagonal close-packed (hcp) cadmium, which keep their linear out-of-plane and quadratic inplane dispersions up to the Fermi level. We demonstrate that the dichotomy between the linear and quadratic dispersions is driven by an orientation-sensitive hybridization between the $s$ and $p_z$ orbitals. The upper semi-Dirac band produces a lens-shaped nonellipsoidal Fermi sheet whose cross-section area has a $k$-dependence that is in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured period of Sondheimer oscillations.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial growth of mono- and (twisted) multilayer graphene on SiC(0001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To take full advantage of twisted bilayers of graphene or other two-dimensional materials, it is essential to precisely control the twist angle between the stacked layers, as this parameter determines the properties of the heterostructure. In this context, a growth routine using borazine as a surfactant molecule on SiC(0001) surfaces has been reported, leading to the formation of high-quality epitaxial graphene layers that are unconventionally oriented, i.e., aligned with the substrate lattice (G-$R0^\circ$) [Bocquet et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 106102 (2020)]. Since the G-$R0^\circ$ layer sits on a buffer layer, also known as zeroth-layer graphene (ZLG), which is rotated $30^\circ$ with respect to the SiC substrate and still covalently bonded to it, decoupling the ZLG-$R30^\circ$ from the substrate can lead to high-quality twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG). Here we report the decoupling of ZLG-$R30^\circ$ by increasing the temperature during annealing in a borazine atmosphere. While this converts ZLG-$R30^\circ$ to G-$R30^\circ$ and thus produces tBLG, the growth process at elevated temperature is no longer self-limiting, so that the surface is covered by a patchwork of graphene multilayers of different thicknesses. We find a 20% coverage of tBLG on ZLG, while on the rest of the surface tBLG sits on one or more additional graphene layers. In order to achieve complete coverage with tBLG only, alternative ways of decoupling the ZLG, e.g., by intercalation with suitable atoms, may be advantageous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of correlated emission lasing in a coherently driven single quantum dot coupled to a bimodal photonic crystal cavity, utilizing a master equation to describe the system dynamics. To account for exciton-phonon interactions, we incorporate a non-perturbative approach through a polaron transformed master equation. By analyzing fluctuations in the Hermitian operators associated with relative and average phase, we derive a Fokker-Planck equation to assess phase drift and diffusion coefficients, demonstrating that correlated emission suppresses quantum noise in the presence of exciton-phonon interaction at low temperature. Additionally, we calculate the single and two-photon excess emission rates (difference between emission and absorption rates) into the cavity modes and explore the generation of continuous-variable entanglement between these modes.</description>

      <title>Role of bias and tunneling asymmetries in nonlinear Fermi-liquid transport through an SU($N$) quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01162v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how bias and tunneling asymmetries affect nonlinear current through a quantum dot with $N$ discrete levels in the Fermi liquid regime, using an exact low-energy expansion of the current derived up to terms of order $V^3$ with respect to the bias voltage. The expansion coefficients are described in terms of the phase shift, the linear susceptibilities, and the three-body correlation functions, defined with respect to the equilibrium ground state of the Anderson impurity model. In particular, the three-body correlations play an essential role in the order $V^3$ term, and their coupling to the nonlinear current depends crucially on the bias and tunnel asymmetries. The number of independent components of the three-body correlation functions increases with $N$ the internal degrees of the quantum dots, and it gives a variety in the low-energy transport. We calculate the correlation functions over a wide range of electron fillings of the Anderson impurity model with the SU($N$) internal symmetry, using the numerical renormalization group. We find that the order $V^3$ nonlinear current through the SU($N$) Kondo state, which occurs at electron fillings of $1$ and $N-1$ for strong Coulomb interactions, significantly varies with the three-body contributions as tunnel asymmetries increase. Furthermore, in the valence fluctuation regime toward the empty or fully occupied impurity state, a sharp peak emerges in the coefficient of $V^3$ current in the case at which bias and tunneling asymmetries cooperatively enhance the charge transfer from one of the electrodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04631v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum information transfer is fundamental for scalable quantum computing in any potential platform and architecture. Hole spin qubits, owing to their intrinsic spin-orbit interaction (SOI), promise fast quantum operations which are fundamental for the implementation of quantum gates. Yet, the influence of SOI in quantum transfer protocols remains an open question. Here, we investigate flying spin qubits mediated by SOI, using shortcuts to adiabaticity protocols, i.e., the long-range transfer of spin qubits and the quantum distribution of entangled pairs in semiconductor quantum dot arrays. We show that electric field manipulation allows dynamical control of the SOI, enabling simultaneously the implementation of quantum gates during the transfer, with the potential to significantly accelerate quantum algorithms. By harnessing the ability to perform quantum gates in parallel with the transfer, we implement dynamical decoupling schemes to focus and preserve the spin state, leading to higher transfer fidelity.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear thermoelectric probes of anomalous electron lifetimes in topological Fermi liquids</title>

Abstract: In two-dimensional Fermi liquids (FLs), odd-parity Fermi surface deformations have anomalously slow relaxation rates that are suppressed as $T^4$ with temperature $T$, distinct from the standard FL $T^2$ scaling. We demonstrate here that these long-lived modes, which are often hidden in linear response, have a significant impact on nonlinear transport by establishing a direct proportionality of nonlinear thermoelectric currents to the anomalously large relaxation time. These currents exist in topological time-reversal invariant FLs, and their magnitude is characterized by topological heat capacitance terms that we refer to as the Berry curvature capacity and the velocity-curvature capacity. We quantify the effect in bismuth telluride, which is an efficient thermoelectric and a topological insulator with a hexagonal Fermi surface. The proposed field-induced thermoelectric currents are well within the range of current experiments. Our findings demonstrate the potential to explore topological and many-body effects in FLs through the nonlinear thermoelectric response, urging further experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Dichroic cavity mode splitting and lifetimes from interactions with a ferromagnetic metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01929v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of ferromagnetic metals (FM) on the circularly polarized modes of an electromagnetic cavity and show that broken time-reversal symmetry leads to a dichroic response of the cavity modes. With one spin-split band, the Zeeman coupling between the FM electrons and cavity modes leads to an anticrossing for mode frequencies comparable to the spin splitting. However, this is only the case for one of the circularly polarized modes, while the other is unaffected by the FM, allowing for the determination of the spin-splitting of the FM using polarization-dependent transmission experiments. Moreover, we show that for two spin-split bands, also the lifetimes of the cavity modes display a polarization-dependent response. The change in photon lifetimes can be understood as a suppression due to level attraction with a continuum of Stoner modes with the same wavevector. The reduced lifetime of modes of only one polarization could potentially be used to engineer and control circularly polarized cavities.</description>

      <title>Crystal-field effects in the formation of Wigner-molecule supercrystals in moir\'e TMD superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For moir\'e bilayer TMD superlattices, full-configuration-interaction (FCI) calculations are presented that take into account both the intra-moir\'e-quantum-dot (MQD) charge-carrier Coulombic interactions, as well as the crystal-field effect from the surrounding moir\'e pockets (inter-moir\'e-QD interactions). The effective computational embedding strategy introduced here allows for an FCI methodogy that enables the complete interpretation of the counterintuitive experimental observations reported recently in the context of moir\'e TMD superlattices at integer fillings $\nu=2$ and 4. Two novel states of matter are reported: (i) a genuinely quantum-mechanical supercrystal of $sliding$ Wigner molecules (WMs) for unstrained moir\'e TMD materials (when the crystal field is commensurate with the trilobal symmetry of the confining potential in each embedded MQD) and (ii) a supercrystal of $pinned$ Wigner molecules when the crystal field is incommensurate with the trilobal symmetry or straining of the whole material is involved. The case of $\nu=3$ is an exception, in that even the unstrained case is associated with a supercrystal of pinned WMs, which is due to the congruence of intrinsic (that of the WM) and external (that of the confining potential of the MQD) $C_3$ point-group symmetries. Furthermore, it is shown that the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approach fails to describe the supercrystal of sliding WMs in the unstrained case, providing a qualitative agreement only in the case of a supercrystal of pinned WMs</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric cooling of a finite reservoir coupled to a quantum dot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate non-equilibrium transport of charge and heat through an interacting quantum dot coupled to a finite electron reservoir. Both the quantum dot and the finite reservoir are coupled to conventional electric contacts, i.e., infinite electron reservoirs, between which a bias voltage can be applied. We develop a phenomenological description of the system, combining a rate equation for transport through the quantum dot with standard linear response expressions for transport between the finite and infinite reservoirs. The finite reservoir is assumed to be in a quasi-equilibrium state with time-dependent chemical potential and temperature which we solve for self-consistently. We show that the finite reservoir can have a large impact on the stationary state transport properties, including a shift and broadening of the Coulomb diamond edges. We also demonstrate that there is a region around the conductance lines where a heat current flows out of the finite reservoir. Our results reveal the dependence of the temperature that can be reached by this thermoelectric cooling on the system parameters, in particular the coupling between the finite and infinite reservoirs and additional heat currents induced by electron-phonon couplings, and can thus serve as a guide to experiments on quantum dot-enabled thermoelectric cooling of finite electron reservoirs. Finally, we study the full dynamics of the system, with a particular focus on the timescales involved in the thermoelectric cooling.</description>

      <title>Linear response in planar Hall and thermal Hall setups for Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of the linear-response tensors in planar Hall and planar thermal Hall setups, where we subject a Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (RSW) semimetal to the combined influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (and/or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and a weak (i.e., non-quantizing) magnetic field $\mathbf B $. For computing the in-plane transport components, we have added an elastic deformation which gives rise to a chirality-dependent effective magnetic field $ \mathbf B^{\text{tot}} = \mathbf B + \chi \, \mathbf B_5 $, where $\chi $ is the chirality of an RSW node. We have included the effects of orbital magnetic moment (OMM), in conjunction with the Berry curvature (BC), both of which appear as a consequence of nontrivial topology of the bandstructure. Due to the presence of four bands, RSW semimetals provide a richer structure for obtaining the linear-response coefficients, compared to the Weyl semimetals. In particular, we have found that the OMM-contributed terms may oppose or add up to the BC-only parts, depending on which band we are considering. Last, but not the least, we have determined the out-of-plane response comprising the intrinsic anomalous-Hall and the Lorentz-force-contributed currents, whose nature corroborates the findings of some recent experimental results.</description>

      <title>Adaptive AI-Driven Material Synthesis: Towards Autonomous 2D Materials Growth</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials are poised to revolutionize current solid-state technology with their extraordinary properties. Yet, the primary challenge remains their scalable production. While there have been significant advancements, much of the scientific progress has depended on the exfoliation of materials, a method that poses severe challenges for large-scale applications. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in materials science, innovative synthesis methodologies are now on the horizon. This study explores the forefront of autonomous materials synthesis using an artificial neural network (ANN) trained by evolutionary methods, focusing on the efficient production of graphene. Our approach demonstrates that a neural network can iteratively and autonomously learn a time-dependent protocol for the efficient growth of graphene, without requiring pretraining on what constitutes an effective recipe. Evaluation criteria are based on the proximity of the Raman signature to that of monolayer graphene: higher scores are granted to outcomes whose spectrum more closely resembles that of an ideal continuous monolayer structure. This feedback mechanism allows for iterative refinement of the ANN's time-dependent synthesis protocols, progressively improving sample quality. Through the advancement and application of AI methodologies, this work makes a substantial contribution to the field of materials engineering, fostering a new era of innovation and efficiency in the synthesis process.</description>

      <title>Nonconserved Density Accumulations in Orbital Hall Transport: Insights from Linear Response Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a linear response theory for stationary density accumulations in anomalous transport phenomena, such as the orbital Hall effect, where the transported density is odd under time reversal and the underlying charge is not conserved. Our framework applies to both metals and insulators, topologically trivial or nontrivial, and distinguishes between contributions from bulk and edge states, as well as undergap and dissipative currents. In time-reversal invariant systems, we prove a microscopic reciprocity theorem showing that only dissipative currents at the Fermi level contribute to density accumulation, while undergap currents do not. In contrast, in non-time-reversal invariant systems, non-dissipative density accumulations, such as magnetoelectric polarization, can appear in both the bulk and edges. Importantly, we find that the net density accumulation does not always vanish, pointing to a global non-conservation that implies the existence of a non-vanishing integrated ``net torque'' in addition to a ``distributed torque'', which has zero spatial average. We show that the distributed torque can be absorbed in the divergence of a redefined current that satisfies Onsager reciprocity, while the net torque must be explicitly accounted for. Finally, we apply our theory to two-dimensional models with edge terminations.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast light-driven optical rotation and hidden orders in bulk WSe$_2$</title>

Abstract: Single-layer semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides, lacking point inversion symmetry, provide an efficient platform for valleytronics, where the electronic, magnetic, valley and lattice degrees of freedom can be selectively manipulated by using polarized light. This task is however thought to be limited in parent bulk compounds where the point inversion symmetry is restored. Exploiting the underlying quantum physics in bulk materials is thus one of the biggest paradigmatic challenges. Here we show that a sizable optical Kerr rotation can be efficiently generated in a wide energy range on ultrafast timescales in bulk WSe$_2$, by means of circularly-polarized light. We rationalize these findings as a result of the hidden spin/layer/valley quantum entanglement. The spectral analysis reveals clear features at the three characteristic frequencies corresponding to the A-, B- and C-exciton edges. The origin and the relative sign of all these features is shown to stem from the selective Pauli blocking of intralayer and interlayer optical transitions. The long lifetime of the broadband Kerr response ($\tau \sim 500$ fs) provides a strong indication that coupled photo-induced electron and hole densities survive in bulk compounds longer than previously expected. The present report demonstrates that a hidden quantum entanglement is operative also in bulk centrosymmetric layered materials, opening the way for an effective exploitation of bulk WSe$_2$ in optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moire materials like twisted bilayer graphene have emerged as a rich playground of strongly correlated physics, where the effect of interactions can be drastically enhanced by tuning the non-interacting density of states via twist angle. A key feature of bilayer graphene at small twist angles is that the two valleys of graphene are effectively decoupled at the non-interacting level, leading to an emergent U(1) symmetry corresponding to the conservation of valley-charge. Theoretical studies invariably find that short-ranged interactions tend to break this symmetry, leading to inter-valley coherence (IVC). Here, I propose an experimental signature of IVC order by coupling with a closely related system where valley-mixing is guaranteed - the pentagonal disclinations of graphene. Such disclinations are naturally found in fullerenes. The tunneling current between twisted bilayer graphene and an appropriately oriented large buckyball has a sharp signature of the onset of IVC order. Successfully integrating these fullerenes in a scanning tunneling microscope would allow spatial resolution of the IVC order parameter on a sub-moire scale. Experimentally constraining the broken symmetries and order parameters in the multitude of emerging correlated insulators is a crucial first step to understanding the superconductivity that develops on doping these exotic `normal' states.</description>

      <title>Magnon spectrum of altermagnets beyond linear spin wave theory: Magnon-magnon interactions via time-dependent matrix product states vs. atomistic spin dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy-momentum dispersion of magnons, as collective low-energy excitations of magnetic material, is computed from an effective quantum spin Hamiltonian but simplified via linearized Holstein-Primakoff transformations to describe noninteracting magnons. The dispersion produced by such linear spin wave theory (LSWT) is then plotted as ``sharp bands'' of infinitely long-lived quasiparticles. However, magnons are prone to many-body interactions with other quasiparticles -- such as electrons, phonons or other magnons -- which can lead to shifting (i.e., band renormalization) and broadening of ``sharp bands'' as the signature of finite quasiparticle lifetime. The magnon-magnon interactions can be particularly important in antiferromagnets (AFs), and, therefore, possibly in newly classified altermagnets sharing many features of collinear AFs. Here, we employ nonperturbative quantum many-body calculations, via time-dependent matrix product states (TDMPS), to obtain magnon spectral function for RuO$_2$ altermagnet whose effective quantum spin Hamiltonian is put onto 4-leg cylinder. Its upper band is shifted away from upper ``sharp band'' of LSWT, as well as broadened, which is explained as the consequence of {\em hybridization} of the latter with three-magnon continuum. This implies that two-magnon Raman scattering spectra {\em cannot} be computed from LSWT bands, which offers a litmus test for the relevance of magnon-magnon interactions. Finally, we employ atomistic spin dynamics (ASD) simulations, based on classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, to obtain magnon spectrum at finite temperature and/or at a fraction of the cost of TDMPS calculations. Despite including magnon-magnon interactions via nonlinearity of LLG equation, ASD simulations {\em cannot} match the TDMPS-computed magnon spectrum, thereby signaling {\em nonclassical} effects harbored by AFs and altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Mixed Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry in mixed quantum states can manifest in two distinct forms: strong symmetry, where each individual pure state in the quantum ensemble is symmetric with the same charge, and weak symmetry, which applies only to the entire ensemble. This paper explores a novel type of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) where a strong symmetry is broken to a weak one. While the SSB of a weak symmetry is measured by the long-ranged two-point correlation function, the strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) is measured by the fidelity correlator. We prove that SW-SSB is a universal property of mixed-state quantum phases, in the sense that the phenomenon of SW-SSB is robust against symmetric low-depth local quantum channels. We also show that the symmetry breaking is "spontaneous" in the sense that the effect of a local symmetry-breaking measurement cannot be recovered locally. We argue that a thermal state at a nonzero temperature in the canonical ensemble (with fixed symmetry charge) should have spontaneously broken strong symmetry. Additionally, we study non-thermal scenarios where decoherence induces SW-SSB, leading to phase transitions described by classical statistical models with bond randomness. In particular, the SW-SSB transition of a decohered Ising model can be viewed as the "ungauged" version of the celebrated toric code decodability transition. We confirm that, in the decohered Ising model, the SW-SSB transition defined by the fidelity correlator is the only physical transition in terms of channel recoverability. We also comment on other (inequivalent) definitions of SW-SSB, through correlation functions with higher Renyi indices.</description>

      <title>Types of Size-Dependent Melting in Fe Nanoclusters: a Molecular Dynamics Study</title>

Abstract: Metallic nanoclusters are of interest in many fields because of their size-dependent catalytic activity. This activity can, in part, be influenced by their melting properties. In this work, the melting phase transitions of $Fe_{n}$ nanoclusters with $n \leq 100$ atoms were investigated using classical many-body molecular dynamics simulations. Adding a single atom to many cluster sizes induced strong variations in surface and core melting points, and cluster energetics. Clusters with size-dependent melting behavior were classified into 3 distinct cluster types: closed-shell, near-closed-shell, and far-from-closed-shell clusters. For small clusters, near-closed-shell clusters had very low surface melting points and very high melting points (heat capacity maximum). Cluster sizes with symmetric closed shells and near-closed shells almost always had first-order-like phase transitions. For intermediate cluster sizes, far-from-closed-shell clusters often exhibited second-order-like phase transitions due to geometric factors. Larger cluster sizes began to favor bcc lattice structures. Variations in the surface and core melting behavior of neighboring cluster sizes may have implications for catalytic systems such as the growth of single-wall carbon nanotubes.</description>

      <title>Cooperative non-reciprocal emission and quantum sensing of symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal propagation of energy and information is fundamental to a wide range of quantum technology applications. In this work, we explore the quantum many-body dynamics of a qubit ensemble coupled to a shared bath that mediates coherent and dissipative inter-qubit interactions with both symmetric and anti-symmetric components. We find that the interplay between anti-symmetric (symmetric) coherent and symmetric (anti-symmetric) dissipative interactions results in non-reciprocal couplings, which, in turn, generate a spatially asymmetric emission pattern. We demonstrate that this pattern arises from non-reciprocal interactions coupling different quantum many-body states within a specific excitation manifold. Focusing on solid-state baths, we show that their lack of time-reversal and inversion symmetry is a key ingredient for generating non-reciprocal dynamics in the qubit ensemble. With the plethora of quantum materials that exhibit this symmetry breaking at equilibrium, our approach paves the way for realizing cooperative non-reciprocal transport in qubit ensembles without requiring time-modulated external drives or complex engineering. Using an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers coupled to a generic non-centrosymmetric ferromagnetic bath as a concrete example, we demonstrate that our predictions can be tested in near-future experiments. As the spatial asymmetry in the relaxation dynamics of the qubit ensemble is a direct probe of symmetry breaking in the solid-state bath, our work also opens the door to developing model-agnostic quantum sensing schemes capable of detecting bath properties invisible to current state-of-the-art protocols, which operate solid-state defects as single-qubit sensors.</description>

Abstract: We synthesized the powder of molybdenum-disulfide-oxide nanoflowers consisting of self-assembled 10-20 nm thin nanoflakes by reaction of (NH4)6Mo7O24 with thiourea in aqueous solution at temperatures from 130oC to 180oC in hydrothermal conditions. The detailed analysis of the XPS, EDX and Raman spectroscopy results reveal the significant amount of the molybdenum oxides, sulfides and sulfates in the molybdenum disulfide nanoflakes, which allows to consider the "effective" formulae MoSxOy for their chemical composition. The MoSxOy nanoflakes reveal unusual electric transport features interesting for material science and promising for applications. The chemical composition and microstructure of the nanoflakes, which are determined by the temperature of synthesis, is shown to be responsible for the electro-conduction mechanism. Namely, the current-voltage characteristics (I-V curves) grow monotonically with the applied voltage for the samples, synthesized at the temperatures T_s&lt;&lt;150oC and T_s&gt;&gt;150oC, being non-ohmic and hysteretic at lower voltages and becoming close to the ohmic at higher voltages. The I-V curves acquire N-like shape with a strongly pronounced negative differential resistivity part at T_s=150oC. Both with and without N-shape, the I-V curves manifest hysteretic behavior with the difference between increasing and decreasing voltage sweeps, and the hysteresis loop parameters are determined by the temperature of synthesis. Important, that the studied nanoflakes manifest very long living deep charging and discharging after the voltage switching "on" and "off".Considering that the presence of oxygen non-stoichiometry and bending can create strong flexo-chemical strains in the nanoflakes, we proposed the flexo-chemical model of the polar and electro-transport properties of the pressed MoSxOy nanoflakes, which describes the observed I-V curves.</description>
