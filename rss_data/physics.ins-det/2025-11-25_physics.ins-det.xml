      <title>WavePID: Studies of DOM-level waveform timing for track vs. cascade discrimination in IceCube at 5-100 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer Cherenkov detector embedded in the Antarctic ice at the South Pole. Its densely instrumented sub-array and dedicated low-energy analyses provide sensitivity to neutrinos in the 5-100 GeV range, enabling precision studies of neutrino oscillations and searches for new physics. This work focuses specifically on this low-energy regime, where sparse hit patterns limit the performance of topology-based reconstruction and classification methods. We introduce Waveform-based Particle Identification (WavePID), a statistically rigorous and interpretable likelihood-ratio discriminator for track-cascade separation, built from Monte Carlo templates in timing-aware, physics-motivated observables and validated through dedicated simulations. Applied to both Monte Carlo and 11.1 years of IceCube data, WavePID suggests improved cascade purity by about 5 percentage points at a fixed 20% down-selection rate relative to the current leading cascade selection, while maintaining Data-MC agreement within detector systematics. The approach is compact and robust to sparse observations, demonstrating the value of waveform-level timing for low-energy reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Radiation tolerance test and damage of single-crystal CVD Diamond sensor under high fluence particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-crystal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond is a promising material for radiation detectors operating in extreme environments, owing to its outstanding radiation hardness. As nuclear and high-energy physics applications demand particle detectors that withstand higher radiation fluences, understanding the damage thresholds and degradation mechanisms of diamond-based detectors is essential. In this study, single-crystal CVD diamond sensors were exposed to fast neutron irradiation at fluences up to $3.3\times10^{17}$ ${n/cm^2}$. Modules exhibited stable output confirming potential for application in future high-dose radiation environments. The dominant defects were identified as point defects including &lt;100&gt; self interstitials, vacancies, and lattice disorder. Macroscopic defects including nanocavities and cracks were observed with areal densities approaching $10^7$ $cm^{-2}$. The impact of 100 MeV proton irradiation on diamond detector response was quantified by extracting a damage constant of $k^{100 MeV}_{proton}=(1.452\pm0.006)\times10^{-18}cm^2/(p\cdot\mu m)$ from a linear carrier drift degradation model. The mean free path of carriers was found to exhibit saturation behavior beyond a fluence of $4\times10^{16}$ ${p/cm^2}$ under 100 MeV proton irradiation. Monte Carlo together with molecular dynamics simulations were performed to assess irradiation induced defect and its influence on carrier transport. By considering saturation effects and defect-interaction corrections, we develop an enhanced carrier-drift degradation model that accurately captures detector response under high-dose irradiation. Furthermore, the simulation framework was applied to evaluate damage induced by protons and pions on diamond at various energies, yielding results that show better agreement with experimental data than conventional NIEL based estimates.</description>

      <title>From LIGO to Fiber- Compact Sagnac Interferometer for Gravitational-Wave Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave detection has transformed astrophysics, granting us direct access to black hole mergers, neutron star collisions, and the cataclysms of stellar death. Yet the great observatories of today, LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and the planned Einstein Telescope, rest on Michelson interferometers that, despite their triumphs, confront fundamental barriers of scale, cost, and environmental vulnerability. We envision a new path, a Sagnac-based fiber interferometer that leverages reciprocity and inherent robustness. Its meter-scale, modular design compact enough to fit within a small facility, offers dramatic gains in scalability and affordability over kilometer scale Michelson systems. Tunable to frequency bands where conventional detectors lose sensitivity, it opens the door to compact, versatile, and accessible GW observatories, empowering universities and research centers worldwide. Linked together in a global network, such facilities could transcend mere detection, they could localize cosmic sources and reconstruct them into images, much as black holes were first directly revealed, ushering in a new era of gravitational-wave astronomy and multi-messenger discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The off-axis magnetic near detector of the T2K experiment has undergone a significant upgrade, including the construction and installation of two new Time Projection Chambers featuring innovative resistive Micromegas technology and a field cage composed of thin composite walls. This paper provides a detailed description of the new components of the chambers, including the gas system, gas monitoring chambers, and data acquisition system. Additionally, it reports the results of extensive testing using both neutrino beams and cosmic rays, with comparisons between data and Monte Carlo simulations. The new detectors achieve improved spatial resolution and enhanced particle identification capabilities which are crucial for the precision goals of the T2K experiment.</description>

      <title>Development of a dual-phase xenon time projection chamber prototype for the RELICS experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The RELICS (REactor neutrino LIquid xenon Coherent elastic Scattering) experiment aims to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering from reactor antineutrinos using a dual-phase xenon time projection chamber. To validate the detector concept and ensure technical reliability for the full-scale experiment, a dedicated prototype was designed, constructed, and operated. This work presents an overview of the design, construction, and operational performance of the prototype, with emphasis on its major subsystems, including the TPC, cryogenic and xenon purification systems, slow control, and data acquisition. During operation, the detector demonstrated the capability to achieve a sub-keV energy threshold required for the RELICS physics program, as reflected by a measured single electron gain of 34.30~$\pm$~0.01~(stat.)~PE/e$^-$ and the successful detection of 0.27~keV L-shell decay events from $^{37}$Ar. In addition, essential data analysis techniques and simulation frameworks were developed and validated, establishing the methodological foundation for future RELICS operations. The successful construction and operation of this prototype confirm the feasibility of the core technologies and provide a crucial experimental basis for the final RELICS detector.</description>

      <title>Simulating neutron diffraction from deformed mosaic crystals in McStas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monochromator and analyzer systems that rely on bent single crystals are in use throughout the neutron scattering community. We here introduce a new component to the neutron simulation software package McStas, that simulates these bent single crystals. We then compare the performance of this component to like software in SIMRES, and Ncrystal. These simulations show excellent agreement across the different software programs. Finally we compare simulations of the new McStas component with analytical calculations of secondary extinction, based on the Darwin transfer equations. Here we also find excellent agreement, further validating this new component.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic characterization of FBK NUV-HD-Cryo 3T SiPM sensors for the DUNE photon detection system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a long-baseline neutrino experiment based in the USA and composed of a Near Detector (ND) complex at Fermi National Laboratory (FNAL), and a Far Detector (FD) complex located at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) $\sim$1300\,km distant. DUNE will study neutrino oscillations looking for unresolved issues of the Standard Model of particle physics (SM) such as CP violation in the leptonic sector, neutrino mass ordering and others, starting from the early 2030s. The FD, with a mass of $\sim$17\,kt, that will exploit both ionization and scintillation signals to detect neutrino interactions with Argon. Scintillating photons in LAr will be detected by the photon detection system (PDS) based on light collectors coupled to Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). During a test campaign, different laboratories of the collaboration performed an investigation of the best SiPM candidates that fulfill the DUNE FD requirements. We identified two models of SiPM, produced by Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. (HPK) and Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK), respectively. In this paper, we focus on the FBK selected model showing its main features. We will describe the characterization protocol, the results at both room and cryogenic temperatures and the photon detection efficiency measurements.</description>

      <title>Approximate resolution convolution function for fitting a dispersion gap measured on a triple-axis spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytic convoluted-gap function, eq. 11 in the manuscript, for fitting dispersion gaps measured on triple-axis spectrometers (TAS). At the gap, the instrumental resolution skews the signal, producing a high-energy tail that complicates fitting. Our function assumes an instrumental $Q$-resolution with two equal wide and one narrow direction (typical of focused TAS instruments), and a parabolic dispersion at the gap, which is exact for quadratic and accurate for linear dispersions if the resolution is moderate. We demonstrate, that our function outperforms previous methods of fitting a gap, by giving a better fit and more accurate gap determination, seen in figure 4. Here, the anti-ferromagnetically gapped material; MnF$_2$ is simulated in a double-focusing TAS instrument. We also tested our function on experimental data on MnF$_2$ from a TAS-like instrument, where we reproduce the gap size from previous accurate experimentally determined measurements. The function is simple to implement, converges reliably, and we recommend its use for future gap fitting on TAS data.</description>

      <title>Insights into neutron transport in a new multipurpose nuclear reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron transport inside the reflector tank of the new Brazilian nuclear reactor, called the RMB (Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor), is investigated using the stochastic Monte Carlo method. One of the main characteristics of research nuclear reactors is the core power density, which is proportional to the neutron flux generated in the fission reaction. The RMB is part of the new generation of multipurpose reactors, and studying neutron transport is essential for the project to meet its objectives of producing radioisotopes, irradiating materials, and generating neutron beams for scientific investigations. The neutron moderation process in the reflector tank is very well described by Maxwellian distributions, which provide temperatures ranging from T = 331.5 K in the core to T = 266.8 K in the peripheral regions. The relative proportions reveal the predominance (52%) of epithermal neutrons in the reactor core, followed by thermal (29%) and fast (19%) neutrons. The moderation process proves to be effective, considering that 100% of the neutrons fall within the thermal spectrum near the reflector tank wall. The fits using Maxwellian distributions reveal another effect of neutron moderation, a shift in the peak wavelength from 1.07 \r{A} to 1.19 \r{A}. The same effect is observed along the tube that supplies a neutron beam to the RMB imaging instrument, with $\lambda_{peak}$ = 1.18 \r{A} increasing to $\lambda_{peak}$ = 1.21 \r{A}.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the first full-size production for ePIC TOF layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) are characterized by a fast rise time (500 ps) and extremely good time resolution (down to 17 ps). The intrinsic low granularity of LGADs and the large power consumption of readout chips for precise timing are problematic in near-future experiments such as e+e- Higgs factories (FCC-ee) and the ePIC detector at the Electron-Ion Collider. AC-coupled LGADs, where the readout metal is AC-coupled through an insulating oxide layer, could solve both issues at the same time thanks to the 100% fill factor and charge-sharing capabilities. Charge sharing between electrodes allows a hit position resolution well below the pitch/$\sqrt12$ of standard segmented detectors. At the same time, it relaxes the channel density and power consumption requirements of readout chips. Extensive laboratory characterization of AC-LGAD devices from the first full-size (up to 3x4 cm) production from HPK for ePIC will be shown in this contribution. Both pixel and strip geometry was produced and tested. This study was conducted within the scope of the ePIC detector time of flight (TOF) layer R&amp;D program at the EIC.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed SiPM Readout of Plastic Scintillating Fiber Detector for Muon Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Muon tomography is a non-destructive imaging technique that uses cosmic-ray muons to probe dense materials. A plastic Scintillating Fiber (SciFi) detector with a one-dimensional SiPM array offers a compact and high-resolution solution. However, constructing a large-area SciFi detector demands reducing the number of readout channels while maintaining detector performance. To address this challenge, we present a multiplexing scheme based on a diode-based symmetric charge division circuit combined with a position-encoding algorithm, enabling up to $N_{\textrm{SiPM}}^{\textrm{max}}=C^{2}_{N_{\textrm{ele}}}$ SiPM channels to be read out using only ${N_{\textrm{ele}}}$ electronic channels. Circuit simulations confirm the feasibility of the multiplexing design and guide the choice of appropriate diodes to preserve SiPM signal integrity. A multiplexed SciFi detector module comprising 21 SiPM channels read out through 7 electronic channels are constructed. Electronic tests show that this module exhibits low crosstalk between electronic channels, and preserves linearity over a dynamic range from $\sim$10 to 122 photoelectrons. Cosmic-ray measurements further show that the multiplexed SciFi detector achieves a detection efficiency above 95\% and a spatial resolution of about 0.65~mm, with only minor degradation compared to the direct (per SiPM channel) readout. These results verify that the proposed method provides a scalable and cost-effective readout solution for large-area muon tomography systems.</description>

Abstract: POLAR-2 is a next-generation space astronomy platform led by China, with its core scientific objective focused on high-precision polarization measurements of gamma-ray bursts. As one of its key payloads, the Low-energy Polarization Detector (LPD) is designed to perform wide-field surveys to capture X-ray polarization information from gamma-ray bursts in the 2$\sim$10 keV energy range. This paper presents Topmetal-L, a dedicated charge-sensitive pixel sensor developed for the LPD prototype upgrade. Fabricated in a 130 nm CMOS process in 2024, the chip integrates a 356 $\times$ 512 pixel array with a pixel pitch of 45 $\mu$m. Each pixel incorporates a 26 $\times$ 26 $\mu$m$^2$ charge-collecting window and is capable of simultaneously outputting both energy and position information of deposited charges. Topmetal-L has been systematically optimized for power consumption, noise performance, and readout efficiency. It exhibits an input dynamic range of 0$\sim$4 ke$^{-}$, a typical charge-to-voltage conversion gain of 76.04 $\mu$V/e$^{-}$, an average equivalent noise charge of approximately 22.8 e$^{-}$, a sensitive area exceeding 3.69 cm$^2$, and a total power consumption of 720 mW per chip. To meet the requirements of large-area, high-frame-rate readout for gas-based polarization detectors, a sentinel readout scheme is proposed, reducing the full-frame readout time to 730 $\mu$s. A prototype Topmetal-L-based gas polarization detection system was evaluated across key energies: it exhibited a residual modulation of 0.26% $\pm$ 0.45% at 5.90 keV, a modulation factor of 66.67% $\pm$ 0.45% for a linearly polarized 8.05 keV source, and a count rate saturated at 15 k counts$\cdot$cm$^{-2}$$\cdot$s$^{-1}$ when tested at 5.40 keV.</description>
