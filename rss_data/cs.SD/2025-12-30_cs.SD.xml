      <title>Rethinking Leveraging Pre-Trained Multi-Layer Representations for Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent speaker verification studies have achieved notable success by leveraging layer-wise output from pre-trained Transformer models. However, few have explored the advancements in aggregating these multi-level features beyond the static weighted average. We present Layer Attentive Pooling (LAP), a novel strategy for aggregating inter-layer representations from pre-trained speech models for speaker verification. LAP assesses the significance of each layer from multiple perspectives time-dynamically, and employs max pooling instead of averaging. Additionally, we propose a lightweight backend speaker model comprising LAP and Attentive Statistical Temporal Pooling (ASTP) to extract speaker embeddings from pre-trained model output. Experiments on the VoxCeleb benchmark reveal that our compact architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance while greatly reducing the training time. We further analyzed LAP design and its dynamic weighting mechanism for capturing speaker characteristics.</description>

      <title>A Robust framework for sound event localization and detection on real recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This technical report describes the systems submitted to the DCASE2022 challenge task 3: sound event localization and detection (SELD). The task aims to detect occurrences of sound events and specify their class, furthermore estimate their position. Our system utilizes a ResNet-based model under a proposed robust framework for SELD. To guarantee the generalized performance on the real-world sound scenes, we design the total framework with augmentation techniques, a pipeline of mixing datasets from real-world sound scenes and emulations, and test time augmentation. Augmentation techniques and exploitation of external sound sources enable training diverse samples and keeping the opportunity to train the real-world context enough by maintaining the number of the real recording samples in the batch. In addition, we design a test time augmentation and a clustering-based model ensemble method to aggregate confident predictions. Experimental results show that the model under a proposed framework outperforms the baseline methods and achieves competitive performance in real-world sound recordings.</description>

      <title>Marco-ASR: A Principled and Metric-Driven Framework for Fine-Tuning Large-Scale ASR Models for Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models have achieved remarkable accuracy in general settings, yet their performance often degrades in domain-specific applications due to data mismatch and linguistic variability. This challenge is amplified for modern Large Language Model (LLM)-based ASR systems, whose massive scale and complex training dynamics make effective fine-tuning non-trivial. To address this gap, this paper proposes a principled and metric-driven fine-tuning framework for adapting both traditional and LLM-based ASR models to specialized domains. The framework emphasizes learning rate optimization based on performance metrics, combined with domain-specific data transformation and augmentation. We empirically evaluate our framework on state-of-the-art models, including Whisper, Whisper-Turbo, and Qwen2-Audio, across multi-domain, multilingual, and multi-length datasets. Our results not only validate the proposed framework but also establish practical protocols for improving domain-specific ASR performance while preventing overfitting.</description>

      <title>AudioGAN: A Compact and Efficient Framework for Real-Time High-Fidelity Text-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-audio (TTA) generation can significantly benefit the media industry by reducing production costs and enhancing work efficiency. However, most current TTA models (primarily diffusion-based) suffer from slow inference speeds and high computational costs. In this paper, we introduce AudioGAN, the first successful Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)-based TTA framework that generates audio in a single pass, thereby reducing model complexity and inference time. To overcome the inherent difficulties in training GANs, we integrate multiple ,contrastive losses and propose innovative components Single-Double-Triple (SDT) Attention and Time-Frequency Cross-Attention (TF-CA). Extensive experiments on the AudioCaps dataset demonstrate that AudioGAN achieves state-of-the-art performance while using 90% fewer parameters and running 20 times faster, synthesizing audio in under one second. These results establish AudioGAN as a practical and powerful solution for real-time TTA.</description>

      <title>Chord Recognition with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress in automatic chord recognition has been slow since the advent of deep learning in the field. To understand why, I conduct experiments on existing methods and test hypotheses enabled by recent developments in generative models. Findings show that chord classifiers perform poorly on rare chords and that pitch augmentation boosts accuracy. Features extracted from generative models do not help and synthetic data presents an exciting avenue for future work. I conclude by improving the interpretability of model outputs with beat detection, reporting some of the best results in the field and providing qualitative analysis. Much work remains to solve automatic chord recognition, but I hope this thesis will chart a path for others to try.</description>

      <title>Mobile-Efficient Speech Emotion Recognition Using DistilHuBERT: A Cross-Corpus Validation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has significant potential for mobile applications, yet deployment remains constrained by the computational demands of state-of-the-art transformer architectures. This paper presents a mobile-efficient SER system based on DistilHuBERT, a distilled and 8-bit quantized transformer that achieves 92% parameter reduction compared to full-scale Wav2Vec 2.0 models while maintaining competitive accuracy. We conduct a rigorous 5-fold Leave-One-Session-Out (LOSO) cross-validation on the IEMOCAP dataset to ensure speaker independence, augmented with cross-corpus training on CREMA-D to enhance generalization. Cross-corpus training with CREMA-D yields a 1.2% improvement in Weighted Accuracy, a 1.4% gain in Macro F1-score, and a 32% reduction in cross-fold variance, with the Neutral class showing the most substantial benefit at 5.4% F1-score improvement. Our approach achieves an Unweighted Accuracy of 61.4% with a quantized model footprint of only 23 MB, representing approximately 91% of full-scale baseline performance. Cross-corpus evaluation on RAVDESS reveals that the theatrical nature of acted emotions causes predictions to cluster by arousal level rather than valence: happiness is systematically confused with anger due to acoustic saturation in high-energy expressions. Despite this theatricality effect reducing overall RAVDESS accuracy to 43.29%, the model maintains robust arousal detection with 97% recall for anger and 64% for sadness. These findings establish a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between model size and accuracy, enabling practical affect recognition on resource-constrained mobile devices.</description>

      <title>EEG-to-Voice Decoding of Spoken and Imagined speech Using Non-Invasive EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Restoring speech communication from neural signals is a central goal of brain-computer interface research, yet EEG-based speech reconstruction remains challenging due to limited spatial resolution, susceptibility to noise, and the absence of temporally aligned acoustic targets in imagined speech. In this study, we propose an EEG-to-Voice paradigm that directly reconstructs speech from non-invasive EEG signals without dynamic time warping (DTW) or explicit temporal alignment. The proposed pipeline generates mel-spectrograms from EEG in an open-loop manner using a subject-specific generator, followed by pretrained vocoder and automatic speech recognition (ASR) modules to synthesize speech waveforms and decode text. Separate generators were trained for spoken speech and imagined speech, and transfer learning-based domain adaptation was applied by pretraining on spoken speech and adapting to imagined speech. A minimal language model-based correction module was optionally applied to correct limited ASR errors while preserving semantic structure. The framework was evaluated under 2 s and 4 s speech conditions using acoustic-level metrics (PCC, RMSE, MCD) and linguistic-level metrics (CER, WER). Stable acoustic reconstruction and comparable linguistic accuracy were observed for both spoken speech and imagined speech. While acoustic similarity decreased for longer utterances, text-level decoding performance was largely preserved, and word-position analysis revealed a mild increase in decoding errors toward later parts of sentences. The language model-based correction consistently reduced CER and WER without introducing semantic distortion. These results demonstrate the feasibility of direct, open-loop EEG-to-Voice reconstruction for spoken speech and imagined speech without explicit temporal alignment.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Aware Optimization for Respiratory Sound Classification: Enhancing Sensitivity with SAM-Optimized Audio Spectrogram Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Respiratory sound classification is hindered by the limited size, high noise levels, and severe class imbalance of benchmark datasets like ICBHI 2017. While Transformer-based models offer powerful feature extraction capabilities, they are prone to overfitting and often converge to sharp minima in the loss landscape when trained on such constrained medical data. To address this, we introduce a framework that enhances the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) using Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM). Instead of merely minimizing the training loss, our approach optimizes the geometry of the loss surface, guiding the model toward flatter minima that generalize better to unseen patients. We also implement a weighted sampling strategy to handle class imbalance effectively. Our method achieves a state-of-the-art score of 68.10% on the ICBHI 2017 dataset, outperforming existing CNN and hybrid baselines. More importantly, it reaches a sensitivity of 68.31%, a crucial improvement for reliable clinical screening. Further analysis using t-SNE and attention maps confirms that the model learns robust, discriminative features rather than memorizing background noise.</description>

      <title>Style Amnesia: Investigating Speaking Style Degradation and Mitigation in Multi-Turn Spoken Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that when spoken language models (SLMs) are instructed to speak in a specific speaking style at the beginning of a multi-turn conversation, they cannot maintain the required speaking styles after several turns of interaction; we refer to this as the style amnesia of SLMs. We focus on paralinguistic speaking styles, including emotion, accent, volume, and speaking speed. We evaluate three proprietary and two open-source SLMs, demonstrating that none of these models can maintain a consistent speaking style when instructed to do so. We further show that when SLMs are asked to recall the style instruction in later turns, they can recall the style instruction, but they fail to express it throughout the conversation. We also show that explicitly asking the model to recall the style instruction can partially mitigate style amnesia. In addition, we examine various prompting strategies and find that SLMs struggle to follow the required style when the instruction is placed in system messages rather than user messages, which contradicts the intended function of system prompts.</description>

      <title>PROFASR-BENCH: A Benchmark for Context-Conditioned ASR in High-Stakes Professional Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in professional settings faces challenges that existing benchmarks underplay: dense domain terminology, formal register variation, and near-zero tolerance for critical entity errors. We present ProfASR-Bench, a professional-talk evaluation suite for high-stakes applications across finance, medicine, legal, and technology. Each example pairs a natural-language prompt (domain cue and/or speaker profile) with an entity-rich target utterance, enabling controlled measurement of context-conditioned recognition. The corpus supports conventional ASR metrics alongside entity-aware scores and slice-wise reporting by accent and gender. Using representative families Whisper (encoder-decoder ASR) and Qwen-Omni (audio language models) under matched no-context, profile, domain+profile, oracle, and adversarial conditions, we find a consistent pattern: lightweight textual context produces little to no change in average word error rate (WER), even with oracle prompts, and adversarial prompts do not reliably degrade performance. We term this the context-utilization gap (CUG): current systems are nominally promptable yet underuse readily available side information. ProfASR-Bench provides a standardized context ladder, entity- and slice-aware reporting with confidence intervals, and a reproducible testbed for comparing fusion strategies across model families.

      <title>Unrolled Creative Adversarial Network For Generating Novel Musical Pieces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Music generation has emerged as a significant topic in artificial intelligence and machine learning. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been widely employed for sequence generation, generative adversarial networks (GANs) remain relatively underexplored in this domain. This paper presents two systems based on adversarial networks for music generation. The first system learns a set of music pieces without differentiating between styles, while the second system focuses on learning and deviating from specific composers' styles to create innovative music. By extending the Creative Adversarial Networks (CAN) framework to the music domain, this work introduces unrolled CAN to address mode collapse, evaluating both GAN and CAN in terms of creativity and variation.</description>

      <title>Steering Language Model to Stable Speech Emotion Recognition via Contextual Perception and Chain of Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale audio language models (ALMs), such as Qwen2-Audio, are capable of comprehending diverse audio signal, performing audio analysis and generating textual responses. However, in speech emotion recognition (SER), ALMs often suffer from hallucinations, resulting in misclassifications or irrelevant outputs. To address these challenges, we propose C$^2$SER, a novel ALM designed to enhance the stability and accuracy of SER through Contextual perception and Chain of Thought (CoT). C$^2$SER integrates the Whisper encoder for semantic perception and Emotion2Vec-S for acoustic perception, where Emotion2Vec-S extends Emotion2Vec with semi-supervised learning to enhance emotional discrimination. Additionally, C$^2$SER employs a CoT approach, processing SER in a step-by-step manner while leveraging speech content and speaking styles to improve recognition. To further enhance stability, C$^2$SER introduces self-distillation from explicit CoT to implicit CoT, mitigating error accumulation and boosting recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments show that C$^2$SER outperforms existing popular ALMs, such as Qwen2-Audio and SECap, delivering more stable and precise emotion recognition. We release the training code, checkpoints, and test sets to facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>SonicMaster: Towards Controllable All-in-One Music Restoration and Mastering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Music recordings often suffer from audio quality issues such as excessive reverberation, distortion, clipping, tonal imbalances, and a narrowed stereo image, especially when created in non-professional settings without specialized equipment or expertise. These problems are typically corrected using separate specialized tools and manual adjustments. In this paper, we introduce SonicMaster, the first unified generative model for music restoration and mastering that addresses a broad spectrum of audio artifacts with text-based control. SonicMaster is conditioned on natural language instructions to apply targeted enhancements, or can operate in an automatic mode for general restoration. To train this model, we construct the SonicMaster dataset, a large dataset of paired degraded and high-quality tracks by simulating common degradation types with nineteen degradation functions belonging to five enhancements groups: equalization, dynamics, reverb, amplitude, and stereo. Our approach leverages a flow-matching generative training paradigm to learn an audio transformation that maps degraded inputs to their cleaned, mastered versions guided by text prompts. Objective audio quality metrics demonstrate that SonicMaster significantly improves sound quality across all artifact categories. Furthermore, subjective listening tests confirm that listeners prefer SonicMaster's enhanced outputs over other baselines.</description>

      <title>The CCF AATC 2025 Speech Restoration Challenge: A Retrospective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world speech communication is rarely affected by a single type of degradation. Instead, it suffers from a complex interplay of acoustic interference, codec compression, and, increasingly, secondary artifacts introduced by upstream enhancement algorithms. To bridge the gap between academic research and these realistic scenarios, we introduced the CCF AATC 2025 Challenge. This challenge targets universal blind speech restoration, requiring a single model to handle three distinct distortion categories: acoustic degradation, codec distortion, and secondary processing artifacts. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive retrospective of the challenge, detailing the dataset construction, task design, and a systematic analysis of the 25 participating systems. We report three key findings that define the current state of the field: (1) Efficiency vs. Scale: Contrary to the trend of massive generative models, top-performing systems demonstrated that lightweight discriminative architectures (&lt;10M parameters) can achieve state-of-the-art performance, balancing restoration quality with deployment constraints. (2) Generative Trade-off: While generative and hybrid models excel in theoretical perceptual metrics, breakdown analysis reveals they suffer from "reconstruction bias" in high-SNR codec tasks and struggle with hallucination in complex secondary artifact scenarios. (3) Metric Gap: Most critically, our rank correlation analysis exposes a strong negative correlation (\r{ho}=-0.8) between widely-used reference-free metrics (e.g., DNSMOS) and human MOS when evaluating hybrid systems. This indicates that current metrics may over-reward artificial spectral smoothness at the expense of perceptual naturalness.

      <title>A Data-Centric Approach to Generalizable Speech Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18210v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving robust generalization in speech deepfake detection (SDD) remains a primary challenge, as models often fail to detect unseen forgery methods. While research has focused on model-centric and algorithm-centric solutions, the impact of data composition is often underexplored. This paper proposes a data-centric approach, analyzing the SDD data landscape from two practical perspectives: constructing a single dataset and aggregating multiple datasets. To address the first perspective, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to characterize the data scaling laws for SDD, quantifying the impact of source and generator diversity. To address the second, we propose the Diversity-Optimized Sampling Strategy (DOSS), a principled framework for mixing heterogeneous data with two implementations: DOSS-Select (pruning) and DOSS-Weight (re-weighting). Our experiments show that DOSS-Select outperforms the naive aggregation baseline while using only 3% of the total available data. Furthermore, our final model, trained on a 12k-hour curated data pool using the optimal DOSS-Weight strategy, achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming large-scale baselines with greater data and model efficiency on both public benchmarks and a new challenge set of various commercial APIs.</description>

      <title>Decoding EEG Speech Perception with Transformers and VAE-based Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoding speech from non-invasive brain signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG), has the potential to advance brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), with applications in silent communication and assistive technologies for individuals with speech impairments. However, EEG-based speech decoding faces major challenges, such as noisy data, limited datasets, and poor performance on complex tasks like speech perception. This study attempts to address these challenges by employing variational autoencoders (VAEs) for EEG data augmentation to improve data quality and applying a state-of-the-art (SOTA) sequence-to-sequence deep learning architecture, originally successful in electromyography (EMG) tasks, to EEG-based speech decoding. Additionally, we adapt this architecture for word classification tasks. Using the Brennan dataset, which contains EEG recordings of subjects listening to narrated speech, we preprocess the data and evaluate both classification and sequence-to-sequence models for EEG-to-words/sentences tasks. Our experiments show that VAEs have the potential to reconstruct artificial EEG data for augmentation. Meanwhile, our sequence-to-sequence model achieves more promising performance in generating sentences compared to our classification model, though both remain challenging tasks. These findings lay the groundwork for future research on EEG speech perception decoding, with possible extensions to speech production tasks such as silent or imagined speech.</description>

      <title>Dub-S2ST: Textless Speech-to-Speech Translation for Seamless Dubbing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a cross-lingual dubbing system that translates speech from one language to another while preserving key characteristics such as duration, speaker identity, and speaking speed. Despite the strong translation quality of existing speech translation approaches, they often overlook the transfer of speech patterns, leading to mismatches with source speech and limiting their suitability for dubbing applications. To address this, we propose a discrete diffusion-based speech-to-unit translation model with explicit duration control, enabling time-aligned translation. We then synthesize speech based on the translated units and source speaker's identity using a conditional flow matching model. Additionally, we introduce a unit-based speed adaptation mechanism that guides the translation model to produce speech at a rate consistent with the source, without relying on any text. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates natural and fluent translations that align with the original speech's duration and speaking pace, while achieving competitive translation performance. The code is available at https://github.com/kaistmm/Dub-S2ST.</description>

      <title>Fun-Audio-Chat Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in joint speech-text models show great potential for seamless voice interactions. However, existing models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They also achieve competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy. We develop Fun-Audio-Chat-Duplex, a full-duplex variant with strong performance on Spoken QA and full-duplex interactions. We open-source Fun-Audio-Chat-8B with training and inference code, and provide an interactive demo, at https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/Fun-Audio-Chat .</description>
