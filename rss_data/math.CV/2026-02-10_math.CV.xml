      <title>Complex harmonic mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the harmonic mean of non-zero complex-valued random variables (complex harmonic mean) and establish several geometric estimates and bounds. In contrast to the classical positive-valued case, complex harmonic means may lie outside the convex hull of the range. We prove that if the range is contained in a disk not containing the origin, then the complex harmonic mean is confined to the same disk. This result is based on the behavior of disks under inversion and convexity arguments. Further estimates involving the modulus and the real part are obtained, and the two-point case is analyzed explicitly, revealing a circular structure. Several examples are provided to illustrate the distinctive features of complex harmonic means.</description>

      <title>Mellin-Space Prony Representability of Linear Viscoelastic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear viscoelasticity is universally described by relaxation functions, which are continuous in relaxation times. Yet experimentally, measurements are necessarily discrete and band-limited, creating a fundamental gap between the continuous mathematical description and empirical observations. While Laplace-domain rational moduli admit finite Prony representations, using Mellin space analysis requires a deeper structural criterion. This work proves that finite Prony series representation holds if and only if the arithmetic pole lattices of Gamma factors in the Mellin transform of the complex modulus align exactly with those of a trial kernel, with residues satisfying decoupled first-order recurrences along aligned sublattices. This maximal criterion classifies classical models (Maxwell, standard linear solid) as finitely representable and fractional models (power-law, Cole--Cole, Zener, Gaussian) as transcendentally representable via infinite Prony ladders, yielding a complete analytical pole-lattice taxonomy of viscoelastic material models.</description>

      <title>Fundamental groups of compact Kahler varieties with nef anti canonical bundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is proved by M. Paun (1997, 2017) that the fundamental group of a compact Kahler manifold X is almost Abelian if the anti-canonical bundle -KX is nef. In this paper, we apply the recent geometric analytic theory of Kahler spaces developed by Guo-Phong-Song-Sturm to study fundamental groups of mildly singular compact Kahler varieties. We first extend Paun's result to log canonical pairs (X,Delta) with smooth X and nef -(KX+Delta) as well as to compact Kahler manifolds X with pseudo-effective -KX under a suitable assumption on the singularities of c1(-KX). We further prove that, for a 3-dimensional log canonical pair (X,\Delta) with X being klt, pi 1(X) is almost Abelian if -(KX+\Delta) is nef. Moreover, as one of the main ingredients for the proof of these results, we establish the surjectivity of the Albanese maps of compact normal complex varieties X in Fujiki class C that admits an effective R-divisor \Delta such that the pair (X,\Delta) is log canonical with nef anti-log canonical divisor -(KX+\Delta).This generalizes the corresponding theorems for projective varieties (Zhang, 2005), for klt pairs (Matsumura-Wang-Wu-Zhang, 2025) and for log smooth case (Fu-Han-Zou, 2025)</description>

      <title>Complete minimal surfaces of finite total curvature on punctured spheres with totally ramified value number greater than $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Osserman's problem on the number $D_g$ of omitted values
  of the Gauss map of a complete minimal surface with finite total curvature in $\boldsymbol{R}^3$,
  its totally ramified value number $\nu_g$ (referred to in this paper as the
  \emph{total weight of totally ramified values})
  has attracted significant interest.
  The value of $\nu_g$ provides more detailed information than the number of omitted values alone.
  In 2006, Kawakami first found that a minimal surface defined on the three-punctured Riemann sphere,
  originally constructed by Miyaoka and Sato, satisfies $D_g = 2$ and $\nu_g = 2.5 &gt; 2$.
  Subsequently, in 2024, Kawakami and Watanabe gave another minimal surface
  defined on the four-punctured Riemann sphere that also satisfies $D_g = 2$ and $\nu_g = 2.5$.
  To date, these remain the only two known examples of such surfaces satisfying $\nu_g &gt; 2$.
  In this paper, we provide a systematic construction of meromorphic functions
  on punctured Riemann spheres that satisfy $\nu_g &gt; 2$.
  As a consequence, we obtain the following results for complete minimal surfaces of finite total curvature with $\nu_g = 2.5$ within the topological types of the known examples: (1) For the three-punctured sphere, we prove the uniqueness of Miyaoka--Sato's example. (2) For the four-punctured sphere, we completely determine the surfaces with $D_g=2$ and $\nu_g = 2.5$, which include examples other than Kawakami--Watanabe's one. (3) Furthermore, we construct a new example on the four-punctured sphere satisfying $D_g=1$ and $\nu_g = 2.5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a new version of the Wiener-Ikehara theorem where one deduces bounds $$ 0&lt; \liminf_{x\to\infty} \frac{S(x)}{e^{x}}\leq \limsup_{x\to\infty} \frac{S(x)}{e^{x}} &lt;\infty $$ for (in particular) a non-decreasing function $S$ from a mild hypothesis on the boundary behavior of its Laplace transform on a vertical segment containing $s=1$. As an application, we establish new criteria for the validity of Chebyshev bounds for Beurling generalized prime number systems under weaker conditions than were known so far.</description>

      <title>Principal Distribution Isomorphisms and Almost Hermitian geometry on Isoparametric Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the isomorphisms between principal distributions $\mathcal{D}_k$ $(k=1,\dots 4)$ on OT--FKM type isoparametric hypersurfaces in spheres. We recover the isomorphism $\mathcal{D}_1 \cong \mathcal{D}_3$ established by Qian--Tang--Yan \cite{Q-T-Y 2}, and further construct the isomorphism $\mathcal{D}_{2}\cong\mathcal{D}_{4}$ in specific cases. More significantly, we provide an explicit construction of a global vector bundle isomorphism $\mathcal{D}_1 \oplus \mathcal{D}_2 \cong \mathcal{D}_3 \oplus \mathcal{D}_4$ for all odd multiplicities $m$. As applications, we employ these isomorphisms to induce nearly K\"ahler structures on certain OT--FKM hypersurfaces. Finally, we prove that the $*$-Ricci curvature vanishes for any OT--FKM hypersurface admitting an almost Hermitian structure that interchanges principal distributions in pairs.</description>

      <title>Uniform spectral gaps for random hyperbolic surfaces with not many cusps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate uniform spectral gaps for Weil-Petersson random hyperbolic surfaces with not many cusps. We show that if $n=O(g^\alpha)$ where $\alpha\in \left[0,\frac{1}{2}\right)$, then for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, a random cusped hyperbolic surface in $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ has no eigenvalues in $\left(0,\frac{1}{4}-\left(\frac{1}{6(1-\alpha)}\right)^2-\epsilon\right)$. If $\alpha$ is close to $\frac{1}{2}$, this gives a new uniform lower bound $\frac{5}{36}-\epsilon$ for the spectral gaps of Weil-Petersson random hyperbolic surfaces. The major contribution of this work is to reveal a critical phenomenon of ``second order cancellation".</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Brolin-Lyubich-Freire--Lopes--Ma\~n\'e equidistribution theorem for iterated preimages of a given non-exceptional value and Lyubich's periodic point version of it are foundational in the study of dynamics of rational functions of degree more than one on the complex projective line, and Drasin and the author studied a quantification of the former in a formalism of Nevanlinna theory or more specifically with the aid of Selberg's theorem. In this paper, we point out that the argument in that previous study have already yielded a better quantification of the Brolin-Lyubich-Freire--Lopes--Ma\~n\'e equidistribution theorem, and also point out that a similar argument also yields a quantification of Lyubich's theorem under an exponentwise version of the so called hypothesis H.</description>

      <title>Norm inequalities for weighted Dirichlet spaces with applications to conformal maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A variety of norm inequalities related to Bergman and Dirichlet spaces induced by radial weights are considered. Some of the results obtained can be considered as generalizations of certain known special cases while most of the estimates discovered are completely new. The second objective of the paper is to apply the obtained norm inequalities to relate the growth of the maximum modulus of a conformal map $f$, measured in terms of a weighted integrability condition, to a geometric quantity involving the area of image under $f$ of a disc centered at the origin. Our findings in this direction yield new geometric characterizations of conformal maps in certain weighted Dirichlet and Besov spaces.</description>

      <title>Embedding theorems for Bergman-Zygmund spaces induced by doubling weights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $0&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and $\Psi: [0,1) \to (0,\infty)$, and let $\mu$ be a finite positive Borel measure on the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$ of the complex plane. We define the Lebesgue-Zygmund space $L^p_{\mu,\Psi}$ as the space of all measurable functions $f$ on $\mathbb{D}$ such that $\int_{\mathbb{D}}|f(z)|^p\Psi(|f(z)|)\,d\mu(z)&lt;\infty$. The weighted Bergman-Zygmund space $A^p_{\omega,\Psi}$ induced by a weight function $\omega$ consists of analytic functions in $L^p_{\mu,\Psi}$ with $d\mu=\omega\,dA$. Let $0&lt;q&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and let $\omega$ be radial weight on $\mathbb{D}$ which has certain two-sided doubling properties. In this study, we will characterize the measures $\mu$ such that the identity mapping $I: A^p_{\omega,\Psi} \to L^q_{\mu,\Phi}$ is bounded and compact, when we assume $\Psi,\Phi$ to be almost monotonic and to satisfy certain doubling properties. In addition, we apply our result to characterize the measures for which the differentiation operator $D^{(n)}: A^p_{\omega,\Psi} \to L^q_{\mu,\Phi}$ is bounded and compact.</description>

      <title>Variable Elliptic Structures on the Plane: Transport Dynamics, Rigidity, and Function Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study variable elliptic structures on planar domains defined by a smoothly varying quadratic relation between a local generator and real coefficient functions. This induces a rank two real algebra bundle whose multiplication varies with position and gives rise to a generalized first order Cauchy Riemann type operator. Differentiating the structure relation shows that the derivatives of the generator are uniquely determined by the structure coefficients, leading to an intrinsic obstruction field that governs all deviations from the constant coefficient theory. Eliminating the derivatives of the generator yields a universal first order transport system constraining the admissible variability of the structure coefficients. In the elliptic regime this system reduces to a forced complex inviscid Burgers equation for a scalar spectral parameter encoding the structure data. Transport along characteristic curves is therefore intrinsic to variable elliptic structures. Within this framework, general smooth first order elliptic systems on the plane admit a natural reformulation as variable structure Vekua equations. The intrinsic obstruction identifies the geometric source of inhomogeneity, while a rigidity condition selects a conservative transport regime. A rigidity-flatness theorem further characterizes when rigid structures reduce locally to constant coefficients, yielding a geometric classification of smooth first order elliptic equations on the plane. Classical tools of complex analysis reemerge in the rigid regime with explicit structure.</description>
