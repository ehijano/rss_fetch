      <title>Comment on "Direct Targeting and Regulation of RNA Polymerase II by Cell Signaling Kinases"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dabas et al. in Science 2025 report that approximately 117 human kinases directly phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), proposing an extensive, direct biochemical bridge between signal transduction and transcriptional control. Such a sweeping claim that one-fourth of the human kinome directly targets the CTD represents a profound revision of canonical transcriptional biology. However, the evidence presented relies primarily on in vitro kinase assays using short CTD peptides, sparse in-cell validation, and mechanistically incomplete models of nuclear trafficking, chromatin targeting, structural compatibility, and catalytic specificity. In this extended critique, we demonstrate that the conclusions of this study are not supported by current biochemical, structural, cell biological, or genomic data. We outline severe shortcomings in assay design, lack of quantitative kinetics, incompatibilities with known Pol II structural constraints, unsupported assumptions about nuclear localization, inappropriate extension to "direct-at-gene" mechanisms, absence of global transcriptional effects, failure to align with the essential role of canonical CDKs, and missing transparency in dataset reporting. We conclude that the central claims of the study are premature and contradicted by decades of established transcriptional research. Substantial new evidence is required before revising the mechanistic model of Pol II CTD regulation.</description>

      <title>Survival and invasion dynamics in cell populations: an analytical framework for threshold behaviour in nonlinear age-structured models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell populations invade through a combination of proliferation and motility. Proliferation depends on the internal timing of cell division: how long cells take to complete the cell cycle. This timing varies substantially within (and across) cell types, creating age structure where cells at different times since their last division have different propensities to divide. Classical mathematical models of cell spreading treat division as memoryless and predict exponential cell-cycle-time distributions. Lineage tracing, by contrast, reveals peaked, gamma-like distributions that indicate a maturation delay leading to a fertility window. This gap motivates a modelling framework that incorporates age-dependent cell division rates while retaining analytical tractability.
  We address this through a moment-hierarchy framework that tracks time since cell division, with age resetting to zero at division. The framework yields explicit formulae for steady-state age distributions, cell-cycle-time distributions, and invasion speeds. For age-independent rates, we recover classical Fisher--KPP. Three fundamental principles emerge. First, age structure systematically reduces a population's carrying capacity and narrows the viable parameter range for positive steady states. Second, classical linear theory overestimates invasion speeds; the true minimal speed is slower when division is age-dependent. Third, the parameter condition for population survival is identical to the condition for a positive invasion speed.</description>
