      <title>Characterising the Standardisation Properties of Type Ia Supernovae in the z band with Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are standardisable candles: their peak magnitudes can be corrected for correlations between light curve properties and their luminosities to precisely estimate distances. Understanding SN Ia standardisation across wavelength improves methods for correcting SN Ia magnitudes. Using 150 SNe Ia from the Foundation Supernova Survey and Young Supernova Experiment, we present the first study focusing on SN Ia standardisation properties in the z band. Straddling the optical and near-infrared, SN Ia light in the z band is less sensitive to dust extinction and can be collected alongside the optical on CCDs. Pre-standardisation, SNe Ia exhibit less residual scatter in z-band peak magnitudes than in the g and r bands. SNe Ia peak z-band magnitudes still exhibit a significant dependence on light-curve shape. Post-standardisation, the z-band Hubble diagram has a total scatter of RMS = 0.195 mag. We infer a z-band mass step of $\gamma_{z} = -0.105 \pm 0.031$ mag, which is consistent within 1$\sigma$ of that estimated from gri data, assuming Rv = 2.61. When assuming different Rv values for high and low mass host galaxies, the z-band and optical mass steps remain consistent within 1$\sigma$. Based on current statistical precision, these results suggest dust reddening cannot fully explain the mass step. SNe Ia in the z band exhibit complementary standardisability properties to the optical that can improve distance estimates. Understanding these properties is important for the upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory and Nancy G. Roman Space Telescope, which will probe the rest-frame z band to redshifts 0.1 and 1.8.</description>

      <title>Fishing for the Optimal Roman High Latitude Time Domain Survey: Cosmological Constraints for 1,000 Possible Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is set to conduct a generation-defining SN Ia cosmology measurement with its High Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS). However, between optical elements, exposure times, cadences, and survey areas, there are many survey parameters to consider. This work was part of a Roman Project Infrastructure Team effort to help the Core Community Survey (CCS) Committee finalize the HLTDS recommendation to the Roman Observations Time Allocation Committee. We simulate 1,000 surveys, with and without a conservative (volume-limited) version of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Deep Drilling Field SNe Ia, and compute Fisher-matrix-analysis Dark Energy Task Force Figures of Merit (FoM, based on w0-wa constraints) for each. We investigate which survey parameters correlate with FoM, as well as the dependence of the FoM values on calibration uncertainties and the SN dispersion model. The exact optimum depends on the assumed dispersion model and whether Rubin DDF SNe Ia are also considered, but ~20% time in prism, ~30--40% time in Wide imaging and the remainder in Deep imaging seems most promising. We also advocate for "interlaced" cadences where not every filter is used in every cadence step to reduce overheads while maintaining a good cadence and increasing the number of filters compared to the Rose et al. (2021) reference survey (the prism has proportionately lower overheads and can be used for each cadence step). We show simulated light curves and spectra for the baseline HLTDS CCS recommendation and release distance-modulus covariance matrices for all surveys to the community.</description>

      <title>Estimating Bolometric Luminosities of Type 1 Quasars with Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method to calculate bolometric luminosities for unobscured, type 1 quasars with multi-band photometric data. Bolometric luminosity is a fundamental property to understand quasars and it is commonly estimated from monochromatic luminosities using bolometric corrections that often neglect quasar SED diversity. We take advantage of the fact that most quasars now have multi-band observations from UV to mid-IR, and construct SEDs for a well-defined sample of SDSS quasars at $0.5\leq z\leq 2$. Based on this fiducial sample, we explore quasar SEDs, their diversity, and their relations with bolometric luminosities. We then use unsupervised neural network self-organizing maps (SOM) to describe the SED diversity and compute the bolometric luminosities with a fully-trained SOM model. This method reduces systematical uncertainties compared to the traditional method. In addition, we update the multi-linear regression relations between bolometric luminosity and monochromatic luminosities at restframe 1450\r{A}, 3000\r{A}, and 5100\r{A}. Our method is applicable to large quasar samples with a wide range of luminosity and redshift. We have applied it to the SDSS DR16 quasars. We have also made our code publicly available.</description>

      <title>Uncalibrated Cosmic Standards as a Robust Test on Late-Time Cosmological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a minimally model-dependent framework for testing late-time cosmological models using Uncalibrated Cosmic Standards (UCS), including standard rulers and standard candles, without relying on absolute calibrations. The method exploits a tight, model-insensitive correlation between the sound horizons at recombination and the drag epoch. By avoiding dependence on pre-recombination physics and the amplitude of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectra, the UCS framework reduces potential early-time biases while retaining much of the constraining power of full analyses. Applying UCS to the recent dynamical dark energy (DE) study that reported deviations from $\Lambda$CDM, we find the constraints shift systematically toward the $\Lambda$CDM case, suggesting the present of pre-recombination physics or systematics that likely affect the scale-dependence of the CMB spectra. We also observe a mild tension between uncalibrated standard rulers and candles, which can be largely mitigated by introducing a redshift-dependent magnitude bias in the supernova (SNe Ia) data. Our results highlights the importance of isolating post-recombination observables for testing late-time models in the era of precision cosmology, positioning UCS analysis as a robust framework for upcoming galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Numerical evolution of self-gravitating halos of self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a modification of a recently developed numerical scheme for evolving spherically symmetric self-gravitating systems to include the effects of self-interacting dark matter. The approach is far more efficient than traditional N-body simulations and cross sections with different dependencies on velocity and scattering-angle are easily accommodated. To demonstrate, we provide results of a simulation, which runs quickly on a personal computer, that shows the expected initial flattening of the inner region of an NFW halo as well as the later gravothermal collapse instability that leads to a dense core at the galactic center. We note that this approach can also be used, with some augmentation, to simulate the dynamics in globular clusters by modeling gravitational hard scattering as a self-interaction.</description>

      <title>Savage-Dickey density ratio estimation with normalizing flows for Bayesian model comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A core motivation of science is to evaluate which scientific model best explains observed data. Bayesian model comparison provides a principled statistical approach to comparing scientific models and has found widespread application within cosmology and astrophysics. Calculating the Bayesian evidence is computationally challenging, especially as we continue to explore increasingly more complex models. The Savage-Dickey density ratio (SDDR) provides a method to calculate the Bayes factor (evidence ratio) between two nested models using only posterior samples from the super model. The SDDR requires the calculation of a normalised marginal distribution over the extra parameters of the super model, which has typically been performed using classical density estimators, such as histograms. Classical density estimators, however, can struggle to scale to high-dimensional settings. We introduce a neural SDDR approach using normalizing flows that can scale to settings where the super model contains a large number of extra parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this neural SDDR methodology applied to both toy and realistic cosmological examples. For a field-level inference setting, we show that Bayes factors computed for a Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) and simulation-based inference (SBI) approach are consistent, providing further validation that SBI extracts as much cosmological information from the field as the BHM approach. The SDDR estimator with normalizing flows is implemented in the open-source harmonic Python package.</description>

      <title>A novel test of gravity: Does spacetime geometry track matter density?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel test of gravity that combines galaxy clustering with gravitational lensing. In general relativity, the evolution of matter density fluctuations and of the Weyl potential -- the sum of spatial and temporal distortions of the geometry -- are governed by the same growth function. In contrast, alternative theories of gravity that modify the relation between geometry and matter content can lead to differences in these two growths. Exploiting a recent method to directly measure the Weyl potential, we construct a null test that deviates from zero if and only if there is a mismatch between the growth rate of density and that of geometry distortions. We show that changes in the background expansion due to alternative dark energy models and additional forces in the dark matter sector induce no deviations in this test, making it a robust probe for detecting departures from general relativity. Applying the test to current data, we find no evidence of deviation. From an initial $z_*=10$ to $z\sim 0.5$, we constrain the evolution of the Weyl potential to track that of the density to within 33\%. Combining stage-IV surveys will improve the precision across a broad redshift range, limiting differences between the two evolutions to below $2-4\%$.</description>

      <title>Cosmology Constraints from Type Ia Supernova Simulations of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Strategy Recommended by the High Latitude Time Domain Survey Definition Committee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the next few years, the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will be gathering data for the High Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS) that will be used to significantly improve the Type Ia supernova measurement of the dark energy equation of state parameters w0 and wa. Here we generate a catalog-level simulation of the in-guide strategy recommended by the HLTDS definition committee, and determine dark energy parameter constraints using a detailed analysis that includes light curve fitting, photometric redshifts and classification, BEAMS formalism, systematic uncertainties, and cosmology fitting. After analysis and selection requirements, the sample includes 10,000 Roman SNe Ia that we combine with 4,500 events from LSST. The resulting dark energy figure of merit is well above the NASA mission requirement of 326, with the caveat that SN Ia model training systematics have not been included.</description>

      <title>CSST Cosmological Emulator III: Hybrid Lagrangian Bias Expansion Emulation of Galaxy Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clustering is an important probe in the upcoming China Space Station Telescope (CSST) survey to understand the structure growth and reveal the nature of the dark sector. However, it is a long-term challenge to model this biased tracer and connect the observable to the underlying physics. In this work, we present a hybrid Lagrangian bias expansion emulator, combining the Lagrangian bias expansion and the accurate dynamical evolution from $N$-body simulation, to predict the power spectrum of the biased tracer in real space. We employ the Kun simulation suite to construct the emulator, emulating across the space of 8 cosmological parameters including dynamic dark energy $w_0$, $w_a$, and total neutrino mass $\sum m_{\nu}$. The sample variance due to the finite simulation box is further reduced using the Zel'dovich variance control, and it enables the precise measurement of the Lagrangian basis spectra up to quadratic order. The emulation of basis spectra realizes 1% level accuracy, covering wavelength $ k \leq 1 \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}h$ and redshift $0\leq z\leq 3$ up to quadratic order field. To validate the emulator, we perform the joint fitting of the halo auto power spectrum and the halo-matter cross power spectrum from 46 independent simulations. Depending on the choice of counterpart, the joint fitting is unbiased up to $k_{\rm max}\simeq 0.7\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}h$ with $1\sim 2$ percent accuracy, for all the redshift and halo mass samples. As one of the CSST cosmological emulator series, our emulator is expected to provide accurate theoretical predictions of the galaxy power spectrum for the upcoming CSST survey.</description>

      <title>Modelling the selection of galaxy groups with end to end simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback from supernovae and AGN shapes galaxy formation and evolution, yet its impact remains unclear. Galaxy groups offer a crucial probe, as their binding energy is comparable to that available from their central AGN. The XMM-Newton Group AGN Project (X-GAP) is a sample of 49 groups selected in X-ray (ROSAT) and optical (SDSS) bands, providing a benchmark for hydrodynamical simulations. In sight of such a comparison, understanding selection effects is essential. We aim to model the selection function of X-GAP by forward modelling the detection process in the X-ray and optical bands. Using the Uchuu simulation, we build a halo light cone, predict X-ray group properties with a neural network trained on hydro simulations, and assign galaxies matching observed properties. We compare the selected sample to the parent population. Our method provides a sample that matches the observed distribution of X-ray luminosity and velocity dispersion. The 50% completeness is reached at a velocity dispersion of 450 km/s in the X-GAP redshift range. The selection is driven by X-ray flux, with secondary dependence on velocity dispersion and redshift. We estimate a 93% purity level in the X-GAP parent sample. We calibrate the velocity dispersion-halo mass relation. We find a normalisation and slope in agreement with the literature, and an intrinsic scatter of about 0.06 dex. The measured velocity dispersion is accurate within 10% only for rich systems with more than about 20 members, while the velocity dispersion for groups with less than 10 members is biased at more than 20%. The X-ray follow-up refines the optical selection, enhancing purity but reducing completeness. In an SDSS-like setup, velocity dispersion measurement errors dominate over intrinsic scatter. Our selection model will enable the comparisons of thermodynamic properties and gas fractions between X-GAP groups and hydro simulations.</description>

      <title>Model selection using the HII galaxy Hubble diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proposal to use HII galaxies (HIIGx) and giant extragalactic HII regions (GEHR) as standard candles to construct the Hubble diagram at redshifts beyond the current reach of Type Ia supernovae has gained considerable support recently with the addition of five new HIIGx discovered by JWST. The updated sample of 231 sources now extends the redshift range of these objects to $z\sim 7.5$, mapping the Universe's expansion over $95\%$ of its current age. In this {\it Letter} we use these sources for model selection, and show that the $R_{\rm h}=ct$ universe is strongly favored by this probe over both flat-$\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM, with relative Bayesian Information Criterion probabilities of, respectively, $91.8\%$, $7.4\%$ and $0.8\%$. A possible caveat with these results, however, is that an unknown dispersion, $\sigma_{\rm int}$, in the HIIGx standard candle relation can weaken the model comparisons. We find that the inclusion of $\sigma_{\rm int}$ as an additional, optimizable parameter makes the likelihoods of flat-$\Lambda$CDM and $R_{\rm h}=ct$ about equal, though at the expense of creating $\sim 2.5\sigma$ tension between our inferred matter density $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and its {\it Planck}-optimized value.</description>

      <title>Probing Ultralight Axion-like Dark Matter $-$ A PTA-PPA Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight axion-like dark matter (ALDM) is a leading candidate in the dark matter realm, characterized by its prominent wave properties on astronomical scales. Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) and Pulsar Polarization Arrays (PPAs) aim to detect this dark matter through timing and polarization measurements, respectively, of pulsars. The PTA relies on gravitational effects, as the ALDM halo perturbs the spacetime metric within the Milky Way, while the PPA detects non-gravitational effects, namely cosmological birefringence induced by the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling with photons. These two methods complement each other, synergistically enhancing the pulsar array's capability to identify the ALDM signals in the data. In this article, we provide a foundational development of this synergy. We begin by revisiting previously derived two-point correlation functions for both PTA and PPA, and expand our analysis to include correlations between timing and polarization signals. We then construct likelihood functions for PTA and combined PTA-PPA analyses within a Bayesian framework, aimed at detecting the characteristic correlations of ALDM signals. We emphasize the non-Gaussianity of the ALDM timing signals, which arises from their non-linear dependence on the field, in contrast to the Gaussian nature of its polarization signals. To address the complexities introduced, we approach this investigation in two ways: one involves a Gaussian approximation with proper justifications, while the other derives the formalism from the generic Gaussian characteristics of the ALDM field. We anticipate that these efforts will lead to further developments in PTA and PTA-PPA analysis methods.</description>

      <title>Learning Balanced Field Summaries of the Large-Scale Structure with the Neural Field Scattering Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a cosmology analysis of weak lensing convergence maps using the Neural Field Scattering Transform (NFST) to constrain cosmological parameters. The NFST extends the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) by incorporating trainable neural field filters while preserving rotational and translational symmetries. This setup balances flexibility with robustness, ideal for learning in limited training data regimes. We apply the NFST to 500 simulations from the CosmoGrid suite, each providing a total of 1000 square degrees of noiseless weak lensing convergence maps. We use the resulting learned field compression to model the posterior over $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, and $w$ in a $w$CDM cosmology. The NFST consistently outperforms the WST benchmark, achieving a 16% increase in the average posterior probability density assigned to test data. Further, the NFST improves direct parameter prediction precision on $\sigma_8$ by 6% and w by 11%. We also introduce a new visualization technique to interpret the learned filters in physical space and show that the NFST adapts its feature extraction to capture task-specific information. These results establish the NFST as a promising tool for extracting maximal cosmological information from the non-Gaussian information in upcoming large-scale structure surveys, without requiring large simulated training datasets.</description>

      <title>Learning Intrinsic Alignments from Local Galaxy Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DELTA (Data-Empiric Learned Tidal Alignments), a deep learning model that isolates galaxy intrinsic alignments (IAs) from weak lensing distortions using only observational data. The model uses an Equivariant Graph Neural Network backbone suitable for capturing information from the local galaxy environment, in conjunction with a probabilistic orientation output. Unlike parametric models, DELTA flexibly learns the relationship between galaxy shapes and their local environments, without assuming an explicit IA form or relying on simulations. When applied to mock catalogs with realistic noisy IAs injected, it accurately reconstructs the noise-free, pure IA signal. Mapping these alignments provides a direct visualization of IA patterns in the mock catalogs. Combining DELTA with deep learning interpretation techniques provides further insights into the physics driving tidal relationships between galaxies. This new approach to understanding and controlling IAs is suitable for application to joint photometric and spectroscopic surveys such as the combination of upcoming Euclid, Rubin, and DESI datasets.</description>

      <title>Millimeter-wave observations of Euclid Deep Field South using the South Pole Telescope: A data release of temperature maps and catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The South Pole Telescope third-generation camera (SPT-3G) has observed over 10,000 square degrees of sky at 95, 150, and 220 GHz (3.3, 2.0, 1.4 mm, respectively) overlapping the ongoing 14,000 square-degree Euclid Wide Survey. The Euclid collaboration recently released Euclid Deep Field observations in the first quick data release (Q1). Aims. With the goal of releasing complementary millimeter-wave data and encouraging legacy science, we performed dedicated observations of a 57-square-degree field overlapping the Euclid Deep Field South (EDF-S). Methods. The observing time totaled 20 days and we reached noise depths of 4.3, 3.8, and 13.2 $\mu$K-arcmin at 95, 150, and 220 GHz, respectively. Results. In this work we present the temperature maps and two catalogs constructed from these data. The emissive source catalog contains 601 objects (334 inside EDF-S) with 54% synchrotron-dominated sources and 46% thermal dust emission-dominated sources. The 5$\sigma$ detection thresholds are 1.7, 2.0, and 6.5 mJy in the three bands. The cluster catalog contains 217 cluster candidates (121 inside EDF-S) with median mass $M_{500c}=2.12 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}/h_{70}$ and median redshift $z$ = 0.70, corresponding to an order-of-magnitude improvement in cluster density over previous tSZ-selected catalogs in this region (3.81 clusters per square degree). Conclusions. The overlap between SPT and Euclid data will enable a range of multiwavelength studies of the aforementioned source populations. This work serves as the first step towards joint projects between SPT and Euclid and provides a rich dataset containing information on galaxies, clusters, and their environments.</description>

      <title>Differential measurement of m_e/m_p: 3 mm methanol lines toward Sagittarius B2(N) and (M) molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential measurement of the fundamental physical constant mu = m_e/m_p (the electron-to-proton mass ratio) toward two sources located near the Galactic center - the Sagittarius (Sgr) B2(N) and (M) molecular clouds - show a lower mu compared to its terrestrial value. Based on methanol (CH3OH) emission lines from the frequency range 80-112 GHz (IRAM 30-m telescope archival data), the calculated difference (Delta mu)/mu = (mu_obs - mu_lab)/mu_lab is equal to (-3.0 +/- 0.6)*10^(-7) (1 sigma C.L.) in the whole cloud SgrB2. The revealed 5 sigma signal in mu-variations agrees within the margin of error with the recently obtained result based on methanol emission lines from the higher frequency range 542-543 GHz (Herschel space telescope archival data) for SgrB2(N): (Delta mu)/mu = (-4.2 +/- 0.7)*10^(-7).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though an anti-de Sitter (AdS) vacuum, corresponding to a negative cosmological constant (NCC), can be not responsible for the acceleration of current universe, it might coexist with one evolving positive dark energy component at low redshift, as well as with early dark energy around the recombination to solve the Hubble tension. In this paper, we investigate the scenario with one AdS vacuum around the recombination and one at low redshift, and from both current observational and theoretical perspectives preliminarily explore the possibility that the universe experienced a landscape with multiple AdS vacua since matter-radiation equality.</description>

      <title>Discretely Evanescent Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new UV-complete dark energy model which is \underbar{\it neither} a cosmological constant nor a slowly rolling scalar field. Our dark energy is the flux of a top form in a hidden sector gauge theory similar to QCD. The top form controls the vacuum energy generated by dark sector CP violation. Its flux discharges by the nucleation of membranes that source it. The tension and charge of the membranes are set by the chiral symmetry breaking scale $\sim 10^{-3} eV$, and the dark energy is a transient. It decays on the order of the current age of the universe. The decays decrease dark energy discretely and randomly, instead of gradually like rolling scalars. Since the decay rate is close to the present Hubble scale, $\Gamma \ga H_0^4$, in a time $\sim {\cal O}(1/H_0)$ the cosmic acceleration may even cease altogether.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter may freeze-out and undergo composite assembly while decoupled from the Standard Model. In this secluded composite scenario, while individual dark matter particles may be too weakly-coupled to detect, the assembled composite can potentially be detected since its effective coupling scales with number of constituents. We examine models and observables for secluded composites, and in particular we investigate the cosmological abundance of the composite binding field, which is generated during freeze-out annihilation and secluded composite assembly. This binding field could be discovered as a new relativistic species in the early universe or through later interactions as a subdominant dark component.</description>

      <title>Initial Characterization of Stellar Photometry of Roman images from the OpenUniverse Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will provide an opportunity to study dark energy with unprecedented precision and accuracy using several techniques, including measurements of high-$z$ Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia, $z \lesssim 3.0$) via the High-Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS). In this work, we do an initial "benchmark" characterization of the photometric repeatability of stellar fluxes, which must be below $1\%$ when sky noise is subdominant in order xto enable a number of calibration requirements. Achieving this level of flux precision requires attention to Roman's highly-structured, spatially-varying, undersampled PSF. In this work, we build a library of effective PSFs (ePSFs) compatible with the OpenUniverse HLTDS simulations. Using our library of ePSFs, we recover fractional flux between $0.6 - 1.2\%$ photometric precision, finding that redder bands perform better by this metric. We also find that flux recovery is improved by up to $20\%$ when a chip (sensor chip assembly; SCA) is divided into 8 sub-SCAs in order to account for the spatial variation of the PSF. With our optimized algorithm, we measure non-linearity due to photometry (magnitude dependence) of $|s_{NL}| &lt; 1.93 \times 10^{-3}$ per dex, which is still larger than stated requirements for detector effects and indicates that further work is necessary. We also measure the dependence of photometric residuals on stellar color, and find the largest possible dependence in R062, implying a color-dependent PSF model may be needed. Finally, we characterize the detection efficiency function of each OpenUniverse Roman filter, which will inform future studies.</description>

      <title>A large, chemically enriched, neutral gas reservoir in a galaxy at z = 6.782</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chemical characterization of galaxies in the first billion years after the Big Bang is one of the central goals of current astrophysics. Optical/near-infrared spectroscopy of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been heralded as an effective diagnostic to probe the interstellar medium of their host galaxies and their metal and dust content, up to the highest redshift. An opportunity to fulfill this expectation was provided by the recent blast triggered by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory of GRB 240218A at redshift z=6.782. We study a high-redshift galaxy selected in a complementary way with respect to flux-limited surveys, not depending on galaxy luminosity and stellar mass. We present the VLT/X-shooter spectrum of its afterglow enabling the detection of neutral-hydrogen, low-ionization, high-ionization and fine-structure absorption lines. We determine the metallicity, kinematics and chemical abundance pattern, providing the first detailed characterization of the neutral gas of a galaxy at z&gt;6.5. From the analysis of fine-structure lines we estimate the distance of the closest gas clouds as $d_{II}=620^{+230}_{-140}$ pc. We determine a high neutral hydrogen column density, $\log(N(HI)/cm^{-2})=22.5\pm0.3$, which is the highest one at z&gt;6 determined so far for a GRB host galaxy, as well as a surprisingly high metal column density, $\log(N(ZnII)/cm^{-2})&gt;14.3$. The observed metallicity of the host galaxy system is [Zn/H]&gt;-0.8. We find evidence of a high amount of dust depletion and of aluminum overabundance, although a number of transitions are saturated. The high hydrogen column density, metal abundances and dust depletion in the neutral gas align with those of the ionized gas of very high-redshift galaxies unveiled by ALMA and JWST, testifying that a rapid build up of metals and dust, and massive neutral hydrogen reservoirs seem to be common features of galaxies in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative determination of the sphaleron rate for first-order phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many extensions of the Standard Model electroweak phase transitions at high temperatures can be described in a minimal dimensionally reduced effective theory with SU(2) gauge field and fundamental Higgs scalar. In this effective theory, all thermodynamic information is governed by two dimensionless ratios $x \equiv \lambda_3/g^2_3$ and $y\equiv m^2_3/g^4_3$, where $\lambda_3$, $m^2_3$ and $g_3$ are the effective thermal scalar self-interaction coupling, the thermal mass and the effective gauge-coupling, respectively. By using non-perturbative lattice simulations to determine the rate of sphaleron transitions in the entire $(x,y)$-plane corresponding to the Higgs phase, and by applying previous lattice results for the bubble nucleation, we find a condition $x(T_c) \lesssim 0.025$ to guarantee preservation of the baryon asymmetry, which translates to $v/T_c \equiv \sqrt{2 \langle \phi^\dagger \phi \rangle}/T_c \gtrsim 1.33$ for the (gauge-invariant) Higgs condensate. This indicates that viability of the electroweak baryogenesis requires the phase transition to be slightly stronger than previously anticipated. Finally, we present a general template for analysing such viability in a wide class of beyond the Standard Model theories, in which new fields are heavy enough to be integrated out at high temperature.</description>

      <title>The Hourglass Simulation: A Catalog for the Roman High-Latitude Time-Domain Core Community Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simulation of the time-domain catalog for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope's High-Latitude Time-Domain Core Community Survey. This simulation, called the Hourglass simulation, uses the most up-to-date spectral energy distribution models and rate measurements for ten extra-galactic time-domain sources. We simulate these models through the design reference Roman Space Telescope survey: four filters per tier, a five day cadence, over two years, a wide tier of 19 deg$^2$ and a deep tier of 4.2 deg$^2$, with $\sim$20% of those areas also covered with prism observations. We find that a science-independent Roman time-domain catalog, assuming a S/N at max of &gt;5, would have approximately 21,000 Type Ia supernovae, 40,000 core-collapse supernovae, around 70 superluminous supernovae, $\sim$35 tidal disruption events, 3 kilonovae, and possibly pair-instability supernovae. In total, Hourglass has over 64,000 transient objects, 11 million photometric observations, and 500,000 spectra. Additionally, Hourglass is a useful data set to train machine learning classification algorithms. We show that SCONE is able to photometrically classify Type Ia supernovae with high precision ($\sim$95%) to a z &gt; 2. Finally, we present the first realistic simulations of non-Type Ia supernovae spectral-time series data from Roman's prism.</description>

      <title>2024 TASI Lectures: A Dark Matter Primer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These notes are based on a sequence of 4 lectures delivered at the 2024 Theoretical Advanced Study Institute (TASI) and at the Universit\`a degli Studi di Padova. They are intended for graduate students at the early stages of their study of dark matter with some prior exposure to cosmology and quantum field theory. The primary aim is to offer an accessible introduction to dark matter and to lay the groundwork for exploring its phenomenology. These lectures are not intended to serve as a comprehensive review. We begin by motivating the study of dark matter through a discussion of the empirical evidence and the constraints it places on dark matter properties.

      <title>Learning from Topology: Cosmological Parameter Estimation from the Large-scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topology of the large-scale structure of the universe contains valuable information on the underlying cosmological parameters. While persistent homology can extract this topological information, the optimal method for parameter estimation from the tool remains an open question. To address this, we propose a neural network model to map persistence images to cosmological parameters. Through a parameter recovery test, we demonstrate that our model makes accurate and precise estimates, considerably outperforming conventional Bayesian inference approaches.</description>

      <title>Detection prospects for the GW background of Galactic (sub)solar mass primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In multi-component dark matter models, a fraction $f_\text{pbh}$ of the dark matter could be in the form of primordial black holes (PBHs) with (sub)solar masses. Some would have formed binaries that presently trace the Milky Way halo of particle dark matter. We explore the gravitational wave (GW) signal produced by such a hypothetical population of Galactic PBH binaries and assess its detectability by the LISA experiment. For this purpose, we model the formation and evolution of early-type PBH binaries accounting for GW hardening and binary disruption in the Milky Way. Our analysis reveals that the present-day Galactic population of PBH binaries is characterized by very high orbital eccentricities $|1-e|\ll 1$. For a PBH mass $M_{\rm pbh} \sim 0.1 - 1 M_\odot$, this yields a GW background that peaks in the millihertz frequency range where the LISA instrumental noise is minimum. While this signal remains below the LISA detection threshold for viable $f_\text{pbh}\lesssim 0.01$, future GW observatories such as DECIGO and BBO could detect it if $0.01\lesssim M_{\rm pbh} \lesssim 0.1 M_\odot$. Furthermore, we anticipate that, after 5 years of observations, LISA should be able to detect $\mathcal{O}(100)$ (resp. $\mathcal{O}(1)$) loud Galactic PBH binaries of mass $M_{\rm pbh} \sim 0.1 - 1 M_\odot$ with a SNR $\geq 5$ if $f_{\rm pbh}=0.01$ (resp. $f_{\rm pbh}=0.001$). Nonlinear effects not considered here such as mass accretion and dynamical capture could alter these predictions.</description>

      <title>MUltiplexed Survey Telescope: Perspectives for Large-Scale Structure Cosmology in the Era of Stage-V Spectroscopic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The MUltiplexed Survey Telescope (MUST) is a 6.5-meter telescope under development. Dedicated to highly-multiplexed, wide-field spectroscopic surveys, MUST observes over 20,000 targets simultaneously using 6.2-mm pitch positioning robots within a ~5 deg$^2$ field of view. MUST aims to conduct the first Stage-V spectroscopic survey in the 2030s, mapping the 3D Universe with over 100 million galaxies and quasars, spanning from the nearby Universe to a redshift of z ~ 5.5, corresponding to approximately 1 billion years after the Big Bang. To cover this extensive redshift range, we present an initial conceptual target selection algorithm for different types of galaxies, ranging from local bright galaxies and luminous red galaxies to emission-line galaxies, and high-redshift (2 &lt; z &lt; 5.5) Lyman-break galaxies. Using Fisher forecasts, we demonstrate that MUST can address fundamental questions in cosmology, including the nature of dark energy, tests of gravity theories, and investigations into primordial physics. This is the first paper in the series of science white papers for MUST, with subsequent developments focusing on additional scientific cases such as galaxy and quasar evolution, Milky Way physics, and dynamic phenomena in the time-domain Universe.</description>

      <title>Improving cosmological constraints via galaxy intrinsic alignment in full-shape analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic alignment (IA) of galaxy shapes probes the underlying gravitational tidal field, thus offering cosmological information complementary to galaxy clustering. In this paper, we perform a Fisher forecast to assess the benefit of IA in improving cosmological parameter constraints, for the first time, leveraging the full-shape (FS) information of IA statistics. Our forecast is based on PFS-like and Euclid-like surveys as examples of deep and wide galaxy surveys, respectively. We explore various cosmological models, with the most comprehensive one simultaneously including dynamical dark energy, curvature, massive neutrinos, and modified gravity (MG). We find that adding FS IA information significantly tightens cosmological constraints relative to the FS clustering-only cases, particularly for dynamical dark energy and nonflat-MG models. For a deep galaxy survey, the Figure-of-Merit for the dark energy equation of state parameters is improved by at least more than $40\%$ in all dynamical dark energy models investigated. For nonflat-MG models, parameter constraints are tightened by $6-28\%$, except for the dark matter density and spectral index parameters. For a wide galaxy survey, improvements with IA become milder, although its joint constraints are tighter than those from the deep survey. Our findings highlight the efficacy of the galaxy IA as a complementary cosmological probe to galaxy clustering.</description>

      <title>Assessing cosmological evidence for non-minimal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent observational evidence of deviations from the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model points towards the presence of evolving dark energy. The simplest possibility consists of a cosmological scalar field $\varphi$, dubbed quintessence, driving the accelerated expansion. We assess the evidence for the existence of such a scalar field. We find that, if the accelerated expansion is driven by quintessence, the data favour a potential energy $V(\varphi)$ that is concave, i.e., $m^2=d^2V/d\varphi^2&lt;0$. Furthermore, and more significantly, the data strongly favour a scalar field that is non-minimally coupled to gravity (Bayes factor $\log(B) = 7.34 \pm 0.6$), leading to time variations in the gravitational constant on cosmological scales, and the existence of fifth forces on smaller scales. The fact that we do not observe such fifth forces implies that either new physics must come into play on non-cosmological scales or that quintessence is an unlikely explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a two-parameter phenomenological extension of the $\Lambda$CDM model in which the equation of state parameter of the ``dust'' fluid becomes different from zero for redshifts below a transition value $z_t$. Using data from DESI DR2 BAO, DESY5 Sn~Ia and CMB distance priors ($R,l_A,\omega_b$) data, we compare our model with the standard CPL parameterization $w_0-w_a$ for dynamical dark energy. Using the Deviance Information Criteria (DIC), we find that the two models are essentially indistinguishable ($\Delta$DIC $&lt;$ 2) and preferred over $\Lambda$CDM with a significance $\geq 3 \sigma$. We discuss how this parameterization finds a natural interpretation in the context of cosmological backreaction and derive a prediction for the evolution of the growth factor, discussing its impact on low redshift $f\sigma_8$ measurements.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave constraints on the primordial black hole dominated early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.08151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the gravitational waves (GWs) induced by the density fluctuations due to inhomogeneous distribution of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the case where PBHs eventually dominate and reheat the universe by Hawking evaporation. The initial PBH density fluctuations are isocurvature in nature. We find that most of the induced GWs are generated right after evaporation, when the universe transits from the PBH dominated era to the radiation dominated era and the curvature perturbation starts to oscillate wildly. The strongest constraint on the amount of the produced GWs comes from the big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). We improve previous constraints on the PBH fraction and find that it cannot exceed $10^{-3}$. Furthermore, this maximum fraction decreases as the mass increases and reaches $10^{-9}$ for $M_{\rm PBH}\sim 5\times10^8 {\rm g}$, which is the largest mass allowed by the BBN constraint on the reheating temperature. Considering that PBH may cluster above a given clustering scale, we also derive a lower bound on the scale of clustering. Interestingly, the GW spectrum for $M_{\rm PBH}\sim 10^4 -10^8 {\rm g}$ enters the observational window of LIGO and DECIGO and could be tested in the future. Although we focus on the PBH dominated early universe in this paper, our methodology is applicable to any model with early isocurvature perturbation.</description>

      <title>Learned harmonic mean estimation of the Bayesian evidence with normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the learned harmonic mean estimator with normalizing flows - a robust, scalable and flexible estimator of the Bayesian evidence for model comparison. Since the estimator is agnostic to sampling strategy and simply requires posterior samples, it can be applied to compute the evidence using any Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling technique, including saved down MCMC chains, or any variational inference approach. The learned harmonic mean estimator was recently introduced, where machine learning techniques were developed to learn a suitable internal importance sampling target distribution to solve the issue of exploding variance of the original harmonic mean estimator. In this article we present the use of normalizing flows as the internal machine learning technique within the learned harmonic mean estimator. Normalizing flows can be elegantly coupled with the learned harmonic mean to provide an approach that is more robust, flexible and scalable than the machine learning models considered previously. We perform a series of numerical experiments, applying our method to benchmark problems and to a cosmological example in up to 21 dimensions. We find the learned harmonic mean estimator is in agreement with ground truth values and nested sampling estimates. The open-source harmonic Python package implementing the learned harmonic mean, now with normalizing flows included, is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Coevolution of Dwarf Galaxies and Their Circumgalactic Medium Across Cosmic Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies are thought of as the building blocks of large galaxies such as our Milky Way. This paper presents new high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies and their intergalactic medium with the \texttt{GIZMO} code. Our simulations consider the key physical processes of galaxy evolution, such as gas cooling, chemistry, and stellar and black hole feedback. Unlike the previous work, the initial conditions of our simulations taking the dwarf galaxies of $2-5 \times 10^{10} \, M_\odot$ from the realistic cosmology simulations, \texttt{IllustrisTNG}. We further increase the original resolution of \texttt{IllustrisTNG} by a factor of $\sim 100$ via a particle splitting scheme. Our results show that the evolution of complex multiphase CGM and its metal content is sensitive to the redshift of dwarf galaxies. The accretion of CGM into dwarf galaxies plays a key role in providing $20 \% - 50 \%$ of the star-forming gas and replenishing $40 \% - 70 \%$ of the total mass in the galactic disk. Furthermore, the accretion history of supermassive black holes in the centers of high-$z$ dwarf galaxies shows episodic patterns with high-accreting states close to $\sim 10 \%$ of the Eddington mass accretion rate, implying the rapid growth of supermassive black holes in the early universe, which may be revealed by the coming observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).</description>

      <title>GHOST commissioning science results -- IV: Chemodynamical analyses of Milky Way satellites Sagittarius II and Aquarius II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Gemini/GHOST high-resolution spectra of five stars observed in two low surface brightness Milky Way satellites, Sagittarius II (Sgr2) and Aquarius II (Aqu2). For Aqu2, the velocities and metallicities of the two stars are consistent with membership in a dark matter-dominated ultra faint dwarf galaxy (UFD). The chemical abundance ratios suggest inefficient star formation from only one or a few supernovae (e.g., low Na, Sr, Ba), and enriched potassium (K) from super-AGB stars. For Sgr2, the velocity and metallicity dispersions of its members are not clearly resolved and our detailed chemical abundances show typical ratios for metal-poor stars, with low dispersions. There is only one exception - we report the discovery of an r-process enhanced star (Sgr2584, [Eu/Fe]= $+0.7 \pm 0.2 $; thus, an r-I star). As r-I stars are found in both UFDs (Tuc III, Tuc IV, Grus II) and globular clusters (M15 and M92), then this does not help to further classify the nature of Sgr2. Our exploration of Sgr2 demonstrates the difficulty in classifying some of the faintest (ambiguous) satellites. We advocate for additional diagnostics in analysing the ambiguous systems, such as exploring radial segregation (by mass and/or chemistry), N-body simulations, and the need for dark matter to survive Galactic tidal effects. The spectra analysed in this paper were taken as part of the GHOST commissioning observations, testing faint observation limits (G &lt; 18.8) and the single and double IFU observing modes.</description>

      <title>Exploring over 700 massive quiescent galaxies at z = 2-7: Demographics and stellar mass functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-redshift ($z&gt;2$) massive quiescent galaxies are crucial tests of early galaxy formation and evolutionary mechanisms through their cosmic number densities and stellar mass functions (SMFs). We explore a sample of 745 massive ($\rm M_*&gt; 10^{9.5}M_\odot$) quiescent galaxies from $z=2-7$ in over 800 arcmin$^2$ of NIRCam imaging from a compilation of public JWST fields (with a total area $&gt;$ 5 $\times$ previous JWST studies). We compute and report their cosmic number densities, stellar mass functions, and cosmic stellar mass density. We confirm a significant overabundance of massive quiescent galaxies relative to a range of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and semi-analytic models (SAMs). We find that one SAM, SHARK is able to reproduce our observed number density with the addition of mock observational errors, but that it is still unable to produce quiescent galaxies of the same masses. We find that no simulations or SAMs accurately reproduce the SMF for massive quiescent galaxies at any redshift within the interval $z=2-5$. This shows that none of these models' feedback prescriptions are fully capturing high-z galaxy quenching, challenging the standard formation scenarios. We find a greater abundance of lower-mass ($\rm M_*&lt;10^{10}M_\odot$) quiescent galaxies than previously found, highlighting the importance of sSFR cuts rather than simple colour selection. We show the importance of this selection bias, alongside individual field-to-field variations caused by cosmic variance, in varying the observed quiescent galaxy SMF, especially at higher-z. We also find a steeper increase in the cosmic stellar mass density for massive quiescent galaxies than has been seen previously, with an increase of around a factor of 60 from $z=4.5$ to $z=2$, indicating the increasing importance of galaxy quenching within these epochs.</description>
