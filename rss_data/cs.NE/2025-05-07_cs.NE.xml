      <title>Accelerating Evolution: Integrating PSO Principles into Real-Coded Genetic Algorithm Crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces an innovative crossover operator named Particle Swarm Optimization-inspired Crossover (PSOX), which is specifically developed for real-coded genetic algorithms. Departing from conventional crossover approaches that only exchange information between individuals within the same generation, PSOX uniquely incorporates guidance from both the current global best solution and historical optimal solutions across multiple generations. This novel mechanism enables the algorithm to maintain population diversity while simultaneously accelerating convergence toward promising regions of the search space. The effectiveness of PSOX is rigorously evaluated through comprehensive experiments on 15 benchmark test functions with diverse characteristics, including unimodal, multimodal, and highly complex landscapes. Comparative analysis against five state-of-the-art crossover operators reveals that PSOX consistently delivers superior performance in terms of solution accuracy, algorithmic stability, and convergence speed, especially when combined with an appropriate mutation strategy. Furthermore, the study provides an in-depth investigation of how different mutation rates influence PSOX's performance, yielding practical guidelines for parameter tuning when addressing optimization problems with varying landscape properties.</description>

      <title>From Neurons to Computation: Biological Reservoir Computing for Pattern Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm for reservoir computing (RC) that leverages a pool of cultured biological neurons as the reservoir substrate, creating a biological reservoir computing (BRC). This system operates similarly to an echo state network (ESN), with the key distinction that the neural activity is generated by a network of cultured neurons, rather than being modeled by traditional artificial computational units. The neuronal activity is recorded using a multi-electrode array (MEA), which enables high-throughput recording of neural signals. In our approach, inputs are introduced into the network through a subset of the MEA electrodes, while the remaining electrodes capture the resulting neural activity. This generates a nonlinear mapping of the input data to a high-dimensional biological feature space, where distinguishing between data becomes more efficient and straightforward, allowing a simple linear classifier to perform pattern recognition tasks effectively. To evaluate the performance of our proposed system, we present an experimental study that includes various input patterns, such as positional codes, bars with different orientations, and a digit recognition task. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using biological neural networks to perform tasks traditionally handled by artificial neural networks, paving the way for further exploration of biologically-inspired computing systems, with potential applications in neuromorphic engineering and bio-hybrid computing.</description>

      <title>Artificial Protozoa Optimizer (APO): A novel bio-inspired metaheuristic algorithm for engineering optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel artificial protozoa optimizer (APO) that is inspired by protozoa in nature. The APO mimics the survival mechanisms of protozoa by simulating their foraging, dormancy, and reproductive behaviors. The APO was mathematically modeled and implemented to perform the optimization processes of metaheuristic algorithms. The performance of the APO was verified via experimental simulations and compared with 32 state-of-the-art algorithms. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed for pairwise comparisons of the proposed APO with the state-of-the-art algorithms, and Friedman test was used for multiple comparisons. First, the APO was tested using 12 functions of the 2022 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation benchmark. Considering practicality, the proposed APO was used to solve five popular engineering design problems in a continuous space with constraints. Moreover, the APO was applied to solve a multilevel image segmentation task in a discrete space with constraints. The experiments confirmed that the APO could provide highly competitive results for optimization problems. The source codes of Artificial Protozoa Optimizer are publicly available at https://seyedalimirjalili.com/projects and https://ww2.mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/162656-artificial-protozoa-optimizer.</description>

      <title>Neural Orchestration for Multi-Agent Systems: A Deep Learning Framework for Optimal Agent Selection in Multi-Domain Task Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are foundational in simulating complex real-world scenarios involving autonomous, interacting entities. However, traditional MAS architectures often suffer from rigid coordination mechanisms and difficulty adapting to dynamic tasks. We propose MetaOrch, a neural orchestration framework for optimal agent selection in multi-domain task environments. Our system implements a supervised learning approach that models task context, agent histories, and expected response quality to select the most appropriate agent for each task. A novel fuzzy evaluation module scores agent responses along completeness, relevance, and confidence dimensions, generating soft supervision labels for training the orchestrator. Unlike previous methods that hard-code agent-task mappings, MetaOrch dynamically predicts the most suitable agent while estimating selection confidence. Experiments in simulated environments with heterogeneous agents demonstrate that our approach achieves 86.3% selection accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline strategies including random selection and round-robin scheduling. The modular architecture emphasizes extensibility, allowing agents to be registered, updated, and queried independently. Results suggest that neural orchestration offers a powerful approach to enhancing the autonomy, interpretability, and adaptability of multi-agent systems across diverse task domains.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Exploratory Learning-Aided Community Detection Under Topological Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04497v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In social networks, the discovery of community structures has received considerable attention as a fundamental problem in various network analysis tasks. However, due to privacy concerns or access restrictions, the network structure is often uncertain, thereby rendering established community detection approaches ineffective without costly network topology acquisition. To tackle this challenge, we present META-CODE, a unified framework for detecting overlapping communities via exploratory learning aided by easy-to-collect node metadata when networks are topologically unknown (or only partially known). Specifically, META-CODE consists of three iterative steps in addition to the initial network inference step: 1) node-level community-affiliation embeddings based on graph neural networks (GNNs) trained by our new reconstruction loss, 2) network exploration via community-affiliation-based node queries, and 3) network inference using an edge connectivity-based Siamese neural network model from the explored network. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets including two large networks, we demonstrate: (a) the superiority of META-CODE over benchmark community detection methods, achieving remarkable gains up to 65.55% on the Facebook dataset over the best competitor among our selected competitive methods in terms of normalized mutual information (NMI), (b) the impact of each module in META-CODE, (c) the effectiveness of node queries in META-CODE based on empirical evaluations and theoretical findings, and (d) the convergence of the inferred network.</description>

      <title>Towards Combinatorial Interpretability of Neural Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce combinatorial interpretability, a methodology for understanding neural computation by analyzing the combinatorial structures in the sign-based categorization of a network's weights and biases. We demonstrate its power through feature channel coding, a theory that explains how neural networks compute Boolean expressions and potentially underlies other categories of neural network computation. According to this theory, features are computed via feature channels: unique cross-neuron encodings shared among the inputs the feature operates on. Because different feature channels share neurons, the neurons are polysemantic and the channels interfere with one another, making the computation appear inscrutable.
  We show how to decipher these computations by analyzing a network's feature channel coding, offering complete mechanistic interpretations of several small neural networks that were trained with gradient descent. Crucially, this is achieved via static combinatorial analysis of the weight matrices, without examining activations or training new autoencoding networks. Feature channel coding reframes the superposition hypothesis, shifting the focus from neuron activation directionality in high-dimensional space to the combinatorial structure of codes. It also allows us for the first time to exactly quantify and explain the relationship between a network's parameter size and its computational capacity (i.e. the set of features it can compute with low error), a relationship that is implicitly at the core of many modern scaling laws.
  Though our initial studies of feature channel coding are restricted to Boolean functions, we believe they provide a rich, controlled, and informative research space, and that the path we propose for combinatorial interpretation of neural computation can provide a basis for understanding both artificial and biological neural circuits.</description>

      <title>ABG-NAS: Adaptive Bayesian Genetic Neural Architecture Search for Graph Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective and efficient graph representation learning is essential for enabling critical downstream tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and subgraph search. However, existing graph neural network (GNN) architectures often struggle to adapt to diverse and complex graph structures, limiting their ability to produce structure-aware and task-discriminative representations. To address this challenge, we propose ABG-NAS, a novel framework for automated graph neural network architecture search tailored for efficient graph representation learning. ABG-NAS encompasses three key components: a Comprehensive Architecture Search Space (CASS), an Adaptive Genetic Optimization Strategy (AGOS), and a Bayesian-Guided Tuning Module (BGTM). CASS systematically explores diverse propagation (P) and transformation (T) operations, enabling the discovery of GNN architectures capable of capturing intricate graph characteristics. AGOS dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring search efficiency and preserving solution diversity. BGTM further optimizes hyperparameters periodically, enhancing the scalability and robustness of the resulting architectures. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets (Cora, PubMed, Citeseer, and CoraFull) demonstrate that ABG-NAS consistently outperforms both manually designed GNNs and state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) methods. These results highlight the potential of ABG-NAS to advance graph representation learning by providing scalable and adaptive solutions for diverse graph structures. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/sserranw/ABG-NAS.</description>

      <title>Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Z-Score Gradient Filtering for Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves neural network generalization by optimizing the worst-case loss within a neighborhood of parameters, yet it perturbs parameters using the entire gradient vector, including components with low statistical significance. We introduce ZSharp, a refined sharpness-aware optimization method that incorporates layer-wise Z-score normalization followed by percentile-based filtering. This process selects only the most statistically significant gradient components-those with large standardized magnitudes-for constructing the perturbation direction. ZSharp retains the standard two-phase SAM structure of ascent and descent while modifying the ascent step to focus on sharper, curvature-relevant directions. We evaluate ZSharp on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet using a range of models including ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers. Across all architectures and datasets, ZSharp consistently achieves higher test accuracy compared to SAM, ASAM, and Friendly-SAM. These results indicate that Z-score-based gradient filtering can enhance the sharpness sensitivity of the update direction, leading to improved generalization in deep neural network training.</description>
