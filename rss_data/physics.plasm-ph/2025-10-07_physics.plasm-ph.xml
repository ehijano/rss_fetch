      <title>Spectroscopic measurements of graphite electrode erosion on the ZaP-HD sheared-flow-stabilized Z-pinch device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ionizations per photon, or S/XB, method uses spectroscopic measurements of radiating impurity ions to determine the influx from a solid surface. It is highly useful as a non-perturbing, in-situ measure of the gross erosion flux of plasma-facing components (PFCs). In sheared-flow-stabilized (SFS) Z-pinch devices, the electrode supplies the plasma current and directly contacts the core Z-pinch plasma. Electrode erosion due to the large particle and heat fluxes affects electrode durability, which is an important factor in existing and future devices. An improved understanding of these plasma-electrode interactions is required, in particular as energy density increases. Experiments on the ZaP-HD device investigate erosion of the graphite electrode by applying the S/XB method for C-III emission at 229.7 nm. The S/XB coefficients are determined from electron density and temperature profiles obtained from Digital Holographic Interferometry (DHI) measurements. An approach for expanding these profiles to represent plasma contacting the electrode is described. In both cases, the measured erosion fluxes are on the order of 10$^{30}$-10$^{31}$ atoms m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. These values are significantly larger than the expected erosion flux due to physical sputtering of H$^+$ ions on carbon, but are comparable to theoretical sublimation fluxes. This suggests that the source of carbon erosion flux is primarily from sublimation as opposed to sputtering. The dominance of sublimation over sputtering processes implies a difference in energy of the eroded neutrals which may provide insight on redeposition and net erosion behavior.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Energy-Conserving Particle Method for the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an explicit particle method for the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation that conserves energy at the fully discrete level. The method features two key components: a deterministic and conservative particle discretization for the nonlinear Fokker-Planck operator (also known as the Lenard-Bernstein or Dougherty operator), and a second-order explicit time integrator that ensures energy conservation through an accuracy-justifiable correction. We validate the method on several plasma benchmarks, including collisional Landau damping and two-stream instability, demonstrating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>A Particle-in-Cell Simulation Framework for Thomson Scattering Analysis in Inertial Confinement Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion (ICF), Thomson scattering (TS) is a widely used diagnostic technique for probing plasma conditions. We present a first-principles numerical approach to obtaining scattered light signals of ion acoustic features with high resolution in angle and frequency space using particle-in-cell simulations under typical ICF conditions. Our method demonstrates good agreement with existing theories for thermal collective TS. In the super-thermal collective regime, the results align with theory when the driven plasma modes are well-matched in wave vectors to the probe and collecting beams. Moreover, we also find that TS signals can remain significant even under imperfect wave-vector matching-a result that contradicts the conventional expectation that the TS spectrum strictly follows the plasma density spectrum. We attribute this discrepancy to a beating wave mechanism arising from the interaction between the probe beam and driven plasma density modulations. Our work thus provides a practical framework for interpreting TS signals from driven ion modes, a common yet complex feature in ICF plasmas.</description>

      <title>Non-local transport in Radiation-Hydrodynamics codes for ICF by efficient coupling to an external Vlasov-Fokker-Planck code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately incorporating non-local transport into radiation-hydrodynamics codes, and indeed any fluid system, has long been elusive. To date, a simplified and accurate theory that can be easily integrated has not been available. This limitation affects modeling in inertial confinement fusion and magnetic confinement fusion systems, among others, where non-local transport is well-known to be present. Here, we present a coupling methodology between a full Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) electron kinetic code and radiation-hydrodynamics (rad-hydro) codes. The VFP code is used to adjust native electron transport in the rad-hydro code, thus enabling improved transport without the need to integrate a full electron VFP solver into the rad-hydro code. This approach necessitates only occasional invocation of the VFP code, reducing computational intensity compared to following the dynamic evolution entirely with the VFP code on fluid time scales. We illustrate that the methodology is more accurate than other simplified methods in thermal decay systems relevant to inertial confinement fusion and can replicate standard theoretical results with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Numerical Demonstration of Kolmogorov Scaling in Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two leading models of isotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence have competing predictions: $k^{-5/3}$ (Kolmogorov) and $k^{-3/2}$ (Iroshnikov-Kraichnan) scalings. This paper identifies the valid MHD turbulence model using high-resolution numerical and diagnostics-structure functions, intermittency exponents, and energy spectra and fluxes of imbalance MHD. The energy spectra of our forced MHD simulations on $8192^2$, $4096^2$, $1024^3$, and $512^3$ support Kolmogorov's k^{-5/3} spectrum over Iroshnikov-Kraichnan's k^{-3/2} spectrum, but the difference in the spectral exponents is small. However, the numerically computed third-order structure functions and intermittency exponents support Kolmogorov scaling in both two and three dimensions. Also, the energy fluxes of the imbalance MHD follow the predictions of Kolmogorov scaling. These results would help in better modelling of solar wind, solar corona, and dynamos.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Frontiers of Light: Magnetized Plasma Lenses and Chirp Tailoring for Extreme Intensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, an innovative scheme is proposed that exploits the response of magnetized plasmas to realize a refractive index exceeding unity for right circularly polarized (RCP) waves. Using two- and three-dimensional Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations with the OSIRIS 4.0 framework, it is shown that a shaped magnetized plasma lens (MPL) can act as a glass/solid-state-based convex lens, amplifying laser intensity via transverse focusing. Moreover, by integrating three key ingredients, a tailored plasma lens geometry, a spatially structured strong magnetic field, and a suitably chirped laser pulse, simultaneous focusing and compression of the pulse has been achieved. The simulations reveal up to a 100-fold increase in laser intensity, enabled by the combined action of the MPL and the chirped pulse profile. With recent advances in high-field magnet technology, shaped plasma targets, and controlled chirped laser systems, this approach offers a promising pathway toward experimentally reaching extreme intensities.</description>

      <title>Electrospray Thruster Plume Impingement on CubeSat Solar Arrays: A Particle-Tracking Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrospray thrusters are emerging as a leading propulsion technology for CubeSats, offering high specific impulse ($I_{sp} &gt; 1000$ s) and low power requirements. However, the divergent ion plumes can impinge on spacecraft surfaces, particularly body-mounted solar arrays, causing contamination and thrust efficiency losses. This study presents a validated particle-tracking simulation to quantify the effects of thruster placement on thrust efficiency and surface contamination for 1U, 3U, and 6U CubeSats. The plume model employs a cosine power distribution ($k=1.8$) with half-angle $46^\circ$, validated against experimental data with errors below 7%. Results show that thrust efficiency ranges from 53.6% for rear-mounted thrusters on 3U body-mounted configurations to 100% for side-mounted configurations with deployable arrays. CubeSat size significantly affects impingement: 3U platforms experience 46.4% contamination with rear-mounted thrusters compared to 16.6% for 1U. Deployable solar arrays reduce contamination by 77% compared to body-mounted arrays, while side-mounted thrusters eliminate impingement entirely at the cost of only 1.6% efficiency loss. Corner-mounted configurations at $30^\circ$ cant provide intermediate performance with 88.9% efficiency and 11.1% contamination. These quantitative design guidelines enable mission planners to optimize thruster integration based on power budget and propellant mass constraints, with statistical uncertainty below 0.15% across all configurations.</description>

      <title>On the existence of fibered three-dimensional perfect fluid equilibria without continuous Euclidean symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02955v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following Lortz, we construct a family of smooth steady states of the ideal, incompressible Euler equation in three dimensions that possess no continuous Euclidean symmetry. As in Lortz, they do possess a planar reflection symmetry and, as such, all the orbits of the velocity are closed. Different from Lortz, our construction has a discrete m-fold symmetry and is foliated by invariant cylindrical level sets of a non-degenerate Bernoulli pressure. Such examples narrow the scope of validity of Grad's conjecture that the only solutions with a continuous symmetry can be fibered by pressure surfaces.</description>

      <title>Mixed Stochastic-Deterministic Density Functional Theoretic Decomposition of Kubo-Greenwood Conductivities in the Projector Augmented Wave Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pairing the accuracy of Kohn-Sham density-functional framework with the efficiency of a stochastic algorithmic approach, mixed stochastic-deterministic Density Functional Theory (mDFT) achieves a favorable computational scaling with system sizes and electronic temperatures. We employ the recently developed mDFT formalism to investigate the dynamic charge-transport properties of systems in the warm dense matter regime. The optical conductivity spectra are computed for single- and multi- component mixtures of carbon, hydrogen, and beryllium using two complementary approaches: Kubo-Greenwood in the mDFT picture and real-time Time-Dependent mDFT. We further devise a decomposition of the Onsager coefficients leading up to the Kubo-Greenwood spectra to exhibit contributions from the deterministic, stochastic, and mixed electronic state transitions at different incident photon energies.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving MHD-Driftkinetic Discretization for Wave-Particle Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a structure-preserving discretization of the hybrid magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)-driftkinetic system for simulations of low-frequency wave-particle interactions. The model equations are derived from a variational principle, assuring energetically consistent couplings between MHD fluids and driftkinetic particles. The spatial discretization is based on a finite-element-exterior-calculus (FEEC) framework for the MHD and a particle-in-cell (PIC) method for the driftkinetic. A key feature of the scheme is the inclusion of the non-quadratic particle magnetic moment energy term in the Hamiltonian, which is introduced by the guiding-center approximation. The resulting discrete Hamiltonian structure naturally organizes the dynamics into skew-symmetric subsystems, enabling balanced energy exchange. To handle the non-quadratic energy term, we develop energy-preserving time integrators based on discrete gradient methods. The algorithm is implemented in the open-source Python package \texttt{STRUPHY}. Numerical experiments confirm the energy-conserving property of the scheme and demonstrate the capability to simulate energetic particles (EP) induced excitation of toroidal Alfv\'en eigenmodes (TAE) without artificial dissipation or mode filtering. This capability highlights the potential of structure-preserving schemes for high-fidelity simulations of hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Laser Amplification in $e^{-}$-$\mu^{-}$-ion Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate laser amplification in $e^{-}$-$\mu^{-}$-ion plasmas, where negative muons partially replace electrons. Theoretical results reveal a hybrid plasma wave, called $\mu$-wave that exhibits ion-acoustic behavior in long-wavelength regime and Langmuir-like behavior in short-wavelength regime. Besides, the Landau damping of $\mu$-wave is smaller than that of Langmuir wave. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations confirm the theoretical results of instabilities in$e^{-}$-$\mu^{-}$-ion plasmas. The $\mu$-wave enables efficient laser amplification by suppressing pump-driven spontaneous instabilities through enhanced Landau damping of Langmuir waves. Compared to Raman amplification, $\mu$-wave amplification can maintain the Gaussian waveform of the seed laser, avoiding pulse splitting. Compared to strongcoupling Brillouin amplification, $\mu$-wave amplification exhibits weaker filamentation instability. Our theoretical model can be generalized to other plasma systems containing two species of negatively charged particles, such as two-temperature electron plasmas and negative-ion plasma. These findings establish $e^{-}$-$\mu^{-}$-ion plasma as a promising medium for advanced laser amplification schemes.</description>

      <title>Do plasmoids induce fast magnetic reconnection in well-resolved current sheets in 2D MHD simulations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the development of tearing-mode instability using the highest resolution two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of reconnecting current sheets on a uniform grid, for Lundquist numbers $10^3 \le S \le 2 \times 10^5$. Although the tearing-mode instability is commonly thought to trigger a plasmoid cascade that enables fast reconnection - i.e., independent of $S$ - our results, in broad agreement with the recent findings of Morillo \&amp; Alexakis (2025), challenge this belief. We demonstrate a Sweet-Parker scaling of the reconnection rate $V_{\text{rec}} \sim S^{-1/2}$ up to Lundquist numbers $S \sim 10^4$. For larger values, plasmoid formation sets in leading to a slight enhancement of the reconnection rate, $V_{\text{rec}} \sim S^{-1/3}$, consistent with the prediction from linear tearing mode induced reconnection, indicating that reconnection remains resistivity dependent, and therefore slow. In our simulations, the plasmoids do not form a cascade of mergers, as they are rapidly advected out of the reconnection layer. Our findings call for the revision of the role of plasmoid formation in 2D high Lundquist number magnetic reconnection. Even if future studies demonstrate that 2D plasmoid-reconnection becomes resistivity-independent at sufficiently large $S$, directly extending those results to 3D astrophysical environments is not justified, as in realistic circumstances, the increase of $S$ also raises the Reynolds number of the outflows, making it essential to account for the dominant role of turbulence.</description>

      <title>Entropic convergence and the linearized limit for the Boltzmann equation with external force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05096</link>
      <description>arXiv:1612.05096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the results regarding entropic convergence and the strong linearized limit for the Boltzmann equation (without external force) in [C. David Levermore. Entropic convergence and the linearized limit for the Boltzmann equation. Communications in Partial Differential Equations, 18(7-8):1231--1248, 1993] to the case of the Boltzmann equation with external force. Our starting point is the Boltzmann equation with an external force introduced in [Diogo Ars\'enio and Laure Saint-Raymond. From the Vlasov--Maxwell--Boltzmann System to Incompressible Viscous Electro-magneto-hydrodynamics, EMS Press, 2019], we then find new conditions on the force and rigorously prove the maintaining result by Levermore. More specifically, any sequence of DiPerna-Lions renormalized solutions of the Boltzmann equation with external force are shown to have fluctuations (about the global Maxwellian equilibrium $M$) that converge entropically (and hence strongly in $L^1$) to the solution of the linearized Boltzmann equation for any positive time, given that its initial fluctuations about $M$ converge entropically to the provided $L^2$ initial data of the linearized equation, where the force can be physically significant.</description>
