      <title>The Ba{\l}aban variational problem in the non-linear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimization of the action of a QFT with a constraint dictated by the block averaging procedure is an important part of Ba{\l}aban's approach to renormalization. It is particularly interesting for QFTs with non-trivial target spaces, such as gauge theories or non-linear sigma models on a lattice. We analyze this step for the $O(4)$ non-linear sigma model in two dimensions and demonstrate, in this case, how various ingredients of Ba{\l}aban's approach play together. First, using variational calculus on Lie groups, the equation for the critical point is derived. Then, this non-linear equation is solved by the Banach contraction mapping theorem. This step requires detailed control of lattice Green functions and their integral kernels via random walk expansions.</description>

      <title>Emerging Jordan forms, with applications to critical statistical models and conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two novel frameworks for handling mathematical and physical problems are introduced. The first, the emerging Jordan form, generalizes the concept of the Jordan canonical form, a well-established tool of linear algebra. The second, dual Jordan quantum physics, generalizes the framework of quantum physics to one in which the hermiticity postulate is considerably relaxed. These frameworks are then used to resolve some long-outstanding problems in theoretical physics, coming from critical statistical models and conformal field theory. I describe these problems and the difficulties involved in finding satisfactory solutions, then show how the concepts of emerging Jordan forms and dual Jordan quantum physics are naturally suited to overcoming these difficulties. Although their applications in this work are limited in scope to rather specific problems, the frameworks themselves are completely general, and I describe ways in which they may be used in other areas of mathematics and physics. Several appendices close the work, which include improvements to a widely used computational algorithm and corrections to some published data.</description>

      <title>SO(n) AKLT Chains as Symmetry Protected Topological Quantum Ground States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis studies a pair of symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases which arise when considering one-dimensional quantum spin systems possessing a natural orthogonal group symmetry. Particular attention is given to a family of exactly solvable models whose ground states admit a matrix product state description and generalize the AKLT chain. We call these models ``$SO(n)$ AKLT chains'' and the phase they occupy the ``$SO(n)$ Haldane phase''. We present new results describing their ground state structure and, when $n$ is even, their peculiar $O(n)$-to-$SO(n)$ symmetry breaking. We also prove that these states have arbitrarily large correlation and injectivity length by increasing $n$, but all have a 2-local parent Hamiltonian, in contrast to the natural expectation that the interaction range of a parent Hamiltonian should diverge as these quantities diverge. We extend Ogata's definition of an SPT index for a split state for a finite symmetry group $G$ to an SPT index for a compact Lie group $G$. We then compute this index, which takes values in the second Borel group cohomology $H^2(SO(n),U(1))$, at a single point in each of the SPT phases. The two points have different indices, confirming the two SPT phases are indeed distinct. Chapter 1 contains an introduction with a detailed overview of the contents of this thesis, which includes several chapters of background information before presenting new results in Chapter 7 and Chapter 8.</description>

      <title>Deformation of superintegrability in the Miwa-deformed Gaussian matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an arbitrary deformation of the Gaussian matrix model parameterized by Miwa variables $z_a$. One can look at it as a mixture of the Gaussian and logarithmic (Selberg) potentials, which are both superintegrable. The mixture is not, still one can find an explicit expression for an arbitrary Schur average as a linear transform of a {\it finite degree} polynomial made from the values of skew Schur functions at the Gaussian locus $p_k=\delta_{k,2}$. This linear operation includes multiplication with an exponential $ e^{z_a^2/2}$ and a kind of Borel transform of the resulting product, which we call multiple and enhanced. The existence of such remarkable formulas appears intimately related to the theory of auxiliary $K$-polynomials, which appeared in {\it bilinear} superintegrable correlators at the Gaussian point (strict superintegrability). We also consider in the very detail the generating function of correlators $&lt;(\Tr X)^k&gt;$ in this model, and discuss its integrable determinant representation. At last, we describe deformation of all results to the Gaussian $\beta$-ensemble.</description>

      <title>Thermal oscillations and resonance in electron-phonon interaction process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal resonance, in which the temperature amplitude attains a maximum value (peak) in response to an external exciting frequency source, is a phenomenon pertinent to the presence of underdamped thermal oscillations and explicit finite-speed for the thermal wave propagation. The present work investigates the occurrence condition for thermal resonance phenomenon during the electron-phonon interaction process in metals based on the hyperbolic two-temperature model. First, a sufficient condition for underdamped electron and lattice temperature oscillations is discussed by deriving a critical frequency (a material characteristic). It is shown that the critical frequency of thermal waves near room temperature, during electron-phonon interactions, may be on the order of terahertz ($10-20$ THz for Cu and Au, i.e., lying within the terahertz gap). It is found that whenever the natural frequency of metal temperature exceeds this frequency threshold, the temperature oscillations are of underdamped type. However, this condition is not necessary, since there is a small frequency domain, below this threshold, in which the underdamped thermal wave solution is available but not effective. Otherwise, the critical damping and the overdamping conditions of the temperature waves are determined numerically for a sample of pure metals. The thermal resonance conditions in both electron and lattice temperatures are investigated. The occurrence of resonance in both electron and lattice temperature is conditional on violating two distinct critical values of frequencies. When the natural frequency of the system becomes larger than these two critical values, an applied frequency equal to such a natural frequency can drive both electron and lattice temperatures to resonate together with different amplitudes and behaviors. However, the electron temperature resonates earlier than the lattice temperature.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Expansion of Yang-Baxter Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the deformations of a wide class of Yang-Baxter (YB) operators arising from Lie algebras. We relate the higher order deformations of YB operators to Lie algebra deformations. We show that the obstruction to integrating deformations of self-distributive (SD) objects lie in the corresponding Lie algebra third cohomology group, and interpret this result in terms of YB deformations. We show that there are YB operators that admit integrable deformations (i.e. that can be deformed infinitely many times), and that therefore give rise to a full perturbative series in the deformation parameter $\hbar$. We consider the second cohomology group of YB operators corresponding to certain types of Lie algebras, and show that this can be nontrivial even if the Lie algebra is rigid, providing examples of nontrivial YB deformations that do not arise from SD deformations.</description>

      <title>Exploring Self-Gravitating Cylindrical Structures in Modified Gravity: Insights from Scalar-Vector-Tensor Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate static cylindrical solutions within an extended theory of modified gravity. By incorporating various coupling functions through a straightforward boost symmetry approach, we establish the equations of motion in a self-consistent manner and subsequently determine the linear scalar field profile. Utilizing analytical methods, we solve the system of equations for the metric functions and the $U(1)$ gauge field, revealing their dependence on Bessel's functions. To comprehend gravito-objects exhibiting cylindrical symmetry, we develop a perturbative framework aimed at identifying all nontrivial solutions for the scalar profiles. Introducing first-order truncated perturbation equations for the gauge field, synchronized with metric gauges and electromagnetic field considerations, we demonstrate their integrability and obtain solutions through quadrature. Our findings suggest the feasibility of obtaining self-gravitating cylindrical structures within the scalar-vector-tensor theory.</description>

      <title>Force-free Electromagnetic Configurations in FLRW Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Force-free electrodynamics is the theoretical paradigm used to describe electromagnetic fields in a region where the inertia of plasma is negligible compared to the strength of the electromagnetic field. While these fields are studied extensively around accreting black holes in an attempt to describe energy extraction, force-free fields also routinely appear in the study of cosmological magnetic fields. Despite this, there are no systematic studies of exact force-free fields in an expanding universe. In this paper, we use geometric methods to find a wide variety of force-free solutions in a fixed Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric background. The method we use can be directly generalized to any arbitrary electrically neutral space-time, and hence, provides a powerful tool to study force-free fields in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free boundaries of biofilms advancing on surfaces evolve according to conservation laws coupled with systems of partial differential equations for velocities, pressures and chemicals affecting cell behavior. Thin film approximations lead to complicated quasi-stationary systems coupling stationary transport equations and compressible Stokes systems with convection-reaction-diffusion equations.We establish existence, uniqueness and stability of solutions of the different submodels involved and then obtain well posedness results for the full system. Our analysis relies on the construction of weak solutions for the steady transport equations under sign assumptions and the reformulation of the compressible Stokes problem as an elliptic system with enhanced regularity properties on the pressure. We need to consider velocity fields whose divergence and normal boundary components satisfy sign conditions, instead of vanishing as classical results require. Applications include the study of cells, biofilms and tissues, where one phase is a liquid solution, whereas the other one is assorted biomass.</description>

      <title>Sun-Jupiter-Saturn System may exist: A verified computation of quasiperiodic solutions for the planar three body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present evidence of the stability of a simplified model of the Solar System, a flat (Newtonian) Sun-Jupiter-Saturn system with realistic data: masses of the Sun and the planets, their semi-axes, eccentricities and (apsidal) precessions of the planets close to the real ones. The evidence is based on convincing numerics that a KAM theorem can be applied to the Hamiltonian equations of the model to produce quasiperiodic motion (on an invariant torus) with the appropriate frequencies. To do so, we first use KAM numerical schemes to compute translated tori to continue from the Kepler approximation (two uncoupled two-body problems) up to the actual Hamiltonian of the system, for which the translated torus is an invariant torus. Second, we use KAM numerical schemes for invariant tori to refine the solution giving the desired torus. Lastly, the convergence of the KAM scheme for the invariant torus is (numerically) checked by applying several times a KAM iterative lemma, from which we obtain that the final torus (numerically) satisfies the existence conditions given by a KAM theorem.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Bounded by Fisher Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a general upper bound to mutual information in terms of the Fisher information. The bound may be further used to derive a lower bound for Bayesian quadratic cost. These two provide alternatives to the Efroimovich and to the van Trees inequality that are useful also for classes of prior distributions where the latter ones give trivial bounds. We illustrate the usefulness of our bounds with a case study in quantum phase estimation. Here, they allow us to adapt to mutual information the known and highly nontrivial bounds for Fisher information in the presence of noise. This nicely complements quantum metrology, since Fisher information is useful to gauge local estimation strategies, whereas mutual information is useful for global strategies.</description>

      <title>Exact time-evolving scattering states in open quantum-dot systems with an interaction: Discovery of time-evolving resonant states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study exact time-evolving many-electron states of an open double quantum-dot system with an interdot Coulomb interaction. A systematic construction of the time-evolving states for arbitrary initial conditions is proposed. For any initial states of one- and two-electron plane waves on the electrical leads, we obtain exact solutions of the time-evolving scattering states, which converge to known stationary scattering eigenstates in the long-time limit. For any initial states of localized electrons on the quantum dots, we find exact time-evolving states of a new type, which we refer to as time-evolving resonant states. In contrast to stationary resonant states, whose wave functions spatially diverge and not normalizable, the time-evolving resonant states are normalizable since their wave functions are restricted to a finite space interval due to causality. The exact time-evolving resonant states enable us to calculate the time-dependence of the survival probability of electrons on the quantum dots for the system with the linearized dispersions. It decays exponentially in time on one side of an exponential point of resonance energies while, on the other side, it oscillates during the decay as a result of the interference of the two resonance energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we study problems at the interface of analysis and discrete mathematics. We discuss analogues of well known Hardy-type inequalities and Rearrangement inequalities on the lattice graphs $\mathbb{Z}^d$, with a particular focus on behaviour of sharp constants and optimizers.In the first half of the thesis, we analyse Hardy inequalities on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, first for $d=1$ and then for $d \geq 3$. We prove a sharp weighted Hardy inequality on integers with power weights of the form $n^\alpha$. This is done via two different methods, namely super-solution and Fourier method. We also use Fourier method to prove a weighted Hardy type inequality for higher order operators. After discussing the one dimensional case, we study the Hardy inequality in higher dimensions ($d \geq 3$). In particular, we compute the asymptotic behaviour of the sharp constant in the discrete Hardy inequality, as $d \rightarrow \infty$. This is done by converting the inequality into a continuous Hardy-type inequality on a torus for functions having zero average. These continuous inequalities are new and interesting in themselves.
  In the second half, we focus our attention on analogues of Rearrangement inequalities on lattice graphs. We begin by analysing the situation in dimension one. We define various notions of rearrangements and prove the corresponding Polya-Szeg\H{o} inequality. These inequalities are also applied to prove some weighted Hardy inequalities on integers. Finally, we study Rearrangement inequalities (Polya-Szeg\H{o}) on general graphs, with a particular focus on lattice graphs $\mathbb{Z}^d$, for $d \geq 2$. We develop a framework to study these inequalities, using which we derive concrete results in dimension two. In particular, these results develop connections between Polya-Szeg\H{o} inequality and various isoperimetric inequalities on graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new framework of Hessian-free force-gradient integrators that do not require the analytical expression of the force-gradient term based on the Hessian of the potential. Due to that the new class of decomposition algorithms for separable Hamiltonian systems with quadratic kinetic energy may be particularly useful when applied to Hamiltonian systems where an evaluation of the Hessian is significantly more expensive than an evaluation of its gradient, e.g. in molecular dynamics simulations of classical systems. Numerical experiments of an N-body problem, as well as applications to the molecular dynamics step in the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm for lattice simulations of the Schwinger model and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) verify these expectations.</description>

      <title>The inhomogeneous $t$-PushTASEP and Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a multispecies $t$-PushTASEP system on a finite ring of $n$ sites with site-dependent rates $x_1,\dots,x_n$. Let $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n)$ be a partition whose parts represent the species of the $n$ particles on the ring. We show that for each composition $\eta$ obtained by permuting the parts of $\lambda$, the stationary probability of being in state $\eta$ is proportional to the ASEP polynomial $F_{\eta}(x_1,\dots,x_n; q,t)$ at $q=1$; the normalizing constant (or partition function) is the Macdonald polynomial $P_{\lambda}(x_1,\dots,x_n;q,t)$ at $q=1$. Our approach involves new relations between the families of ASEP polynomials and of non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials at $q=1$. We also use multiline diagrams, showing that a single jump of the PushTASEP system is closely related to the operation of moving from one line to the next in a multiline diagram. We derive symmetry properties for the system under permutation of its jump rates, as well as a formula for the current of a single-species system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a commutative algebra $A$, we exhibit a canonical structure of post-Lie algebra on the space $A\otimes Der(A)$ where $Der(A)$ is the space of derivations on $A$, in order to use the machinery given in [Guin &amp; Oudom 2008] and [Ebrahimi-Fard &amp; Lundervold &amp; Munthe-Kaas 2015] and to define a Hopf algebra structure on the associated enveloping algebra with a natural action on $A$. We apply these results to the setting of [Linares &amp; Otto &amp; Tempelmayr 2023], giving a simpler and more efficient construction of their action and extending the recent work [Bruned &amp; Katsetsiadis]. This approach gives an optimal setting to perform explicit computations in the associated structure group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Connes-Rovelli thermal time associated with the quantum harmonic oscillator can be described as an (unsharp) observable, that is, as a positive operator valued measure. We furthermore present extensions of this result to the free massless relativistic particle in one dimension and to a hypothetical physical system whose equilibrium state is given by the noncommutative integral.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02118v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study products of functions evaluated at self-adjoint polynomials in deterministic matrices and independent Wigner matrices; we compute the deterministic approximations of such products and control the fluctuations. We focus on minimizing the assumption of smoothness on those functions while optimizing the error term with respect to $N$, the size of the matrices. As an application, we build on the idea that the long-time Heisenberg evolution associated to Wigner matrices generates asymptotic freeness as first shown in $[9]$. More precisely given $P$ a self-adjoint non-commutative polynomial and $Y^N$ a $d$-tuple of independent Wigner matrices, we prove that the quantum evolution associated to the operator $P(Y^N)$ yields asymptotic freeness for large times.</description>

      <title>CFT$_D$ from TQFT$_{D+1}$ via Holographic Tensor Network, and Precision Discretisation of CFT$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the path-integral of conformal field theories in $D$ dimensions (CFT$_D$) can be constructed by solving for eigenstates of an RG operator following from the Turaev-Viro formulation of a topological field theory in $D+1$ dimensions (TQFT$_{D+1}$), explicitly realising the holographic sandwich relation between a symmetric theory and a TQFT. Generically, exact eigenstates corresponding to symmetric-TQFT$_D$ follow from Frobenius algebra in the TQFT$_{D+1}$. For $D=2$, we constructed eigenstates that produce 2D rational CFT path-integral exactly, which, curiously connects a continuous field theoretic path-integral with the Turaev-Viro state sum. We also devise and illustrate numerical methods for $D=2,3$ to search for CFT$_D$ as phase transition points between symmetric TQFT$_D$. Finally since the RG operator is in fact an exact analytic holographic tensor network, we compute ``bulk-boundary'' correlator and compare with the AdS/CFT dictionary at $D=2$. Promisingly, they are numerically compatible given our accuracy, although further works will be needed to explore the precise connection to the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

Abstract: We extend Loeper's $L^2$-estimate relating the electric fields to the densities for the Vlasov-Poisson system to $L^p$, with $1 &lt; p &lt; +\infty$, based on the Helmholtz-Weyl decomposition. This allows us to generalize both the classical Loeper's $2$-Wasserstein stability estimate and the recent stability estimate by the first author relying on the newly introduced kinetic Wasserstein distance to kinetic Wasserstein distances of order $1 &lt; p &lt; +\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00262v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a differential structure associated with the infinite particle Dyson Brownian motion satisfies the Bakry-\'Emery nonnegative lower Ricci curvature bound $\mathsf{BE}(0, \infty)$. Various functional inequalities follow including a local spectral gap inequality, the Lipschitz Feller property, the dimension-free Harnack inequality and the evolutional variation inequality. As a consequence, the infinite Dyson Brownian motion is characterised as a gradient flow of the Boltzmann-Shannon entropy associated with $\mathsf{sine}_\beta$ point processes with respect to a certain Benamou-Brenier-like Wasserstein distance. At the end, we provide a sufficient condition for $\mathsf{BE}(K, \infty)$ beyond the Dyson model and apply it to the infinite particle model of the $\beta$-Riesz gas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Topological String/Spectral theory duality on toric Calabi-Yau threefolds obtained from the resolution of the cone over the $Y^{N,0}$ singularity. Assuming Kyiv formula, we demonstrate this duality in a special regime thanks to an underlying connection between spectral determinants of quantum mirror curves and the non-autonomous (q)-Toda system. We further exploit this link to connect small and large time expansions in Toda equations. In particular we provide an explicit expression for their tau functions at large time in terms of a strong coupling version of irregular $W_N$ conformal blocks at $c=N-1$. These are related to a special class of multi-cut matrix models which describe the strong coupling regime of four dimensional, $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills.</description>

      <title>$W$ state is not the unique ground state of any local Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The characterization of ground states among all quantum states is an important problem in quantum many-body physics. For example, the celebrated entanglement area law for gapped Hamiltonians has allowed for efficient simulation of 1d and some 2d quantum systems using matrix product states. Among ground states, some types, such as cat states (like the GHZ state) or topologically ordered states, can only appear alongside their degenerate partners, as is understood from the theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking. In this work, we introduce a new class of simple states, including the $W$ state, that can only occur as a ground state alongside an exactly degenerate partner, even in gapless or disordered models. We show that these states are never an element of a stable gapped ground state manifold, which may provide a new method to discard a wide range of 'unstable' entanglement area law states in the numerical search of gapped phases. On the other hand when these degenerate states are the ground states of gapless systems they possess an excitation spectrum with $O(1/L^2)$ finite-size splitting. One familiar situation where this special kind of gaplessness occurs is at a Lifshitz transition due to a zero mode; a potential quantum state signature of such a critical point. We explore pathological parent Hamiltonians, and discuss generalizations to higher dimensions, other related states, and implications for understanding thermodynamic limits of many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On conformally compact manifolds we study Yang-Mills equations, their boundary conditions, formal asymptotics, and Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps. We find that smooth solutions with "magnetic" Dirichlet boundary data are obstructed by a conformally invariant, higher order boundary current. We study the asymptotics of the interior Yang-Mills energy functional and show that the obstructing current is the variation of the conformally invariant coefficient of the first log term in this expansion which is a higher derivative conformally invariant analog of the Yang-Mills energy. The invariant energy is the anomaly for the renormalized interior Yang-Mills functional and its variation gives higher conformal Yang-Mills equations. Global solutions to the magnetic boundary problem determine higher order "electric" Neumann data. This yields the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. We also construct conformally invariant, higher transverse derivative boundary operators. Acting on interior connections, they give obstructions to solving the Yang-Mills boundary problem, determine the asymptotics of formal solutions, and yield conformally invariant tensors capturing the (non-local) electric Neumann data. We also characterize a renormalized Yang-Mills action functional that encodes global features analogously to the renormalized volume for Poincar\'e-Einstein structures.</description>

      <title>Anomalous scaling of heterogeneous elastic lines: a new picture from sample to sample fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a discrete model of an heterogeneous elastic line with internal disorder, submitted to thermal fluctuations. The monomers are connected through random springs with independent and identically distributed elastic constants drawn from $p(k)\sim k^{\mu-1}$ for $k\to0$. When $\mu&gt;1$, the scaling of the standard Edwards-Wilkinson model is recovered. When $\mu&lt;1$, the elastic line exhibits an anomalous scaling of the type observed in many growth models and experiments. Here we derive and use the exact expression for the exact probability distribution of the line shape at equilibrium, as well as the spectral properties of the matrix containing the random couplings, to fully characterize the sample to sample fluctuations. Our results lead to novel scaling predictions that partially disagree with previous works, but which are corroborated by numerical simulations. We also provide a novel interpretation of the anomalous scaling in terms of the abrupt jumps in the line's shape that dominate the average value of the observable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12047v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Jordan algebraic formulation of the non-commutative Landau problem coupled to a harmonic potential. To achieve this, an alternative formulation of the Hilbert space version of quantum mechanics is presented. Using this construction, the Hilbert space corresponding to the non-commutative Landau problem is obtained. Non-commutative parameters are then described in terms of an associator in the Jordan algebraic setting. Pure states and density matrices arising from this problem are characterized. This in turn leads us to the Jordan-Schr\"odinger time-evolution equation for the state vectors for this specific problem.</description>

      <title>Normal modes of Proca fields in AdS$_d$ spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The normal modes of Proca field perturbations in $d$-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime, AdS$_d$ for short, with reflective Dirichlet boundary conditions, are obtained exactly. Within the Ishibashi-Kodama framework, we decompose the Proca field in scalar-type and vector-type components, according to their tensorial behavior on the $(d-2)$-sphere $\mathcal{S}^{d-2}$. Two of the degrees of freedom of the Proca field are described by scalar-type components, which in general are coupled due to the mass of the field, but in AdS$_d$ we show that they can be decoupled. The other $d-3$ degrees of freedom of the field are described by a vector-type component that generically decouples completely. The normal modes and their frequencies for both the scalar-type and vector-type components of the Proca field are then obtained analytically. Additionally, we analyze the normal modes of the Maxwell field as the massless limit of the Proca field. We find that for scalar-type perturbations in $d=4$ there is a discontinuity in the massless limit, in $d=5$ the massless limit is well defined using Dirichlet-Neumann rather than Dirichlet boundary conditions, and in $d&gt;5$ the massless limit is completely well defined, i.e., it is obtained smoothly from the massless limit of the scalar-type perturbations of the Proca field. For vector-type perturbations the Maxwell field limit is obtained smoothly for all $d$ from the massless limit of the vector-type perturbations of the Proca field.</description>

      <title>Wild orbits and generalised singularity modules: stratifications and quantisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study isomorphism classes of untwisted irregular singular meromorphic connections on principal bundles over (wild) Riemann surfaces, for any complex reductive structure group $G$ and polar divisor. In particular we compute the stabilisers of suitable marked points on their principal part orbits, showing the stabilisers are connected and controlled by the corresponding filtration of (Levi factors of) nested parabolic subgroups of $G$; this uniquely determines the orbits as complex homogeneous manifolds for groups of jets of principal $G$-bundle automorphisms. Moreover, when the residue is semisimple we stratify the space of orbits by the stabilisers, relating this to local wild mapping class groups and generalising the Levi stratification of a Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{t} \subseteq \mathfrak{g} = \operatorname{Lie}(G)$: the dense stratum corresponds to the generic setting of irregular isomonodromic deformations \`a la Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno.
  Then we adapt a result of Alekseev-Lachowska to deformation-quantise nongeneric orbits: the $\ast$-product involves affine-Lie-algebra modules, extending the generalised Verma modules (in the case of regular singularities) and the `singularity' modules of F.-R. (in the case of generic irregular singularities). As in the generic case, the modules contain Whittaker vectors for the Gaiotto-Teschner Virasoro pairs from irregular Liouville conformal field theory; but they now provide all the quotients which are obtained when the corresponding parameters leave the aforementioned dense strata. We also construct Shapovalov forms for the corresponding representations of truncated (holomorphic) current Lie algebras, leading to a conjectural irreducibility criterion. Finally, we use these representations to construct new flat vector bundles of vacua/covacua \`a la Wess--Zumino-Novikov-Witten, equipped with connections \`a la Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that a formal deformation of a commutative algebra ${\mathcal A}$ leads to a Poisson bracket on ${\mathcal A}$ and that the classical limit of a derivation on the deformation leads to a derivation on ${\mathcal A}$, which is Hamiltonian with respect to the Poisson bracket. In this paper we present a generalisation of it for formal deformations of an arbitrary noncommutative algebra ${\mathcal A}$. The deformation leads in this case to a Poisson algebra structure on $\Pi({\mathcal A}):=Z({\mathcal A})\times({\mathcal A}/Z({\mathcal A}))$ and to the structure of a $\Pi({\mathcal A})$-Poisson module on ${\mathcal A}$. The limiting derivations are then still derivations of ${\mathcal A}$, but with the Hamiltonian belong to $\Pi({\mathcal A})$, rather than to ${\mathcal A}$. We illustrate our construction with several cases of formal deformations, coming from known quantum algebras, such as the ones associated with the nonabelian Volterra chains, Kontsevich integrable map, the quantum plane and the quantised Grassmann algebra.</description>

      <title>Localization of Random Surfaces with Monotone Potentials and an FKG-Gaussian Correlation Inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The seminal 1975 work of Brascamp-Lieb-Lebowitz initiated the rigorous study of Ginzberg-Landau random surface models. It was conjectured therein that fluctuations are localized on $\mathbb Z^d$ when $d\geq 3$ for very general potentials, matching the behavior of the Gaussian free field. We confirm this behavior for all even potentials $U:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ satisfying $U'(x)\geq \min(\varepsilon x,\frac{1+\varepsilon}{x})$ on $x\in \mathbb R^+$. Given correspondingly stronger growth conditions on $U$, we show power or stretched exponential tail bounds on all transient graphs, which determine the maximum field value up to constants in many cases. Further extensions include non-wired boundary conditions and iterated Laplacian analogs such as the membrane model. Our main tool is an FKG-based generalization of the Gaussian correlation inequality, which is used to dominate the finite-volume Gibbs measures by mixtures of centered Gaussian fields.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Reducibility of $C^k$ Quasi-Periodic Cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes an extreme $C^k$ reducibility theorem of quasi-periodic $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ cocycles in the local perturbative region, revealing both the essence of Eliasson [Commun.Math.Phys.1992] and Hou-You [Invent.Math.2012] in respectively the non-resonant and resonant cases. By paralleling further the reducibility process with the almost reducibility, we are able to acquire the least initial regularity as well as the least loss of regularity for the whole KAM iterations. This, in return, makes various spectral applications of quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger operators wide open.</description>
