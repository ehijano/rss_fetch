      <title>Eastward Transients in the Dayside Ionosphere II: A Parallel-plate Capacitor-Like Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03174v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the 23 April 2023 geospace storm, we observed chorus wave-driven, energetic particle precipitation on closed magnetic field lines in the dayside magnetosphere. Simultaneously and in the ionosphere's bottom-side, we observed signatures of impact ionization and strong enhancements in the ionospheric electric field, via radar-detection of meter-scale turbulence, and with matching temporal characteristics as that of the magnetospheric observations. We detailed this in a companion paper. In the present article, we place those observations into context with the dayside ionosphere, and describe a remarkably similar event that took place during the May 2024 geospace superstorm. In both cases, fast, eastward-moving electric field structures were excited equatorward of the ionospheric cusp, on closed magnetic field-lines -- observations that challenge existing modes of explanation for electrodynamics in the cusp-region, where most such observations are interpreted in the context of poleward-moving auroral forms. Instead, primarily eastward-moving electric field structures were associated with turbulent Hall currents that are perhaps characteristically excited during geospace storms by wave-particle interactions near magnetospheric equator or by proton precipitation characteristics in the cusp, forming a `parallel-plate capacitor-like effect'. We propose that transient eastward electrodynamic bursts in the dayside ionosphere might be a common, albeit previously unresolved, feature of geomagnetic storms.</description>

      <title>A Characteristic Signature of Magnetospheric Wave-Particle Interactions Found in the Turbulent E-region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasma waves in the magnetosphere scatter electrons, causing them to precipitate into Earth's atmosphere, imparting their temporal characteristics to diffuse auroras. In a case study of conjugate radar and satellite observations, we demonstrate a close and unprecedented association between enhanced electrostatic cyclotron harmonic wave activity in the magnetosphere and the appearance of meter-scale plasma turbulence a few seconds later in the lower ionosphere on nearby magnetic field lines. Such direct structuring of the ionosphere carries implications for our understanding of space weather.</description>

      <title>GIC--Related Observations During the May 2024 Geomagnetic Storm in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The May 2024 geomagnetic storm was one of the most severe in the past 20~years. Understanding how large geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs) impact geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) within electrical power grid networks is key to ensuring their resilience. We have assembled and synthesized a large and unique set of GMD-related data, compared model predictions with measurements, and identified empirical relationships for GICs in the contiguous United States for this storm. Measurement data include GIC data from $47$ sites and magnetometer data from $17$ sites. Model data include GIC computed by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) power system operators at $4$ sites, GIC computed using a reference model at $47$ sites, and the difference in the surface magnetic field from a baseline ($\Delta \mathbf{B}$) computed at $12$ magnetometer sites from three global magnetospheric models -- the Multiscale Atmosphere-Geospace Environment Model (MAGE), Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF), and Open Geospace General Circulation Model (OpenGGCM). GIC measured and computed by TVA had a correlation coefficient $\text{r}&gt;0.8$ and a prediction efficiency between 0.4 and 0.7. The horizontal magnetic field perturbation from a baseline, $\Delta B_H$, computed by MAGE, SWMF, and OpenGGCM had a correlation r from $0.21$ to $0.65$. Two empirical relationships were considered: (1) how the correlation between measured GIC site pairs depended on differences in site separation distance, $\beta$ scaling factor (related to ground conductivity), and geomagnetic latitude; and (2) a regression model for the maximum $\mbox{GIC}$ magnitude at each site given the product of $\alpha$ (related to magnetic latitude) and $\beta$.</description>
