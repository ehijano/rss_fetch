      <title>MRI Image Generation Based on Text Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the use of text-prompted MRI image generation with the Stable Diffusion (SD) model to address challenges in acquiring real MRI datasets, such as high costs, limited rare case samples, and privacy concerns. The SD model, pre-trained on natural images, was fine-tuned using the 3T fastMRI dataset and the 0.3T M4Raw dataset, with the goal of generating brain T1, T2, and FLAIR images across different magnetic field strengths. The performance of the fine-tuned model was evaluated using quantitative metrics,including Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM), showing improvements in image quality and semantic consistency with the text prompts. To further evaluate the model's potential, a simple classification task was carried out using a small 0.35T MRI dataset, demonstrating that the synthetic images generated by the fine-tuned SD model can effectively augment training datasets and improve the performance of MRI constrast classification tasks. Overall, our findings suggest that text-prompted MRI image generation is feasible and can serve as a useful tool for medical AI applications.</description>

      <title>DeepMultiConnectome: Deep Multi-Task Prediction of Structural Connectomes Directly from Diffusion MRI Tractography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography enables in vivo mapping of brain structural connections, but traditional connectome generation is time-consuming and requires gray matter parcellation, posing challenges for large-scale studies. We introduce DeepMultiConnectome, a deep-learning model that predicts structural connectomes directly from tractography, bypassing the need for gray matter parcellation while supporting multiple parcellation schemes. Using a point-cloud-based neural network with multi-task learning, the model classifies streamlines according to their connected regions across two parcellation schemes, sharing a learned representation. We train and validate DeepMultiConnectome on tractography from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset ($n = 1000$), labeled with an 84 and 164 region gray matter parcellation scheme. DeepMultiConnectome predicts multiple structural connectomes from a whole-brain tractogram containing 3 million streamlines in approximately 40 seconds. DeepMultiConnectome is evaluated by comparing predicted connectomes with traditional connectomes generated using the conventional method of labeling streamlines using a gray matter parcellation. The predicted connectomes are highly correlated with traditionally generated connectomes ($r = 0.992$ for an 84-region scheme; $r = 0.986$ for a 164-region scheme) and largely preserve network properties. A test-retest analysis of DeepMultiConnectome demonstrates reproducibility comparable to traditionally generated connectomes. The predicted connectomes perform similarly to traditionally generated connectomes in predicting age and cognitive function. Overall, DeepMultiConnectome provides a scalable, fast model for generating subject-specific connectomes across multiple parcellation schemes.</description>

      <title>Plug-and-Play Posterior Sampling for Blind Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Blind Plug-and-Play Diffusion Models (Blind-PnPDM) as a novel framework for solving blind inverse problems where both the target image and the measurement operator are unknown. Unlike conventional methods that rely on explicit priors or separate parameter estimation, our approach performs posterior sampling by recasting the problem into an alternating Gaussian denoising scheme. We leverage two diffusion models as learned priors: one to capture the distribution of the target image and another to characterize the parameters of the measurement operator. This PnP integration of diffusion models ensures flexibility and ease of adaptation. Our experiments on blind image deblurring show that Blind-PnPDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual fidelity. Our results highlight the effectiveness of treating blind inverse problems as a sequence of denoising subproblems while harnessing the expressive power of diffusion-based priors.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Generation and Latent Projection Denoising of Rim Lesions in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative susceptibility maps from magnetic resonance images can provide both prognostic and diagnostic information in multiple sclerosis, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the formation of lesions in white matter brain tissue. In particular, susceptibility maps provide adequate contrast to distinguish between "rim" lesions, surrounded by deposited paramagnetic iron, and "non-rim" lesion types. These paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs) are an emerging biomarker in multiple sclerosis. Much effort has been devoted to both detection and segmentation of such lesions to monitor longitudinal change. As paramagnetic rim lesions are rare, addressing this problem requires confronting the class imbalance between rim and non-rim lesions. We produce synthetic quantitative susceptibility maps of paramagnetic rim lesions and show that inclusion of such synthetic data improves classifier performance and provide a multi-channel extension to generate accompanying contrasts and probabilistic segmentation maps. We exploit the projection capability of our trained generative network to demonstrate a novel denoising approach that allows us to train on ambiguous rim cases and substantially increase the minority class. We show that both synthetic lesion synthesis and our proposed rim lesion label denoising method best approximate the unseen rim lesion distribution and improve detection in a clinically interpretable manner. We release our code and generated data at https://github.com/agr78/PRLx-GAN upon publication.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised feature learning for cardiac Cine MR image reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a self-supervised feature learning assisted reconstruction (SSFL-Recon) framework for MRI reconstruction to address the limitation of existing supervised learning methods. Although recent deep learning-based methods have shown promising performance in MRI reconstruction, most require fully-sampled images for supervised learning, which is challenging in practice considering long acquisition times under respiratory or organ motion. Moreover, nearly all fully-sampled datasets are obtained from conventional reconstruction of mildly accelerated datasets, thus potentially biasing the achievable performance. The numerous undersampled datasets with different accelerations in clinical practice, hence, remain underutilized. To address these issues, we first train a self-supervised feature extractor on undersampled images to learn sampling-insensitive features. The pre-learned features are subsequently embedded in the self-supervised reconstruction network to assist in removing artifacts. Experiments were conducted retrospectively on an in-house 2D cardiac Cine dataset, including 91 cardiovascular patients and 38 healthy subjects. The results demonstrate that the proposed SSFL-Recon framework outperforms existing self-supervised MRI reconstruction methods and even exhibits comparable or better performance to supervised learning up to $16\times$ retrospective undersampling. The feature learning strategy can effectively extract global representations, which have proven beneficial in removing artifacts and increasing generalization ability during reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Transform Adjustments For Video Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent video codecs with multiple separable transforms can achieve significant coding gains using asymmetric trigonometric transforms (DCTs and DSTs), because they can exploit diverse statistics of residual block signals. However, they add excessive computational and memory complexity on large transforms (32-point and larger), since their practical software and hardware implementations are not as efficient as of the DCT-2. This article introduces a novel technique to design low-complexity approximations of trigonometric transforms. The proposed method uses DCT-2 computations, and applies orthogonal adjustments to approximate the most important basis vectors of the desired transform. Experimental results on the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) reference software show that the proposed approach significantly reduces the computational complexity, while providing practically identical coding efficiency.</description>

      <title>Position Dependent Prediction Combination For Intra-Frame Video Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intra-frame prediction in the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard can be empirically improved by applying sets of recursive two-dimensional filters to the predicted values. However, this approach does not allow (or complicates significantly) the parallel computation of pixel predictions. In this work we analyze why the recursive filters are effective, and use the results to derive sets of non-recursive predictors that have superior performance. We present an extension to HEVC intra prediction that combines values predicted using non-filtered and filtered (smoothed) reference samples, depending on the prediction mode, and block size. Simulations using the HEVC common test conditions show that a 2.0% bit rate average reduction can be achieved compared to HEVC, for All Intra (AI) configurations.</description>

      <title>PdNeuRAM: Forming-Free, Multi-Bit Pd/HfO2 ReRAM for Energy-Efficient Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memristor technology shows great promise for energy-efficient computing, yet it grapples with challenges like resistance drift and inherent variability. For filamentary Resistive RAM (ReRAM), one of the most investigated types of memristive devices, the expensive electroforming step required to create conductive pathways results in increased power and area overheads and reduced endurance. In this study, we present novel HfO2-based forming-free ReRAM devices, PdNeuRAM, that operate at low voltages, support multi-bit functionality, and display reduced variability. Through a deep understanding and comprehensive material characterization, we discover the key process that allows this unique behavior: a Pd-O-Hf configuration that capitalizes on Pd innate affinity for integrating into HfO2. This structure actively facilitates charge redistribution at room temperature, effectively eliminating the need for electroforming. Moreover, the fabricated ReRAM device provides tunable resistance states for dense memory and reduces programming and reading energy by 43% and 73%, respectively, using spiking neural networks (SNN). This study reveals novel mechanistic insights and delineates a strategic roadmap for the realization of power-efficient and cost-effective ReRAM devices.</description>

      <title>GeoMan: Temporally Consistent Human Geometry Estimation using Image-to-Video Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating accurate and temporally consistent 3D human geometry from videos is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods, primarily optimized for single images, often suffer from temporal inconsistencies and fail to capture fine-grained dynamic details. To address these limitations, we present GeoMan, a novel architecture designed to produce accurate and temporally consistent depth and normal estimations from monocular human videos. GeoMan addresses two key challenges: the scarcity of high-quality 4D training data and the need for metric depth estimation to accurately model human size. To overcome the first challenge, GeoMan employs an image-based model to estimate depth and normals for the first frame of a video, which then conditions a video diffusion model, reframing video geometry estimation task as an image-to-video generation problem. This design offloads the heavy lifting of geometric estimation to the image model and simplifies the video model's role to focus on intricate details while using priors learned from large-scale video datasets. Consequently, GeoMan improves temporal consistency and generalizability while requiring minimal 4D training data. To address the challenge of accurate human size estimation, we introduce a root-relative depth representation that retains critical human-scale details and is easier to be estimated from monocular inputs, overcoming the limitations of traditional affine-invariant and metric depth representations. GeoMan achieves state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming longstanding challenges in 3D human geometry estimation from videos.</description>

      <title>Spoken question answering for visual queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Question answering (QA) systems are designed to answer natural language questions. Visual QA (VQA) and Spoken QA (SQA) systems extend the textual QA system to accept visual and spoken input respectively.
  This work aims to create a system that enables user interaction through both speech and images. That is achieved through the fusion of text, speech, and image modalities to tackle the task of spoken VQA (SVQA). The resulting multi-modal model has textual, visual, and spoken inputs and can answer spoken questions on images.
  Training and evaluating SVQA models requires a dataset for all three modalities, but no such dataset currently exists. We address this problem by synthesizing VQA datasets using two zero-shot TTS models. Our initial findings indicate that a model trained only with synthesized speech nearly reaches the performance of the upper-bounding model trained on textual QAs. In addition, we show that the choice of the TTS model has a minor impact on accuracy.</description>

      <title>Weakly-supervised Localization of Manipulated Image Regions Using Multi-resolution Learned Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The explosive growth of digital images and the widespread availability of image editing tools have made image manipulation detection an increasingly critical challenge. Current deep learning-based manipulation detection methods excel in achieving high image-level classification accuracy, they often fall short in terms of interpretability and localization of manipulated regions. Additionally, the absence of pixel-wise annotations in real-world scenarios limits the existing fully-supervised manipulation localization techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a novel weakly-supervised approach that integrates activation maps generated by image-level manipulation detection networks with segmentation maps from pre-trained models. Specifically, we build on our previous image-level work named WCBnet to produce multi-view feature maps which are subsequently fused for coarse localization. These coarse maps are then refined using detailed segmented regional information provided by pre-trained segmentation models (such as DeepLab, SegmentAnything and PSPnet), with Bayesian inference employed to enhance the manipulation localization. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting the feasibility to localize image manipulations without relying on pixel-level labels.</description>

      <title>Multilook Coherent Imaging: Theoretical Guarantees and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilook coherent imaging is a widely used technique in applications such as digital holography, ultrasound imaging, and synthetic aperture radar. A central challenge in these systems is the presence of multiplicative noise, commonly known as speckle, which degrades image quality. Despite the widespread use of coherent imaging systems, their theoretical foundations remain relatively underexplored. In this paper, we study both the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of likelihood-based approaches for multilook coherent imaging, providing a rigorous framework for analysis and method development. Our theoretical contributions include establishing the first theoretical upper bound on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the maximum likelihood estimator under the deep image prior hypothesis. Our results capture the dependence of MSE on the number of parameters in the deep image prior, the number of looks, the signal dimension, and the number of measurements per look. On the algorithmic side, we employ projected gradient descent (PGD) as an efficient method for computing the maximum likelihood solution. Furthermore, we introduce two key ideas to enhance the practical performance of PGD. First, we incorporate the Newton-Schulz algorithm to compute matrix inverses within the PGD iterations, significantly reducing computational complexity. Second, we develop a bagging strategy to mitigate projection errors introduced during PGD updates. We demonstrate that combining these techniques with PGD yields state-of-the-art performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/Computational-Imaging-RU/Bagged-DIP-Speckle.</description>

      <title>Maximum Spherical Mean Value (mSMV) Filtering for Whole Brain Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To develop a tissue field filtering algorithm, called maximum Spherical Mean Value (mSMV), for reducing shadow artifacts in quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) of the brain without requiring brain tissue erosion. Residual background field is a major source of shadow artifacts in QSM. The mSMV algorithm filters large field values near the border, where the maximum value of the harmonic background field is located. The effectiveness of mSMV for artifact removal was evaluated by comparing with existing QSM algorithms in numerical brain simulation as well as using in vivo human data acquired from 11 healthy volunteers and 93 patients. Numerical simulation showed that mSMV reduces shadow artifacts and improves QSM accuracy. Better shadow reduction, as demonstrated by lower QSM variation in the gray matter and higher QSM image quality score, was also observed in healthy subjects and in patients with hemorrhages, stroke and multiple sclerosis. The mSMV algorithm allows QSM maps that are substantially equivalent to those obtained using SMV-filtered dipole inversion without eroding the volume of interest.</description>

Abstract: Despite the impressive advances achieved using deep learning for functional brain activity analysis, the heterogeneity of functional patterns and the scarcity of imaging data still pose challenges in tasks such as identifying neurological disorders. For functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), while data may be abundantly available from healthy controls, clinical data is often scarce, especially for rare diseases, limiting the ability of models to identify clinically-relevant features. We overcome this limitation by introducing a novel representation learning strategy integrating meta-learning with self-supervised learning to improve the generalization from normal to clinical features. This approach enables generalization to challenging clinical tasks featuring scarce training data. We achieve this by leveraging self-supervised learning on the control dataset to focus on inherent features that are not limited to a particular supervised task and incorporating meta-learning to improve the generalization across domains. To explore the generalizability of the learned representations to unseen clinical applications, we apply the model to four distinct clinical datasets featuring scarce and heterogeneous data for neurological disorder classification. Results demonstrate the superiority of our representation learning strategy on diverse clinically-relevant tasks.

      <title>An unsupervised method for MRI recovery: Deep image prior with structured sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: To propose and validate an unsupervised MRI reconstruction method that does not require fully sampled k-space data. Materials and Methods: The proposed method, deep image prior with structured sparsity (DISCUS), extends the deep image prior (DIP) by introducing group sparsity to frame-specific code vectors, enabling the discovery of a low-dimensional manifold for capturing temporal variations. \discus was validated using four studies: (I) simulation of a dynamic Shepp-Logan phantom to demonstrate its manifold discovery capabilities, (II) comparison with compressed sensing and DIP-based methods using simulated single-shot late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) image series from six distinct digital cardiac phantoms in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM), (III) evaluation on retrospectively undersampled single-shot LGE data from eight patients, and (IV) evaluation on prospectively undersampled single-shot LGE data from eight patients, assessed via blind scoring from two expert readers. Results: DISCUS outperformed competing methods, demonstrating superior reconstruction quality in terms of NMSE and SSIM (Studies I--III) and expert reader scoring (Study IV). Discussion: An unsupervised image reconstruction method is presented and validated on simulated and measured data. These developments can benefit applications where acquiring fully sampled data is challenging.</description>

      <title>LEAVS: An LLM-based Labeler for Abdominal CT Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extracting structured labels from radiology reports has been employed to create vision models to simultaneously detect several types of abnormalities. However, existing works focus mainly on the chest region. Few works have been investigated on abdominal radiology reports due to more complex anatomy and a wider range of pathologies in the abdomen. We propose LEAVS (Large language model Extractor for Abdominal Vision Supervision). This labeler can annotate the certainty of presence and the urgency of seven types of abnormalities for nine abdominal organs on CT radiology reports. To ensure broad coverage, we chose abnormalities that encompass most of the finding types from CT reports. Our approach employs a specialized chain-of-thought prompting strategy for a locally-run LLM using sentence extraction and multiple-choice questions in a tree-based decision system. We demonstrate that the LLM can extract several abnormality types across abdominal organs with an average F1 score of 0.89, significantly outperforming competing labelers and humans. Additionally, we show that extraction of urgency labels achieved performance comparable to human annotations. Finally, we demonstrate that the abnormality labels contain valuable information for training a single vision model that classifies several organs as normal or abnormal. We release our code and structured annotations for a public CT dataset containing over 1,000 CT volumes.</description>

      <title>BrainMRDiff: A Diffusion Model for Anatomically Consistent Brain MRI Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate brain tumor diagnosis relies on the assessment of multiple Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences. However, in clinical practice, the acquisition of certain sequences may be affected by factors like motion artifacts or contrast agent contraindications, leading to suboptimal outcome, such as poor image quality. This can then affect image interpretation by radiologists. Synthesizing high quality MRI sequences has thus become a critical research focus. Though recent advancements in controllable generative AI have facilitated the synthesis of diagnostic quality MRI, ensuring anatomical accuracy remains a significant challenge. Preserving critical structural relationships between different anatomical regions is essential, as even minor structural or topological inconsistencies can compromise diagnostic validity. In this work, we propose BrainMRDiff, a novel topology-preserving, anatomy-guided diffusion model for synthesizing brain MRI, leveraging brain and tumor anatomies as conditioning inputs. To achieve this, we introduce two key modules: Tumor+Structure Aggregation (TSA) and Topology-Guided Anatomy Preservation (TGAP). TSA integrates diverse anatomical structures with tumor information, forming a comprehensive conditioning mechanism for the diffusion process. TGAP enforces topological consistency during reverse denoising diffusion process; both these modules ensure that the generated image respects anatomical integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMRDiff surpasses existing baselines, achieving performance improvements of 23.33% on the BraTS-AG dataset and 33.33% on the BraTS-Met dataset. Code will be made publicly available soon.</description>

      <title>Non-rigid Motion Correction for MRI Reconstruction via Coarse-To-Fine Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is highly susceptible to motion artifacts due to the extended acquisition times required for k-space sampling. These artifacts can compromise diagnostic utility, particularly for dynamic imaging. We propose a novel alternating minimization framework that leverages a bespoke diffusion model to jointly reconstruct and correct non-rigid motion-corrupted k-space data. The diffusion model uses a coarse-to-fine denoising strategy to capture large overall motion and reconstruct the lower frequencies of the image first, providing a better inductive bias for motion estimation than that of standard diffusion models. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on both real-world cine cardiac MRI datasets and complex simulated rigid and non-rigid deformations, even when each motion state is undersampled by a factor of 64x. Additionally, our method is agnostic to sampling patterns, anatomical variations, and MRI scanning protocols, as long as some low frequency components are sampled during each motion state.</description>

      <title>OSCAR: One-Step Diffusion Codec for Image Compression Across Multiple Bit-rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pretrained latent diffusion models have shown strong potential for lossy image compression, owing to their powerful generative priors. Most existing diffusion-based methods reconstruct images by iteratively denoising from random noise, guided by compressed latent representations. While these approaches have achieved high reconstruction quality, their multi-step sampling process incurs substantial computational overhead. Moreover, they typically require training separate models for different compression bit-rates, leading to significant training and storage costs. To address these challenges, we propose a one-step diffusion codec across multiple bit-rates. termed OSCAR. Specifically, our method views compressed latents as noisy variants of the original latents, where the level of distortion depends on the bit-rate. This perspective allows them to be modeled as intermediate states along a diffusion trajectory. By establishing a mapping from the compression bit-rate to a pseudo diffusion timestep, we condition a single generative model to support reconstructions at multiple bit-rates. Meanwhile, we argue that the compressed latents retain rich structural information, thereby making one-step denoising feasible. Thus, OSCAR replaces iterative sampling with a single denoising pass, significantly improving inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OSCAR achieves superior performance in both quantitative and visual quality metrics. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/jp-guo/OSCAR.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Adaptation of Pre-trained Vision Backbones for Energy-Efficient Image Coding for Machine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image Coding for Machines (ICM) focuses on optimizing image compression for AI-driven analysis rather than human perception. Existing ICM frameworks often rely on separate codecs for specific tasks, leading to significant storage requirements, training overhead, and computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient framework that leverages pre-trained vision backbones to extract robust and versatile latent representations suitable for multiple tasks. We introduce a task-specific low-rank adaptation mechanism, which refines the pre-trained features to be both compressible and tailored to downstream applications. This design minimizes trainable parameters and reduces energy costs for multi-task scenarios. By jointly optimizing task performance and entropy minimization, our method enables efficient adaptation to diverse tasks and datasets without full fine-tuning, achieving high coding efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms traditional codecs and pre-processors, offering an energy-efficient and effective solution for ICM applications.

      <title>How We Won the ISLES'24 Challenge by Preprocessing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stroke is among the top three causes of death worldwide, and accurate identification of stroke lesion boundaries is critical for diagnosis and treatment. Supervised deep learning methods have emerged as the leading solution for stroke lesion segmentation but require large, diverse, and annotated datasets. The ISLES'24 challenge addresses this need by providing longitudinal stroke imaging data, including CT scans taken on arrival to the hospital and follow-up MRI taken 2-9 days from initial arrival, with annotations derived from follow-up MRI. Importantly, models submitted to the ISLES'24 challenge are evaluated using only CT inputs, requiring prediction of lesion progression that may not be visible in CT scans for segmentation. Our winning solution shows that a carefully designed preprocessing pipeline including deep-learning-based skull stripping and custom intensity windowing is beneficial for accurate segmentation. Combined with a standard large residual nnU-Net architecture for segmentation, this approach achieves a mean test Dice of 28.5 with a standard deviation of 21.27.</description>

      <title>Surf2CT: Cascaded 3D Flow Matching Models for Torso 3D CT Synthesis from Skin Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Surf2CT, a novel cascaded flow matching framework that synthesizes full 3D computed tomography (CT) volumes of the human torso from external surface scans and simple demographic data (age, sex, height, weight). This is the first approach capable of generating realistic volumetric internal anatomy images solely based on external body shape and demographics, without any internal imaging. Surf2CT proceeds through three sequential stages: (1) Surface Completion, reconstructing a complete signed distance function (SDF) from partial torso scans using conditional 3D flow matching; (2) Coarse CT Synthesis, generating a low-resolution CT volume from the completed SDF and demographic information; and (3) CT Super-Resolution, refining the coarse volume into a high-resolution CT via a patch-wise conditional flow model. Each stage utilizes a 3D-adapted EDM2 backbone trained via flow matching. We trained our model on a combined dataset of 3,198 torso CT scans (approximately 1.13 million axial slices) sourced from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the AutoPET challenge. Evaluation on 700 paired torso surface-CT cases demonstrated strong anatomical fidelity: organ volumes exhibited small mean percentage differences (range from -11.1% to 4.4%), and muscle/fat body composition metrics matched ground truth with strong correlation (range from 0.67 to 0.96). Lung localization had minimal bias (mean difference -2.5 mm), and surface completion significantly improved metrics (Chamfer distance: from 521.8 mm to 2.7 mm; Intersection-over-Union: from 0.87 to 0.98). Surf2CT establishes a new paradigm for non-invasive internal anatomical imaging using only external data, opening opportunities for home-based healthcare, preventive medicine, and personalized clinical assessments without the risks associated with conventional imaging techniques.</description>

      <title>A Superposition Code-Based Semantic Communication Approach with Quantifiable and Controllable Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of achieving security in semantic communication (SemCom) over a wiretap channel, where a legitimate receiver coexists with an eavesdropper experiencing a poorer channel condition. Despite previous efforts to secure SemCom against eavesdroppers, guarantee of approximately zero information leakage remains an open issue. In this work, we propose a secure SemCom approach based on superposition codes, aiming to provide quantifiable and controllable security for digital SemCom systems. The proposed method employs a double-layered constellation map, where semantic information is associated with satellite constellation points and cloud center constellation points are randomly selected. By carefully allocating power between these two layers of constellation, we ensure that the symbol error probability (SEP) of the eavesdropper decoding satellite constellation points is nearly equivalent to random guessing, while maintaining a low SEP for the legitimate receiver to successfully decode the semantic information. Simulation results demonstrate that the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean squared error (MSE) of the eavesdropper' s reconstructed data, under the proposed method, can range from decoding Gaussian-distributed random noise to approaching the variance of the data. This validates the effectiveness of our method in nearly achieving the experimental upper bound of security for digital SemCom systems when both eavesdroppers and legitimate users utilize identical decoding schemes. Furthermore, the proposed method consistently outperforms benchmark techniques, showcasing superior data security and robustness against eavesdropping.</description>

      <title>QMamba: On First Exploration of Vision Mamba for Image Quality Assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we take the first exploration of the recently popular foundation model, i.e., State Space Model/Mamba, in image quality assessment (IQA), aiming at observing and excavating the perception potential in vision Mamba. A series of works on Mamba has shown its significant potential in various fields, e.g., segmentation and classification. However, the perception capability of Mamba remains under-explored. Consequently, we propose QMamba by revisiting and adapting the Mamba model for three crucial IQA tasks, i.e., task-specific, universal, and transferable IQA, which reveals its clear advantages over existing foundational models, e.g., Swin Transformer, ViT, and CNNs, in terms of perception and computational cost. To improve the transferability of QMamba, we propose the StylePrompt tuning paradigm, where lightweight mean and variance prompts are injected to assist task-adaptive transfer learning of pre-trained QMamba for different downstream IQA tasks. Compared with existing prompt tuning strategies, our StylePrompt enables better perceptual transfer with lower computational cost. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic, authentic IQA datasets, and cross IQA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed QMamba. The code will be available at: https://github.com/bingo-G/QMamba.git</description>

      <title>Epsilon-VAE: Denoising as Visual Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04081v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In generative modeling, tokenization simplifies complex data into compact, structured representations, creating a more efficient, learnable space. For high-dimensional visual data, it reduces redundancy and emphasizes key features for high-quality generation. Current visual tokenization methods rely on a traditional autoencoder framework, where the encoder compresses data into latent representations, and the decoder reconstructs the original input. In this work, we offer a new perspective by proposing denoising as decoding, shifting from single-step reconstruction to iterative refinement. Specifically, we replace the decoder with a diffusion process that iteratively refines noise to recover the original image, guided by the latents provided by the encoder. We evaluate our approach by assessing both reconstruction (rFID) and generation quality (FID), comparing it to state-of-the-art autoencoding approaches. By adopting iterative reconstruction through diffusion, our autoencoder, namely Epsilon-VAE, achieves high reconstruction quality, which in turn enhances downstream generation quality by 22% at the same compression rates or provides 2.3x inference speedup through increasing compression rates. We hope this work offers new insights into integrating iterative generation and autoencoding for improved compression and generation.</description>

      <title>Circumventing shortcuts in audio-visual deepfake detection datasets with unsupervised learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Good datasets are essential for developing and benchmarking any machine learning system. Their importance is even more extreme for safety critical applications such as deepfake detection - the focus of this paper. Here we reveal that two of the most widely used audio-video deepfake datasets suffer from a previously unidentified spurious feature: the leading silence. Fake videos start with a very brief moment of silence and based on this feature alone, we can separate the real and fake samples almost perfectly. As such, previous audio-only and audio-video models exploit the presence of silence in the fake videos and consequently perform worse when the leading silence is removed. To circumvent latching on such unwanted artifact and possibly other unrevealed ones we propose a shift from supervised to unsupervised learning by training models exclusively on real data. We show that by aligning self-supervised audio-video representations we remove the risk of relying on dataset-specific biases and improve robustness in deepfake detection.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Enhancement of Forward-Looking Sonar Images: Bridging Cross-Modal Degradation Gaps through Feature Space Transformation and Multi-Frame Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhancing forward-looking sonar images is critical for accurate underwater target detection. Current deep learning methods mainly rely on supervised training with simulated data, but the difficulty in obtaining high-quality real-world paired data limits their practical use and generalization. Although self-supervised approaches from remote sensing partially alleviate data shortages, they neglect the cross-modal degradation gap between sonar and remote sensing images. Directly transferring pretrained weights often leads to overly smooth sonar images, detail loss, and insufficient brightness. To address this, we propose a feature-space transformation that maps sonar images from the pixel domain to a robust feature domain, effectively bridging the degradation gap. Additionally, our self-supervised multi-frame fusion strategy leverages complementary inter-frame information to naturally remove speckle noise and enhance target-region brightness. Experiments on three self-collected real-world forward-looking sonar datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, effectively suppressing noise, preserving detailed edges, and substantially improving brightness, demonstrating strong potential for underwater target detection applications.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a stereo radargrammetry method using deep learning from airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Deep learning-based methods are considered to suffer less from geometric image modulation, while there is no public SAR image dataset used to train such methods. We create a SAR image dataset and perform fine-tuning of a deep learning-based image correspondence method. The proposed method suppresses the degradation of image quality by pixel interpolation without ground projection of the SAR image and divides the SAR image into patches for processing, which makes it possible to apply deep learning. Through a set of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits a wider range and more accurate elevation measurements compared to conventional methods.
