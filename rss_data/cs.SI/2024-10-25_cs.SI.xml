      <title>Exploring Network Structure with the Density of States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection, as well as the identification of other structures like core periphery and disassortative patterns, is an important topic in network analysis. While most methods seek to find the best partition of the network according to some criteria, there is a body of results that suggest that a single network can have many good but distinct partitions. In this paper we introduce the density of states as a tool for studying the space of all possible network partitions. We demonstrate how to use the well known Wang-Landau method to compute a network's density of states. We show that, even using modularity to measure quality, the density of states can still rule out spurious structure in random networks and overcome resolution limits. We demonstrate how these methods can be used to find `building blocks', groups of nodes which are consistently found together in detected communities. This suggests an approach to partitioning based on exploration of the network's structure landscape rather than optimisation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Information Diffusion Prediction by Addressing Noise in Social Connection Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing use of online social media platforms, information diffusion has become a prevalent phenomenon, making Information Diffusion Prediction (IDP) critical for various applications. Many studies utilize social connection data to improve prediction performance. However, previous research has largely overlooked the issue of noise within social connection data, which often contains irrelevant or misleading connections due to the diversity of social relationships and the presence of weak ties. Such noise can lead to inaccurate learning of user preferences and negatively affect prediction outcomes. To address this issue, we propose DIDP, a novel social connection denoising framework for information diffusion prediction. First, we introduce a graph learning encoder module that encodes the information diffusion hypergraph and social graph to obtain latent diffusion embeddings and social embeddings. Next, DIDP integrates a denoising diffusion module to adaptively remove different types of noise from the learned social embeddings in the latent space. Through multi-step noise injection and removal, the framework enhances the ability to learn robust embeddings. Additionally, we introduce a cross-domain contrastive learning module that maximizes the mutual information between the diffusion embeddings and the denoised social embeddings of the same user. This module guides the denoising process and facilitates cross-domain knowledge transfer. Experimental results show that DIDP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the information diffusion prediction task.</description>

      <title>Health Misinformation in Social Networks: A Survey of IT Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on the pervasive issue of medical misinformation in social networks from the perspective of information technology. The survey aims at providing a systematic review of related research and helping researchers and practitioners navigate through this fast-changing field. Specifically, we first present manual and automatic approaches for fact-checking. We then explore fake news detection methods, using content, propagation features, or source features, as well as mitigation approaches for countering the spread of misinformation. We also provide a detailed list of several datasets on health misinformation and of publicly available tools. We conclude the survey with a discussion on the open challenges and future research directions in the battle against health misinformation.</description>

      <title>Continuous Dynamic Modeling via Neural ODEs for Popularity Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Popularity prediction for information cascades has significant applications across various domains, including opinion monitoring and advertising recommendations. While most existing methods consider this as a discrete problem, popularity actually evolves continuously, exhibiting rich dynamic properties such as change rates and growth patterns. In this paper, we argue that popularity trajectory prediction is more practical, as it aims to forecast the entire trajectory of how popularity unfolds over arbitrary future time. This approach offers insights into both instantaneous popularity and the underlying dynamic properties. However, traditional methods for popularity trajectory prediction primarily rely on specific diffusion mechanism assumptions, which may not align well with real-world dynamics and compromise their performance. To address these limitations, we propose NODEPT, a novel approach based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for popularity trajectory prediction. NODEPT models the continuous dynamics of the underlying diffusion system using neural ODEs. We first employ an encoder to initialize the latent state representations of information cascades, consisting of two representation learning modules that capture the co-evolution structural characteristics and temporal patterns of cascades from different perspectives. More importantly, we then introduce an ODE-based generative module that learns the dynamics of the diffusion system in the latent space. Finally, a decoder transforms the latent state into the prediction of the future popularity trajectory. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of the proposed NODEPT method.</description>

      <title>Language-Agnostic Modeling of Source Reliability on Wikipedia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last few years, content verification through reliable sources has become a fundamental need to combat disinformation. Here, we present a language-agnostic model designed to assess the reliability of sources across multiple language editions of Wikipedia. Utilizing editorial activity data, the model evaluates source reliability within different articles of varying controversiality such as Climate Change, COVID-19, History, Media, and Biology topics. Crafting features that express domain usage across articles, the model effectively predicts source reliability, achieving an F1 Macro score of approximately 0.80 for English and other high-resource languages. For mid-resource languages, we achieve 0.65 while the performance of low-resource languages varies; in all cases, the time the domain remains present in the articles (which we dub as permanence) is one of the most predictive features. We highlight the challenge of maintaining consistent model performance across languages of varying resource levels and demonstrate that adapting models from higher-resource languages can improve performance. This work contributes not only to Wikipedia's efforts in ensuring content verifiability but in ensuring reliability across diverse user-generated content in various language communities.</description>

      <title>SPEED++: A Multilingual Event Extraction Framework for Epidemic Prediction and Preparedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media is often the first place where communities discuss the latest societal trends. Prior works have utilized this platform to extract epidemic-related information (e.g. infections, preventive measures) to provide early warnings for epidemic prediction. However, these works only focused on English posts, while epidemics can occur anywhere in the world, and early discussions are often in the local, non-English languages. In this work, we introduce the first multilingual Event Extraction (EE) framework SPEED++ for extracting epidemic event information for a wide range of diseases and languages. To this end, we extend a previous epidemic ontology with 20 argument roles; and curate our multilingual EE dataset SPEED++ comprising 5.1K tweets in four languages for four diseases. Annotating data in every language is infeasible; thus we develop zero-shot cross-lingual cross-disease models (i.e., training only on English COVID data) utilizing multilingual pre-training and show their efficacy in extracting epidemic-related events for 65 diverse languages across different diseases. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can provide epidemic warnings for COVID-19 in its earliest stages in Dec 2019 (3 weeks before global discussions) from Chinese Weibo posts without any training in Chinese. Furthermore, we exploit our framework's argument extraction capabilities to aggregate community epidemic discussions like symptoms and cure measures, aiding misinformation detection and public attention monitoring. Overall, we lay a strong foundation for multilingual epidemic preparedness.</description>

      <title>The process of polarisation as a loss of dimensionality: measuring changes in polarisation using Singular Value Decomposition of network graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present new methods that extend Baldassari and Gelman's theory of polarisation. They show that it is useful to define polarisation as increasing correlation between positions in an ideological field, which reduces political pluralism. We also draw from post-structuralist work which argues that deliberate development of these correlations is a feature of polarised regimes such as apartheid.
  To measure polarisation in social networks, we use Random Dot Product Graphs to embed social networks in metric spaces. Singular Value Decomposition of a social network provides an embedded dimensionality which corresponds to the number of uncorrelated dimensions in the network. Each uncorrelated dimension in a social network represents a part of that society which allows two people from different groups to form a social connection, such as living in a racially integrated neighbourhood. A decrease in the optimal dimensionality for the embedding of the network graph means that the dimensions in the network are becoming more correlated, and therefore the network is becoming more polarised.
  We apply this method to the communication interactions among New Zealand Twitter users discussing climate change issues from 2017 to 2023. We find that the discussion is more polarised after 2020 than before, as shown by a decrease in the dimensionality of the communication network. Second, we apply this method to discussions of the COP climate change conferences, showing that our methods agree with other researchers' detections of polarisation in this space. Finally, we use networks generated by stochastic block models to explore how an increase of the isolation between distinct communities, or the increase of the predominance of one community over the other, in the social networks decrease the embedded dimensionality and are therefore identifiable as polarisation processes.</description>

      <title>The Failed Migration of Academic Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following changes in Twitter's ownership and subsequent changes to content moderation policies, many in academia looked to move their discourse elsewhere and migration to Mastodon was pursued by some. Our study looks at the dynamics of this migration. Utilizing publicly available user account data, we track the posting activity of academics on Mastodon over a one year period. We also gathered follower-followee relationships to map internal networks, finding that the subset of academics who engaged in migration were well-connected. However, this strong internal connectivity was insufficient to prevent users from returning to Twitter/X. Our analyses reveal significant challenges sustaining user engagement on Mastodon due to its decentralized structure as well as competition from other platforms such as Bluesky and Threads. The movement lost momentum after an initial surge of enthusiasm where the main network was fully established as most users did not maintain their activity levels, and those who did faced lower levels of engagement. Our findings highlight the challenges involved in transitioning professional communities to decentralized platforms, emphasizing the need for focus on community building for long-term user engagement.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Physician Referral Networks with Ricci Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying (a) systemic barriers to quality healthcare access and (b) key indicators of care efficacy in the United States remains a significant challenge. To improve our understanding of regional disparities in care delivery, we introduce a novel application of curvature, a geometrical-topological property of networks, to Physician Referral Networks. Our initial findings reveal that Forman-Ricci and Ollivier-Ricci curvature measures, which are known for their expressive power in characterizing network structure, offer promising indicators for detecting variations in healthcare efficacy while capturing a range of significant regional demographic features. We also present APPARENT, an open-source tool that leverages Ricci curvature and other network features to examine correlations between regional Physician Referral Networks structure, local census data, healthcare effectiveness, and patient outcomes.</description>
