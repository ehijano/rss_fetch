      <title>Microcirculatory blood flow with aberrant levels of red blood cell aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent clinical results indicate that aberrant erythrocyte aggregation in hematological disorders is accompanied by endothelial damage and glycocalyx disruption, but the underlying biophysical mechanisms remain unclear. This study uses direct computational modeling to explore how red blood cell (RBC) aggregation impacts shear stress in small blood vessels, highlighting the increased risk of vascular damage. RBC aggregation creates a heterogeneous distribution, leading to variations in the cell-free layer thickness and fluctuating wall shear stress, especially near vessel walls. This effect aligns with experimental findings on endothelial disruption linked to RBC clustering near the wall, potentially reducing the protective glycocalyx layer. The power spectral density analysis of wall shear stress fluctuations reveals that, with RBC aggregation, there is a distinct peak near frequency f = 0.04, indicating increased fluctuations due to aggregated RBC clusters traveling close to the vessel wall. The presence of aberrant cells in blood disorders, modeled here by sickle cells, further amplifies these effects, as aggregation-enhanced margination drives sickle cells closer to vessel walls, exacerbating shear stress fluctuations and increasing the likelihood of vascular injury and inflammation. Simulations show that curved vascular geometry, with curvature accentuating RBC clustering near vessel walls, intensifies aggregation-induced wall shear stress fluctuations and increases the risk of vascular damage, particularly in sickle cell disease where sickle cells marginate closer to the wall.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Approach to the Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: the Navier-Stokes equations are essential in fluid dynamics, describing the motion of fluids like liquids and gases. Solving these equations, especially in complex flows and high-Reynolds-number regimes, is a significant challenge. Numerical simulations provide some insights, but often under restrictive assumptions that limit applicability. Recent geometric and algebraic methods have emerged, focusing on the equations' structure, yet questions about the uniqueness and stability of weak solutions persist. Objective: this paper aims to reformulate the Navier-Stokes equations in covariant form and develop new equations that facilitate the search for potential solutions, emphasizing symmetries. Geometric Approach: a covariant formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations is presented, applying a Fourier transform on a bounded manifold and seeking smoothness and viable solutions through convergence of manifold elements. Transformations: the study examines transformations between manifolds, investigating symmetries and interpretations related to homeomorphisms, isometries, and diffeomorphisms, including inertial frames of reference. Discussion and Conclusions: this study introduces a geometric reformulation of the Navier-Stokes equations, proposing new equations to enhance convergence and smoothness of solutions. It presents a novel class of solutions and transformations, with significant interdisciplinary connections. Further simulations, experimental validation, and ongoing development are essential to broaden the applicability of these equations and their solutions.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Immersed-Boundary/Front-Tracking Method for Interface-Resolved Simulation of Droplet Evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hybrid sharp-interface immersed-boundary/front-tracking (IB/FT) method is developed for interface-resolved simulation of evaporating droplets in incompressible multiphase flows. A one-field formulation is used to solve the flow, species mass fraction and energy equations in the entire computational domain with appropriate jump conditions at the interface. An image point and ghost cell methodology is coupled with a front-tracking method to achieve an overall second order spatial accuracy for the mass fraction boundary condition on the droplet surface. The immersed-boundary method is also extended to simulate mass transfer from a solid sphere in a convective environment. The numerical method is first validated for the standard benchmark cases and the results are found to be in good agreement with analytical solutions. The method is shown to be overall second order accurate in space. Employing a moving reference frame methodology, the method is then applied to simulate evaporation of a deformable droplet in a convective environment and the results are compared with the existing evaporation models widely used in spray combustion simulations.</description>

      <title>Stokes Waves in Finite Depth Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider traveling waves on a surface of an ideal fluid of finite depth. The equation describing Stokes waves in conformal variables formulation are referred to as the Babenko equation. We use a Newton-Conjugate-Gradient method to compute Stokes waves for a range of conformal depths from deep to shallow water. In deep water, we compute eigenvalues of the linearized Babenko equation with Fourier-Floquet-Hill method. The secondary bifurcation points that correspond to double period bifurcations of the Stokes waves are identified on the family of waves. In shallow water, we find solutions that have broad troughs and sharp crests, and which resemble cnoidal or soliton-like solution profiles of the Korteweg-de Vries equation. Regardless of depth, we find that these solutions form a $2\pi/3$ angle at the crest in the limit of large steepness.</description>

      <title>Designing an Optimal Scoop for Holloman High-Speed Test Track Water Braking Mechanism using Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Specializing in high-speed testing, Holloman High-Speed Test Track (HHSTT) uses water braking to stop vehicles on the test track. This method takes advantage of the higher density of water, compared to air, to increase braking capability through momentum exchange by increasing the water content in that section at the end of the track. By studying water braking using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the forces acting on tracked vehicles can be approximated and prepared before actual testing through numerical simulations. In this study, emphasis will be placed on the brake component of the tracked sled, which is responsible for interacting with water to brake. By discretizing a volume space around our brake, we accelerate the water and air to simulate the brake coupling relatively. The multiphase flow model uses the governing equations of the gas and liquid phases with the finite volume method to perform 3D simulations. By adjusting the air and water inlet velocity, it is possible to simulate HHSTT sled tests at various operating speeds.</description>

      <title>Crank-Nicolson BGK Integrator for Multi-Scale Particle-Based Kinetic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) equation with a stochastic particle approach enables efficient and flexible simulations of flows in the transition regime, between continuum and free molecular flow. However, the usual first-order operator splitting between particle movement and relaxation imposes restrictions on the time step, causing the computational cost to increase with the gas density. The Crank-Nicolson stochastic particle BGK (CN-SPBGK) method is introduced here as an advanced particle-based kinetic solver designed for multi-scale gas flow simulations. This method integrates the BGK equation with second-order accuracy across all Knudsen number regimes without requiring additional parameters, while asymptotically preserving the Navier-Stokes flux in the continuum regime. Comparisons with pre-existing particle BGK methods are conducted on several test cases, with CN-SPBGK demonstrating more consistent convergence and accuracy.</description>

      <title>HOPE: An Automatically Differentiable High-Order Non-Oscillatory Finite-Volume Shallow-Water Dynamic Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19185v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An automatically differentiable, high-order non-oscillatory finite volume shallow water dynamic core has been constructed on a cubed sphere grid. This dynamic core has four advantageous properties: high order accuracy, essential non-oscillation, mass conservation, and scalability. Besides, the code development is based on PyTorch, enabling the model to run seamlessly on both CPU and GPU, while naturally possessing the capability of automatic differentiation. We named the new dynamic core as High Order Prediction Environment (HOPE). The spatial reconstruction is based on the two-dimensional tensor product polynomial and the genuine two-dimensional Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) scheme. A novel panel boundary approach ensures that the accuracy can reach arbitrary order. The algorithm has very high degree of compatibility with GPU architecture, allowing the computational overhead to be mitigated through the utilization of GPU. The LMARS (Low Mach number Approximate Riemann Solver) scheme is adopted as Riemann solvers to determine fluxes on the Gaussian points on edges. Flux across the interface between each cell edge is computed using linear Gaussian quadrature, and the tendency of prognostic values is obtained by summing all fluxes around the cell. This shallow water dynamic core demonstrates outstanding performance in ideal shallow water test cases. In the steady-state geostrophic flow, the 11th order scheme reduces errors to nearly round-off error even on coarse grids (2 degrees). Furthermore, the Rossby-Haurwitz wave preserves its shape for over 90 days. To test the non-oscillation property, we designed a cylinder dam break case. The WENO approach effectively suppresses non-physical oscillation, and the genuine two-dimensional reconstruction exhibits significantly better isotropy than the dimension-by-dimension scheme.</description>

      <title>An unstructured adaptive mesh refinement for steady flows based on physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesh generation is essential for accurate and efficient computational fluid dynamics simulations. To resolve critical features in the flow, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is routinely employed in certain regions of the computational domain, where gradients or error estimates of the solution are often considered as the refining criteria. In many scenarios, however, these indicators can lead to unnecessary refinement over a large region, making the process a matter of trial and error and resulting in slow convergence of the computation. To this end, we propose a heuristic strategy that employs the residuals of the governing partial differential equations (PDEs) as a novel criterion to adaptively guide the mesh refining process. In particular, we leverage on the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to integrate imprecise data obtained on a coarse mesh and the governing PDEs. Once trained, PINNs are capable of identifying regions of highest residuals of the Navier-Stokes/Euler equations and suggesting new potential vertices for the coarse mesh cells. Moreover, we put forth two schemes to maintain the quality of the refined mesh through the strategic insertion of vertices and the implementation of Delaunay triangulation. By applying the residuals-guided AMR to address a multitude of typical incompressible/compressible flow problems and comparing the outcomes with those of gradient-based methods, we illustrate that the former effectively attains a favorable balance between the computational accuracy and cost.</description>

      <title>Shock-capturing particle hydrodynamics with reproducing kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and explore a new shock-capturing particle hydrodynamics approach. We enhance a commonly used SPH discretization with Roe's approximate Riemann solver where we use slope-limited linear reconstruction in the dissipative terms of the solver. All gradients of the method are calculated with linearly reproducing kernels that are constructed to enforce the two lowest order consistency relations so that constant and linear functions can be recovered to machine precision. We scrutinize the method with a set of challenging 3D benchmark problems ranging from shocks over instabilities to Schulz-Rinne-type vorticity creating shocks. In all of them we find excellent agreement with analytic/reference solutions.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the Global Attractor of 2D Incompressible Turbulence in the Palinstrophy-Enstrophy-Energy Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytic bounds on the projection of the global attractor of 2D incompressible turbulence in the palinstrophy--enstrophy plane [Dascaliuc, Foias, and Jolly 2005, 2010] are observed to vastly overestimate the values obtained from numerical simulations. This is due to the lack of a good estimate for the inner product $(\cal{B}(u,u),A^2u)$ of the advection term and the biLaplacian. Sobolev inequalities like Ladyzhenskaya or Agmon's inequalities yield an upper bound that we show is not sharp. In fact, for statistically isotropic turbulence, the expected value of $(\cal{B}(u,u),A^2u)$ is zero. The implications for estimates on the behaviour of the global attractor are discussed.</description>

      <title>Gravity current energetics and particle suspension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravity currents are a ubiquitous density driven flow occurring in both the natural environment and in industry. They include: seafloor turbidity currents, primary vectors of sediment, nutrient and pollutant transport; cold fronts; and hazardous gas spills. However, while the energetics are critical for their evolution and particle suspension, they are included in system scale models only crudely, so we cannot yet predict and explain the dynamics and run-out of such real-world flows. Herein, a novel depth-averaged framework is developed to capture the evolution of volume, concentration, momentum, and turbulent kinetic energy from direct integrals of the full governing equations. For the first time, we show the connection between the vertical profiles, the evolution of the depth-averaged flow, and the energetics. The viscous dissipation of mean-flow energy near the bed makes a leading order contribution, and an energetic approach to entrainment captures detrainment of fluid through particle settling. These observations allow a reconsideration of particle suspension, advancing over 50-years of research. We find that the new formulation can describe the full evolution of a shallow dilute current, with the accuracy depending primarily on closures for the profiles and source terms. Critically, this enables accurate and computationally efficient hazard risk analysis and earth surface modelling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates conjugate heat transfer analysis of a rocket nozzle featuring a charring ablative thermal protection system. The study is carried out by weakly coupling a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) flow solver Fluent with an in-house material thermal response solver. The coupling of the two solvers is carried out by exchanging the boundary conditions at the fluid-solid interface using a non-iterative approach. Validation of the numerical framework is performed. A blowing correlation is used to model the pyrolysis gas behavior at the interface. Results highlight a significant surface heating and ablation particularly at the nozzle throat.</description>

      <title>The universality of the law of the wall: A long-lasting controversial debate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the law of the wall, the log-law including the von Karman constant, is seen to be one of the biggest accomplishments of fluid mechanics. However, after more than ninety years there is still a controversial debate about the validity and universality of the law of the wall. Clarity about this question matters: in absence of alternatives, a reliable and universal theory involving the law of the wall is needed to provide essential guideline for the validation of theory, computational methods, and experimental studies of very high Reynolds number (Re) flows. The paper presents an analysis of concepts used to derive controversial conclusions. It is shown that nonuniversality is a consequence of simplified modeling concepts, which leads to unrealizable models. On the other hand, realizability implies universality: models in consistency with physical requirements do not need to be adjusted to different flows. There are essential advantages of a universal law of the wall: it enables the design of accurate turbulence models and it provides a bridge between finite Re observations and asymptotic structural theories of turbulence.</description>

      <title>Continuous Eddy Simulation (CES): Conceptual approach and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of high Reynolds number (Re) separated turbulent flows faces significant problems for decades: large eddy simulation (LES) is computationally too expensive, and Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) methods and hybrid RANS-LES methods often provide unreliable results. This has serious consequences, we are currently unable to reliably predict very high Re regimes, which hampers applications and our understanding of turbulence structures. The paper reports the advantages of a strict mathematical approach, continuous eddy simulation (CES), to derive partially resolving turbulence models. In contrast to popular hybrid RANS-LES, this minimal error approach includes a dynamic modification of the turbulence model in response to the actual flow resolution: the model can increase (decrease) its contribution to the simulation in dependence of a low (high) flow resolution. This property is the essential requirement to seamlessly cover RANS and LES regimes. The CES modeling approach offers essential advantages regarding its functionality: basically, it is independent of a variety of simulation settings applied in popular hybrid RANS-LES to improve the model performance. In addition, the CES computational cost can be below the cost of other hybrid RANS-LES and LES by orders of magnitude. Essential simulation performance advantages of CES simulations are described here with respect to three complex flow applications: periodic hill flows at high Reynolds number, the NASA wall-mounted hump flow, and the Bachalo &amp; Johnson axisymmetric transonic bump flow.</description>

      <title>Intermittency assessed through a model of kurtosis-skewness relation in MHD in fast dynamo regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermittency as it occurs in fast dynamos in the MHD framework is evaluated through the examination of relations between normalized moments at third order (skewness S) and fourth order (kurtosis K) for both the velocity and magnetic field, and for their local dissipations. As investigated by several authors in various physical contexts such as fusion plasmas (Krommes (2008)), climate evolution (Sura &amp; Sardeshmukh (2008)), fluid turbulence or rotating stratified flows (Pouquet et al. (2023)), approximate parabolic K(S) ~ alpha laws emerge whose origin may be related to the applicability of intermittency models to their dynamics. The results analyzed herein are obtained through direct numerical simulations of MHD flows for both Taylor-Green and Beltrami ABC forcing at moderate Reynolds numbers, and for up to 314000 turn-over times. We observe for the dissipation 0.2 &lt; alpha &lt;3.0, an evaluation that varies with the field, the forcing, and when filtering for high-skewness intermittent structures. When using the She &amp; Leveque (1994) intermittency model, one can compute alpha analytically; we then find alpha = 2.5, clearly differing from a (strict) parabolic scaling, a result consistent with the numerical data.</description>

      <title>Marangoni Interfacial Instability Induced by Solute Transfer Across Liquid-Liquid Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents analytical and numerical investigations of Marangoni interfacial instability in a two-liquid-layer system with constant solute transfer across the interface. While previous research has established that both diffusivity and viscosity ratios affect hydrodynamic stability via the Marangoni effect, the specific nonlinear dynamics and the role of interfacial deformation remain fully unclear. To address this, we developed a phase-field-based numerical model, validated against linear stability analysis and existing theories. The validated parameter space includes Schmidt number, Marangoni number, Capillary number, and the diffusivity and viscosity ratio between the two layers. Our finding shows that solute transfer from a less diffusive layer triggers short-wave instability, governed by the critical Marangoni number, while solute transfer into a less viscous layer induces long-wave instability, controlled by the critical Capillary number. Nonlinear simulations reveal distinct field coupling behaviors: in the diffusivity-ratio-driven instability, the spatially averaged flow intensity remains symmetric about a flat interface, while solute gradient is uneven. In contrast, in viscosity-ratio-driven instability, a deforming interface separates the two layers, with a uniform solute gradient but asymmetric spatially averaged flow intensity. These results highlight the crucial role of diffusivity and viscosity in shaping Marangoni flows and enhance our understanding of interfacial instability dynamics.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks-based Random Vortex Methods for Modelling Incompressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a novel Neural Networks-based approach for approximating solutions to the (2D) incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, which is an extension of so called Deep Random Vortex Methods (DRVM), that does not require the knowledge of the Biot--Savart kernel associated to the computational domain. Our algorithm uses a Neural Network (NN), that approximates the vorticity based on a loss function that uses a computationally efficient formulation of the Random Vortex Dynamics. The neural vorticity estimator is then combined with traditional numerical PDE-solvers, which can be considered as a final implicit linear layer of the network, for the Poisson equation to compute the velocity field. The main advantage of our method compared to the standard DRVM and other NN-based numerical algorithms is that it strictly enforces physical properties, such as incompressibility or (no slip) boundary conditions, which might be hard to guarantee otherwise. The approximation abilities of our algorithm, and its capability for incorporating measurement data, are validated by several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>How "mixing" affects propagation and structure of intensely turbulent, lean, hydrogen-air premixed flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how intrinsically fast hydrogen-air premixed flames can be rendered much faster in turbulence is crucial for systematically developing hydrogen-based gas turbines and spark ignition engines. Here, we present fundamental insights into the variation of flame displacement speeds by investigating how the disrupted flame structure affects speed and vice-versa. Three DNS cases of lean hydrogen-air mixtures with $Le$ from 0.5 to 1 and $Ka$ from 100 to 1000 are analyzed. Suitable comparisons are made with the closest canonical laminar flame configurations at same mixture conditions and their suitability and limitations in expounding turbulent flame properties are elucidated. Since near zero-curvature surface locations are most probable and representative of the average flame geometry in such large $Ka$ flames, this study focuses on the statistical variation of flame displacement speed and the concomitant change in flame structure at those locations. Relevant flame properties are averaged normal to the zero-curvature isotherm regions to obtain the conditional mean flame structures. In the smallest $Le$ case, downstream of the most probable zero-curvature regions, the temperature exceeds that of the standard laminar flame, leading to enhanced local thermal gradient and flame speed. This is due to increased heat-release rate contribution by differential diffusion in positive curvatures downstream of the zero-curvature locations. Furthermore, locally, the flame structure is broadened for all cases due to a reversal in the direction of the flame speed gradient. This reversal is caused by cylindrical flame-flame interactions upstream of the zero-curvature regions, resulting in localized scalar mixing within the flame structure. These non-local effects, in combination, define the mean flame structure and the associated variation in local flame speed in turbulent premixed flames.</description>

      <title>Digital twin of a large-aspect-ratio Rayleigh-B\'enard experiment: Role of thermal boundary conditions, measurement errors and uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Albeit laboratory experiments and numerical simulations have proven themselves successful in enhancing our understanding of long-living large-scale flow structures in horizontally extended Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, some discrepancies with respect to their size and induced heat transfer remain. This study traces these discrepancies back to their origins. We start by generating a digital twin of one standard experimental set-up. This twin is subsequently simplified in steps to understand the effect of non-ideal thermal boundary conditions, and the experimental measurement procedure is mimicked using numerical data. Although this allows explaining the increased observed size of the flow structures in the experiment relative to past numerical simulations, our data suggests that the vertical velocity magnitude has been underestimated in the experiments. A subsequent re-assessment of the latter's original data reveals an incorrect calibration model. The re-processed data show a relative increase in $u_{z}$ of roughly $24 \%$, resolving the previously observed discrepancies. This digital twin of a laboratory experiment for thermal convection at Rayleigh numbers $\Ra = \left\{ 2, 4, 7 \right\} \times 10^{5}$, a Prandtl number $\Pr = 7.1$, and an aspect ratio $\Gamma = 25$ highlights the role of different thermal boundary conditions as well as a reliable calibration and measurement procedure.</description>

      <title>PINNs4Drops: Convolutional feature-enhanced physics-informed neural networks for reconstructing two-phase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-phase flow phenomena play a key role in many engineering applications, including hydrogen fuel cells, spray cooling techniques and combustion. Specialized techniques like shadowgraphy and particle image velocimetry can reveal gas-liquid interface evolution and internal velocity fields; however, they are largely limited to planar measurements, while flow dynamics are inherently three-dimensional (3D). Deep learning techniques based on convolutional neural networks provide a powerful approach for volumetric reconstruction based on the experimental data by leveraging spatial structure of images and extracting context-rich features. Building on this foundation, Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a complementary and promising alternative integrating prior knowledge in the form of governing equations into the networks training process. This integration enables accurate predictions even with limited data. By combining the strengths of both approaches, we propose a novel convolutional feature-enhanced PINNs framework, designed for the spatio-temporal reconstruction of two-phase flows from color-coded shadowgraphy images. The proposed approach is first validated on synthetic data generated through direct numerical simulation, demonstrating high spatial accuracy in reconstructing the three-dimensional gas-liquid interface, along with the inferred velocity and pressure fields. Subsequently, we apply this method to interface reconstruction for an impinging droplet using planar experimental data, highlighting the practical applicability and significant potential of the proposed approach to real-world fluid dynamics analysis.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Super-Stencils for Turbulence Model Corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate simulation of turbulent flows remains a challenge due to the high computational cost of direct numerical simulations (DNS) and the limitations of traditional turbulence models. This paper explores a novel approach to augmenting standard models for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations using a Non-Linear Super-Stencil (NLSS). The proposed method introduces a fully connected neural network that learns a mapping from the local mean flow field to a corrective force term, which is added to a standard RANS solver in order to align its solution with high-fidelity data. A procedure is devised to extract training data from reference DNS and large eddy simulations (LES). To reduce the complexity of the non-linear mapping, the dimensionless local flow data is aligned with the local mean velocity, and the local support domain is scaled by the turbulent integral length scale. After being trained on a single periodic hill case, the NLSS-corrected RANS solver is shown to generalize to different periodic hill geometries and different Reynolds numbers, producing significantly more accurate solutions than the uncorrected RANS simulations.</description>

      <title>Laws of thermodynamic equilibrium within first order relativistic hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using recently developed consistent and robust first order relativistic hydrodynamics of a dissipative fluid we propose a generalization but weak version of Tolman-Ehrenfest relation and Klein's law on a general background spacetime. These relations are appeared to be a consequence of thermal equilibrium state of the fluid, defined by the absence of heat flux. We interpret them as the defining relations for the local temperature and chemical potential of the fluid. The validity of usual Tolman-Ehrenfest relation and Klein's law deeply depends on the existence of a global timelike Killing vector. However imposition of more stronger equilibrium condition -- local conservation of entropy current -- yields the constancy of the equilibrium thermodynamic parameters along the flow lines.</description>

      <title>Finite-difference-informed graph network for solving steady-state incompressible flows on block-structured grids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10534v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in deep learning have enabled physics-informed neural networks to solve partial differential equations. Numerical differentiation using the finite-difference (FD) method is efficient in physics-constrained designs, even in parameterized settings. In traditional computational fluid dynamics(CFD), body-fitted block-structured grids are often employed for complex flow cases when obtaining FD solutions. However, convolution operators in convolutional neural networks for FD are typically limited to single-block grids. To address this issue, \blueText{graphs and graph networks are used} to learn flow representations across multi-block-structured grids. \blueText{A graph convolution-based FD method (GC-FDM) is proposed} to train graph networks in a label-free physics-constrained manner, enabling differentiable FD operations on unstructured graph outputs. To demonstrate model performance from single- to multi-block-structured grids, \blueText{the parameterized steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved} for a lid-driven cavity flow and the flows around single and double circular cylinder configurations. When compared to a CFD solver under various boundary conditions, the proposed method achieves a relative error in velocity field predictions on the order of $10^{-3}$. Furthermore, the proposed method reduces training costs by approximately 20\% compared to a physics-informed neural network. \blueText{To} further verify the effectiveness of GC-FDM in multi-block processing, \blueText{a 30P30N airfoil geometry is considered} and the \blueText{predicted} results are reasonable compared with those given by CFD. \blueText{Finally, the applicability of GC-FDM to three-dimensional (3D) case is tested using a 3D cavity geometry.</description>

      <title>Parsimonious Dynamic Mode Decomposition: A Robust and Automated Approach for Optimally Sparse Mode Selection in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Parsimonious Dynamic Mode Decomposition (parsDMD), a novel algorithm designed to automatically select an optimally sparse subset of dynamic modes for both spatiotemporal and purely temporal data. By incorporating time-delay embedding and leveraging Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), parsDMD ensures robustness against noise and effectively handles complex, nonlinear dynamics. The algorithm is validated on a diverse range of datasets, including standing wave signals, identifying hidden dynamics, fluid dynamics simulations (flow past a cylinder and transonic buffet), and atmospheric sea-surface temperature (SST) data. ParsDMD addresses a significant limitation of the traditional sparsity-promoting DMD (spDMD), which requires manual tuning of sparsity parameters through a rigorous trial-and-error process to balance between single-mode and all-mode solutions. In contrast, parsDMD autonomously determines the optimally sparse subset of modes without user intervention, while maintaining minimal computational complexity. Comparative analyses demonstrate that parsDMD consistently outperforms spDMD by providing more accurate mode identification and effective reconstruction in noisy environments. These advantages render parsDMD an effective tool for real-time diagnostics, forecasting, and reduced-order model construction across various disciplines.</description>
