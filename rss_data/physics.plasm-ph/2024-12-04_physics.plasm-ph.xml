      <title>Turbulence-Induced Safety Factor Profile Flattening at Rational Surfaces in Tokamaks with Low Magnetic Shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effects of ion-scale turbulence-generated currents on the local safety factor profile under conditions of low magnetic shear and proximity to rational surfaces, relevant to Internal Transport Barrier (ITB) formation. Our results show that turbulent currents can generate stationary zonal magnetic potential corrugations, producing a stepped safety factor profile with extended regions of zero magnetic shear. This change significantly affects turbulence self-interaction, resulting in a substantial decrease in turbulent transport, indicating a potential triggering mechanism for transport barrier formation.</description>

      <title>Parallel diffusion operator for magnetized plasmas with improved spectral fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusive transport processes in magnetized plasmas are highly anisotropic, with fast parallel transport along the magnetic field lines sometimes faster than perpendicular transport by orders of magnitude. This constitutes a major challenge for describing non-grid-aligned magnetic structures in Eulerian (grid-based) simulations. The present paper describes and validates a new method for parallel diffusion in magnetized plasmas based on the anti-symmetry representation [Halpern and Waltz, Phys. Plasmas 25, 060703 (2018)]. In the anti-symmetry formalism, diffusion manifests as a flow operator involving the logarithmic derivative of the transported quantity. Qualitative plane wave analysis shows that the new operator naturally yields better discrete spectral resolution compared to its conventional counterpart. Numerical simulations comparing the new method against existing finite difference methods are carried out, showing significant improvement. In particular, we find that combining anti-symmetry with finite differences in diagonally staggered grids essentially eliminates the so-called "artificial numerical diffusion" that affects conventional finite difference and finite volume methods.</description>

      <title>Centrifugal Confinement Fusion Thruster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centrifugal confinement fusion, a promising alternative to toroidal confinement devices like tokamaks and stellarators, leverages supersonic plasma rotation within a magnetic mirror configuration to achieve simplified coil design, compactness, and enhanced stability. This brief article explores the potential of centrifugal confinement fusion for propulsion applications. A previous concern regarding the escape of energetic ions, essential for propulsion, is addressed through test-particle simulations. The results indicate that the earlier estimate based on adiabatic invariance was overly pessimistic, and the underlying physics is clarified.</description>

      <title>Controlling the interaction of tightly focused 10-PW class lasers with multicomponent plasma via target parameters: optimization of electron-positron pair and $\gamma$-photon sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of multipetawatt lasers with plasma is a complex multiparameter problem, providing a wide field for fundamental research and opening up great opportunities for creating unique sources of high-energy electrons and positrons, dense pair plasma, and $\gamma$-photons. However, to achieve high efficiency of such a source, it is necessary to use targets with optimized parameters, primarily density and size, for the given laser parameters. With the use of 3D QED-PIC modeling it is shown that, when targets whose size is comparable with the laser wavelength are irradiated by laser beams with a total power of several tens of PW, the total initial number of target electrons may be regarded to be the similarity parameter of laser-plasma interaction. In practice, this can significantly simplify the selection of the targets needed for controlling the interaction and, accordingly, for achieving the specified parameters of the developed electron-positron plasma and $\gamma$-photon sources. Based on the similarity parameter, various laser-plasma interaction modes are identified, the necessary conditions for their launch are determined, and the properties of the pair particle and $\gamma$-photon source are revealed. Moreover, qualitative estimates of the quantitative and energy characteristics of such a source are obtained, allowing it to be optimized for various laser beam configurations.</description>

      <title>Quadrupolar Density Structures in Driven Magnetic Reconnection Experiments with a Guide Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous process in plasma physics, driving rapid and energetic events such as coronal mass ejections. Reconnection between magnetic fields with arbitrary shear can be decomposed into an anti-parallel, reconnecting component, and a non-reconnecting guide-field component which is parallel to the reconnecting electric field. This guide field modifies the structure of the reconnection layer and the reconnection rate. We present results from experiments on the MAIZE pulsed-power generator (500 kA peak current, 200 ns rise-time) which use two exploding wire arrays, tilted in opposite directions, to embed a guide field in the plasma flows with a relative strength $b\equiv B_g/B_{rec}=\text{0, 0.4, or 1}$. The reconnection layers in these experiments have widths which are less than the ion skin depth, $d_i=c/\omega_{pi}$, indicating the importance of the Hall term, which generates a distinctive quadrupolar magnetic field structure along the separatrices of the reconnection layer. Using laser imaging interferometry, we observe quadrupolar structures in the line-integrated electron density, consistent with the interaction of the embedded guide field with the quadrupolar Hall field. Our measurements extend over much larger length scales ($40 d_i$) at higher $\beta$ ($\sim 1$) than previous experiments, providing an insight into the global structure of the reconnection layer.</description>

      <title>Solar GES-structure modified with EiBI gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the post-Newtonian era, the Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory, considered as an improved modification of the Einsteinian general relativity formalism in the weak field regime (non-relativistic), has enabled us to study the dynamics of dense astroobjects in light of the modified gravitational effects. This EiBI theory imparts a new shape to the usual gravitational Poisson equation through the addition of a cosmological correction factor, termed as the EiBI gravity parameter. A systematic inclusion of this gravity in the basic structure equation could lead to a realistic picture of the existing solar models free from any end-stage singularity. A theoretic model is accordingly proposed to investigate the effect of the EiBI gravity on the Gravito-Electrostatic Sheath (GES) formalism of the equilibrium solar plasma structure. This study shows that the GES-based solar plasma dynamics is noticeably modified against the previously reported Newtonian GES-model studies. An equilibrium bounded solution for the solar self-gravity shows the EiBI-modified solar surface boundary (SSB) to exist at a new helio-centric radial location $\xi = 4$ (on the Jeansean scale). It is found that the EiBI gravity shifts the present SSB outwards by 14.28% relative to the original Newtonian SSB. The EiBI-modified gravity effects on diverse relevant solar parameters, such as the gravito-electrostatic potentials, fields, and Mach numbers, are illustratively analyzed. It is anticipated that our analyses could be applied further to see the solar plasma equilibrium and fluctuation dynamics in realistically modified post-Newtonian gravity environments on both the bounded (interior) and unbounded (exterior) solar plasma scales.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fluid Models of the Braginskii Type. Part 2. The Boltzmann Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous paper (Hunana et al. 2022) we have employed the Landau collisional operator together with the moment method of Grad and considered various generalizations of the Braginskii model, such as a multi-fluid formulation of the 21- and 22-moment models valid for general masses and temperatures, where all of the considered moments are described by their evolution equations (with fully non-linear left-hand-sides). Here we consider the same models, however, we employ the Boltzmann operator and calculate the collisional contributions via expressing them through the Chapman-Cowling collisional integrals. These ``integrals'' just represent a useful mathematical technique/notation introduced roughly 100 years ago, which (in the usual semi-linear approximation) allows one to postpone specifying the particular collisional process and finish all of the calculations with the Boltzmann operator. We thus consider multi-fluid 21- and 22-moment models which are valid for a large class of elastic collisional processes describable by the Boltzmann operator. Reduction into the 13-moment approximation recovers the models of Schunk and Burgers. We only focus on the particular cases of hard spheres, Coulomb collisions, purely repulsive inverse power force $|K|/r^\nu$ and attractive force $-|K|/r^\nu$ with repulsive rigid core (or potential $V(r)=\delta(r)- |c|/r^n$, so that the particles bounce from each other when they meet), but other cases can be found in the literature. In the Appendix, we introduce the Boltzmann operator in a way suitable for newcomers and we discuss a surprisingly simple recipe how to calculate the collisional contributions with analytic software.</description>

      <title>Influences of $\delta$B Contribution and Parallel Inertial Term of Energetic Particles on MHD-Kinetic Hybrid Simulations: A Case Study of the 1/1 Internal Kink Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetohydrodynamic-kinetic (MHD-kinetic) hybrid model [Park et. al., 1992] has been widely applied in studying energetic particles (EPs) problems in fusion plasmas for past decades. The pressure-coupling scheme or the current-coupling scheme is adopted in this model. However, two noteworthy issues arise in the model application: firstly, the coupled term introduced in the pressure-coupling scheme, $\left( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{h}} \right)_{\bot}$, is often simplified by $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{h}}$, which is equivalent to neglecting the parallel inertial term of EPs; secondly, besides the $\delta f $ contribution caused by changing in the EP distribution function, the magnetic field perturbation (the $\delta \mathbf{B} $ contribution) generated during development of the instabilities should also be considered, but it is often ignored in existing hybrid simulations. In this paper, we derive the analytical formulations under these two coupling schemes and then numerically study the representative case of the linear stability of the m/n=1/1 internal kink mode (IKM) [Fu et. al., 2006] by using the CLT-K code. It is found that the approximated models can still yield reasonable results when EPs are isotopically distributed. But it fails completely in cases with anisotropic EP distributions. In addition, we further investigate the influence of EP's orbit width on the stability of IKM and verify the equivalence between pressure-coupling scheme and the current-coupling scheme.</description>

      <title>Uniform Field in Microwave Cavities Through the Use of Effective Magnetic Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18474v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wire media (WM) resonators have emerged as promising realization for plasma haloscopes -- devices designed to detect axions, a potential component of dark matter. Key factors influencing the detection probability include cavity volume, resonance quality factor, and form factor. While the form factor has been explored for resonant frequency tuning, its optimization for axion detection remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel approach to significantly enhance the form factor of WM plasma haloscopes. By shifting the metal walls of the resonator by a quarter wavelength, we effectively convert an electric wall boundary condition into a magnetic wall one, allowing for an almost uniform mode. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations confirm that this modification improves the electric field profile and boosts the form factor. We validate these findings through experimental results from two prototype resonators: one with a standard geometry and another with a quarter-wave air gap between the WM and the walls. Additionally, our method provides a simple way to control the field profile within WM cavities, which can be explored for further applications.</description>

      <title>A study of particle acceleration, heating, power deposition, and the damping length of kinetic Alfv\'en waves in non-Maxwellian coronal plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The heating of the solar corona and solar wind, through suprathermal particles and kinetic Alfv\'en waves within the 0 - 10 $R_{\rm Sun}$ range, has been a subject of great interest for many decades. This study investigates the acceleration and heating of charged particles and the role of KAWs in the solar corona. We investigate how KAWs transport energy and accelerate/heat the charged particles, focusing on the behavior of perturbed EM fields, Poynting flux vectors, net power transfer, resonant particle speed, group speed, and the damping length of KAWs. The study examines how these elements are influenced by suprathermal particles \kappa and the electron-to-ion temperature $T_e/T_i$. We use kinetic plasma theory coupled with the Vlasov-Maxwell model to investigate the dynamics of KAWs and particles. We assume a collisionless, homogeneous, and low-beta electron-ion plasma in which Alfv\'en waves travel in the kinetic limits. The results show the perturbed EM fields are significantly influenced by $\kappa$ and $T_e/T_i$. We evaluate both the parallel and perpendicular Poynting fluxes and find that the parallel Poynting flux dissipates gradually for lower \kappa values. The perpendicular flux dissipates quickly over shorter distances. Power deposition in solar flux tubes is significantly influenced by \kappa and Te/Ti. We find that particles can heat the solar corona over long distances in the parallel direction and short distances in the perpendicular direction. The group velocity of KAWs increases for lower \kappa values, and the damping length is enhanced under lower \kappa, suggesting longer energy transport distances. These findings offer a comprehensive understanding of particle-wave interactions in the solar corona and wind, with potential applications for missions such as the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), and can also apply to other environments.</description>
