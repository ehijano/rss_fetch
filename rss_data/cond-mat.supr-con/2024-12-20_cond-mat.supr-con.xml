      <title>Coexistence of $p$-wave Magnetism and Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetry requirements for realizing unconventional compensated magnets with spin-polarized bands such as altermagnets have recently been uncovered. The most recent addition to this family of magnets is parity-odd or $p$-wave magnets. We demonstrate that $p$-wave magnets are perfectly compatible with superconductivity due to the spin polarization of their electron bands and that they induce unexpected spin transport phenomena. We first show that $p$-wave magnetism can coexist with conventional superconductivity regardless of the magnitude of the spin splitting. We then predict that $p$-wave magnets induce a charge-to-spin conversion, which can be strongly enhanced by the presence of superconductivity providing a way to probe the coexistence in experiments. Our results open a new avenue for material combinations with a synergetic relation between spintronics and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Induced Enhancement of Superfluid Density in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with and without Charge Density Wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaining a deeper understanding of the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), particularly within the (4H/2H)-NbX$_{2}$ (X=Se,S) family, remains an open and intriguing challenge. A systematic microscopic study across various compounds in this family is therefore required to unravel this complex interplay. Here, we report on muon spin rotation and magnetotransport experiments investigating the effects of hydrostatic pressure on the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$), the temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth ($\lambda_\mathrm{eff}$), and the charge density wave order (CDW) in two layered chalcogenide superconductors: 4H-NbSe$_{2}$, which exhibits CDW order, and 2H-NbS$_{2}$, which lacks such order. Our observations reveal a substantial 75$\%$ enhancement of the superfluid density ($n_{s}/m^{*}$) in 4H-NbSe$_{2}$ upon maximum applied pressure of 2 GPa, surpassing that of 2H-NbSe$_{2}$. Despite the absence of CDW order, a sizeable 20$\%$ growth in superfluid density is also observed for 2H-NbS$_{2}$ under an applied pressure of 1.8 GPa. Notably, the evaluated superconducting gaps in all these TMDs remain largely unaffected by changes in applied pressure, irrespective of pressure-induced partial suppression of CDW order in (4H/2H)-NbSe$_{2}$ or its general absence in 2H-NbS$_{2}$. These results underscore the complex nature of pressure-induced behaviors in these TMDs, challenging a simplistic view of competition solely between CDW order and superconductivity. Remarkably, the relationship between $n_{s}/m^{*}$ and $T_{\rm c}$ exhibits an unconventional correlation, indicating a noteworthy similarity with the behavior observed in cuprate, kagome, and iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Odd-frequency pairing due to Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states are predicted to appear in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems, but their identification is still a challenging task. Here we consider superconducting junctions with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and explore the signatures of Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states in the emergent superconducting correlations when the systems are subjected to an external Zeeman field. We first show that robust zero-energy Andreev bound states naturally appear due to confinement and helicity when the normal sector of the junction becomes helical. These Andreev states can evolve into Majorana states, developing alike oscillations around zero energy as a function of Zeeman field. Unlike Majorana states located at both ends, helical Andreev states are located at the interface. We then demonstrate that the emergent superconducting correlations are locally composed of even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity and odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pair amplitudes, which coexist due to the interplay of spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman field, and spatial translation invariance breaking. In the helical regime, trivial Andreev states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, which decays in the superconductor and has a homogeneous long-range profile in the normal region. At zero frequency, however, odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing vanishes in the helical regime. In the topological phase, Majorana states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, producing a long-range homogeneous leakage into the normal region. Interestingly, we discover that when Majorana states are truly zero-energy modes, odd-frequency pairing develops a divergent low-frequency profile, which we interpret as the unambiguous self-conjugated Majorana signature. Our results help understand Majorana and trivial Andreev states from a superconducting correlations perspective in Majorana devices.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Superconductivity in Correlated, Multiband, and Topological Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we theoretically examine the pairing mechanisms and the identification of the pairing symmetry of unconventional superconductors whose normal states are correlated, multiband, or topological. In the first part, we investigate whether fluctuating intra-unit-cell loop currents can drive unconventional superconductivity. For general systems, we find that even-parity loop currents are not an effective pairing glue, whereas odd-parity loop currents, such as those proposed to explain the cuprates, are strong pair-breakers, suppressing rather than enhancing Cooper pairing. By employing the same methodology, we also analyze quantum-critical pairing due to other intra-unit-cell orders. For cuprates, we review the evidence for intra-unit-cell loop currents in the pseudogap, we classify the possible loop-current and particle-hole orders in the Emery model, and we analyze the pairing due to the various possible loop-current orders. In the second part, we present a novel electronic pairing mechanism that is based on electric monopole-dipole interactions. We show that these interactions become enhanced in quasi-2D systems with strong parity-mixing and spin-orbit coupling, such as doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$ or SnTe, and that they induce unconventional odd-parity superconductivity. In addition, we establish that the proposed pairing glue is measurable in the out-of-plane optical conductivity. In the last part, we reexamine the pairing symmetry of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ in light of recent experiments. By theoretically analyzing recent $T_c$ and elastocaloric measurements under uniaxial stress, we demonstrate that the pairing state includes $s$, $d_{x^2-y^2}$, or body-centered $d_{xz} + i d_{yz}$ admixtures and that a bulk two-component superconductivity requires a great deal of fine-tuning to be consistent with ultrasound experiments.</description>

      <title>Microscopic study of supercurrent diode effect in chiral nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocity of supercurrents may exist when both spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries are broken, leading to the supercurrent diode effect (SDE). The spatial inversion symmetry may be broken by chiral structures in nanotubes where the SDE is expected when a magnetic flux passes through the tube. While such an effect has been predicted based on a phenomenological theory, a microscopic and quantitative study with a concrete lattice model is missing. Here, we investigate the SDE in chiral nanotubes made of carbon and those made of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) with tight-binding models. We obtain the SDE efficiency as a function of the nanotube radius, the chiral angle, the magnetic flux, the temperature, the chemical potential, etc., and find that sign flipping happens in various parameter dependencies. In TMD nanotubes, the SDEs with and without the spin-orbit coupling are compared. We also simulate CNTs made from square lattice materials for comparison and discuss the effects of strains. Besides qualitative consistency with previous phenomenological theory, new features are found and the microscopic origins are clarified.</description>

      <title>Resistance of high-temperature superconducting tapes triggered by alternating magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic resistance occurs in a superconducting tape carrying a dc transport current while being exposed to an alternating magnetic field. This effect is caused by flux movements interacting with the transport current. The dynamic resistance is already applied in many superconducting applications, for example superconducting flux pumps or persistent current switches. The resistance is highly dependent on the magnetic field and the frequency the superconductor is subjected to and its properties. When the dynamic resistance exceeds a certain value and thus enters the magnitude of the resistances of the normal conducting layers of the HTS tape, these normal conducting layers play a significant role in the total resistance of the tape. In this paper, modifications were made to the silver stabilizer and the total resistance of the HTS tape has been investigated. The experimental results with frequencies up to 1000 Hz and magnetic field up to 277 mT show significant increases in resistance. Additionally, a multilayer model based on H-formulation is presented to calculate the losses of the superconductor. The results also show significant heating due to the losses and therefore a temperature rise, which effects the measured total resistance. These results can be further used for applications where high switchable resistances are required with zero dc resistance when the magnet is turned off.</description>

      <title>Mathematical analysis of a flux-jump model in superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed mathematically a model describing flux jumps in superconductivity in a 1D configuration. Three effects occur from fastest to slowest: Joule heating, magnetic relaxation and temperature diffusion. Adimensionalising the equations showed that magnetic field fronts penetrate the material as inhomogeneous Burgers fronts. An additional global term pushes the magnetic field and is responsible for flux jumps. We considered a medium temperature for which the heat capacity of a sample can be taken as a constant and a low temperature where heat capacity depends on temperature causing a nonlinear temperature evolution. As expected, we found that flux jumps occur mostly at low temperature. To understand flux trapping, we examined external magnetic field pulses of different amplitudes and duration. We found that flux trapping is maximal for medium amplitudes and low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Impurity-temperature phase diagram with phase crystals and competing time-reversal symmetry breaking states in nodal $d$-wave superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase crystals are a class of non-uniform superconducting ground states characterized by spontaneous phase gradients of the superconducting order parameter. These phase gradients non-locally drive periodic currents and magnetic fields, thus breaking both time-reversal symmetry and continuous translational symmetry. The phase crystal instability is generally triggered by negative and inhomogeneous superfluid stiffness. Several scenarios have been identified that can realize phase crystals, especially flat bands at specific edges of unconventional nodal superconductors. Motivated by omnipresent disorder in all materials, we employ the ${t}$-matrix approach within the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity to study the emergence of phase crystals at edges of a nodal $d$-wave superconductor. We quantify the full phase diagram as a function of the impurity scattering energy and the temperature, with full self-consistency in the impurity self energies, the superconducting order parameter, and the vector potential. We find that the phase crystal survives even up to $\sim 40-50\%$ of the superconducting critical impurity strength in both the Born and unitary scattering limits. Finally, we show how mesoscopic finite-size effects induce a competition with a state still breaking time-reversal symmetry but with translationally invariant edge currents.</description>

      <title>Ghost Josephson plasmon in bilayer superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental measurement of collective charge fluctuations in metals and superconductors is a preferential tool to benchmark fundamental interactions in solids. Recent experiments in multicomponent systems, from superconducting layered cuprates to multiband metals, highlighted striking effects due to the interplay between different degrees of freedom. In this paper we provide a physical explanation for the existence of a "ghost" Josephson plasmon in bilayer superconductors, layered systems with two layers per unit cells that interact with two different Josephson couplings. We show that one of the two plasmons that emerge after the breaking of the translational symmetry along the out-of-plane direction is connected to counterflowing current fluctuations polarized perpendicularly to the planes. This effect makes it a staggered mode that is virtually transverse at small out-of-plane momenta qc, explaining why it is hidden in the density response at small qc. Our work offers an additional perspective on the understanding of collective excitations in systems with multiple intertwined degrees of freedom.</description>

Abstract: A new axion-haloscope is setup at the Johannes Gutenberg university of Mainz, named the Supax (a SUPerconducting AXion search) experiment. This setup is used to characterize the behaviour of a NbN coated superconducting cavity in a 2.5T strong magnetic field, at a resonance frequency of 8.4GHz. We observe an increasing surface resistance with increasing magnetic field, leading to a decreasing quality factor. The behaviour is similar to that of previously studied cavities using Nb3Tn.</description>

      <title>Possible High temperature Superconductivity above 200K mediated by Bose Einstein Condensation of exciton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton mediated superconductor is a fascinating quantum phase of matter that occurs when excitons become the dominant excitation in materials, which is also very promising for high temperature superconductor. However, there is no experimental report of exciton mediated superconductivity. Herein, we realize exciton mediated superconductivity from exciton insulator, where the onset transition temperature can reach larger than 200 K. More profoundly, Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of exciton can facilitate the formation of exciton insulator and a transition happened from extremely high resistivity of 107 {\Omega} at 153.5 K to 100 {\Omega} at 125 K, indicating a superconducting transition. The resistance of exciton mediated superconductivity can not be absolutely reach zero possibly as a result of drag effect between electrons/holes and excitons. We reveal one rule for exciton mediated superconductivity is that the resistivity is an inverse linear function of the current through the BEC superfluid state, which should be ascribed to the Andreev-Bashkin effect, which reflects the coupling between the BEC state of exciton and Cooper pairs mediated by excitons. Furthermore, a record transition temperature above 200 K has been found for one superconducting sample, which shows the Josephson oscillation dominated by a pendulum-like equation caused by the quantum coupling between superconductor and BEC superfluid of exciton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extension of Landau's theory of phase transitions by incorporating the topology of the order parameter. When the order parameter comprises several components arising from multiplicity in the same irreducible representation of symmetry, it can possess a nontrivial topology and acquire a Berry phase under the variation of thermodynamic parameters. To illustrate this idea, we investigate the superconducting phase transition of an electronic system with tetragonal symmetry and an attractive interaction involving two partial waves, both transforming in the trivial representation. By analyzing the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation in the adiabatic limit, we show that the order parameter acquires a Berry phase after a cyclic evolution of parameters. We study two concrete models -- one preserving time-reversal symmetry and one breaking it -- and demonstrate that the nontrivial topology of the order parameter originates from thermodynamic analogs of gapless Dirac and Weyl points in the phase diagram. Finally, we identify an experimental signature of the topological Berry phase in a Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>Anomalous currents and spontaneous vortices in spin-orbit coupled superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism which can generate supercurrents in spin-orbit coupled superconductors with charged magnetic inclusions. The basic idea is that through spin-orbit interaction, the in-plane electric field near the edge of each inclusion appears to the electrons as an effective spin-dependent gauge field; if Cooper pairs can be partially spin polarized, then each pair experiences a nonzero \textit{net} transverse pseudo-gauge field. We explore the phenomenology of our mechanism within a Ginzburg-Landau theory, with parameters determined from a microscopic model. Depending on parameters, our mechanism can either enhance or reduce the total magnetization upon superconducting condensation. Given an appropriate distribution of inclusions, we show how our mechanism can generate superconducting vortices without any applied orbital magnetic field. Surprisingly, the vortices form \textit{nonlocally}; they are situated in between the inclusions. Our mechanism can produce similar qualitative behavior to the "magnetic memory effect" observed in 4Hb-TaS$_2$. However, the magnitude of the effect in that material seems larger than our model can naturally explain.</description>

Abstract: Topological zero modes in topological insulators or superconductors are exponentially localized at the phase transition between a topologically trivial and nontrivial phase. These modes are solutions of a Jackiw-Rebbi equation modified with an additional term which is quadratic in the momentum. Moreover, localized fermionic modes can also be induced by harmonic potentials in superfluids and superconductors or in atomic nuclei. Here, by using inverse methods, we consider in the same framework exponentially-localized zero modes, as well as gaussian modes induced by harmonic potentials (with superexponential decay) and polynomially decaying modes (with subexponential decay), and derive the explicit and analytical form of the modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation (and of the Schr\"odinger equation) which admits these modes as solutions. We find that the asymptotic behavior of the mass term is crucial in determining the decay properties of the modes. Furthermore, these considerations naturally extend to the nonhermitian regime. These findings allow us to classify and understand topological and nontopological boundary modes in topological insulators and superconductors.</description>

      <title>Theory of intervalley-coherent AFM order and topological superconductivity in tWSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent observation of superconductivity in the vicinity of insulating or Fermi surface reconstructed metallic states has established twisted bilayers of WSe$_2$ as an exciting platform to study the interplay of strong electron-electron interactions, broken symmetries and topology. In this work, we study the emergence of electronic ordering in twisted WSe$_2$ driven by gate-screened Coulomb interactions. Our first-principles treatment begins by constructing moir\'e Wannier orbitals that faithfully capture the bandstructure and topology of the system and project the gate-screened Coulomb interaction onto them. Using unbiased functional renormalization group calculations, we find an interplay between intervalley-coherent antiferromagnetic order and chiral, mixed-parity $d/p$-wave superconductivity for carrier concentrations near the displacement field-tunable van-Hove singularity. Our microscopic approach establishes incommensurate intervalley-coherent antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations as the dominant electronic mechanism driving the formation of superconductivity in $\theta = 5.08^{\circ}$ twisted WSe$_2$ and demonstrates that nesting properties of the Fermi surface sheets near the higher-order van-Hove point cause an asymmetric density dependence of the spin ordering as the density is varied across the van-Hove line, in good agreement with experimental observations. We show how the region of superconducting and magnetic order evolves within the two-dimensional phase space of displacement field and electronic density as twist angle is varied between $4^{\circ} \dots 5^{\circ}$.</description>

      <title>Dynamic charge order from strong correlations in the cuprates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge order has been a central focus in the study of cuprate high-temperature superconductors due to its intriguing yet not fully understood connection to superconductivity. Recent advances in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) in the soft x-ray regime have enabled the first momentum-resolved studies of dynamic charge order correlations in the cuprates. This progress has opened a window for a more nuanced investigation into the mechanisms behind the formation of charge order (CO) correlations. This review provides an overview of RIXS-based measurements of dynamic CO correlations in various cuprate materials. It specifically focuses on electron-doped cuprates and Bi-based hole-doped cuprates, where the CO-related RIXS signals may reveal signatures of the effective Coulomb interactions. This aims to explore a connection between two central phenomena in the cuprates: strong Coulomb correlations and CO-forming tendencies. Finally, we discuss current open questions and potential directions for future RIXS studies as the technique continues to improve and mature, along with other probes of dynamic correlations that would provide a more comprehensive picture.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of fractionalized Shiba states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A magnetic impurity in a BCS superconductor induces the formation of a Shiba state and drives a local quantum phase transition. We generalize this concept to a one-dimensional superconductor with fractionalized excitations, where the dominant instability is superconducting. In this framework, conduction electrons fractionalize into gapless charge and gapped spin excitations. We show that magnetic impurity interacts exclusively with the spin degrees of freedom and induces a quantum phase transition. Furthermore, charge excitations influence dynamical observables, giving rise to the phenomenon we term the fractionalized Shiba state. At zero temperature, the tunneling spectrum exhibits universal power-law scaling with an exponent of $-1/2$ at half filling, stemming from the gapless charge modes that form a standard Luttinger liquid. Extending this analysis to finite temperatures reveals that the spectral features retain universal behavior at the critical point.</description>

      <title>Identifying Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces via thermoelectric response in a $d$-wave superconductor heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric response of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs) generated in a two dimensional unconventional $d$-wave superconductor subjected to an external in-plane Zeeman field. These BFSs exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism and considering normal-$d$-wave superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and examine the validation of Widemann-Franz law in the presence of both voltage and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of $d$-wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the normal-superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in Seebeck coefficient ($\sim 200\,\mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($\sim 3.5$) due to the generation of the BFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for device applications. Finally, we strengthen our continuum model results by computing the thermoelectric coefficients based on a lattice-regularized version of our continuum model.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates: strain to mimic the effects pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Signatures of superconductivity under pressure have recently been reported in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates with general chemical formula La$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ ($n=$ number of perovskite layers along the $c$-axis). The emergence of superconductivity is always concomitant with a structural transition in which the octahedral tilts are suppressed causing an increase in the out-of-plane $d_{z^2}$ orbital overlap. Here, using first-principles calculations, we explore biaxial strain (both compressive and tensile) as a means to mimic the electronic structure characteristics of RP nickelates (up to $n=5$) under hydrostatic pressure. Our findings highlight that strain allows to decouple the structural and electronic structure effects obtained under hydrostatic pressure, with tensile strain reproducing the known electronic structure characteristics of the pressurized bilayer and trilayer compounds. Overall, strain represents a promising way to tune the electronic structure of RP nickelates and could be an alternative route to achieve superconductivity in this family of materials.</description>

      <title>Back-action supercurrent diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Back-action refers to a response that retro-acts on a system to tailor its properties with respect to an external stimulus. This effect is at the heart of many electronic devices such as amplifiers, oscillators, and sensors. Here, we demonstrate that back-action can be exploited to achieve non-reciprocal transport in superconducting circuits. In our devices, dissipationless current flows in one direction whereas dissipative transport occurs in the opposite direction. Supercurrent diodes presented so far rely on magnetic elements or vortices to mediate charge transport or external magnetic fields to break time-reversal symmetry. Back-action solely turns a conventional reciprocal superconducting weak link with no asymmetry between the current bias directions into a rectifier, where the critical current amplitude depends on the bias sign. The self-interaction of the supercurrent stems from the gate tunability of the critical current in metallic and semiconducting systems, which promotes nearly ideal magnetic field-free rectification with selectable polarity.</description>

      <title>Topological Classification of One-Dimensional Chiral Symmetric Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the topological classification of one-dimensional chiral symmetric interfaces embedded into a two-dimensional substrate. A proof of the validity of a topological classification based on the Green's function by explicit evaluation of the topological invariant is presented. Further, we show that due to entanglement between the in-gap modes and the substrate, the full physics of the substrate that is contained in the Green's function is required. This is done by considering a classification scheme derived from the reduced ground state projector, for which we show that an uncritical handling produces erroneous changes in the topological index due to entanglement driven gap closures. We illustrate our results by applying them to a tight-binding model of a spiral magnetic interface in a s-wave superconductor.</description>

      <title>Topological columnar nano-SQUID based on a 3D topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding an ideal platform to generate non-Abelian Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) is a crucial first step for topological quantum computing. A 3D topological insulator (TI) is promising for this purpose due to the spin-momentum-locked surface state. Here we propose a novel yet simple TI platform that gives rise to a robust topological phase and can realize a well-defined fermion parity necessary for quantum computing. It consists of a bulk-insulating rectangular TI nanowire laterally sandwiched by two superconductors. In this structure, the top and bottom surfaces individually work as SNS line junctions, forming a nanometer-scale columnar SQUID in which the nanowire cross-section defines the threading flux $\Phi$ in axial magnetic fields. We demonstrate that a TI device of this structure indeed presents SQUID-type oscillations of the critical current $I_c$ as a function of $\Phi$ with period $\Phi_{0}^s=\frac{h}{2e}$. It can be tuned by a back gate to attain a full $I_c$ suppression and then a nearly-full recovery as a function of $\Phi$, an indication that the superconductivity is completely surface-dominated. Our theory shows that, when the two junctions are asymmetric, a robust topological phase hosting MZMs occurs periodically for $(n-\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s &lt; \Phi &lt; (n+\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s$ with odd-integer $n$.</description>
