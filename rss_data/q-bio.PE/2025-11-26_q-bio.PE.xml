      <title>Population size in stochastic multi-patch ecological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We look at the interaction of dispersal and environmental stochasticity in $n$-patch models. We are able to prove persistence and extinction results even in the setting when the dispersal rates are stochastic. As applications we look at Beverton-Holt and Hassell functional responses. We find explicit approximations for the total population size at stationarity when we look at slow and fast dispersal. In particular, we show that if dispersal is small then in the Beverton-Holt setting, if the carrying capacity is random, then environmental fluctuations are always detrimental and decrease the total population size. Instead, in the Hassell setting, if the inverse of the carrying capacity is made random, then environmental fluctuations always increase the population size. Fast dispersal can save populations from extinction and therefore increase the total population size. We also analyze a different type of environmental fluctuation which comes from switching environmental states according to a Markov chain and find explicit approximations when the switching is either fast or slow - in examples we are able to show that slow switching leads to a higher population size than fast switching.
  Using and modifying some approximation results due to Cuello, we find expressions for the total population size in the $n=2$ patch setting when the growth rates, carrying capacities, and dispersal rates are influenced by random fluctuations. We find that there is a complicated interaction between the various terms and that the covariances between the various random parameters (growth rate, carrying capacity, dispersal rate) play a key role in whether we get an increase or a decrease in the total population size. Environmental fluctuations turn to sometimes be beneficial -- this show that not only dispersal, but also environmental stochasticity can lead to an increase in population size.</description>

      <title>Hormonal Regulation of Breast Cancer Incidence Dynamics: A Mathematical Analysis Explaining the Clemmesen's Hook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clemmesen's hook refers to a commonly observed slowdown and rebound in breast cancer incidence around the age at menopause. It suggests a shift in the underlying carcinogenic dynamics, but the mechanistic basis remains poorly understood. Building on our previously developed Extended Multistage Clonal Expansion Tumor (MSCE-T) model, we perform a theoretical analysis to determine the conditions under which Clemmesen's hook would occur. Our results show that Clemmesen's hook can be quantitatively explained by time-specific changes in the proliferative and apoptotic balance of early-stage mutated cell populations, corresponding to the decline in progesterone levels and progesterone-driven proliferation due to reduced menstrual cycles preceding menopause, and changing dominant carcinogenic impact from alternative growth pathways post-menopause (e.g., adipose-derived growth signals). In contrast, variation in last-stage clonal dynamics cannot effectively reproduce the observed non-monotonic incidence pattern. Analytical results further demonstrate that midlife incidence dynamics corresponding to the hook are governed primarily by intrinsic proliferative processes rather than detection effects. Overall, this study provides a mechanistic and mathematical explanation for Clemmesen's hook and establishes a quantitative framework linking hormonal transitions during menopause to age-specific breast cancer incidence curve.</description>

      <title>Expectation-enforcing strategies for repeated games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Originating in evolutionary game theory, the class of "zero-determinant" strategies enables a player to unilaterally enforce linear payoff relationships in simple repeated games. An upshot of this kind of payoff constraint is that it can shape the incentives for the opponent in a predetermined way. An example is when a player ensures that the agents get equal payoffs. While extensively studied in infinite-horizon games, extensions to discounted games, nonlinear payoff relationships, richer strategic environments, and behaviors with long memory remain incompletely understood. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a player to enforce arbitrary payoff relationships (linear or nonlinear), in expectation, in discounted games. These conditions characterize precisely which payoff relationships are enforceable using strategies of arbitrary complexity. Our main result establishes that any such enforceable relationship can actually be implemented using a simple two-point reactive learning strategy, which conditions on the opponent's most recent action and the player's own previous mixed action, using information from only one round into the past. For additive payoff constraints, we show that enforcement is possible using even simpler (reactive) strategies that depend solely on the opponent's last move. In other words, this tractable class is universal within expectation-enforcing strategies. As examples, we apply these results to characterize extortionate, generous, equalizer, and fair strategies in the iterated prisoner's dilemma, asymmetric donation game, nonlinear donation game, and the hawk-dove game, identifying precisely when each class of strategy is enforceable and with what minimum discount factor.</description>

      <title>Complex multiannual cycles of Mycoplasma pneumoniae: persistence and the role of stochasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11402v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The epidemiological dynamics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae is characterized by poorly understood complex multiannual cycles. The origins of these cycles have long been debated, and multiple explanations of varying complexity have been suggested. Using Bayesian methods, we fit a dynamical model to half a century of M. pneumoniae surveillance data from Denmark (1958-1995, 2010-2025) and uncover a parsimonious explanation for the persistent cycles, based on the theory of quasicycles. The period of the multiannual cycle (approx. 5 years in Denmark) is explained by susceptible replenishment due, primarily, to loss of immunity. While an excellent fit to shorter time series (a few decades), the deterministic model eventually settles into an annual cycle, unable to reproduce the persistent cycles. We find that environmental stochasticity (e.g., varying contact rates) stabilizes the multiannual cycles and so does demographic noise, at least in smaller or incompletely mixing populations. The temporary disappearance of cycles during 1979-1985 is explained as a consequence of stochastic mode-hopping. The circulation of M. pneumoniae was recently disrupted by COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), providing a natural experiment on the effects of large perturbations. Consequently, the effects of NPIs are included in the model and medium-term predictions are explored. Our findings highlight the intrinsic sensitivity of M. pneumoniae dynamics to perturbations and interventions, underscoring the limitations for long-term prediction. More generally, our findings provide further evidence for the role of stochasticity as a driver of complex cycles across endemic and recurring pathogens.</description>

      <title>Vendi Information Gain for Active Learning and its Application to Ecology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10390v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While monitoring biodiversity through camera traps has become an important endeavor for ecological research, identifying species in the captured image data remains a major bottleneck due to limited labeling resources. Active learning -- a machine learning paradigm that selects the most informative data to label and train a predictive model -- offers a promising solution, but typically focuses on uncertainty in the individual predictions without considering uncertainty across the entire dataset. We introduce a new active learning policy, Vendi information gain (VIG), that selects images based on their impact on dataset-wide prediction uncertainty, capturing both informativeness and diversity. We applied VIG to the Snapshot Serengeti dataset and compared it against common active learning methods. VIG needs only 3% of the available data to reach 75% accuracy, a level that baselines require more than 10% of the data to achieve. With 10% of the data, VIG attains 88% predictive accuracy, 12% higher than the best of the baselines. This improvement in performance is consistent across metrics and batch sizes, and we show that VIG also collects more diverse data in the feature space. VIG has broad applicability beyond ecology, and our results highlight its value for biodiversity monitoring in data-limited environments.</description>
