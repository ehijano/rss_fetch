      <title>Secure Beamforming for Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA) Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous aperture array (CAPA) is considered a promising technology for 6G networks, offering the potential to fully exploit spatial DoFs and achieve the theoretical limits of channel capacity. This paper investigates the performance gain of a CAPA-based downlink secure transmission system, where multiple legitimate user terminals (LUTs) coexist with multiple eavesdroppers (Eves). The system's secrecy performance is evaluated using a weighted secrecy sum-rate (WSSR) under a power constraint. We then propose two solutions for the secure current pattern design. The first solution is a block coordinate descent (BCD) optimization method based on fractional programming, which introduces a continuous-function inversion theory corresponding to matrix inversion in the discrete domain. This approach derives a closed-form expression for the optimal source current pattern. Based on this, it can be found that the optimal current pattern is essentially a linear combination of the channel spatial responses, thus eliminating the need for complex integration operations during the algorithm's optimization process. The second solution is a heuristic algorithm based on Zero-Forcing (ZF), which constructs a zero-leakage current pattern using the channel correlation matrix. It further employs a water-filling approach to design an optimal power allocation scheme that maximizes the WSSR. In high SNR regions, this solution gradually approaches the first solution, ensuring zero leakage while offering lower computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) CAPA-based systems achieve better WSSR compared to discrete multiple-input multiple-output systems. 2) The proposed methods, whether optimization-based or heuristic, provide significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art Fourier-based discretization methods, while considerably reducing computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Infinite Factorial Linear Dynamical Systems for Transient Signal Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately detecting the transient signal of interest from the background signal is one of the fundamental tasks in signal processing. The most recent approaches assume the existence of a single background source and represent the background signal using a linear dynamical system (LDS). This assumption might fail to capture the complexities of modern electromagnetic environments with multiple sources. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a method for detecting the transient signal in a background composed of an unknown number of emitters. The proposed method consists of two main tasks. First, a Bayesian nonparametric model called the infinite factorial linear dynamical system (IFLDS) is developed. The developed model is based on the sticky Indian buffet process and enables the representation and parameter learning of the unbounded number of background sources. This study also designs a parameter learning method for the IFLDS using slice sampling and particle Gibbs with ancestor sampling. Second, the finite moving average (FMA) stopping time is introduced to minimize the worst-case probability of missed detection, and the statistical performance of the stopping time is investigated. To facilitate the computation of the FMA stopping time, this study derives the factorial Kalman forward filtering (FKFF) method and designs a dependence structure for the underlying model, allowing the stopping time to be defined by a recursive function. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the validity of the theoretical results. The experimental results of the pulse signal detection under the condition of communication interference confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Joint Detection and Angle Estimation for Multiple Jammers in Beamspace Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the joint detection and angle estimation problem for beamspace multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with multiple random jamming targets. An iterative low-complexity generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is proposed by transforming the composite multiple hypothesis test on the projected vector into a series of binary hypothesis tests based on the spatial covariance matrix. In each iteration, the detector implicitly inhibits the mainlobe effects of the previously detected jammers by utilizing the estimated angles and average jamming-to-signal ratios. This enables the detection of a new potential jammer and the identification of its corresponding spatial covariance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing benchmarks by suppressing sidelobes of the detected jammers and interference from irrelevant angles, especially in medium-to-high jamming-to-noise ratio scenarios.</description>

      <title>Holographic Metasurfaces Enabling Wave Computing for 6G: Status Overview, Challenges, and Future Research Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in wave computing using metasurfaces are poised to transform wireless communications by enabling high-speed, energy-efficient, and highly parallelized signal processing. These capabilities are essential to meet the ultra-high data rates of up to 1 terabit per second and minimal latency as low as 1 millisecond required by next-generation wireless networks. Diverging from traditional digital processing, wave computing adopts continuous analog signals to foster innovative functions such as over-the-air computation, integrated sensing and communications, computational electromagnetic imaging, and physical-layer security. This article explores the potential of reconfigurable multi-functional metasurfaces in wave computing, emphasizing their pivotal role in facilitating seamless communications and addressing the escalating computational demands for sixth generation (6G) networks. As artificial intelligence has become one of the most prominent and rapidly advancing fields of research over the last decade, we also introduce a wave-domain-based machine learning approach aimed at achieving power-efficient, fast training and computation. Future research directions are discussed, underscoring how metasurface-based systems can merge computation with communication to innovate components of 6G networks, thus creating smarter, faster, and more adaptable wireless infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Hyperdimensional Computing for ADHD Classification using EEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the recent interest in applying the Hyperdimensional Computing paradigm in medical context to power up the performance of general machine learning applied to biomedical data, this study represents the first attempt at employing such techniques to solve the problem of classification of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder using electroencephalogram signals. Making use of a spatio-temporal encoder, and leveraging the properties of HDC, the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 88.9%, outperforming traditional Deep Neural Networks benchmark models. The core of this research is not only to enhance the classification accuracy of the model but also to explore its efficiency in terms of the required training data: a critical finding of the study is the identification of the minimum number of patients needed in the training set to achieve a sufficient level of accuracy. To this end, the accuracy of our model trained with only $7$ of the $79$ patients is comparable to the one from benchmarks trained on the full dataset. This finding underscores the model's efficiency and its potential for quick and precise ADHD diagnosis in medical settings where large datasets are typically unattainable.</description>

      <title>RadioTransformer: Accurate Radio Map Construction and Coverage Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio map, or pathloss map prediction, is a crucial method for wireless network modeling and management. By leveraging deep learning to construct pathloss patterns from geographical maps, an accurate digital replica of the transmission environment could be established with less computational overhead and lower prediction error compared to traditional model-driven techniques. While existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods predominantly rely on convolutional architectures, this paper introduces a hybrid transformer-convolution model, termed RadioTransformer, to enhance the accuracy of radio map prediction. The proposed model features a multi-scale transformer-based encoder for efficient feature extraction and a convolution-based decoder for precise pixel-level image reconstruction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves prediction accuracy, and over a 30% reduction in root mean square error (RMSE) is achieved compared to typical SOTA approaches.</description>

      <title>Joint Communications and Sensing for 6G Satellite Networks: Use Cases and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite Networks (SN) have traditionally been instrumental in providing two key services: communications and sensing. Communications satellites enable global connectivity, while sensing satellites facilitate applications such as Earth observation, navigation, and disaster management. However, the emergence of novel use cases and the exponential growth in service demands make the independent evolution of communication and sensing payloads increasingly impractical. Addressing this challenge requires innovative approaches to optimize satellite resources. Joint Communications and Sensing (JCAS) technology represents a transformative paradigm for SN. By integrating communication and sensing functionalities into unified hardware platforms, JCAS enhances spectral efficiency, reduces operational costs, and minimizes hardware redundancies. This paper explores the potential of JCAS in advancing the next-generation space era, highlighting its role in emerging applications. Furthermore, it identifies critical challenges, such as waveform design, Doppler effect mitigation, and multi-target detection, that remain open for future research. Through these discussions, we aim to stimulate further research into the transformative potential of JCAS in addressing the demands of 6G and beyond SN.</description>

      <title>Timing Properties of the Starlink Ku-Band Downlink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop signal capture and analysis techniques for precisely extracting and characterizing the frame timing of the Starlink constellation's Ku-band downlink transmissions. The aim of this work is to determine whether Starlink frame timing has sufficient short-term stability to support pseudorange-based opportunistic positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT). A second goal is to determine whether frame timing is disciplined to a common time scale such as GPS time. Our analysis reveals several timing characteristics not previously known that carry strong implications for PNT. On the favorable side, periods of ns-level jitter in frame arrival times across all satellite versions indicate that Starlink hardware is fundamentally capable of the short-term stability required to support GPS-like PNT. But there are several unfavorable characteristics that, if not addressed, will make GPS-like PNT impractical: (1) The v1.0 and v1.5 Starlink satellites exhibit once-per-second abrupt frame timing adjustments whose magnitude (as large as 100s of ns) and sign appear unpredictable. Similar discontinuities are also present in the v2.0-Mini frame timing, though smaller and irregularly spaced. (2) Episodic 15-s periods of high frame jitter routinely punctuate the nominal low-jitter frame arrival timing. (3) Starlink frame timing is disciplined to GPS time, but only loosely: to within a few ms by adjustments occurring every 15 s; otherwise exhibiting drift that can exceed 20 ppm. These unfavorable characteristics are essentially incompatible with accurate PNT. Fortunately, they appear to be a consequence of software design choices, not hardware limitations. Moreover, they could be compensated with third-party-provided corrections.</description>

      <title>Reducing Inter-user Interference: Precoding over OFDM for Enhanced MTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the physical layer (PHY) of modern cellular systems, information is transmitted as a sequence of resource blocks (RBs) across various domains with each resource block limited to a certain time and frequency duration. In the PHY of 4G/5G systems, data is transmitted in the unit of transport block (TB) across a fixed number of physical RBs based on resource allocation decisions. Using sharp band-limiting in the frequency domain can provide good separation between different resource allocations without wasting resources in guard bands. However, using sharp filters comes at the cost of elongating the overall system impulse response which can accentuate inter-symbol interference (ISI). In a multi-user setup, such as in Machine Type Communication (MTC), different users are allocated resources across time and frequency, and operate at different power levels. If strict band-limiting separation is used, high power user signals can leak in time into low power user allocations. The ISI extent, i.e., the number of neighboring symbols that contribute to the interference, depends both on the channel delay spread and the spectral concentration properties of the signaling waveforms. We hypothesize that using a precoder that effectively transforms an OFDM waveform basis into a basis comprised of prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSS) can minimize the ISI extent when strictly confined frequency allocations are used. Analytical expressions for upper bounds on ISI are derived. In addition, simulation results support our hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Listened Speech Decoding from EEG via Parallel Phoneme Sequence Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) offer numerous human-centered application possibilities, particularly affecting people with neurological disorders. Text or speech decoding from brain activities is a relevant domain that could augment the quality of life for people with impaired speech perception. We propose a novel approach to enhance listened speech decoding from electroencephalography (EEG) signals by utilizing an auxiliary phoneme predictor that simultaneously decodes textual phoneme sequences. The proposed model architecture consists of three main parts: EEG module, speech module, and phoneme predictor. The EEG module learns to properly represent EEG signals into EEG embeddings. The speech module generates speech waveforms from the EEG embeddings. The phoneme predictor outputs the decoded phoneme sequences in text modality. Our proposed approach allows users to obtain decoded listened speech from EEG signals in both modalities (speech waveforms and textual phoneme sequences) simultaneously, eliminating the need for a concatenated sequential pipeline for each modality. The proposed approach also outperforms previous methods in both modalities. The source code and speech samples are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Generalized Linear Models with 1-Bit Measurements: Asymptotics of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work establishes regularity conditions for consistency and asymptotic normality of the multiple parameter maximum likelihood estimator(MLE) from censored data, where the censoring mechanism is in the form of $1$-bit measurements. The underlying distribution of the uncensored data is assumed to belong to the exponential family, with natural parameters expressed as a linear combination of the predictors, known as generalized linear model (GLM). As part of the analysis, the Fisher information matrix is also derived for both censored and uncensored data, which helps to quantify the impact of censoring and assess the performance of the MLE. The choice of GLM allows one to consider a variety of practical examples where 1-bit estimation is of interest. In particular, it is shown how the derived results can be used to analyze two practically relevant scenarios: the Gaussian model with both unknown mean and variance, and the Poisson model with an unknown mean.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Deep Learning for Interior Tomography with Low-Dose X-ray CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: There exist several X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning strategies to reduce a radiation dose, such as (1) sparse-view CT, (2) low-dose CT, and (3) region-of-interest (ROI) CT (called interior tomography). To further reduce the dose, the sparse-view and/or low-dose CT settings can be applied together with interior tomography. Interior tomography has various advantages in terms of reducing the number of detectors and decreasing the X-ray radiation dose. However, a large patient or small field-of-view (FOV) detector can cause truncated projections, and then the reconstructed images suffer from severe cupping artifacts. In addition, although the low-dose CT can reduce the radiation exposure dose, analytic reconstruction algorithms produce image noise. Recently, many researchers have utilized image-domain deep learning (DL) approaches to remove each artifact and demonstrated impressive performances, and the theory of deep convolutional framelets supports the reason for the performance improvement. Approach: In this paper, we found that the image-domain convolutional neural network (CNN) is difficult to solve coupled artifacts, based on deep convolutional framelets. Significance: To address the coupled problem, we decouple it into two sub-problems: (i) image domain noise reduction inside truncated projection to solve low-dose CT problem and (ii) extrapolation of projection outside truncated projection to solve the ROI CT problem. The decoupled sub-problems are solved directly with a novel proposed end-to-end learning using dual-domain CNNs. Main results: We demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the conventional image-domain deep learning methods, and a projection-domain CNN shows better performance than the image-domain CNNs which are commonly used by many researchers.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Decomposed Dual-domain Deep Learning for Sparse-View CT Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: X-ray computed tomography employing sparse projection views has emerged as a contemporary technique to mitigate radiation dose. However, due to the inadequate number of projection views, an analytic reconstruction method utilizing filtered backprojection results in severe streaking artifacts. Recently, deep learning strategies employing image-domain networks have demonstrated remarkable performance in eliminating the streaking artifact caused by analytic reconstruction methods with sparse projection views. Nevertheless, it is difficult to clarify the theoretical justification for applying deep learning to sparse view CT reconstruction, and it has been understood as restoration by removing image artifacts, not reconstruction.
  Approach: By leveraging the theory of deep convolutional framelets and the hierarchical decomposition of measurement, this research reveals the constraints of conventional image- and projection-domain deep learning methodologies, subsequently, the research proposes a novel dual-domain deep learning framework utilizing hierarchical decomposed measurements. Specifically, the research elucidates how the performance of the projection-domain network can be enhanced through a low-rank property of deep convolutional framelets and a bowtie support of hierarchical decomposed measurement in the Fourier domain.
  Main Results: This study demonstrated performance improvement of the proposed framework based on the low-rank property, resulting in superior reconstruction performance compared to conventional analytic and deep learning methods.
  Significance: By providing a theoretically justified deep learning approach for sparse-view CT reconstruction, this study not only offers a superior alternative to existing methods but also opens new avenues for research in medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Is Your Autonomous Vehicle Safe? Understanding the Threat of Electromagnetic Signal Injection Attacks on Traffic Scene Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on camera-based perception systems to comprehend their driving environment and make crucial decisions, thereby ensuring vehicles to steer safely. However, a significant threat known as Electromagnetic Signal Injection Attacks (ESIA) can distort the images captured by these cameras, leading to incorrect AI decisions and potentially compromising the safety of autonomous vehicles. Despite the serious implications of ESIA, there is limited understanding of its impacts on the robustness of AI models across various and complex driving scenarios. To address this gap, our research analyzes the performance of different models under ESIA, revealing their vulnerabilities to the attacks. Moreover, due to the challenges in obtaining real-world attack data, we develop a novel ESIA simulation method and generate a simulated attack dataset for different driving scenarios. Our research provides a comprehensive simulation and evaluation framework, aiming to enhance the development of more robust AI models and secure intelligent systems, ultimately contributing to the advancement of safer and more reliable technology across various fields.</description>

      <title>LSTM Framework for Classification of Radar and Communications Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although radar and communications signal classification are usually treated separately, they share similar characteristics, and methods applied in one domain can be potentially applied in the other. We propose a simple and unified scheme for the classification of radar and communications signals using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. This proposal provides an improvement of the state of the art on radar signals where LSTM models are starting to be applied within schemes of higher complexity. To date, there is no standard public dataset for radar signals. Therefore, we propose DeepRadar2022, a radar dataset used in our systematic evaluations that is available publicly and will facilitate a standard comparison between methods.</description>

      <title>Understanding Concepts in Graph Signal Processing for Neurophysiological Signal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multivariate signals, which are measured simultaneously over time and acquired by sensor networks, are becoming increasingly common. The emerging field of graph signal processing (GSP) promises to analyse spectral characteristics of these multivariate signals, while at the same time taking the spatial structure between the time signals into account. A central idea in GSP is the graph Fourier transform, which projects a multivariate signal onto frequency-ordered graph Fourier modes, and can therefore be regarded as a spatial analog of the temporal Fourier transform. This chapter derives and discusses key concepts in GSP, with a specific focus on how the various concepts relate to one another. The experimental section focuses on the role of graph frequency in data classification, with applications to neuroimaging. To address the limited sample size of neurophysiological datasets, we introduce a minimalist simulation framework that can generate arbitrary amounts of data. Using this artificial data, we find that lower graph frequency signals are less suitable for classifying neurophysiological data as compared to higher graph frequency signals. Finally, we introduce a baseline testing framework for GSP. Employing this framework, our results suggest that GSP applications may attenuate spectral characteristics in the signals, highlighting current limitations of GSP for neuroimaging.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted Localization in OFDM Systems with Carrier Frequency Offset and Phase Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communication systems have been extensively studied for providing high-precision location services. However, most studies have overlooked the impact of carrier frequency offset (CFO) and phase noise (PN) resulting from hardware impairments on localization. This paper presents a novel, alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm to jointly estimate the CFO, PN, and user position, where, provided the user position, closed-form expressions for the CFO and PN are derived per iteration, significantly reducing the complexity and enhancing the stability of the algorithm. Another important aspect is a new RIS phase shift optimization algorithm developed to minimize the analytical lower bound of localization accuracy, hence benefiting localization. The semidefinite relaxation method and Schur complement are utilized to convexify this challenging non-convex optimization problem to a semidefinite program. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, with the localization accuracy enhanced by two orders of magnitude. The localization accuracy of the proposed algorithm is close to the analytical lower bound, with a root mean square error of lower than $\rm 10^{-2} \: m$.</description>

      <title>Batteryless BLE and Light-based IoT Sensor Nodes for Reliable Environmental Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sustainable design of Internet of Things (IoT) networks encompasses considerations related to energy efficiency and autonomy as well as considerations related to reliable communications, ensuring no energy is wasted on undelivered data. Under these considerations, this work proposes the design and implementation of energy-efficient Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Light-based IoT (LIoT) batteryless IoT sensor nodes powered by an indoor light Energy Harvesting Unit (EHU). Our design intends to integrate these nodes into a sensing network to improve its reliability by combining both technologies and taking advantage of their features. The nodes incorporate state-of-the-art components, such as low-power sensors and efficient System-on-Chips (SoCs). Moreover, we design a strategy for adaptive switching between active and sleep cycles as a function of the available energy, allowing the IoT nodes to continuously operate without batteries. Our results show that by adapting the duty cycle of the BLE and LIoT nodes depending on the environment's light intensity, we can ensure a continuous and reliable node operation. In particular, measurements show that our proposed BLE and LIoT node designs are able to communicate with an IoT gateway in a bidirectional way, every 19.3 and 624.6 seconds, respectively, in an energy-autonomous and reliable manner.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Singular Value Decomposition for Large-scale Distributed Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article studies the problem of decentralized Singular Value Decomposition (d-SVD), which is fundamental in various signal processing applications. Two scenarios are considered depending on the availability of the data matrix under consideration. In the first scenario, the matrix of interest is row-wisely available in each local node in the network. In the second scenario, the matrix of interest implicitly forms an outer product from two different series of measurements. By combining the lightweight local rational function approximation approach with parallel averaging consensus algorithms, two d-SVD algorithms are proposed to cope with the two aforementioned scenarios. We evaluate the proposed algorithms using two application examples: decentralized sensor localization via low-rank matrix completion and decentralized passive radar detection. Moreover, a novel and non-trivial truncation technique, which employs a representative vector that is orthonormal to the principal signal subspace, is proposed to further reduce the communication cost associated with the d-SVD algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed d-SVD algorithms converge to the centralized solution with reduced communication cost compared to those facilitated with the state-of-the-art decentralized power method.</description>

      <title>Handover_Management_in_UAV_Networks_with_Blockages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the performance of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based networks in urban environments characterized by blockages, focusing on their capability to support the service demands of mobile users. The UAV-base stations (UAV-BSs) are modeled using a two-dimensional (2-D) marked- Poisson point process (MPPP), where the marks represent the altitude of each UAV-BS. Leveraging stochastic geometry, we analyze the impact of blockages on network reliability by studying the meta distribution (MD) of the signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR) for a specific reliability threshold and the association probabilities for both line-of-sight (LoS) and non line-of-sight (NLoS) UAV-BSs. Furthermore, to enhance the performance of mobile users, we propose a novel cache-based handover management strategy that dynamically selects the cell search time and delays the received signal strength (RSS)-based base station (BS) associations. This strategy aims to minimize unnecessary handovers (HOs) experienced by users by leveraging caching capabilities at user equipment (UE), thus reducing latency, ensuring seamless connectivity, and maintaining the quality of service (QoS). This study provides valuable insights into optimizing UAV network deployments to support the stringent requirements in the network, ensuring reliable, low-latency, and high-throughput communication for next-generation smart cities.</description>

      <title>Optimal Routing and Link Configuration for Covert Heterogeneous Wireless Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nodes in contemporary radio networks often have multiple interfaces available for communication: WiFi, cellular, LoRa, Zigbee, etc. This motivates understanding both link and network configuration when multiple communication modalities with vastly different capabilities are available to each node. In conjunction, covertness or the hiding of radio communications is often a significant concern in both commercial and military wireless networks. We consider the optimal routing problem in wireless networks when nodes have multiple interfaces available and intend to hide the presence of the transmission from attentive and capable adversaries. We first consider the maximization of the route capacity given an end-to-end covertness constraint against a single adversary and we find a polynomial-time algorithm for optimal route selection and link configuration. We further provide optimal polynomial-time algorithms for two important extensions: (i) statistical uncertainty during optimization about the channel state information for channels from system nodes to the adversary; and, (ii) maintaining covertness against multiple adversaries. Numerical results are included to demonstrate the gains of employing heterogeneous radio resources and to compare the performance of the proposed approach versus alternatives.</description>

      <title>Automotive Speed Estimation: Sensor Types and Error Characteristics from OBD-II to ADAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern on-road navigation systems heavily depend on integrating speed measurements with inertial navigation systems (INS) and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Telemetry-based applications typically source speed data from the On-Board Diagnostic II (OBD-II) system. However, the method of deriving speed, as well as the types of sensors used to measure wheel speed, differs across vehicles. These differences result in varying error characteristics that must be accounted for in navigation and autonomy applications. This paper addresses this gap by examining the diverse speed-sensing technologies employed in standard automotive systems and alternative techniques used in advanced systems designed for higher levels of autonomy, such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), Autonomous Driving (AD), or surveying applications. We propose a method to identify the type of speed sensor in a vehicle and present strategies for accurately modeling its error characteristics. To validate our approach, we collected and analyzed data from three long real road trajectories conducted in urban environments in Toronto and Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The results underscore the critical role of integrating multiple sensor modalities to achieve more accurate speed estimation, thus improving automotive navigation state estimation, particularly in GNSS-denied environments.</description>

      <title>Parameter Training Efficiency Aware Resource Allocation for AIGC in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the evolution of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) techniques and the development of space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN), there will be a growing opportunity to enhance more users' mobile experience with customized AIGC applications. This is made possible through the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) training alongside mobile edge computing. In this paper, we formulate the optimization problem of maximizing the parameter training efficiency of the SAGIN system over wireless networks under limited resource constraints. We propose the Parameter training efficiency Aware Resource Allocation (PARA) technique to jointly optimize user association, data offloading, and communication and computational resource allocation. Solid proofs are presented to solve this difficult sum of ratios problem based on quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP), semidefinite programming (SDP), graph theory, and fractional programming (FP) techniques. Our proposed PARA technique is effective in finding a stationary point of this non-convex problem. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PARA method outperforms other baselines.</description>

      <title>GSVD-NMF: Recovering Missing Features in Non-negative Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is an important tool in signal processing and widely used to separate mixed sources into their components. Algorithms for NMF require that the user choose the number of components in advance, and if the results are unsatisfying one typically needs to start again with a different number of components. To make NMF more interactive and incremental, here we introduce GSVD-NMF, a method that proposes new components based on the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) to address discrepancies between the initial under-complete NMF results and the SVD of the original matrix. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that GSVD-NMF often effectively recovers multiple missing components in under-complete NMF, with the recovered NMF solutions frequently reaching better local optima. The results further show that GSVD-NMF is compatible with various NMF algorithms and that directly augmenting components is more efficient than rerunning NMF from scratch with additional components. By deliberately starting from under-complete NMF, GSVD-NMF has the potential to be a recommended approach for a range of general NMF applications.</description>

      <title>LSTM-QGAN: Scalable NISQ Generative Adversarial Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) still struggle with practical-sized data. First, many QGANs use principal component analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction, which, as our studies reveal, can diminish the QGAN's effectiveness. Second, methods that segment inputs into smaller patches processed by multiple generators face scalability issues. In this work, we propose LSTM-QGAN, a QGAN architecture that eliminates PCA preprocessing and integrates quantum long short-term memory (QLSTM) to ensure scalable performance. Our experiments show that LSTM-QGAN significantly enhances both performance and scalability over state-of-the-art QGAN models, with visual data improvements, reduced Frechet Inception Distance scores, and reductions of 5x in qubit counts, 5x in single-qubit gates, and 12x in two-qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of short blocklength Reed-Muller codes for physical layer security in real environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the application of Reed-Muller (RM) codes for Physical-layer security in a real world wiretap channel scenario. Utilizing software-defined radios (SDRs) in a real indoor environment, we implement a coset coding scheme that leverages the hierarchical structure of RM codes to secure data transmission. The generator matrix of the RM code is used to partition codewords into cosets in the usual way, where each message corresponds to a unique coset, and auxiliary bits select specific codewords within each coset. This approach enables the legitimate receiver (Bob) can decode the transmitted message with minimal information leakage to eavesdropper (Eve) thus protecting the confidentiality of the communication with the help of coset structure. Mutual information neural estimation (MINE) is used to quantify information leakage and validate the effectiveness of the scheme. Experimental results indicate that RM codes can achieve robust security even in practical environments affected by real-world channel impairments. These findings demonstrate the potential of RM codes as an efficient solution for physical-layer security, particularly for applications that require low latency and short blocklengths.</description>
