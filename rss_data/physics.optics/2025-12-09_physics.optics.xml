      <title>Single-particle incoherent diffractive imaging and amplified spontaneous emission in copper nanocubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate element-specific incoherent diffractive imaging (IDI) of single copper nanocubes using intensity correlations of K$\alpha$ fluorescence at a hard X-ray free-electron laser. Combining single particle diffraction classification with IDI, we retrieve the form factor of 88 nm cubes with 20 nm resolution, extending IDI to the destructive single-particle regime with a large gain in resolution. IDI visibility drops sharply above a fluence of $10^2$ J/cm$^2$, consistent with the assumption of amplified spontaneous emission. Our results reveal fundamental limits for high-fluence nanoimaging towards future single-particle X-ray imaging.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear phenomena in X-ray fluorescence from single nanoparticles under extreme conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials exposed to intense femtosecond X-ray pulses with energies above their K-shell absorption edge can enter an extremely ionized state, which could give rise to nonlinear phenomena, such as saturable absorption and reverse saturable absorption. In this work, we investigate these effects on single copper nanoparticles irradiated by an X-ray free-electron laser pulse. We study the properties of the K$\alpha$ fluorescence for two different short pulse durations and three X-ray incident energies below and above the K-shell absorption edge, and correlate these with incident fluence estimates based on coherent diffraction. We observe that the incident fluence of the pulse and not its duration, is the main factor that modulates the non-linear response, which leads to an effective shortening of the fluorescence emission. Our findings have implications for fluorescence-based methods for imaging single particles using transiently coherent fluorescence, or diffractive imaging through transient resonances.</description>

      <title>Tunable Narrowband Terahertz Radiation from van der Waals Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The terahertz (THz) spectral range is central to high-speed communication, precision metrology, sensing technologies, and a range of fundamental scientific investigations. Achieving these capabilities in practical systems increasingly demands chip-scale integration of THz photonic components that are typically bulky. In this context, van der Waals (vdW) materials provide a unique platform for integrated nonlinear photonics in the visible and near-infrared regimes, and extending this framework into the THz domain would constitute a significant advance. Here, we report tunable, intense, and narrowband THz radiation from ferroelectric niobium oxyhalides. Through halogen substitution and alloying, we achieve continuous and precise control over the emission frequency from 3.1 to 5.8 THz. We show that the narrowband THz radiation is driven by phonons associated with the ferroelectric polarization. We further demonstrate dynamic and nonvolatile control of the polarity of the coherent THz wave with external electric field. This work demonstrates efficient narrowband THz emission from vdW ferroeletrics and provides microscopic insight into its origin, paving the way for on-chip THz technology for a broad range of applications.</description>

      <title>Dispersion Engineering of Planar Sub-millimeter Wave Waveguides and Resonators with Low Radiation Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mm-wave and THz superconducting circuits find numerous applications in areas ranging from quantum information and sensing to high-energy physics. Planar THz transmission lines and resonators are fabrication-friendly, compact, and scalable, and they can be efficiently interfaced with external signals and controls. However, planar circuits radiate strongly at high frequencies, which precludes their use in loss-sensitive applications. Here, we present the design and characterization of planar dispersion-engineered transmission lines that effectively suppress radiation leakage in desired mm-wave bands. We extend this concept to design planar resonators with extremely low radiation leakage, resulting in radiation Q-factors above 106 at 553 GHz. Low-loss planar THz circuitry will impact many application domains, including broadband communications, quantum information, radio astronomy, and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Lensless and Lossless HoloVAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first successful fabrication of three-dimensional models using our fully lensless holographic volumetric additive manufacturing (HoloVAM) platform. In this configuration, tomographic light fields are generated directly from a phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) and delivered into a rotating vial of photopolymer without any imaging optics, relays, or index-matching bath. Building on the HoloTile framework for tiled Fourier holography and point-spread function (PSF) shaping, the system creates volumetric dose distributions with high photon efficiency and well-controlled axial propagation. Using a simple acrylate resin formulation and a minimalized optical train, we demonstrate reproducible fabrication of complex geometries. These results establish lensless HoloVAM as a practical and mechanically minimal route to volumetric fabrication, opening a new pathway toward compact and application-flexible VAM devices.</description>

      <title>In-series Multimode Interference Sensors and Fabry-Perot Interferometers for Enhanced Wavelength Shift Resolving Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the development of a refractive index sensor obtained by using a singlemode-multimode-singlemode (SMS) structure and a Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) set into an in-series configuration. Due to the self-imaging phenomenon, the SMS structure - formed by splicing a no-core fiber between two singlemode fibers -, provides a broad spectral peak whose central wavelength position is sensitive to variations in the refractive index of the medium surrounding the fiber. In turn, thanks to the in-series SMS-FPI configuration, the sensor's reflection spectrum exhibits the SMS spectral signature modulated by FPI fringes. This readily allows for reducing the width of the spectral features monitored during the sensing measurements, thus enhancing the capabilities of adequately resolving the corresponding spectral shifts. The FPIs reported in this investigation have been fabricated by using two different methods, namely by forming an air-gap FPI between the cleaved ends of two singlemode optical fibers, and by casting a polymeric film onto a connectorized fiber end tip. In the first configuration, the distance between the two cleaved fiber ends could be varied to tune the FPI's free spectral range, hence allowing for tailoring the widths of the spectral oscillations to be monitored during the sensing measurements. Alternatively, the second configuration, while avoiding the use of motorized translation stages, provides a more versatile option for applications. Thus, we understand that our work expands the application of multimode interference and FPIs in sensing scenarios, providing new opportunities for probing physical and chemical parameters by exploring their combined response.</description>

      <title>Dual-comb correlation spectroscopy reveals laser dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser dynamics underpin a broad range of modern photonic technologies and continue to reveal rich nonlinear behaviors. However, existing spectroscopic tools, most notably time-stretched dispersive Fourier transform spectroscopy (TS-DFT), remain limited in spectral resolution, accuracy, and their ability to capture continuous waveforms and complex field dynamics. Here, we introduce dual-comb correlation spectroscopy (DCCS) as a powerful approach for resolving fast and intricate laser behaviors that are inaccessible to TS-DFT and conventional spectrometers. By correlating two sequences of heterodyne spectra produced by mixing a test laser with a pair of optical combs, DCCS enables rapid (e.g., 1 us) and high-resolution (0.08 pm) spectral retrieval over broad optical bandwidths. Leveraging these capabilities, we reveal mode-hopping and mode-competition dynamics in continuous-wave lasers, as well as the buildup process of a mode-locked laser. These results establish DCCS as a versatile and complementary tool to TS-DFT for exploring transient, broadband, and previously unresolvable behaviors in lasers and other time-evolving optical systems.</description>

      <title>Giant optical anisotropy and visible-frequency epsilon-near-zero in hyperbolic van der Waals MoOCl2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of extreme optical anisotropy is foundational to nanoscale light manipulation. Van der Waals (vdW) crystal MoOCl2 has emerged as a promising candidate for this quest, hosting hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths. However, the fundamental anisotropic dielectric tensor governing this behavior has remained elusive. Here, we resolve this problem by providing the first experimental determination of the full dielectric tensor of hyperbolic vdW MoOCl2. Via spectroscopic ellipsometry, Mueller matrix, and reflectance measurements, we quantify the material's optical duality: a metallic optical response ({\epsilon}_1 &lt; 0) along the crystallographic a-axis and a dielectric response ({\epsilon}_1 &gt; 0) along the orthogonal directions. This dichotomy drives an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) condition at \approx 512 nm and results in giant in-plane birefringence of \delta n \approx 2.2 for MoOCl2. As a result, our work provides the critical missing experimental parameters for MoOCl2, establishing it as a benchmark hyperbolic and ENZ material.</description>

      <title>Laser-written reconfigurable photonic integrated circuit directly coupled to a single-photon avalanche diode array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, most integrated quantum photonics experiments rely on single-photon detectors operating at cryogenic temperatures coupled to photonic integrated circuits (PICs) through single-mode optical fibers. This approach presents significant challenges due to the detection complexity, as cryogenic conditions hinder the development of scalable systems. In addition, going towards fully-integrated devices or, at least, removing the optical fibers would be also advantageous to develop compact and cost-efficient solutions featuring a high number of optical modes. This work reports on the direct coupling of a PIC, fabricated by femtosecond laser writing (FLW), and a silicon single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array, fabricated in a custom planar technology and compatible with the operation at room temperature. The effectiveness of this solution is shown by achieving perfect coupling and a system detection efficiency as high as 41.0% at a wavelength of 561 nm, which is the highest value reported to date among both heterogeneous/hybrid integrated and directly coupled systems. We also show the robustness of the coupling to misalignments, demonstrating that costly alignment procedures are not needed. Finally, we exploit the SPAD array to characterize a reconfigurable Mach-Zehnder interferometer, i.e., the basic building block of multimode reconfigurable PICs. This solution provides a new avenue to the design and implementation of quantum photonics experiments, especially effective when compact and cost-efficient systems are needed.</description>

      <title>Observed enhanced emission at higher-order exceptional points in RF circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Purcell effect -- stemming directly from the celebrated Fermi's Golden Rule -- links the enhanced emissivity of an emitter to the local density of states (LDoS) of a surrounding cavity. Under typical circumstances the LDoS is assumed to have a Lorentzian lineshape. Here, we go beyond the traditional Purcell framework by designing RF cavities with non-Lorentzian LDoS caused by higher-order non-Hermitian exceptional point degeneracies (EPDs) where $N\geq 2$ eigenfrequencies and their associated eigenmodes coalesce. We experimentally demonstrate a non-conventional emissivity enhancement (as compared to the isolated resonance regime) that increases with the EPD order $N$. The theoretical analysis traces its origin to an $N$-th power Lorentzian LDoS line shape that dominates under judicious spatially designed cavity losses. Our results reveal a new route to design cavities that do not rely on ultrahigh $Q$-factor resonators or small modal volumes.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Induced Vacuum Polarization and Mode Shifts in Maxwell-Klein-Gordon Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric confinement is known to modify single-particle dynamics through effective potentials, yet its imprint on the interacting quantum vacuum remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the Maxwell--Klein--Gordon system constrained to curved surfaces and demonstrate that the geometric potential $\Sigma_{\mathrm{geom}}(\mathbf{r})$ acts as a local renormalization environment. We show that extrinsic curvature modifies the scalar loop spectrum, entering the vacuum polarization as a position-dependent mass correction $M^2(\mathbf{r}) \to m^2 + \Sigma_{\mathrm{geom}}(\mathbf{r})$. This induces a finite, gauge-invariant ``geometry-induced running'' of the electromagnetic response. In the long-wavelength regime ($|{\bf Q}|R \ll 1$), we derive a closed-form expression for the relative frequency shift $\Delta\omega/\omega$, governed by the overlap between the electric energy density and the geometric potential. Applying this formalism to Gaussian bumps, cylindrical shells, and tori, we identify distinct spectral signatures that distinguish these quantum loop corrections from classical geometric optics. Our results suggest that spatial curvature can serve as a tunable knob for ``vacuum engineering,'' offering measurable shifts in high-$Q$ cavities and plasmonic systems.</description>

      <title>Wide field-of-view and large depth-of-field metalenses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to visualize both macroscopic and microscopic features over an extended field of view is essential for endoscopic imaging and other applications ranging from machine vision to microscopy. However, miniaturizing endoscopes introduces inherent trade-offs between size and optical performance, including field-of-view (FOV), depth-of-field (DOF), and resolution. These constraints limit the use of microendoscopes in clinical settings such as early cancer detection within narrow, hard-to-access anatomical regions, including the lung, ovaries, and pancreas. State-of-the-art microendoscopes typically rely on microlens assemblies that increase both cost and size. Their large f-numbers also hinder the collection of high-resolution information from live tissue. In this work, we present two compact metalens designs that provide wide FOV, extended DOF, and high resolution, enabled by custom-tailored point spread functions (PSFs). The devices achieve a full 172 degrees FOV, an extended DOF from 0.4 mm to beyond 300 mm, and a resolution of 30 line pairs per millimeter, all within a 1 mm x 1 mm x 0.2 mm footprint. A key advantage of our approach is the ability to transition seamlessly between low and high magnification without mechanical refocusing. Final images are reconstructed through backend deconvolution, highlighting the potential of hybrid imaging systems that integrate computational techniques with flat-optics components.</description>

      <title>Phase-multiplexed optical computing: Reconfiguring a multi-task diffractive optical processor using illumination phase diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a monochrome multi-task diffractive network architecture that leverages illumination phase multiplexing to dynamically reconfigure its output function and accurately implement a large group of complex-valued linear transformations between an input and output aperture. Each member of the desired group of T unique transformations is encoded and addressed with a distinct 2D illumination phase profile, termed "phase key", which illuminates the input aperture, activating the corresponding transformation at the output field-of-view. A common diffractive optical network, optimized with T phase keys, demultiplexes these encoded inputs and accurately executes any of the T distinct linear transformations at its output. We demonstrate that a diffractive network composed of N = 2 x T x Ni x No optimized diffractive features can realize T distinct complex-valued linear transformations, accurately executed for any complex field at the input aperture, where Ni and No refer to the input/output pixels, respectively. In our proof-of-concept numerical analysis, T = 512 complex-valued transformations are implemented by the same monochrome diffractive network with negligible error using illumination phase diversity. Compared with wavelength-multiplexed diffractive systems, phase-multiplexing architecture significantly lowers the transformation errors, potentially enabling larger-scale optical transformations to be implemented through a monochrome processor. Phase-multiplexed multi-task diffractive networks would enhance the capabilities of optical computing and machine-vision systems.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Pre-trained Neural Network Models for the Classification of Tumor Cells Analyzed by Label-free Phase Holotomographic Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can a single label-free image reveal whether cancer cells were exposed to chemotherapy? We present an innovative methodology on the label-free and high-resolution imaging properties of phase holotomographic microscopy coupled with neural network models for the classification of cancer cells. Using 3D phase holotomographic microscopy, we imaged live A549 lung cancer cells with and without paclitaxel, converted stacks to 2D maximum-intensity projections, and evaluated pre-trained convolutional networks (VGG16, ResNet18, DenseNet121, and EfficientNet-B0) for binary classification of treatment status. EfficientNet-B0 achieved 96.9 % accuracy on unsegmented images. Refractive index analysis revealed bimodal distribution in treated cells, reflecting heterogeneous biophysical responses to paclitaxel exposure and supporting the network's ability to detect subtle, label-free indicators of drug action. As further proof-of-concept, the same pipeline separated holotomographic images of label-free, high versus low-graded urothelial cancer cells with high accuracy (90.6 %). These findings highlight the potential of integrating label-free holotomographic imaging with deep learning techniques for rapid and efficient classification of tumor cells, paving the way for advancements in treatment optimization and personalized diagnostic strategies.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative low harmonics generation in low-frequency laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving numerically three-dimensional non-stationary Schr\"odinger equation, we find the atomic response to the quasi-static electric field We suggest a semi-phenomenological approximation of this response which describes well the {\it ab initio} numerical calculation result both for low and high intensities (up to $1.4 \cdot 10^{14}$ W/cm$^2$). In particular, this approximation describes the nonperturbative increase or the third harmonic generation efficiency with the laser intensity, as well as the dependence of the optical ratification signal in the two-color field on the phase difference between the fields. Making the calculations for the realistic laser frequencies, we find that our approach is applicable up to fundamental frequencies of about 1 eV.</description>

      <title>Controllable Emergence of Multiple Topological Anderson Insulator Phases in Photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence and control of multiple topological Anderson insulator (TAI) phases in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) waveguide lattice with generalized Bernoulli-type disorder introduced in the intradimer couplings. By systematically varying the disorder configuration -- including the values and probabilities of the multivariate distribution -- we demonstrate that both the number and width of TAI phases can be precisely engineered. Analytical determination of topological phase boundaries via the inverse localization length shows excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Our results reveal a rich landscape of disorder-induced topological phase transitions, including multiple reentrant TAI phases that arise as the disorder amplitude increases. Furthermore, we show that the mean chiral displacement serves as a sensitive probe for detecting these topological transitions, providing a practical route for experimental realization in photonic waveguide lattices. This work establishes a versatile framework for designing quantum and photonic materials with customizable topological properties driven by tailored disorder.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors for Enhanced Biomedical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significance: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs; also known as SSPDs) show enormous promise for low-light biomedical imaging by offering exceptional sensitivity, picosecond timing resolution, and broad spectral coverage. Aim: This perspective evaluates the role of SNSPDs by comparing their performance with other photon-counting detectors for emerging biomedical imaging applications. Approach: We outline the need for ultrasensitive detectors for biophotonics, summarize SNSPD operating principles and compare their performance with established photon-counting devices. We highlight applications in which SNSPDs enable new imaging capabilities and discuss system-level challenges and technological developments that are critical to future applications, including clinical translation. Results: SNSPDs offer advantages in signal-to-noise ratio, temporal precision, and detection bandwidth, enabling deeper tissue imaging, high-precision fluorescence lifetime measurements, and quantum-enhanced imaging modalities. Advances in scalable arrays, cryogenic miniaturization, and improved signal collection are reducing barriers to widespread adoption. Conclusions: SNSPDs are poised to transform photon-limited biomedical imaging. As device performance and system integration continue to advance, their adoption in imaging platforms is expected to accelerate. Combining SNSPDs with advancements in the excitation pathway, such as structured-light excitation with Bessel beams, aberration correction, and wavefront shaping, shows promise for delivering unprecedented imaging capabilities and broadening both the preclinical and clinical utility of these detectors.</description>

      <title>Phase Space Modeling of Extended Sources Based on Wigner Distribution and Hamiltonian Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise modeling of extended sources is a central challenge in modern optical engineering, laser physics, and computational lithography. Unlike ideal point sources or completely incoherent thermal radiation sources, real-world light sources -- such as high-power laser diode arrays, superluminescent diodes (SLD), extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography sources, and beams transmitted through atmospheric turbulence -- typically exhibit partial spatial coherence.
  Traditional geometric optics based on ray tracing ignores diffraction and interference effects; while classical wave optics is accurate, the computational cost of handling four-dimensional correlation functions for partially coherent fields is enormous. To balance computational efficiency and physical accuracy, phase space optics provides a unified theoretical framework. By introducing the Wigner distribution function (WDF), we can map the light field into a joint space-time-spatial frequency domain $(\bm{r}, \bm{p})$. This description not only retains all the information of wave optics (including interference terms) but also naturally transitions to the ray description of Hamiltonian optics in the short-wavelength limit, governed by Liouville's theorem of phase space volume conservation.
  This report aims to establish optimal modeling methods based on phase space and Hamiltonian optics for different types of extended sources such as partially coherent light, fully coherent light, and quasi-homogeneous light. The report will derive in detail the mathematical models for each source type and provide strict criteria for the applicability of geometric optics models using mathematical tools such as the Moyal expansion and generalized Fresnel number.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous back-end-of-line integration of thin-film lithium niobate on active silicon photonics for single-chip optical transceivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosive growth of artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and large-scale machine learning is driving an urgent demand for short-reach optical interconnects featuring large bandwidth, low power consumption, high integration density, and low cost preferably adopting complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processes. Heterogeneous integration of silicon photonics and thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) combines the advantages of both platforms, and enables co-integration of high-performance modulators, photodetectors, and passive photonic components, offering an ideal route to meet these requirements. However, process incompatibilities have constrained the direct integration of TFLN with only passive silicon photonics. Here, we demonstrate the first heterogeneous back-end-of-line integration of TFLN with a full-functional and active silicon photonics platform via trench-based die-to-wafer bonding. This technology introduces TFLN after completing the full CMOS compatible processes for silicon photonics. Si/SiN passive components including low-loss fiber interfaces, 56-GHz Ge photodetectors, 100-GHz TFLN modulators, and multilayer metallization are integrated on a single silicon chip with efficient inter-layer and inter-material optical coupling. The integrated on-chip optical links exhibit greater than 60 GHz electrical-to-electrical bandwidth and support 128-GBaud OOK and 100-GBaud PAM4 transmission below forward error-correction thresholds, establishing a scalable platform for energy-efficient, high-capacity photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Coherent Field Emission Upon Ultrafast Laser Irradiation of the Tip Plasmon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Irradiation of sharp silver tips with femtosecond laser pulses leads to photoassisted coherent field emission without a static field. We reconstruct the time profile of the emission, and show that the process is entirely governed by the collective response of the tip plasmon and its field emission. Weak-field optical excitation leads to multiphoton absorption and field emission from the tip apex due to the enhanced local field. The attendant sharp field gradient ensures ponderomotive acceleration of emitted electrons and non-local light-matter interaction. The crossover regime in which simultaneous multiphoton absorption and optical field emission take place is evidenced by the time profile of electron emission correlation, laser power dependence, and polarization angle dependence of each harmonic current.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an efficient extension of supercontinuum generation through dispersion engineering of crystalline aluminum nitride (AlN)-on-sapphire waveguides. Using a tailored epitaxial regrowth of AlN epilayers and an optimized fabrication protocol, the dispersion sensitivity to the waveguide cross-section was enhanced allowing for a significant reach extension of both short and long dispersive wave with optimized pumping conditions, reaching down to 550 nm in the visible and up to 4.5 {\mu}m in the mid-infrared.</description>

      <title>Determinations of angular stiffness in rotational optical tweezers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotational optical tweezers are used to probe the mechanical properties of unknown microsystems. Quantifying the angular trap stiffness is essential for interpreting the rotational dynamics of probe particles. While methods for trap stiffness calibration are well established for translational degrees of freedom, angular trapping has been largely overlooked and is often assumed to behave analogously to translational dynamics. However, rotational and translational motions are sensitive to distinct experimental parameters and offer separate insights. This work covers passive analysis techniques for calibrating the angular trap stiffness and examines the influence of several factors unique to rotational optical tweezers. We show that the parameters of an ancillary measurement beam can be tuned to minimise its influence on angular trapping dynamics, while offering unprecedented improvements for nanoparticle analysis. We also explore the combined effects of shape-induced and material birefringence in spheroidal vaterite probes, and present a framework for assessing hydrodynamic and inertial contributions. These results provide a foundation for characterising rotational optical tweezers independent from translational models.</description>

      <title>Floquet states on disclinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that periodic longitudinal modulation of waveguide arrays with disclination can result in the appearance of previously unexplored Floquet modes bound to the disclination core. Such modes arise due to oscillations of the waveguides in the array, periodically switching the structure between topological and trivial phases on each modulation period, so that on average it seems trivial. Localization of such modes depends on the amplitude of waveguide oscillations. Depending on the discrete rotational symmetry of the arrays with disclinations, these modes exhibit distinct spatial profiles unattainable in periodic lattices. Propagation in a medium with focusing cubic nonlinearity reveals that these Floquet states remain localized below a critical power threshold, indicating the possibility of the formation of disclination-bound Floquet solitons. Our results unveil a new regime of localization in photonic systems, bridging disclination topology, Floquet engineering, and nonlinearity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the dynamical behavior of micro- and nano-mechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS) is essential in various fields from nonlinear dynamics to quantum technologies. Hence, it is important to be able to precisely monitor the mechanical properties of MEMS and NEMS devices. In this work, we show how to track and spatially map various properties of a mechanical resonator, such as frequency shift, linewidth, and nonlinearity, by aptly choosing three closely-spaced drive frequencies and using phase-locked loops. This technique tracks changes in the system faster and more efficiently, without the need for repeated frequency sweeps of the oscillator response, simply by employing three phase-locked tones.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Wave-Packet Dynamics in One-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) systems have attracted great attention due to their exotic phenomena beyond Hermitian domains. Here we study the wave-packet dynamics in general one-dimensional NH lattices and uncover several unexpected phenomena. The group velocity of a wave packet during the time evolution in such NH lattices is not only governed by the real part of the band structure but also by its imaginary part. The momentum also evolves due to the imaginary part of the band structure, which can lead to a self-induced Bloch oscillation in the absence of external fields. Furthermore, we discover the wave-packet dynamics can exhibit disorder-free NH jumps even when the energy spectra are entirely real. Finally, we show that the NH jumps can lead to both positive and negative temporal Goos--H\"{a}nchen shifts at the edge.</description>

      <title>Merging exceptional point and quasi-bound state in the continuum in nanophotonic cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional eigenvalue analyses of non-Hermitian systems, the coupling of two modes does not lead to the coexistence of an exceptional point (EP) and a quasi-bound state in the continuum (QBIC) at the same spectral position. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that introducing an excitation-phase degree of freedom enables the merging of an EP and a QBIC (or even a BIC) in nanophotonic cavities. Using coupled mode theory, we reveal the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and further validate it via numerical simulations on practical stacked structures. In the EP-QBIC regime, the mode quality (Q) factor can be enhanced by over one order of magnitude. Moreover, we systematically investigate the formation conditions for EP-QBIC states and conventional QBICs. Additionally, introducing an excitation-phase degree of freedom in a pure plasmonic structure allows the Q factor to increase by over 15 times due to QBIC formation-even breaking through the limit imposed by material loss.</description>

      <title>Site-controlled quantum dot arrays edge-coupled to integrated silicon nitride waveguides and devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalability of quantum photonic integrated circuits opens the path towards large-scale quantum computing and communication. To date, this scalability has been limited by the stochastic nature of the quantum light sources. Moreover, hybrid integration of different platforms will likely be necessary to combine state-of-the-art devices into a functioning architecture. Here, we demonstrate the active alignment and edge-coupling of arrays of ten site-controlled gallium arsenide quantum dots to an array of ten silicon nitride single-mode waveguides, at cryogenic temperatures. The coupling is facilitated by the fabrication of nanopillars, deterministically self-aligned around each quantum dot, leading to a high-yield and regular array of single-photon sources. An on-chip beamsplitter verifies the triggered emission of single photons into the silicon nitride chip. The low inhomogeneous broadening of the ensemble enables us to observe the spectral overlap of adjacent site-controlled emitters. Across the array of waveguides, the signal collected from each coupled quantum dot is consistently and reproducibly 0.17 relative to the free-space collection from the very same single-photon source. Comparing measurement with waveguide simulations, we infer that absolute coupling efficiencies of $\approx 5 \%$ are currently obtained between our quantum dots and the waveguides.</description>

Abstract: Fabrication of X-ray gratings has surged in the last two decades thanks to their vast employment in X-ray Phase Contrast Imaging, an imaging technique able to boost X-ray sensitivity to detect otherwise invisible details. These high aspect ratio devices are usually fabricated by complex, costly, multi-step processes that limit their size and volume scaling. These steps commonly involve UV or X-ray lithography, semiconductor selective etching and high-Z metal plating, usually Au, which require expensive tools and materials. Here we present a proof-of-concept fabrication via soft lithography and Hg infusion of microfluidic X-ray absorption gratings and their performance in biomedical imaging. Such fabrication technique requires fewer, less expensive, and more scalable processes using alternative and more sustainable materials, while showing comparable visibility with their conventional Au-based, solid equivalent. Our results constitute a promising shift in X-ray optics fabrication that could significantly lower barriers to commercialization and accelerate the practical deployment of X-ray Phase Contrast Imaging.</description>

      <title>Widefield pump-probe microscopy with coherent background subtraction by angle-compensated temporal shearing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pump-probe microscopy enables label-free imaging of structural and chemical features of samples. However, signals in pump-probe microscopy are typically small and often must be measured in the presence of large backgrounds. As a result, achieving measurements with a high signal-to-noise ratio is challenging, particularly when using sensors that are easily saturated, such as CMOS cameras. We present a method for enhancing signal-to-noise ratio while avoiding detector saturation. In this approach, temporally separated (sheared) reference and probe pulses transmit through a sample before and after the arrival of a pump pulse. The probe and reference pulses are then temporally recombined with opposing phases and nearly matched amplitudes, resulting in interferometric background subtraction. This recombining operation is performed by a novel common-path interferometer. Unlike previous techniques for temporal shearing, this interferometer demonstrates negligible phase and group delay dispersion with angle of incidence, allowing convenient widefield imaging. To our knowledge, this is the first common-path interferometer with such a property. We demonstrate the technique by measuring transient absorption signals in gold nanorod films with a signal-to-background ratio enhanced by over 100% and a signal-to-noise ratio enhanced by about 70%.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal equilibrium thermodynamics of guided optical waves at positive and negative temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical thermalization has been recently studied theoretically and experimentally in the 2D spatial evolution of (quasi-)monochromatic light waves propagating in multimode fibers. In this work, we investigate the spatio-temporal equilibrium properties of incoherent multimode optical waves through the analysis of the (2+1)D Bose-Einstein thermal distribution and the corresponding classical Rayleigh-Jeans approximation. In the anomalous dispersion regime, the spatio-temporal equilibrium is characterized by positive temperatures. In this regime, we show that as the number of modes of the waveguide increases, the fundamental spatial mode becomes macroscopically populated, while its temporal spectrum undergoes significant narrowing, ultimately leading to complete (2+1)D spatio-temporal condensation in the thermodynamic limit. In the normal dispersion regime, the spatio-temporal equilibrium is characterized by negative temperature states that exhibit a hybrid character: the spatial equilibrium displays an inverted modal population, whereas the temporal spectrum remains peaked around the fundamental (carrier) optical frequency. In this regime, we predict that spatio-temporal light waves exhibit a phase transition to Bose-Einstein condensation at negative temperatures, which occurs by increasing the temperature above a negative critical value. Our work opens new avenues for future research, including the possibility for a dual spatio-temporal beam cleaning through full spatio-temporal light condensation, and lay the groundwork for the development of spatio-temporal optical thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Labyrinth Circular Bragg Grating Design for Charge and Stark-Tunable Quantum Light Sources Spanning Visible to Telecom Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots embedded in circular Bragg gratings (CBGs) are among the most efficient integrated single-photon sources. However, the fully etched rings of conventional CBGs restrict the implementation of charge and Stark tuning via electrical contacts. To overcome this limitation, a labyrinth CBG geometry with four bridges has been proposed, yet the added bridges significantly degraded optical performance. In this work, we numerically demonstrate that a periodic labyrinth CBG design preserves both high coupling efficiency and strong Purcell enhancement while enabling electrical integration if optimized after introducing the bridges. We show three optimized designs at emission wavelengths of 780 nm, 930 nm, and 1550 nm, because these wavelengths are among the most relevant for quantum dots and show the general applicability of our approach. At all three wavelengths collection efficiencies exceeding 90% into a numerical aperture of 0.7 and Purcell factors greater than 25 are achieved. Furthermore, we propose a device layout incorporating a barrier layer that separates p- and n-doped semiconductor regions, which is incorporated to prevent tunneling of one of the charge carriers for selective charging. Also this design can be reoptimized to retain the performance of a device without tunnel barrier. These results establish labyrinth CBGs as a platform for electrically tunable quantum dot single-photon sources with high efficiency and scalability.</description>

      <title>MaxwellLink: A unified framework for self-consistent light-matter simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in light-matter simulations is bridging the disparate time and length scales of electrodynamics and molecular dynamics. Current computational approaches often rely on heuristic approximations of either the electromagnetic (EM) or material component, hindering the exploration of complex light-matter systems. Herein, MaxwellLink -- a modular, open-source Python framework -- is developed for the massively parallel, self-consistent propagation of classical EM fields interacting with a large heterogeneous molecular ensemble. The package utilizes a robust TCP/UNIX socket interface to couple EM solvers with a wide range of external molecular drivers. This decoupled architecture allows users to seamlessly switch between levels of theory of either the EM solver or molecules without modifying the counterpart. Crucially, MaxwellLink supports EM solvers spanning from single-mode cavities to full-feature three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) engines, and molecules described by multilevel open quantum systems, force-field and first-principles molecular dynamics, and nonadiabatic real-time Ehrenfest dynamics. Benefiting from the socket-based design, the EM engine and molecular drivers scale independently across multiple high-performance computing (HPC) nodes, facilitating large-scale simulations previously inaccessible to existing numerical schemes. The versatility and accuracy of this code are demonstrated through applications including superradiance, radiative energy transfer, vibrational strong coupling in Bragg resonators, and plasmonic heating of molecular gases. By providing a unified, extensible engine, MaxwellLink potentially offers a powerful platform for exploring emerging phenomena across the research fronts of spectroscopy, quantum optics, plasmonics, and polaritonics.</description>

      <title>Spin-photon Qubits for Scalable Quantum Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state quantum light sources offer a scalable pathway for interfacing stationary spin qubits with flying photonic qubits, forming the backbone of future quantum networks. Telecom-band spin-photonic qubits, operating in the 1260-1675 nm wavelength range, are particularly well-suited for long-distance quantum communication due to minimal loss in standard optical fibers. Achieving scalability, however, hinges on fulfilling several stringent criteria: coherent spin-state control, deterministic and indistinguishable single-photon emission, and integration with nanophotonic structures that enhance radiative properties, such as lifetime, coherence, and photon indistinguishability. This study explores the state-of-the-art spin-photonic qubits across solid-state platforms, including diamond color centers, silicon carbide defect centers, quantum dots, and two-dimensional materials. Special attention is given to silicon-based emitters, particularly G, T, C- and Ci-centers, which promise monolithic integration with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology and telecom-band operation. We classify these systems based on spin-photon interface availability, CMOS process compatibility, and emitter scalability. We also discuss recent advances in cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED), including Purcell enhancement and quality factor engineering in integrated photonic (circuits) environments. The work highlights emerging demonstrations of quantum networking over metropolitan scales and outlines the trajectory toward chip-scale quantum photonic integrated circuits (QPICs). It combines deterministic emitter creation, coherent spin manipulation, and quantum information processing. These developments pave the way for global quantum networks, enabling secure communication, distributed quantum computing, and quantum-enhanced sensing.</description>

      <title>Alterations of brain tissue structural complexity and disorder in Parkinson disease (PD): Fractal, multifractal, fractal transformation, and disorder strength analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parkinson disease (PD) is marked by progressive neurodegeneration, yet early and subtle structural alterations in brain tissue remain difficult to detect with conventional imaging and analytical methods. Fractal and multifractal frameworks offer a principled way to quantify complex biological architecture, but their diagnostic utility in PD has been largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the fractal and multifractal characteristics of human brain tissues to identify structural alterations associated with PD. Alongside conventional fractal and multifractal analysis, we employed a recently developed fractal functional distribution method that transforms distributions into a Gaussian form, thereby enhancing quantification. Using this combined approach, we found notable deviations across multiple distribution metrics in PD samples, offering potential for quantitative staging and diagnostic applications. The multifractal analysis revealed threshold-dependent variations in intensity-based measures, which are linked to the sparsity and heterogeneity of neural tissue and suggestive of potential biomarker value. Additionally, we applied inverse participation ratio (IPR) analysis to assess structural disorder, demonstrating that larger IPR pixel sizes correlate with increased structural complexity during disease progression. These complementary analyses outline a multi-layered quantitative profile of PD-related tissue disruption, offering a foundation for earlier, objective assessment of disease-associated microstructural change.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the Transition of SiV$^-$ in Diamond to an Optically Dark State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Negatively charged silicon vacancy centers in diamond (SiV$^-$) are promising for quantum photonic technologies. However, when subject to resonant optical excitation, they can inadvertently transfer into a zero-spin optically dark state. We show that this unwanted change of charge state can be quickly reversed by the resonant laser itself in combination with static electric fields. By defining interdigitated metallic contacts on the diamond surface, we increase the steady-state SiV$^-$ photoluminescence under resonant excitation by a factor $\ge3$ for most emitters, making it practically constant for certain individual emitters. We electrically activate single \sivs near the positively biased electrode, which are entirely dark without applying local electric fields. Using time-resolved 3-color experiments, we show that the resonant laser not only excites the SiV$^-$, but also creates free holes that convert SiV$^{2-}$ to SiV$^-$ on a timescale of milliseconds. Through analysis of several individual emitters, our results show that the degree of electrical charge state controllability differs between individual emitters, indicating that their local environment plays a key role. Our proposed electric-field-based stabilization scheme enhances deterministic charge state control in group-IV color centers and improves its understanding, offering a scalable path toward quantum applications such as entanglement generation and quantum key distribution.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Information Processing with Quantum Weak Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noise is an important factor that influences the reliability of information acquisition, transmission, processing, and storage. In order to suppress the inevitable noise effects, a fault-tolerant information processing approach via quantum weak measurement is proposed, where pairwise orthogonal postselected measurement bases with various tiny angles and optimal compositions of measured results are chosen as a decoding rule. The signal to be protected can be retrieved with a minimal distortion after having been transmitted through a noisy channel. Demonstrated by typical examples of encoding signal on two-level superposition state or Einstein-Podolsky-Rossen state transmitted through random telegraph noise and decoherence noises channel, the mean squared error distortion may be close to $0$ and the fault-tolerant capability could reach $1$ with finite quantum resources. To verify the availability of the proposed approach, classic coherent light and quantum coherent state are used for encoding information in the experiment. Potentially, the proposed approach may provide a solution for suppressing noise effects in long-distance quantum communication, high-sensitivity quantum sensing, and accurate quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Polaron-Driven Spin Funneling through Rashba-Split Bands in Mixed-Phase Quasi-Two-Dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) exhibit pronounced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) as a result of their heavy metal constituents, leading to distinctive electronic properties such as Rashba type band splitting which make them promising candidates for next generation spintronic applications. Here, using circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and polarization dependent pump-probe spectroscopy, we found that spin polarization is present across all phases of our two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) mixed-phase perovskites, (C6H7SNH3)2 (CH3NH3)n-1PbnI3n+1 (n=1-4), irrespective of the number of inorganic layers. The origin of these spin polarized bands is attributed to the Rashba effect. Interestingly, the highly disordered nature of this system facilitates remarkably efficient ultrafast funneling of photoexcited spin-polarized excitons from the pure 2D phase (n=1) to higher-n phases at room temperature. We demonstrate that significant polaron formation due to the inherent soft crystal lattice and higher exciton-phonon interaction is responsible for the observed spin funneling effect in mixed-phase 2D RP perovskites. Polaron act as a protective mechanism for spin-polarized excitons, preserving their spin information through the screening of omnipresent phonon-induced momentum scattering. These findings not only offer valuable guidance for the design of 2D RP perovskites with pronounced Rashba effects but also unveil a compelling class of solution-processed perovskites capable of efficient spin-preserving energy transport at room temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Insomuch as statistical mechanics circumvents the formidable task of addressing many-body dynamics, it remains a challenge to derive macroscopic properties from a solution to Hamiltonian equations for microscopic motion of an isolated system. Launching new attacks on this long-standing problem -- part of Hilbert's sixth problem -- is urgently important, for focus of statistical phenomena is shifting from a fictitious ensemble to an individual member, i.e. a mechanically isolated system. Here we uncover a common probabilistic structure, the concentration of measure, in Hamiltonian dynamics of two families of systems, the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model which is finite-dimensional and (almost) ergodic, and the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) which is infinite-dimensional and suffers strong ergodicity breaking. That structure is protected by the geometry of phase space and immune to ergodicity breaking, leading to counterintuitive phenomena. Notably, an isolated FPUT behaves as a thermal ideal gas even for strong modal interaction, with the thermalization time analogous to the Ehrenfest time in quantum chaos, while an isolated GPE system, without any quantum inputs, escapes the celebrated ultraviolet catastrophe through nonlinear wave localization in the mode space, and the Rayleigh-Jeans equilibrium sets in the localization volume. Our findings may have applications in nonlinear optics and cold-atom dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive microstructural deterioration in brain tissue, yet conventional imaging and histopathology often lack the sensitivity needed to detect subtle early-stage changes. Here, we present a multiparametric framework combining fractal and multifractal analysis and their distributions to quantify structural alterations in human brain tissue affected by AD. Moreover, from the fractal and multifractal formalism, we introduced an innovative fractal functional distribution method, a novel technique that transforms fractal distribution into a Gaussian form. Statistically, these distribution parameters are easy to interpret and can distinguish between control and diseased tissues. Across samples, we identify pronounced threshold-dependent behavior of fractal and multifractal parameters, reflecting the intrinsic sparsity and heterogeneous intensity landscape of brain tissue. These threshold-sensitive signatures provide a framework for quantitative stage detection and may serve as biomarkers for early pathological transitions. In addition, we studied structural disorder and complexity using our established light localization technique, inverse participation ratio (IPR) analysis. IPR-based analysis demonstrates that increasing IPR pixel size highlights the elevation of structural alterations with disease progression. Together, these integrative analyses establish a robust, multi-scale quantitative framework for detecting microstructural alterations in AD, providing a promising foundation for early diagnosis and improved pathological assessment.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Characterization of Brain Tissue Alterations in Brain Cancer Using Fractal, Multifractal, and IPR Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the structural alterations between healthy and diseased brain tissues using a multiparametric framework combining fractal analysis, fractal functional transformation, multifractal analysis, and the Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR) analysis. Accurate characterization of brain tissue microstructure is crucial for early detection and diagnosis of cancer. By applying box-counting methods on brightfield microscopy images, we estimated the fractal dimension (Df) and its logarithmic (ln(Df)) and functional (ln(Dtf)) forms to highlight spatial irregularities in the tissue architecture. While Df and ln(Df) exhibited long-tailed distributions distinguishing healthy from cancer tissues, ln(Dtf) provided significantly improved differentiation by emphasizing local structural variations. Additionally, multifractal analysis revealed broader f({\alpha}) vs {\alpha} curves in cancerous samples, reflecting higher heterogeneity. IPR analysis based on light localization further demonstrated increased nanoscale variations in mass density, reflecting higher structural disorder in cancer tissues. Combining these complementary approaches creates a robust framework for measuring tissue complexity and holds great potential to improve microscopic diagnostic methods for brain cancer detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of non-Hermitian photonics, we investigate the spectral and dynamical properties of one- and two-dimensional non-Hermitian off-diagonal disordered optical lattices, where randomness is applied to the couplings rather than to the on-site potential terms. We analyze eigenvalue distributions and the localization properties of the eigenmodes, comparing them with those of the corresponding Hermitian lattices. Furthermore, we study their transport behavior under single-channel excitation and identify unconventional phenomena such as jumps between distant lattice regions in systems with a purely real spectrum, as well as complex spectrum-induced Anderson jumps, reported here for the first time in two dimensions. Our results establish a reference framework for non-Hermitian off-diagonal disorder and open new directions for future studies of localization phenomena.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of quantum jumps between macroscopic states of light: reading an operational coherence record</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an experimental apparatus to reveal the quantum coherence manifested in downward quantum jumps of amplitude bistability. The underlying coherent superposition of macroscopic quantum states is translated into the statistical properties of the integrated charge deposited in the detector circuit of a mode-matched heterodyne/homodyne detection scheme. At first, the dynamical evolution of a signal transmitted from an auxiliary cavity is employed to pinpoint a macroscopic switching event in a bistable main cavity subject to direct photodetection. Once the decision is made on the occurrence of a downward switch, the main cavity mode is let to freely decay to the vacuum, monitored to the production of an integrated charge. In the long-time limit, the charge distribution over an identical collection of pure states generated during the jumps converges to the Q function (heterodyne detection) or marginals of the Wigner function (homodyne detection) dictated by the phase of the local oscillator. When fluctuations over the ensemble step in, we connect the statistical properties of several switching events and the ensuing production of current records, to the cavity field correlations associated with the breakdown of photon blockade.</description>

Abstract: Owing to their significant advantages in terms of bandwidth, power efficiency, and latency, optical neuromorphic systems have arisen as interesting alternatives to digital electronic devices. Recently, photonic crystal nanolasers with excitable behavior were first demonstrated. Depending on the pumping strength, they emit short optical pulses -- spikes -- at various intervals on a nanosecond timescale. In this theoretical work, we show how networks of such photonic spiking neurons can be used for Bayesian inference through sampling from learned probability distributions. We provide a detailed derivation of translation rules from conventional sampling networks, such as Boltzmann machines, to photonic spiking networks and demonstrate their functionality across a range of generative tasks. Finally, we provide estimates of processing speed and power consumption, for which we expect improvements of several orders of magnitude over current state-of-the-art neuromorphic systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Linear Electro-Optic Effect Through Interactions of Free and Bound Charges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in non-Hermitian phenomena in low-symmetry conductors, particularly optical gain driven by electro-optic effects. Conventional semiclassical treatments typically attribute these effects to nonlinear interactions associated with the anomalous velocity of Bloch electrons. Here, we present a phenomenological microscopic model that not only recovers these anomalous-velocity contributions, but also incorporates interband effects that become significant at higher frequencies. Our model captures a wide range of nonlinear interactions while remaining consistent with passivity and microscopic reversibility. Using this broader framework, we study the nonlinear interactions between free and bound electrons as an alternative mechanism for optical gain.
  We show that, under non-equilibrium conditions in low-symmetry conductors, the linearized electromagnetic response can exhibit both nonreciprocity and gain, even without anomalous velocity contributions. Finally, we analyze the stability of electrically biased systems and highlight potential applications such as optical isolators and traveling-wave amplifiers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the design, fabrication in a commercial foundry, and experimental results of high-efficiency, normal incidence grating couplers for silicon photonics. We observe a maximum coupling efficiency of 85.4% (-0.69 dB) with a 1 dB bandwidth of 20 nm at a central wavelength of 1546 nm. These experimental results verify earlier theoretical and simulation results and pave the way for the use of perfectly vertical grating couplers, as an alternative to edge coupling, in silicon photonics applications that are sensitive to input coupling loss. Further, these results enable the use of grating couplers for vertically oriented elements, such as multicore fibers and VCSELs, and address challenges associated with coupling to free space beams.</description>

Abstract: Modern photon-counting sensors are increasingly dominated by Poisson noise, yet conventional Feature-Specific Imaging (FSI) is optimized for additive Gaussian noise, leading to suboptimal performance and a loss of its advantages under Poisson noise. To address this, we introduce DeepFSI, a novel end-to-end optical-electronic framework. DeepFSI "unfreezes" traditional FSI masks, enabling a deep neural network to learn globally optimal measurement masks by computing gradients directly under realistic Poisson and additive noise conditions. Our simulations demonstrate DeepFSI's superior feature fidelity and task performance compared to conventional FSI with predefined masks, especially in Poisson-Noise-dominant environments. DeepFSI also exhibits enhanced robustness to design choices and performs well under additive Gaussian noise, representing a significant advance for noise-robust computational imaging in photon-limited applications.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Nonlinear Optical Tomography: Unbiased Characterization of Off- and On-Chip Coupling Efficiencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate evaluation of nonlinear photonic integrated circuits requires separating input and output coupling efficiencies (i.e., $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$), yet the conventional linear-transmission calibration method recovers only their product (i.e., $\eta_1\,\eta_2$) and therefore introduces systematic bias when inferring on-chip performance from off-chip data. We present bidirectional nonlinear optical tomography (BNOT), a direction-aware metrology that uses forward and backward pumping of complementary nonlinear probes, with process-appropriate detection, to break the ``degeneracy'' of $\eta_1\,\eta_2$ and estimate individual interface efficiencies with tight confidence intervals. The method links off-chip measurements to on-chip quantities through a compact observation model that explicitly incorporates pump fluctuations and detector noise, and it frames efficiency extraction as a joint constrained optimization. Monte Carlo studies show unbiased convergence of the estimated efficiencies to ground truth with low error across realistic operating regimes. Using these efficiency estimates to reconstruct on-chip nonlinear figures of merit yields distributions centered on the true values with reduced variance, whereas conventional ``degenerate'' calibration is biased and can substantially misestimate on-chip performance. BNOT is hardware-compatible and platform-agnostic, and provides unbiased characterization of off- and on-chip coupling efficiencies across nonlinear processes, enabling reproducible, coupling-resolved benchmarking for scalable systems in quantum optics, frequency conversion, and precision metrology.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Gradient Imaging Using a Nonlocal Metasurface System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09922v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum phase imaging enables the analysis of transparent samples with thickness and refractive index variations in scenarios requiring precise measurements under low-light conditions. Here, we present a compact quantum phase-gradient imaging system integrating a lithium niobate (LiNbO3) metasurface for generating spatially entangled photon pairs and a silicon (Si) metasurface for phase gradient extraction. By leveraging nonlocal resonances, the LiNbO3 metasurface enables efficient spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with all-optically angularly tunable emission, while the Si metasurface provides a nearly linear optical transfer function (OTF) that differentiates the photon wavefunction and extracts phase gradients.Experimental proof-of-concept results demonstrate the imaging of up to 25~rad/mm phase gradients, achieving 89% similarity with the reference values. The pixel resolution of the system can be potentially enhanced by orders of magnitude by increasing the metasurface dimensions and resonance quality factor.Our work showcases the application of metasurfaces in both generating and detecting quantum states and establishes a new paradigm for portable quantum phase-gradient imaging, with potential applications in quantum sensing, microscopy, and LiDAR technology.</description>

Abstract: Breaking the diffraction limit in optical imaging is crucial for resolving subwavelength details in a wide range of applications, where superoscillatory imaging and subtraction imaging are two common strategies for surpassing conventional resolution limits. We propose an end-to-end deep learning framework that integrates superoscillatory focusing and subtraction imaging into a single jointly-optimized vectorial Debye integral neural network pipeline, eliminating the traditional two-step acquisition and manual weighting process. With this end-to-end neural network, we further improve the focusing capability of the system to the sub-100-nm regime, enabling deep-subwavelength imaging resolution.</description>

      <title>Structured Light at the Extreme: Harnessing Spatiotemporal Control for High-Field Laser-Matter Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review charts the emerging paradigm of intelligent structured light for high-field laser-matter interactions, where the precise spatiotemporal and vectorial control of light is a critical degree of freedom. We outline a transformative framework built upon three synergistic pillars. First, we survey the advanced electromagnetic toolkit, moving beyond conventional spatial light modulators to include robust static optics and the promising frontier of plasma light modulators. Second, we detail the optimization engine for this high-dimensional design space, focusing on physics-informed digital twins and AI-driven inverse design to automate the discovery of optimal light structures. Finally, we explore the groundbreaking applications enabled by this integrated approach, including programmable electron beams, orbital-angular-momentum-carrying {\gamma}-rays, compact THz accelerators, and robust communications. The path forward necessitates overcoming grand challenges in material science, real-time adaptive control at MHz rates, and the extension of these principles to the quantum realm. This review serves as a call to action for a coordinated, interdisciplinary effort to command, rather than merely observe, light-matter interactions at the extreme.</description>

      <title>Intrinsically chiral exciton polaritons in an atomically-thin semiconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs) have emerged as a versatile tool for enhancing light-matter interactions by strongly confining light fields. Chiral BICs are photonic resonances with a high degree of circular polarisation, which hold great promise for spin-selective applications in quantum optics and nanophotonics. Here, we demonstrate a novel application of a chiral BIC for inducing strong coupling between the circularly polarised photons and spin-polarised (valley) excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) in atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenide crystals (TMDCs). By placing monolayer WS$_2$ onto the BIC-hosting metasurface, we observe the formation of intrinsically chiral, valley-selective exciton polaritons, evidenced by circularly polarised photoluminescence (PL) at two distinct energy levels. The PL intensity and degree of circular polarisation of polaritons exceed those of uncoupled excitons in our structure by an order of magnitude. Our microscopic model shows that this enhancement is due to folding of the Brillouin zone creating a direct emission path for high-momenta polaritonic states far outside the light cone, thereby providing a shortcut to thermalisation (energy relaxation) and suppressing depolarisation. Moreover, while the polarisation of the upper polariton is determined by the valley excitons, the lower polariton behaves like an intrinsic chiral emitter with its polarisation fixed by the BIC. Therefore, the spin alignment of the upper and lower polaritons ($\uparrow\downarrow$ and $\uparrow \uparrow$) can be controlled by $\sigma^+$ and $\sigma^-$ polarised optical excitation, respectively. Our work introduces a new type of chiral light-matter quasi-particles in atomically-thin semiconductors and provides an insight into their energy relaxation dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Currently, the X-ray detectors are widely used in medical imaging, industrial inspection, aerospace, and other fields, as the market demand for high-efficiency, flexible, and low-power detectors is increased. Although the traditional inorganic X-ray detection materials have achieved great success and effectiveness, they have their own limitations and let alone flexibility/bendability and memory function. In this study, we present the design of a BiSeI/NiO-based X-ray synaptic detector and its application in the simulation of biological synaptic processes. Herein, the BiSeI, a quasi-1D inorganic semiconductor, stands out as an ideal choice for the X-ray detectors, especially for flexible and portable devices due to its large atomic number, large photoelectric absorption coefficient, and mechanical plasticity. Meanwhile, the NiO-based materials provide the memory function required for the intelligent detection systems. Moreover, our devices offer notable advantages in terms of low power consumption, compared with traditional X-ray detectors. The BiSeI/NiO detectors demonstrate advanced features with an ultrahigh sensitivity, an ultralow detection limit, and include the paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and the transition from short- to long-term memory, maintaining the functionality on flexible substrates. This design represents a significant step toward the development of intelligent and flexible X-ray detectors.</description>

Abstract: Quantum sensing and metrology present one of the most promising near-term applications in the field of quantum technologies, with quantum sensors enabling unprecedented precision in measurements of electric, magnetic or gravitational fields and displacements. Experimental loss at the detection stage remains one of the key obstacles to achieving a truly quantum advantage in many practical scenarios. Here, we combine the capabilities of Rydberg atoms to both sense external fields and be used for quantum information processing, thereby largely overcoming the issue of detection losses. While utilising the large dipole moments of Rydberg atoms in an ensemble to achieve a $\SI{39}{\nV\per\cm \hertz\tothe{-1/2}}$ sensitivity, we employ inter-atomic dipolar interactions to take advantage of an error-prevention protocol that protects information against conventional losses at the detection stage. Counterintuitively, the protocol's idea is based on introducing an additional non-linear, lossy quantum channel, which results in a 3.3-fold enhancement of Fisher information. The presented results pave the way for broader adoption of quantum-information-inspired enhancements enabled by intrinsic interactions present in a sensor system, and more broadly in practical quantum metrology and communication, without the need for a general-purpose quantum computer.</description>

Abstract: The learning of the physical world relies on sensing and data post-processing. When the signals are weak, multidimensional and correlated, the performance of learning is often bottlenecked by the quality of sensors, calling for integrating quantum sensing into the learning of such physical-layer data. An example of such a learning scenario is the stochastic quadrature displacements of electromagnetic fields, modeling optomechanical force sensing, radiofrequency photonic sensing, microwave cavity weak signal sensing, and other applications. We propose a unified protocol that combines machine learning with interferometric photon counting to reduce noise and reveal correlations. By applying variational quantum learning with multimode programmable quantum measurements, we enhance signal extraction. Our results show that multimode interferometric photon counting outperforms conventional homodyne detection proposed in prior works for tasks like principal component analysis (PCA) and cross-correlation analysis (CCA), even below vacuum noise levels. To further enhance the performance, we also integrate entanglement-enhanced modules, in the form of squeezed state distribution and anti-squeezing at detection, into the protocol. Combining multimode interferometric photon counting and multipartite entanglement, the proposed protocol provides a powerful toolbox for learning weak signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18240v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel Quadratic Binary Optimization (QBO) framework for training a quantized neural network. The framework enables the use of arbitrary activation and loss functions through spline interpolation, while Forward Interval Propagation addresses the nonlinearities and the multi-layered, composite structure of neural networks via discretizing activation functions into linear subintervals. This preserves the universal approximation properties of neural networks while allowing complex nonlinear functions accessible to quantum solvers, broadening their applicability in artificial intelligence. Theoretically, we derive an upper bound on the approximation error and the number of Ising spins required by deriving the sample complexity of the empirical risk minimization problem from an optimization perspective. A key challenge in solving the associated large-scale Quadratic Constrained Binary Optimization (QCBO) model is the presence of numerous constraints. To overcome this, we adopt the Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD) algorithm, which solves QCBO directly on quantum hardware. We establish the convergence of QCGD under a quantum oracle subject to randomness, bounded variance, and limited coefficient precision, and further provide an upper bound on the Time-To-Solution. To enhance scalability, we further incorporate a decomposed copositive optimization scheme that replaces the monolithic lifted model with sample-wise subproblems. This decomposition substantially reduces the quantum resource requirements and enables efficient low-bit neural network training. We further propose the usage of QCGD and Quantum Progressive Hedging (QPH) algorithm to efficiently solve the decomposed problem.</description>

Abstract: We present the first experimental confirmation that a laser-wakefield accelerator produced by a flying focus pulse is able to maintain the coherent structures necessary to accelerate electrons to relativistic energies. Through a combination of spatio-temporal near-field shaping of the beam and focusing with an axiparabola - a long-focal-depth mirror that produces a quasi-Bessel beam - the propagation velocity of the wakefield is tuned to control the maximum electron energy achievable. The experimental data are supported by advanced optical and particle-in-cell simulations and are aligned with a simplified analytical model. Together, the results significantly strengthen the case for the flying-focus wakefield as a strategy for mitigating dephasing in laser-wakefield acceleration.</description>
