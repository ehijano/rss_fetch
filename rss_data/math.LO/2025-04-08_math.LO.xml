      <title>A 2-Categorical Bridge Between Henkin Constructions and Lawvere's Fixed-Point Theorem: Unifying Completeness and Compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified categorical framework that connects the syntactic Henkin construction for the first-order Completeness Theorem with Lawvere's Fixed-Point Theorem. Concretely, we define two canonical functors from the category of first-order theories to the category of their models, and then introduce a canonical natural transformation that links the Henkin-based term models to semantically constructed models arising from compactness or saturation arguments. We prove that every component of this natural transformation is an isomorphism, thereby establishing a strong equivalence between the syntactic and semantic perspectives. Furthermore, we show that this transformation is 2-categorically rigid: any other natural transformation in the same setting is uniquely isomorphic to it. Our framework highlights the shared diagonalization principle underlying both Henkin's and Lawvere's methods and demonstrates concrete applications in automated theorem proving, formal verification, and the design of advanced type-theoretic systems.</description>

      <title>Tarskian Theories of Krivine's Classical Realisability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a formal theory of Krivine's classical realisability interpretation for first-order Peano arithmetic ($\mathsf{PA}$). To formulate the theory as an extension of $\mathsf{PA}$, we first modify Krivine's original definition to the form of number realisability, similar to Kleene's intuitionistic realisability for Heyting arithmetic. By axiomatising our realisability with additional predicate symbols, we obtain a first-order theory $\mathsf{CR}$ which can formally realise every theorem of $\mathsf{PA}$. Although $\mathsf{CR}$ itself is conservative over $\mathsf{PA}$, adding a type of reflection principle that roughly states that ``realisability implies truth'' results in $\mathsf{CR}$ being essentially equivalent to the Tarskian theory $\mathsf{CT}$ of typed compositional truth, which is known to be proof-theoretically stronger than $\mathsf{PA}$. Thus, $\mathsf{CT}$ can be considered a formal theory of classical realisability. We also prove that a weaker reflection principle which preserves the distinction between realisability and truth is sufficient for $\mathsf{CR}$ to achieve the same strength as $\mathsf{CT}$. Furthermore, we formulate transfinite iterations of $\mathsf{CR}$ and its variants, and then we determine their proof-theoretic strength.</description>

      <title>Fractal Origin of the Continuum: A Hypothesis on Process-Relative Definability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new constructive model of the real continuum based on the notion of fractal definability. Rather than assuming the continuum as a completed uncountable totality, we view it as the cumulative result of a vast space of stratified formal systems, each defining a countable layer of real numbers via constructive means. The union of all such definable layers across all admissible chains yields a set of continuum cardinality, yet no single system or definability path suffices to capture it in full.
  This leads to the Fractal Origin Hypothesis: the apparent uncountability of the real line arises not from actual infinity, but from the meta-theoretical continuity of definability itself. Our framework models the continuum as a process-relative totality, grounded in syntax and layered formal growth. We develop this idea through a formal analysis of definability hierarchies and show that the resulting universe of constructible reals is countable-by-construction (that is, each element is definable within some finite syntactic system, but no single procedure enumerates all of them uniformly) yet inaccessible to any uniform enumeration. The continuum, in this view, is not a static set but a stratified semantic horizon.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Abelian Varieties via Model Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2012, Zilber used model-theoretic techniques to show that a curve of high genus over an algebraically closed field is determined by its Jacobian (viewed only as an abstract group with a distinguished subset for an image of the curve). In this paper, we consider an analogous problem for arbitrary (semi)abelian varieties $A$ over algebraically closed fields $K$ with a distinguished subvariety $V$. Our main result characterizes when the data $(A(K),+,V(K))$ (as a group with distinguished subset) determines the pair $(A,V)$ in the strongest reasonable sense.
  As it turns out, the situation is best understood by developing a theory of factorizations for such pairs $(A,V)$. In the final sections of the paper, we develop such a theory and prove unique factorization theorems (one for abelian varieties and a weaker one for semi-abelian varieties). In this language, the main theorem mentioned above (in the abelian case) says that the pair $(A,V)$ is determined by the data $(A(K),+,V(K))$ precisely when $(A,V)$ is simple and $0&lt;\dim(V)&lt;\dim(A)$.</description>

      <title>On the Nature of Fractal Numbers and the Classical Continuum Hypothesis (CH)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a reinterpretation of the continuum grounded in the stratified structure of definability rather than classical cardinality. In this framework, a real number is not an abstract point on the number line, but an object expressible at some level Fn of a formal hierarchy. We introduce the notion of "fractal numbers" -- entities defined not within a fixed set-theoretic universe, but through layered expressibility across constructive systems. This reconceptualizes irrationality as a relative property, depending on definability depth, and replaces the binary dichotomy between countable and uncountable sets with a gradated spectrum of definability classes. We show that the classical Continuum Hypothesis loses its force in this context: between aleph_0 and c lies not a single cardinal jump, but a stratified sequence of definitional stages, each forming a countable yet irreducible approximation to the continuum. We argue that the real line should not be seen as a completed totality but as an evolving architecture of formal expressibility. We conclude with a discussion of rational invariants, the relativity of irrationality, and the emergence of a fractal metric for definitional density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the join-semilattice of constructibility real degrees in the side-by-side Sacks model, the model of set theory obtained by forcing with a countable-support product of infinitely many Sacks forcings over the constructible universe. In particular, we prove that in the side-by-side Sacks model the join-semilattice of constructibility real degrees is rigid, i.e. it does not have non-trivial automorphisms.</description>

      <title>On the Hausdorff dimension of maximal chains and antichains of Turing and Hyperarithmetic degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Hausdorff dimension properties of chains and antichains in Turing degrees and hyperarithmetic degrees. Our main contributions are threefold: First, for antichains in hyperarithmetic degrees, we prove that every maximal antichain necessarily attains Hausdorff dimension 1. Second, regarding chains in Turing degrees, we establish the existence of a maximal chain with Hausdorff dimension 0. Furthermore, under the assumption that $\omega_1=(\omega_1)^L$, we demonstrate the existence of such maximal chains with $\Pi^1_1$ complexity. Third, we extend our investigation to maximal antichains of Turing degrees by analyzing both the packing dimension and effective Hausdorff dimension.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence Checking Problem for Deterministic Top-Down Tree Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient algorithm for checking language equivalence of states in top-down deterministic finite tree automata (DFTAs). Unlike string automata, tree automata operate over hierarchical structures, posing unique challenges for algorithmic analysis. Our approach reduces the equivalence checking problem to that of checking the solvability of a system of language-theoretic equations, which specify the behavior of a DFTA. By constructing such a system of equations and systematically manipulating with it through substitution and conflict detection rules, we develop a decision procedure that determines whether two states accept the same tree language. We formally prove the correctness and termination of the algorithm and establish its worst-case time complexity as $O(n^2)$ under the RAM (Random Access Machine) model of computation augmented with pointers.</description>

Abstract: We survey results on the formalization and independence of mathematical statements related to major open problems in computational complexity theory. Our primary focus is on recent findings concerning the (un)provability of complexity bounds within theories of bounded arithmetic. This includes the techniques employed and related open problems, such as the (non)existence of a feasible proof that P = NP.</description>

      <title>Wild generalised truncation of infinite matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For ${n \in \mathbb{N}}$, the $n$-truncation of a matroid $M$ of rank at least $n$ is the matroid whose bases are the $n$-element independent sets of $M$. One can extend this definition to negative integers by letting the $(-n)$-truncation be the matroid whose bases are all the sets that can be obtained by deleting $n$ elements of a base of $M$. If $M$ has infinite rank, then for distinct ${m,n \in \mathbb{Z}}$ the $m$-truncation and the $n$-truncation are distinct matroids.
  Inspired by the work of Bowler and Geschke on infinite uniform matroids, we provide a natural definition of generalised truncations that encompasses the notions mentioned above. We call a generalised truncation wild if it is not an $n$-truncation for any ${n \in \mathbb{Z}}$ and we prove that, under Martin's Axiom, any finitary matroid of infinite rank and size of less than continuum admits ${2^{2^{\aleph_0}}}$ wild generalised truncations.</description>

      <title>Definable convolution and idempotent Keisler measures III. Generic stability, generic transitivity, and revised Newelski's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study idempotent measures and the structure of the convolution semigroups of measures over definable groups. We isolate the property of generic transitivity and demonstrate that it is sufficient (and necessary) to develop stable group theory localizing on a generically stable type, including invariant stratified ranks and connected components. We establish generic transitivity of generically stable idempotent types in important new cases, including abelian groups in arbitrary theories and arbitrary groups in rosy theories, and characterize them as generics of connected type-definable subgroups. Using tools from Keisler's randomization theory, we generalize some of these results from types to generically stable Keisler measures, and classify idempotent generically stable measures in abelian groups as (unique) translation-invariant measures on type-definable fsg subgroups. This provides a partial definable counterpart to the classical work of Rudin, Cohen and Pym for locally compact topological groups. Finally, we provide an explicit construction of a minimal left ideal in the convolution semigroup of measures for an arbitrary countable NIP group, from a minimal left ideal in the corresponding semigroup on types and a canonical measure constructed on its ideal subgroup. In order to achieve it, we in particular prove the revised Ellis group conjecture of Newelski for countable NIP groups.</description>
