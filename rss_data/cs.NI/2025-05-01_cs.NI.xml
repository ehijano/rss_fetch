      <title>Green Satellite Networks Using Segment Routing and Software-Defined Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of network performance in software defined networking (SDN)-based low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks, focusing on the Telesat Lightspeed constellation. We propose a green traffic engineering (TE) approach leveraging segment routing IPv6 (SRv6) to enhance energy efficiency. Through simulations, we analyze the impact of SRv6, multi-protocol label switching (MPLS), IPv4, and IPv6 with open shortest path first (OSPF) on key network performance metrics, including peak and average CPU usage, memory consumption, packet delivery rate (PDR), and packet overhead under varying traffic loads. Results show that the proposed green TE approach using SRv6 achieves notable energy efficiency, maintaining lower CPU usage and high PDR compared to traditional protocols. While SRv6 and MPLS introduce slightly higher memory usage and overhead due to their advanced configurations, these trade-offs remain manageable. Our findings highlight SRv6 with green TE as a promising solution for optimizing energy efficiency in LEO satellite networks, contributing to the development of more sustainable and efficient satellite communications.</description>

      <title>Covert Prompt Transmission for Secure Large Language Model Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates covert prompt transmission for secure and efficient large language model (LLM) services over wireless networks. We formulate a latency minimization problem under fidelity and detectability constraints to ensure confidential and covert communication by jointly optimizing the transmit power and prompt compression ratio. To solve this problem, we first propose a prompt compression and encryption (PCAE) framework, performing surprisal-guided compression followed by lightweight permutation-based encryption. Specifically, PCAE employs a locally deployed small language model (SLM) to estimate token-level surprisal scores, selectively retaining semantically critical tokens while discarding redundant ones. This significantly reduces computational overhead and transmission duration. To further enhance covert wireless transmission, we then develop a group-based proximal policy optimization (GPPO) method that samples multiple candidate actions for each state, selecting the optimal one within each group and incorporating a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to improve policy stability and exploration. Simulation results show that PCAE achieves comparable LLM response fidelity to baseline methods while reducing preprocessing latency by over five orders of magnitude, enabling real-time edge deployment. We further validate PCAE effectiveness across diverse LLM backbones, including DeepSeek-32B, Qwen-32B, and their smaller variants. Moreover, GPPO reduces covert transmission latency by up to 38.6\% compared to existing reinforcement learning strategies, with further analysis showing that increased transmit power provides additional latency benefits.</description>

      <title>A Unified QoS-Aware Multiplexing Framework for Next Generation Immersive Communication with Legacy Wireless Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Immersive communication, including emerging augmented reality, virtual reality, and holographic telepresence, has been identified as a key service for enabling next-generation wireless applications. To align with legacy wireless applications, such as enhanced mobile broadband or ultra-reliable low-latency communication, network slicing has been widely adopted. However, attempting to statistically isolate the above types of wireless applications through different network slices may lead to throughput degradation and increased queue backlog. To address these challenges, we establish a unified QoS-aware framework that supports immersive communication and legacy wireless applications simultaneously. Based on the Lyapunov drift theorem, we transform the original long-term throughput maximization problem into an equivalent short-term throughput maximization weighted by virtual queue length. Moreover, to cope with the challenges introduced by the interaction between large-timescale network slicing and short-timescale resource allocation, we propose an adaptive adversarial slicing (Ad2S) scheme for networks with invarying channel statistics. To track the network channel variations, we also propose a measurement extrapolation-Kalman filter (ME-KF)-based method and refine our scheme into Ad2S-non-stationary refinement (Ad2S-NR). Through extended numerical examples, we demonstrate that our proposed schemes achieve 3.86 Mbps throughput improvement and 63.96\% latency reduction with 24.36\% convergence time reduction. Within our framework, the trade-off between total throughput and user service experience can be achieved by tuning systematic parameters.</description>

      <title>Online Experimental Design for Network Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to efficiently perform network tomography is a fundamental problem in network management and monitoring. A network tomography task usually consists of applying multiple probing experiments, e.g., across different paths or via different casts (including unicast and multicast). We study how to optimize the network tomography process through online sequential decision-making. From the methodology perspective, we introduce an online probe allocation algorithm that dynamically performs network tomography based on the principles of optimal experimental design and the maximum likelihood estimation. We rigorously analyze the regret of the algorithm under the conditions that i) the optimal allocation is Lipschitz continuous in the parameters being estimated and ii) the parameter estimators satisfy a concentration property. From the application perspective, we present two case studies: a) the classical lossy packet-switched network and b) the quantum bit-flip network. We show that both cases fulfill the two theoretical conditions and provide their corresponding regrets when deploying our proposed online probe allocation algorithm. Besides these two case studies with theoretical guarantees, we also conduct simulations to compare our proposed algorithm with existing methods and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in a broader range of scenarios.</description>

      <title>FreeBeacon: Efficient Communication and Data Aggregation in Battery-Free IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To improve sustainability, Internet-of-Things (IoT) is increasingly adopting battery-free devices powered by ambient energy scavenged from the environment. The unpredictable availability of ambient energy leads to device intermittency, bringing critical challenges to device communication and related fundamental operations like data aggregation.
  We propose FreeBeacon, a novel scheme for efficient communication and data aggregation in battery-free IoT. We argue that the communication challenge between battery-free devices originates from the complete uncertainty of the environment. FreeBeacon is built on the insight that by introducing just a small degree of certainty into the system, the communication problem can be largely simplified. To this end, FreeBeacon first introduces a small number of battery-powered devices as beacons for battery-free devices. Then, FreeBeacon features protocols for battery-free devices to achieve interaction with the beacon and to perform communication efficiently following customized schedules that implement different data aggregation schemes while achieving resilience. We evaluate FreeBeacon with extensive prototype-based experiments and simulation studies. Results show that FreeBeacon can consistently achieve an order of magnitude data aggregation efficiency when compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Toward Realization of Low-Altitude Economy Networks: Core Architecture, Integrated Technologies, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of the low-altitude economy (LAE) is propelling urban development and emerging industries by integrating advanced technologies to enhance efficiency, safety, and sustainability in low-altitude operations. The widespread adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft plays a crucial role in enabling key applications within LAE, such as urban logistics, emergency rescue, and aerial mobility. However, unlike traditional UAV networks, LAE networks encounter increased airspace management demands due to dense flying nodes and potential interference with ground communication systems. In addition, there are heightened and extended security risks in real-time operations, particularly the vulnerability of low-altitude aircraft to cyberattacks from ground-based threats. To address these, this paper first explores related standards and core architecture that support the development of LAE networks. Subsequently, we highlight the integration of technologies such as communication, sensing, computing, positioning, navigation, surveillance, flight control, and airspace management. This synergy of multi-technology drives the advancement of real-world LAE applications, particularly in improving operational efficiency, optimizing airspace usage, and ensuring safety. Finally, we outline future research directions for LAE networks, such as intelligent and adaptive optimization, security and privacy protection, sustainable energy and power management, quantum-driven coordination, generative governance, and three-dimensional (3D) airspace coverage, which collectively underscore the potential of collaborative technologies to advance LAE networks.</description>

      <title>DBSCAN-based Vehicle Clustering and UAV Placement for NOMA-based Resource Management in Cellular V2X Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the future wireless networks, terrestrial, aerial, space, and maritime wireless networks are integrated into a unified network to meet the needs of a fully connected global network. Nowadays, vehicular communication has become one of the challenging applications of wireless networks. In this article, we aim to address the radio resource management in Cellular V2X (C-V2X) networks using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The goal of this problem is to maximize the spectral efficiency of vehicular users in Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) networks under a fronthaul constraint. To solve this problem, a two-stage approach is utilized. In the first stage, vehicles in dense area are clustered based on their geographical locations, predicted location of vehicles, and speeds. Then UAVs are deployed to serve the clusters. In the second stage, NOMA groups are formed within each cluster and radio resources are allocated to vehicles based on NOMA groups. An optimization problem is formulated and a suboptimal method is used to solve it. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through simulations where results demonstrate superiority of proposed method in spectral efficiency, min point, and distance.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Biased Backpressure Routing and Scheduling to Wireless Multi-hop Networks with Advanced Air-interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backpressure (BP) routing and scheduling is a well-established resource allocation method for wireless multi-hop networks, known for its fully distributed operations and proven maximum queue stability. Recent advances in shortest path-biased BP routing (SP-BP) mitigate shortcomings such as slow startup and random walk, but exclusive link-level commodity selection still suffers from the last-packet problem and bandwidth underutilization. Moreover, classic BP routing implicitly assumes single-input-single-output (SISO) transceivers, which can lead to the same packets being scheduled on multiple outgoing links for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) transceivers, causing detouring and looping in MIMO networks. In this paper, we revisit the foundational Lyapunov drift theory underlying BP routing and demonstrate that exclusive commodity selection is unnecessary, and instead propose a Max-Utility link-sharing method. Additionally, we generalize MaxWeight scheduling to MIMO networks by introducing attributed capacity hypergraphs (ACH), an extension of traditional conflict graphs for SISO networks, and by incorporating backlog reassignment into scheduling iterations to prevent redundant packet routing. Numerical evaluations show that our approach substantially mitigates the last-packet problem in state-of-the-art (SOTA) SP-BP under lightweight traffic, and slightly expands the network capacity region for heavier traffic.</description>

      <title>Low latency FPGA implementation of twisted Edward curve cryptography hardware accelerator over prime field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of any elliptic curve cryptography hardware accelerator significantly relies on the efficiency of the underlying point multiplication (PM) architecture. This article presents a hardware implementation of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) based modular arithmetic, group operation, and point multiplication unit on the twisted Edwards curve (Edwards25519) over the 256-bit prime field. An original hardware architecture of a unified point operation module in projective coordinates that executes point addition and point doubling within a single module has been developed, taking only 646 clock cycles and ensuring a better security level than conventional approaches. The proposed point multiplication module consumes 1.4 ms time, operating at a maximal clock frequency of 117.8 MHz utilising 164,730 clock cycles having 183.38 kbps throughput on the Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA platform for 256-bit length of key. The comparative assessment of latency and throughput across various related recent works indicates the effectiveness of our proposed PM architecture. Finally, this high throughput and low latency PM architecture will be a good candidate for rapid data encryption in high-speed wireless communication networks.</description>

      <title>Generative QoE Modeling: A Lightweight Approach for Telecom Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quality of Experience (QoE) prediction plays a crucial role in optimizing resource management and enhancing user satisfaction across both telecommunication and OTT services. While recent advances predominantly rely on deep learning models, this study introduces a lightweight generative modeling framework that balances computational efficiency, interpretability, and predictive accuracy. By validating the use of Vector Quantization (VQ) as a preprocessing technique, continuous network features are effectively transformed into discrete categorical symbols, enabling integration with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for temporal sequence modeling. This VQ-HMM pipeline enhances the model's capacity to capture dynamic QoE patterns while supporting probabilistic inference on new and unseen data. Experimental results on publicly available time-series datasets incorporating both objective indicators and subjective QoE scores demonstrate the viability of this approach in real-time and resource-constrained environments, where inference latency is also critical. The framework offers a scalable alternative to complex deep learning methods, particularly in scenarios with limited computational resources or where latency constraints are critical.</description>

      <title>R-ACP: Real-Time Adaptive Collaborative Perception Leveraging Robust Task-Oriented Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04168v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances sensing in multirobot and vehicular networks by fusing information from multiple agents, improving perception accuracy and sensing range. However, mobility and non-rigid sensor mounts introduce extrinsic calibration errors, necessitating online calibration, further complicated by limited overlap in sensing regions. Moreover, maintaining fresh information is crucial for timely and accurate sensing. To address calibration errors and ensure timely and accurate perception, we propose a robust task-oriented communication strategy to optimize online self-calibration and efficient feature sharing for Real-time Adaptive Collaborative Perception (R-ACP). Specifically, we first formulate an Age of Perceived Targets (AoPT) minimization problem to capture data timeliness of multi-view streaming. Then, in the calibration phase, we introduce a channel-aware self-calibration technique based on reidentification (Re-ID), which adaptively compresses key features according to channel capacities, effectively addressing calibration issues via spatial and temporal cross-camera correlations. In the streaming phase, we tackle the trade-off between bandwidth and inference accuracy by leveraging an Information Bottleneck (IB) based encoding method to adjust video compression rates based on task relevance, thereby reducing communication overhead and latency. Finally, we design a priority-aware network to filter corrupted features to mitigate performance degradation from packet corruption. Extensive studies demonstrate that our framework outperforms five baselines, improving multiple object detection accuracy (MODA) by 25.49% and reducing communication costs by 51.36% under severely poor channel conditions. Code will be made publicly available: github.com/fangzr/R-ACP.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evaluation of an SDN Controller for Open Optical-circuit-switched Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open optical networks have been considered to be important for cost-effectively building and operating the networks. Recently, the optical-circuit-switches (OCSes) have attracted industry and academia because of their cost efficiency and higher capacity than traditional electrical packet switches (EPSes) and reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexers (ROADMs). Though the open interfaces and control planes for traditional ROADMs and transponders have been defined by several standard-defining organizations (SDOs), those of OCSes have not. Considering that several OCSes have already been installed in production datacenter networks (DCNs) and several OCS products are on the market, bringing the openness and interoperability into the OCS-based networks has become important. Motivated by this fact, this paper investigates a software-defined networking (SDN) controller for open optical-circuit-switched networks. To this end, we identified the use cases of OCSes and derived the controller requirements for supporting them. We then proposed a multi-vendor (MV) OCS controller framework that satisfies the derived requirements; it was designed to quickly and consistently operate fiber paths upon receiving the operation requests. We validated our controller by implementing it and evaluating its performance on actual MV-OCS networks. It satisfied all the requirements, and fiber paths could be configured within 1.0 second by using our controller.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the use of Multipath Transmission Control Protocol (MPTCP) in a single Radio Access Technology (RAT) network. Different from other studies where multiple RATs are explored by the MPTCP, a situation that cannot be always guaranteed, due to lack of coverage for example, in this work we assess and evaluate the capability of MPTCP to operate over a single RAT environment. With a vehicular network as use case, we show how the IEEE 802.11p interface is shared among the multiple logical links created between the On-Board Unit (OBU) and the several Road Side Units (RSUs) in its range, supporting the different MPTCP subflows. The results, obtained through experimentation with real vehicular networking hardware, show that MPTCP allows for seamless handovers, ensuring continuous, stable and efficient communication in highly mobile environments.</description>

Abstract: Designing an operational architecture for the Quantum Internet is challenging in light of both fundamental limits imposed by physics laws and technological constraints. Here, we propose a method to abstract away most of the quantum-specific elements and formulate a best-effort quantum network architecture based on packet switching, akin to that of the classical Internet. This reframing provides an opportunity to exploit the many available and well-understood protocols within the Internet context. As an illustration, we tailor and adapt classical congestion control and active queue management protocols to quantum networks, employing an architecture wherein quantum end and intermediate nodes effectively regulate demand and resource utilization, respectively. Results show that these classical networking tools can be effective in managing quantum memory decoherence and maintaining end-to-end fidelity around a target value.</description>
