      <title>Polarization and dynamic phases of aligning active matter in periodic obstacle arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically examine a system of monodisperse self-propelled particles interacting with each other via simple steric forces and aligning torques moving through a periodic array of obstacles. Without obstacles, this system shows a transition to a polarized or aligned state for critical alignment parameters. In the presence of obstacles, there is still a polarization transition, but for dense enough arrays, the polarization is locked to the symmetry directions of the substrate. When the obstacle array is made anisotropic, at low densities the particles can form a quasi-isotropic state where the system can be polarized in any of the dominant symmetry directions. For intermediate anisotropy, the particles self-organize into a coherent lane state with one-dimensional polarization. In this phase, a small number of highly packed lanes are adjacent to less dense lanes that have the same polarization, but lanes further away can have the opposite polarization, so that global polarization is lost. For the highest anisotropy, hopping between lanes is suppressed, and the system forms uniformly dense uncoupled but polarized lanes.</description>

      <title>Repulsion and attraction in the interactions of opposite membrane deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lipid membrane deformations have been predicted to lead to indirect forces between the objects that induce these deformations. Recent experimental measurements have found an attractive interaction between spherical particles that all induce a deformation towards the inside of a giant unilamellar vesicle. Here, we complement these experimental observations by investigating the interactions between deformations pointing in opposite directions with respect to the membrane normal vector. This is experimentally realized by a particle deforming the membrane towards the inside of the GUV and pulling a membrane tube towards the outside of the membrane. Particles completely wrapped by the membrane are repelled from the tube with a strength of 3~k$_B$T at a distance of 0.5~$\mu$m. However, particles that strongly curve the membrane by adhering only to a patch of about 50~\% of its surface area are attracted to the center of the tube with a strength of -5.3~k$_B$T at a minimum distance of about 1~$\mu$m. We find that such Janus particles also experience attractive interactions when both deforming the membrane in the same way. These quantitative experimental observations provide new insights into interactions between oppositely membrane deforming objects, important for cooperative protein assembly at or interactions of microplastics with cell membranes.</description>

      <title>Electrical contact with dielectric breakdown of interfacial gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical contact is fundamental to almost every aspect of modern industry, including the fast-growing electric vehicle industry. In metallic contacts in atmospheric conditions, most of the electrical current passes via the micro-junctions formed between two electrodes. The classic electrical contact theory predicts an infinite current density at the circular contact periphery. In the present work, we explore the influence of the dielectric breakdown of air outside the contact area on the electrical contact interface. Incorporating the discharging boundary condition governed by the modified Paschen law, we develop the numerical model as well as two sets of closed-form solutions for low applied voltage cases where two electrodes are in solid-solid contact and complete separation, respectively. For Hertzian contact, the present work theoretically proves that the ignorance of discharge can lead to a singular current density at the contact periphery and an overestimation of the electrical contact resistance. The current density monotonically increases along the radial direction to a finite value at the contact area periphery, followed by a monotonic drop within the discharge zone. The present study serves as a foundation for the modeling of discharging rough surface electrical contact and sheds light on the machine element surface damages caused by the electrical discharge machining.</description>

      <title>Rubber-to-glass adhesion between a rigid sphere and a shape memory polymer substrate of finite thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are emerging as innovative smart adhesive materials with broad application potential. Compared to conventional elastomeric adhesives, SMP adhesives are distinguished by the so-called rubber-to-glass (R2G) adhesion, which involves contact in the rubbery state followed by detachment in the glassy state. This process, through a shape-locking effect, enhances adhesion strength by more than an order of magnitude compared to conventional adhesive contact. Here, we investigate the fundamental problem of a rigid sphere undergoing R2G adhesion with an SMP substrate of finite thickness through experiments, finite element (FE) simulations, and theoretical modeling. It is demonstrated that during press-in, the contact problem can be modeled as a rigid oblate spheroid contacting an infinite substrate, while the pull-off process can be described by a modified ball-and-socket model. These equivalent models yield practically useful analytical solutions for the contact radius during press-in and the R2G adhesion force during pull-off. A critical thickness-to-contact-radius ratio of around 5 is identified, below which the thickness effect becomes significant. These insights provide valuable guidance for the design and application of SMP-based smart adhesives.</description>

      <title>Suppression of hyperuniformity in hydrodynamic scalar active field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coarsening dynamics at late times in phase-separating systems lead to universally hyperuniform patterns. This is well known for scalar field theories, such as the Cahn-Hilliard equation, but has also been shown for dry scalar active field theories. We demonstrate the role of hydrodynamic interactions in influencing hyperuniformity in a wet active system described by active model H. Our direct numerical simulations reveal that, while (passive) model H shows hyperuniformity in the coarsening regime, the interplay of activity and hydrodynamic interactions suppresses hyperuniformity in active model H, especially when the activity generates contractile stress in the fluid.</description>

      <title>Emulsion Electrocoalescence in microfluidics: impact of local electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanism of coalescence of aqueous droplet pairs under an electric field is quantitatively studied using microfluidics in quiescent conditions. We experimentally trap droplet pairs and apply electric fields with varying frequencies and formulation compositions. We find that the electrical resistance of the oil used as continuous phase controls the onset of electrocoalescence in quiescent conditions. We observe that the local field enhancement between droplets strongly depends on formulations but also on the number of droplets across the electrodes. These findings provide a better understanding of the onset of electrocoalescence and pave a route towards the rationalization of droplet-based microfluidics operations.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium coexistence between a fluid and a hotter or colder crystal of granular hard disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium phase coexistence is commonly observed in both biological and artificial systems, yet understanding it remains a significant challenge. Unlike equilibrium systems, where free energy provides a unifying framework, the absence of such a quantity in non-equilibrium settings complicates their theoretical understanding. Granular materials, driven out of equilibrium by energy dissipation during collisions, serve as an ideal platform to investigate these systems, offering insights into the parallels and distinctions between equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase behavior. For example, the coexisting dense phase is typically colder than the dilute phase, a result usually attributed to greater dissipation in denser regions. In this article, we demonstrate that this is not always the case. Using a simple numerical granular model, we show that a hot solid and a cold liquid can coexist in granular systems. This counterintuitive phenomenon arises because the collision frequency can be lower in the solid phase than in the liquid phase, consistent with equilibrium results for hard-disk systems. We further demonstrate that kinetic theory can be extended to accurately predict phase temperatures even at very high packing fractions, including within the solid phase.
  Our results highlight the importance of collisional dynamics and energy exchange in determining phase behavior in granular materials, offering new insights into non-equilibrium phase coexistence and the complex physics underlying granular systems.</description>

      <title>Initial Stages of Rejuvenation of Vapor-Deposited Glasses during Isothermal Annealing: Contrast Between Experiment and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical vapor deposition can prepare organic glasses with high kinetic stability. When heated, these glassy solids slowly transform into the supercooled liquid in a process known as rejuvenation. In this study, we anneal vapor-deposited glasses of methyl-m-toluate (MMT) for six hours at 0.98Tg to observe rejuvenation using dielectric spectroscopy. Glasses of moderate stability exhibited partial or full rejuvenation in six hours. For highly stable glasses, prepared at substrate temperatures of 0.85Tg and 0.80Tg, the six-hour annealing time is ~2% of the estimated transformation time, and no change in the onset temperature for the {\alpha} relaxation process was observed, as expected. Surprisingly, for these highly stable glasses, annealing resulted in significant increases in the storage component of the dielectric susceptibility, without corresponding increases in the loss component. These changes are interpreted to indicate that short-term annealing rejuvenates a high frequency relaxation (e.g., the boson peak) within the stable glass. We compare these results to computer simulations of the rejuvenation of highly stable glasses generated by the swap Monte Carlo algorithm. The in silico glasses, in contrast to the experiment, show no evidence of rejuvenation within the stable glass at times shorter than the alpha relaxation process.</description>

      <title>Cyclic phase transition of substrate-modulated 2D dusty plasma driven by oscillatory forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Langevin dynamical simulations are performed to investigate the formation of clusters and voids of a two-dimensional-periodic-substrate (2DPS) modulated two-dimensional dusty plasma (2DDP) driven by an oscillatory force. It is discovered that, as the frequency of the oscillatory force decreases gradually, the substrate-modulated 2DDP undergoes the cyclic transition of the ordered cluster and void phases. Between the observed ordered cluster and void phases, the studied 2DDP exhibits a more uniform arrangement of particles. The discovered cyclic transition is attributed to the symmetry of the time-averaged potential landscape due to the 2DPS in the reference frame of the moving particle, as confirmed by superimposing the particle locations on the effective potential landscape under various conditions.</description>

      <title>A Mechanical Route for Cooperative Transport in Autonomous Robotic Swarms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperative transport is a striking phenomenon where multiple agents join forces to transit a payload too heavy for the individual. While social animals such as ants are routinely observed to coordinate transport at scale, reproducing the effect in artificial swarms remains challenging, as it requires synchronization in a noisy many-body system. Here we show that cooperative transport spontaneously emerges in swarms of stochastic self-propelled robots. Robots deprived of sensing and communication, are isotropically initialized around a passive circular payload, where directional motion is not expected without an external cue. And yet it moves. We find that a minute modification to the mechanical design of the individual agent dramatically changes its alignment response to an external force. We then show experimentally that by controlling the individual's friction and mass distribution, a swarm of active particles autonomously cooperates in the directional transport of larger objects. Surprisingly, transport increases with increasing payload size, and its persistence surpasses the persistence of the active particles by over an order of magnitude. A mechanical, coarse-grained description reveals that force-alignment is intrinsic and captured by a signed, charge-like parameter with units of curvature. Numerical simulations of swarms of active particles with a negative active charge corroborate the experimental findings. We analytically derive a geometrical criterion for cooperative transport which results from a bifurcation in a non-linear dynamical system. Our findings generalize existing models of active particles, offer new design rules for distributed robotic systems, and shed light on cooperation in natural swarms.</description>

      <title>Analytical model for the motion and interaction of two-dimensional active nematic defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an approximate, analytical model for the velocity of defects in active nematics by combining recent results for the velocity of topological defects in nematic liquid crystals with the flow field generated from individual defects in active nematics. Importantly, our model takes into account the long-range interactions between defects that result from the flows they produce as well as the orientational coupling between defects inherent in nematics. Our work complements previous studies of active nematic defect motion by introducing a linear approximation that allows us to treat defect interactions as two-body interactions and incorporates the hydrodynamic screening length as a tuning parameter. We show that the model can analytically predict bound states between two $+1/2$ winding number defects, effective attraction between two $-1/2$ defects, and the scaling of a critical unbinding length between $\pm 1/2$ defects with activity. The model also gives predictions for the trajectories of defects, such as the scattering of $+1/2$ defects by $-1/2$ defects at a critical impact parameter that depends on activity. In the presence of circular confinement, the model predicts a braiding motion for three $+1/2$ defects that was recently seen in experiments, as well as stable and ergodic trajectories for four or more defects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the Golgi apparatus to endosomes, organelles in the endomembrane system exhibit complex and varied morphologies that are often related to their function. Such membrane-bound organelles operate far from equilibrium due to directed fluxes of smaller trafficking vesicles; the physical principles governing the emergence and maintenance of these structures have thus remained elusive. By understanding individual fission and fusion events in terms of active mechano-chemical cycles, we show how such trafficking manifests at the hydrodynamic scale, resulting not only in fluxes of material -- such as membrane area and encapsulated volume -- but also in active stresses that drive momentum transfer between an organelle and its cytosolic environment. Due to the fluid and deformable nature of the bounding membrane, this gives rise to novel physics, coupling nonequilibrium forces to organelle composition, morphology and hydrodynamic flows. We demonstrate how both stable compartment drift and ramified sac-like morphologies, each reminiscent of Golgi-cisternae, emerge naturally from the same underlying nonequilibrium dynamics of fission and fusion.</description>

      <title>Bulk electricity storage in 1-nm water channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When water is confined within walls only a few molecular diameters apart, it displays unique behaviors that differ significantly from bulk water. This confinement reveals fascinating mechanical, thermodynamic, and dielectric anomalies. Nature has effectively used the confinement "trick" to achieve superior functionalities with abundant elements and water, avoiding scarce materials. The challenge, however, is to replicate this principle in scalable artificial device engineering. Here, we introduce the "blue battery", a scalable supercapacitive device utilizing pure water confined in 1-nm clay channels as its sole electrolyte. Made entirely from Earth-abundant materials via scalable nano-engineering, it preserves nearly 100% coulombic efficiency over 60,000 charge-discharge cycles, operates at voltages up to 1.65 V, and delivers competitive power and energy densities. Thus, achieving a high degree of sustainability via just the confinement effect, our concept establishes a versatile blueprint for environmentally neutral technologies, enabling the design of other "blue devices" for micro- to bulk-scale energy storage applications, even in extreme environments like Mars. Our research opens possibilities for environmentally neutral energy solutions inspired by nature.</description>

      <title>Internal motion of soft granular particles under circular shearing: Rate-dependent quaking and its spatial structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tightly packed granular particles under shear often exhibit intriguing intermittencies, specifically, sudden stress drops that we refer to as quaking. To probe the nature of this phenomenon, we prototype a circular shear cell that is capable of imposing a uniform and unlimited shear strain under quasi-static cyclic driving. Spherical PDMS(polydimethylsiloxane) particles, immersed in fluid, are driven in a fixed total volume at a wide range of shear rates, with particle trajectories captured in 3D space via refraction-index-matched fluorescent tomography. Statistics on the magnitude of fluctuating displacements of individual particles shows distinct dependence on the shear rate. Particle motions are smooth at high shear rates. At intermediate shear rates, quaking emerges with clusters of particles exhibiting relatively large displacements. At low shear rates, a cluster can span the entire system. and the cluster exhibits substructures in view of localized particle movements. Overall, we have confirmed that the quaking phenomena in the current setup are consistent with our previous work [Phys. Rev. Lett.,126, 128001 (2021)], and that the dimensionless shear rate that we have proposed is indeed a good parameter for unifying the transitions observed in different experimental geometries.</description>

Abstract: It is now established that glasses feature low-frequency, nonphononic excitations, in addition to phonons that follow Debye's vibrational density of state (VDoS). Extensive computer studies demonstrated that these nonphononic, glassy excitations follow a universal non-Debye VDoS ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)\!\sim\!\omega^4$, at low frequencies $\omega$. Yet, due to intrinsic difficulties in disentangling ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ from the total VDoS ${\cal D}(\omega)$, which is experimentally accessible through various scattering techniques, the $\omega^4$ tail of ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ lacked direct experimental support. We develop a procedure to extract ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ from the measured ${\cal D}(\omega)$, based on recent advances in understanding low-frequency excitations in glasses, and apply it to available datasets for diverse glasses. The resulting analysis shows that the $\omega^4$ tail of the nonphononic vibrational spectra of glasses is nontrivially consistent with a broad range of experimental observations. It also further supports that ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ makes an additive contribution to ${\cal D}(\omega)$.</description>
