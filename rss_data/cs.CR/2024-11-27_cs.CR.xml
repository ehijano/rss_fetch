      <title>SafeLight: Enhancing Security in Optical Convolutional Neural Network Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of deep learning has revolutionized computing hardware, driving innovations to improve computationally expensive multiply-and-accumulate operations in deep neural networks. Among these innovations are integrated silicon-photonic systems that have emerged as energy-efficient platforms capable of achieving light speed computation and communication, positioning optical neural network (ONN) platforms as a transformative technology for accelerating deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the increasing complexity of optical hardware introduces new vulnerabilities, notably the risk of hardware trojan (HT) attacks. Despite the growing interest in ONN platforms, little attention has been given to how HT-induced threats can compromise performance and security. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the impact of such attacks on the performance of CNN models accelerated by ONN accelerators. Specifically, we show how HTs can compromise microring resonators (MRs) in a state-of-the-art non-coherent ONN accelerator and reduce classification accuracy across CNN models by up to 7.49% to 80.46% by just targeting 10% of MRs. We then propose techniques to enhance ONN accelerator robustness against these attacks and show how the best techniques can effectively recover the accuracy drops.</description>

      <title>"Moralized" Multi-Step Jailbreak Prompts: Black-Box Testing of Guardrails in Large Language Models for Verbal Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the application of large language models continues to expand in various fields, it poses higher challenges to the effectiveness of identifying harmful content generation and guardrail mechanisms. This research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of guardrails in the face of multi-step jailbreak prompt-generated verbal attacks, through black-box testing of seemingly ethical prompt simulations. The experimental subjects were selected GPT-4o, Grok-2 Beta, Llama 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. The researcher used the same multi-step prompt to simulate moral attacks by designing a scenario of "enterprise middle managers competing for promotion" and observed the model's response at each step. During the experiment, the guardrails of the above model were all bypassed in this experiment and the content of verbal attacks was generated. The data results show that Claude 3.5 Sonnet performs better than other models in terms of its tendency to identify jailbreak prompts. The researcher hopes to use this to remind developers and future research that guardrails not only inappropriately play the role of content filters, but should also have a preventive function. In order to ensure the objectivity and generalizability of the experiment, the researcher has uploaded the experimental process, black box test code, and enhanced guardrail code to GitHub to promote cooperation in the development community: https://github.com/brucewang123456789/GeniusTrail.git.</description>

      <title>From Exponential to Polynomial Complexity: Efficient Permutation Counting with Subword Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counting distinct permutations with replacement, especially when involving multiple subwords, is a longstanding challenge in combinatorial analysis, with critical applications in cryptography, bioinformatics, and statistical modeling. This paper introduces a novel framework that presents closed-form formulas for calculating distinct permutations with replacement, fundamentally reducing the time complexity from exponential to linear relative to the sequence length for single-subword calculations. We then extend our foundational formula to handle multiple subwords through the development of an additional formula. Unlike traditional methods relying on brute-force enumeration or recursive algorithms, our approach leverages novel combinatorial constructs and advanced mathematical techniques to achieve unprecedented efficiency. This comprehensive advancement in reducing computational complexity not only simplifies permutation counting but also establishes a new benchmark for scalability and versatility. We also demonstrate the practical utility of our formulas through diverse applications, including the simultaneous identification of multiple genetic motifs in DNA sequences and complex pattern analysis in cryptographic systems, using a computer program that runs the proposed formulae.</description>

      <title>LoBAM: LoRA-Based Backdoor Attack on Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model merging is an emerging technique that integrates multiple models fine-tuned on different tasks to create a versatile model that excels in multiple domains. This scheme, in the meantime, may open up backdoor attack opportunities where one single malicious model can jeopardize the integrity of the merged model. Existing works try to demonstrate the risk of such attacks by assuming substantial computational resources, focusing on cases where the attacker can fully fine-tune the pre-trained model. Such an assumption, however, may not be feasible given the increasing size of machine learning models. In practice where resources are limited and the attacker can only employ techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to produce the malicious model, it remains unclear whether the attack can still work and pose threats. In this work, we first identify that the attack efficacy is significantly diminished when using LoRA for fine-tuning. Then, we propose LoBAM, a method that yields high attack success rate with minimal training resources. The key idea of LoBAM is to amplify the malicious weights in an intelligent way that effectively enhances the attack efficacy. We demonstrate that our design can lead to improved attack success rate through both theoretical proof and extensive empirical experiments across various model merging scenarios. Moreover, we show that our method has strong stealthiness and is difficult to detect.</description>

      <title>An investigation into the performances of the Current state-of-the-art Naive Bayes, Non-Bayesian and Deep Learning Based Classifier for Phishing Detection: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phishing is one of the most effective ways in which cybercriminals get sensitive details such as credentials for online banking, digital wallets, state secrets, and many more from potential victims. They do this by spamming users with malicious URLs with the sole purpose of tricking them into divulging sensitive information which is later used for various cybercrimes. In this research, we did a comprehensive review of current state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning phishing detection techniques to expose their vulnerabilities and future research direction. For better analysis and observation, we split machine learning techniques into Bayesian, non-Bayesian, and deep learning. We reviewed the most recent advances in Bayesian and non-Bayesian-based classifiers before exploiting their corresponding weaknesses to indicate future research direction. While exploiting weaknesses in both Bayesian and non-Bayesian classifiers, we also compared each performance with a deep learning classifier. For a proper review of deep learning-based classifiers, we looked at Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs). We did an empirical analysis to evaluate the performance of each classifier along with many of the proposed state-of-the-art anti-phishing techniques to identify future research directions, we also made a series of proposals on how the performance of the under-performing algorithm can improved in addition to a two-stage prediction model</description>

      <title>Hide in Plain Sight: Clean-Label Backdoor for Auditing Membership Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are critical tools for assessing privacy risks and ensuring compliance with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). However, their potential for auditing unauthorized use of data remains under explored. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel clean-label backdoor-based approach for MIAs, designed specifically for robust and stealthy data auditing. Unlike conventional methods that rely on detectable poisoned samples with altered labels, our approach retains natural labels, enhancing stealthiness even at low poisoning rates. Our approach employs an optimal trigger generated by a shadow model that mimics the target model's behavior. This design minimizes the feature-space distance between triggered samples and the source class while preserving the original data labels. The result is a powerful and undetectable auditing mechanism that overcomes limitations of existing approaches, such as label inconsistencies and visual artifacts in poisoned samples. The proposed method enables robust data auditing through black-box access, achieving high attack success rates across diverse datasets and model architectures. Additionally, it addresses challenges related to trigger stealthiness and poisoning durability, establishing itself as a practical and effective solution for data auditing. Comprehensive experiments validate the efficacy and generalizability of our approach, outperforming several baseline methods in both stealth and attack success metrics.</description>

      <title>Blockchain Meets LLMs: A Living Survey on Bidirectional Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain of large language models, considerable advancements have been attained in multimodal large language models and explainability research, propelled by the continuous technological progress and innovation. Nonetheless, security and privacy concerns continue to pose as prominent challenges in this field. The emergence of blockchain technology, marked by its decentralized nature, tamper-proof attributes, distributed storage functionality, and traceability, has provided novel approaches for resolving these issues. Both of these technologies independently hold vast potential for development; yet, their combination uncovers substantial cross-disciplinary opportunities and growth prospects. The current research tendencies are increasingly concentrating on the integration of blockchain with large language models, with the aim of compensating for their respective limitations through this fusion and promoting further technological evolution. In this study, we evaluate the advantages and developmental constraints of the two technologies, and explore the possibility and development potential of their combination. This paper primarily investigates the technical convergence in two directions: Firstly, the application of large language models to blockchain, where we identify six major development directions and explore solutions to the shortcomings of blockchain technology and their application scenarios; Secondly, the application of blockchain technology to large language models, leveraging the characteristics of blockchain to remedy the deficiencies of large language models and exploring its application potential in multiple fields.</description>

      <title>XAI and Android Malware Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Android malware detection based on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models is widely used for mobile device security. Such models offer benefits in terms of detection accuracy and efficiency, but it is often difficult to understand how such learning models make decisions. As a result, these popular malware detection strategies are generally treated as black boxes, which can result in a lack of trust in the decisions made, as well as making adversarial attacks more difficult to detect. The field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) attempts to shed light on such black box models. In this paper, we apply XAI techniques to ML and DL models that have been trained on a challenging Android malware classification problem. Specifically, the classic ML models considered are Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN), while the DL models we consider are Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The state-of-the-art XAI techniques that we apply to these trained models are Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), PDP plots, ELI5, and Class Activation Mapping (CAM). We obtain global and local explanation results, and we discuss the utility of XAI techniques in this problem domain. We also provide a literature review of XAI work related to Android malware.</description>

      <title>EvoChain: a Recovery Approach for Permissioned Blockchain Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain technology supports decentralized, consensus-driven data storage and processing, ensuring integrity and auditability. It is increasingly adopted for use cases with multiple stakeholders with shared ownership scenarios like digital identity and supply chain management. However, real-world deployments face challenges with mistakes and intrusions. This article presents EvoChain, a chaincode framework extension introducing controlled mutability for data redaction and recovery under time-limited or specific conditions. This mechanism allows corrections during a grace period before immutability takes effect. We validated our approach using WineTracker, a Hyperledger Fabric-based supply chain application. It enables some users to cancel unwanted operations while preserving the blockchain security and maintaining data consistency. Performance evaluations showed minimal overhead with functional benefits.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Storage And Self-Sovereign Identity For Document-Based Claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Users increasingly rely on identity providers for accessing online services and resources. However, centralized identity systems often compromise user privacy due to online activity tracking or data breaches. At the same time, many online services require digital copies of physical documents for validation in claims processes, such as providing proof of residence for opening a bank account or verifying medical images for health insurance claims. With centralized solutions, privacy depends entirely on the trusted party, but there are emerging decentralized approaches that offer greater transparency.
  This article introduces SoverClaim, a decentralized application prototype that empowers users to control their identity and also allows them to present digital documents with privacy. SoverClaim leverages Hyperledger Indy, a blockchain for issuing and presenting self-sovereign digital identities with transparent audit logs, and Storj, a decentralized peer-to-peer service, for secure and decentralized document storage and subsequent deletion. The prototype demonstrates the seamless integration of self-sovereign identities and document-based claims, achieving response times of under 750 ms, making it suitable for timely human interactions.</description>

      <title>HOPE: Homomorphic Order-Preserving Encryption for Outsourced Databases -- A Stateless Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Order-preserving encryption (OPE) is a fundamental cryptographic tool for enabling efficient range queries on encrypted data in outsourced databases. Despite its importance, existing OPE schemes face critical limitations that hinder their practicality. Stateful designs require clients to maintain plaintext-to-ciphertext mappings, imposing significant storage and management overhead. Stateless designs often rely on interactive protocols between the client and server, leading to high communication latency and limited scalability. These limitations make existing schemes unsuitable for real-world applications that demand simplicity, efficiency, and scalability.
  In this work, we present Homomorphic OPE (HOPE), a new OPE scheme that eliminates client-side storage and avoids additional client-server interaction during query execution. HOPE leverages the additive property of homomorphic encryption to introduce a novel comparison key mechanism, which transforms ciphertext comparison into a randomized difference computation. This mechanism ensures that only the sign of the comparison is preserved while fully masking the underlying plaintext values, enabling secure and efficient range queries without leaking additional information about the data.
  We provide a formal cryptographic analysis of HOPE, proving its security under the widely accepted IND-OCPA model. Our proofs rigorously demonstrate that the comparison key mechanism reveals no information beyond the order of the plaintexts and ensures resistance to both chosen-plaintext attacks and frequency analysis. To validate the practicality of HOPE, we conduct extensive experiments comparing it with state-of-the-art OPE schemes. The results demonstrate that HOPE achieves competitive query performance while addressing the key limitations of existing designs, making it a scalable and secure solution for outsourced database systems.</description>

      <title>ThreatModeling-LLM: Automating Threat Modeling using Large Language Models for Banking System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Threat modeling is a crucial component of cybersecurity, particularly for industries such as banking, where the security of financial data is paramount. Traditional threat modeling approaches require expert intervention and manual effort, often leading to inefficiencies and human error. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a promising avenue for automating these processes, enhancing both efficiency and efficacy. However, this transition is not straightforward due to three main challenges: (1) the lack of publicly available, domain-specific datasets, (2) the need for tailored models to handle complex banking system architectures, and (3) the requirement for real-time, adaptive mitigation strategies that align with compliance standards like NIST 800-53.
  In this paper, we introduce ThreatModeling-LLM, a novel and adaptable framework that automates threat modeling for banking systems using LLMs. ThreatModeling-LLM operates in three stages: 1) dataset creation, 2) prompt engineering and 3) model fine-tuning. We first generate a benchmark dataset using Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool (TMT). Then, we apply Chain of Thought (CoT) and Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO) on the pre-trained LLMs to optimize the initial prompt. Lastly, we fine-tune the LLM using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) based on the benchmark dataset and the optimized prompt to improve the threat identification and mitigation generation capabilities of pre-trained LLMs.</description>

      <title>LESS: Efficient Log Storage System Based on Learned Model and Minimum Attribute Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, cyber attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and persistent. Detection and investigation based on the provenance graph can effectively mitigate cyber intrusion. However, in the long time span of defenses, the sheer size of the provenance graph will pose significant challenges to the storage systems. Faced with long-term storage tasks, existing methods are unable to simultaneously achieve lossless information, efficient compression, and fast query support. In this paper, we propose a novel provenance graph storage system, LESS, which consumes smaller storage space and supports faster storage and queries compared to current approaches. We innovatively partition the provenance graph into two distinct components, the graph structure and attribute, and store them separately. Based on their respective characteristics, we devise two appropriate storage schemes: the provenance graph structure storage method based on machine learning and the use of the minimal spanning tree to store the graph attributes. Compared with the state-of-the-art approach, LEONARD, LESS reduces 6.29 times in storage time, while also achieving a 5.24 times reduction in disk usage and an 18.3 times faster query speed while using only 11.5% of the memory on DARPA TC dataset.</description>

      <title>E-Trojans: Ransomware, Tracking, DoS, and Data Leaks on Battery-powered Embedded Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery-powered embedded systems (BESs) have become ubiquitous. Their internals include a battery management system (BMS), a radio interface, and a motor controller. Despite their associated risk, there is little research on BES internal attack surfaces. To fill this gap, we present the first security and privacy assessment of e-scooters internals. We cover Xiaomi M365 (2016) and ES3 (2023) e-scooters and their interactions with Mi Home (their companion app).
  We extensively RE their internals and uncover four critical design vulnerabilities, including a remote code execution issue with their BMS. Based on our RE findings, we develop E-Trojans, four novel attacks targeting BES internals. The attacks can be conducted remotely or in wireless proximity. They have a widespread real-world impact as they violate the Xiaomi e-scooter ecosystem safety, security, availability, and privacy. For instance, one attack allows the extortion of money from a victim via a BMS undervoltage battery ransomware. A second one enables user tracking by fingerprinting the BES internals. With extra RE efforts, the attacks can be ported to other BES featuring similar vulnerabilities.
  We implement our attacks and RE findings in E-Trojans, a modular and low-cost toolkit to test BES internals. Our toolkit binary patches BMS firmware by adding malicious capabilities. It also implements our undervoltage battery ransomware in an Android app with a working backend. We successfully test our four attacks on M365 and ES3, empirically confirming their effectiveness and practicality. We propose four practical countermeasures to fix our attacks and improve the Xiaomi e-scooter ecosystem security and privacy.</description>

      <title>A Framework for the Security and Privacy of Biometric System Constructions under Defined Computational Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biometric systems, while offering convenient authentication, often fall short in providing rigorous security assurances. A primary reason is the ad-hoc design of protocols and components, which hinders the establishment of comprehensive security proofs. This paper introduces a formal framework for constructing secure and privacy-preserving biometric systems. By leveraging the principles of universal composability, we enable the modular analysis and verification of individual system components. This approach allows us to derive strong security and privacy properties for the entire system, grounded in well-defined computational assumptions.</description>

      <title>Assessing Vulnerability in Smart Contracts: The Role of Code Complexity Metrics in Security Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Codes with specific characteristics are more exposed to security vulnerabilities. Studies have revealed that codes that do not adhere to best practices are more challenging to verify and maintain, increasing the likelihood of unnoticed or unintentionally introduced vulnerabilities. Given the crucial role of smart contracts in blockchain systems, ensuring their security and conducting thorough vulnerability analysis is critical. This study investigates the use of code complexity metrics as indicators of vulnerable code in Solidity smart contracts. We highlight the significance of complexity metrics as valuable complementary features for vulnerability assessment and provide insights into the individual power of each metric. By analyzing 21 complexity metrics, we explored their interrelation, association with vulnerability, discriminative power, and mean values in vulnerable versus neutral codes. The results revealed some high correlations and potential redundancies among certain metrics, but weak correlations between each independent metric and vulnerability. Nevertheless, we found that all metrics can effectively discriminate between vulnerable and neutral codes, and most complexity metrics, except for three, exhibited higher values in vulnerable codes.</description>

      <title>Support Vector Machine for Person Classification Using the EEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User authentication is a pivotal element in security systems. Conventional methods including passwords, personal identification numbers, and identification tags are increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper suggests a paradigm shift towards biometric identification technology that leverages unique physiological or behavioral characteristics for user authenticity verification. Nevertheless, biometric solutions like fingerprints, iris patterns, facial and voice recognition are also susceptible to forgery and deception. We propose using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for individual identification to address this challenge. Derived from unique brain activities, these signals offer promising authentication potential and provide a novel means for liveness detection, thereby mitigating spoofing attacks. This study employs a public dataset initially compiled for fatigue analysis, featuring EEG data from 12 subjects recorded via an eight-channel OpenBCI helmet. This dataset extracts salient features from the EEG signals and trains a supervised multiclass Support Vector Machine classifier. Upon evaluation, the classifier model achieves a maximum accuracy of 92.9\%, leveraging ten features from each channel. Collectively, these findings highlight the viability of machine learning in implementing real-world, EEG-based biometric identification systems, thereby advancing user authentication technology.</description>

      <title>PEFTGuard: Detecting Backdoor Attacks Against Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning is an essential process to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in specific domains, with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) gaining popularity due to its capacity to reduce computational demands through the integration of low-rank adapters. These lightweight adapters, such as LoRA, can be shared and utilized on open-source platforms. However, adversaries could exploit this mechanism to inject backdoors into these adapters, resulting in malicious behaviors like incorrect or harmful outputs, which pose serious security risks to the community. Unfortunately, few of the current efforts concentrate on analyzing the backdoor patterns or detecting the backdoors in the adapters.
  To fill this gap, we first construct (and will release) PADBench, a comprehensive benchmark that contains 13,300 benign and backdoored adapters fine-tuned with various datasets, attack strategies, PEFT methods, and LLMs. Moreover, we propose PEFTGuard, the first backdoor detection framework against PEFT-based adapters. Extensive evaluation upon PADBench shows that PEFTGuard outperforms existing detection methods, achieving nearly perfect detection accuracy (100%) in most cases. Notably, PEFTGuard exhibits zero-shot transferability on three aspects, including different attacks, PEFT methods, and adapter ranks. In addition, we consider various adaptive attacks to demonstrate the high robustness of PEFTGuard. We further explore several possible backdoor mitigation defenses, finding fine-mixing to be the most effective method. We envision our benchmark and method can shed light on future LLM backdoor detection research.</description>

      <title>AI-Augmented Ethical Hacking: A Practical Examination of Manual Exploitation and Privilege Escalation in Linux Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the application of generative AI (GenAI) within manual exploitation and privilege escalation tasks in Linux-based penetration testing environments, two areas critical to comprehensive cybersecurity assessments. Building on previous research into the role of GenAI in the ethical hacking lifecycle, this paper presents a hands-on experimental analysis conducted in a controlled virtual setup to evaluate the utility of GenAI in supporting these crucial, often manual, tasks. Our findings demonstrate that GenAI can streamline processes, such as identifying potential attack vectors and parsing complex outputs for sensitive data during privilege escalation. The study also identifies key benefits and challenges associated with GenAI, including enhanced efficiency and scalability, alongside ethical concerns related to data privacy, unintended discovery of vulnerabilities, and potential for misuse. This work contributes to the growing field of AI-assisted cybersecurity by emphasising the importance of human-AI collaboration, especially in contexts requiring careful decision-making, rather than the complete replacement of human input.</description>

      <title>RTL-Breaker: Assessing the Security of LLMs against Backdoor Attacks on HDL Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential with code generation/completion tasks for hardware design. In fact, LLM-based hardware description language (HDL) code generation has enabled the industry to realize complex designs more quickly, reducing the time and effort required in the development cycle. However, the increased reliance on such automation introduces critical security risks. Notably, given that LLMs have to be trained on vast datasets of codes that are typically sourced from publicly available repositories (often without thorough validation), LLMs are susceptible to so-called data poisoning or backdoor attacks. Here, attackers inject malicious code for the training data, which can be carried over into the HDL code generated by LLMs. This threat vector can compromise the security and integrity of entire hardware systems. In this work, we propose RTL-Breaker, a novel backdoor attack framework on LLM-based HDL code generation. RTL-Breaker provides an in-depth analysis for essential aspects of this novel problem: 1) various trigger mechanisms versus their effectiveness for inserting malicious modifications, and 2) side-effects by backdoor attacks on code generation in general, i.e., impact on code quality. RTL-Breaker emphasizes the urgent need for more robust measures to safeguard against such attacks. Toward that end, we open-source our framework and all data.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Automated Resilient Cyber Defence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-attacks pose a security threat to military command and control networks, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems, and civilian critical national infrastructure. The use of artificial intelligence and autonomous agents in these attacks increases the scale, range, and complexity of this threat and the subsequent disruption they cause. Autonomous Cyber Defence (ACD) agents aim to mitigate this threat by responding at machine speed and at the scale required to address the problem. Sequential decision-making algorithms such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) provide a promising route to create ACD agents. These algorithms focus on a single objective such as minimizing the intrusion of red agents on the network, by using a handcrafted weighted sum of rewards. This approach removes the ability to adapt the model during inference, and fails to address the many competing objectives present when operating and protecting these networks. Conflicting objectives, such as restoring a machine from a back-up image, must be carefully balanced with the cost of associated down-time, or the disruption to network traffic or services that might result. Instead of pursing a Single-Objective RL (SORL) approach, here we present a simple example of a multi-objective network defence game that requires consideration of both defending the network against red-agents and maintaining critical functionality of green-agents. Two Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms, namely Multi-Objective Proximal Policy Optimization (MOPPO), and Pareto-Conditioned Networks (PCN), are used to create two trained ACD agents whose performance is compared on our Multi-Objective Cyber Defence game. The benefits and limitations of MORL ACD agents in comparison to SORL ACD agents are discussed based on the investigations of this game.</description>

      <title>A robust image encryption scheme based on new 4-D hyperchaotic system and elliptic curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a new 4-D hyperchaotic system for image encryption is proposed and its effectiveness is demonstrated by incorporating it into an existing Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) mapping scheme. The proposed system is considered simple because it consists of eight terms with two nonlinearities. The system exhibits high sensitivity to initial conditions, which makes it suitable for encryption purposes. The two-stage encryption process, involving confusion and diffusion, is employed to protect the confidentiality of digital images. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the hyperchaotic system in terms of security and performance when combined with the ECC mapping scheme. This approach can be applied in various domains including healthcare, military, and entertainment to ensure the robust encryption of digital images.</description>

      <title>RealSeal: Revolutionizing Media Authentication with Real-Time Realism Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing threat of deepfakes and manipulated media necessitates a radical rethinking of media authentication. Existing methods for watermarking synthetic data fall short, as they can be easily removed or altered, and current deepfake detection algorithms do not achieve perfect accuracy. Provenance techniques, which rely on metadata to verify content origin, fail to address the fundamental problem of staged or fake media.
  This paper introduces a groundbreaking paradigm shift in media authentication by advocating for the watermarking of real content at its source, as opposed to watermarking synthetic data. Our innovative approach employs multisensory inputs and machine learning to assess the realism of content in real-time and across different contexts. We propose embedding a robust realism score within the image metadata, fundamentally transforming how images are trusted and circulated. By combining established principles of human reasoning about reality, rooted in firmware and hardware security, with the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of contemporary machine learning systems, we develop a holistic approach that analyzes information from multiple perspectives.
  This ambitious, blue sky approach represents a significant leap forward in the field, pushing the boundaries of media authenticity and trust. By embracing cutting-edge advancements in technology and interdisciplinary research, we aim to establish a new standard for verifying the authenticity of digital media.</description>

      <title>FinML-Chain: A Blockchain-Integrated Dataset for Enhanced Financial Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is critical for innovation and efficiency in financial markets, offering predictive models and data-driven decision-making. However, challenges such as missing data, lack of transparency, untimely updates, insecurity, and incompatible data sources limit its effectiveness. Blockchain technology, with its transparency, immutability, and real-time updates, addresses these challenges. We present a framework for integrating high-frequency on-chain data with low-frequency off-chain data, providing a benchmark for addressing novel research questions in economic mechanism design. This framework generates modular, extensible datasets for analyzing economic mechanisms such as the Transaction Fee Mechanism, enabling multi-modal insights and fairness-driven evaluations. Using four machine learning techniques, including linear regression, deep neural networks, XGBoost, and LSTM models, we demonstrate the framework's ability to produce datasets that advance financial research and improve understanding of blockchain-driven systems. Our contributions include: (1) proposing a research scenario for the Transaction Fee Mechanism and demonstrating how the framework addresses previously unexplored questions in economic mechanism design; (2) providing a benchmark for financial machine learning by open-sourcing a sample dataset generated by the framework and the code for the pipeline, enabling continuous dataset expansion; and (3) promoting reproducibility, transparency, and collaboration by fully open-sourcing the framework and its outputs. This initiative supports researchers in extending our work and developing innovative financial machine-learning models, fostering advancements at the intersection of machine learning, blockchain, and economics.</description>

      <title>In-Context Experience Replay Facilitates Safety Red-Teaming of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have shown remarkable progress, but their potential to generate harmful content remains a critical concern in the ML community. While various safety mechanisms have been developed, the field lacks systematic tools for evaluating their effectiveness against real-world misuse scenarios. In this work, we propose ICER, a novel red-teaming framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and a bandit optimization-based algorithm to generate interpretable and semantic meaningful problematic prompts by learning from past successful red-teaming attempts. Our ICER efficiently probes safety mechanisms across different T2I models without requiring internal access or additional training, making it broadly applicable to deployed systems. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ICER significantly outperforms existing prompt attack methods in identifying model vulnerabilities while maintaining high semantic similarity with intended content. By uncovering that successful jailbreaking instances can systematically facilitate the discovery of new vulnerabilities, our work provides crucial insights for developing more robust safety mechanisms in T2I systems.</description>

      <title>Achieving Privacy Utility Balance for Multivariate Time Series Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utility-preserving data privatization is of utmost importance for data-producing agencies. The popular noise-addition privacy mechanism distorts autocorrelation patterns in time series data, thereby marring utility; in response, McElroy et al. (2023) introduced all-pass filtering (FLIP) as a utility-preserving time series data privatization method. Adapting this concept to multivariate data is more complex, and in this paper we propose a multivariate all-pass (MAP) filtering method, employing an optimization algorithm to achieve the best balance between data utility and privacy protection. To test the effectiveness of our approach, we apply MAP filtering to both simulated and real data, sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau's Quarterly Workforce Indicator (QWI) dataset.</description>

      <title>CleanVul: Automatic Function-Level Vulnerability Detection in Code Commits Using LLM Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate identification of software vulnerabilities is crucial for system integrity. Vulnerability datasets, often derived from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) or directly from GitHub, are essential for training machine learning models to detect these security flaws. However, these datasets frequently suffer from significant noise, typically 40% to 75%, due primarily to the automatic and indiscriminate labeling of all changes in vulnerability-fixing commits (VFCs) as vulnerability-related. This misclassification occurs because not all changes in a commit aimed at fixing vulnerabilities pertain to security threats; many are routine updates like bug fixes or test improvements.
  This paper introduces the first methodology that uses the Large Language Model (LLM) with a heuristic enhancement to automatically identify vulnerability-fixing changes from VFCs, achieving an F1-score of 0.82. VulSifter was applied to a large-scale study, where we conducted a crawl of 127,063 repositories on GitHub, resulting in the acquisition of 5,352,105 commits. VulSifter involves utilizing an LLM to comprehend code semantics and contextual information, while applying heuristics to filter out unrelated changes. We then developed CleanVul, a high-quality dataset comprising 11,632 functions using our LLM heuristic enhancement approach, demonstrating Correctness (90.6%) comparable to established datasets such as SVEN and PrimeVul.
  To evaluate the CleanVul dataset, we conducted experiments focusing on fine-tuning various LLMs on CleanVul and other high-quality datasets. Evaluation results reveal that LLMs fine-tuned on CleanVul not only exhibit enhanced accuracy but also superior generalization capabilities compared to those trained on uncleaned datasets. Specifically, models trained on CleanVul and tested on PrimeVul achieve accuracy higher than those trained and tested exclusively on PrimeVul.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The centralization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses significant challenges, including single points of failure, inherent biases, data privacy concerns, and scalability issues. These problems are especially prevalent in closed-source large language models (LLMs), where user data is collected and used without transparency. To mitigate these issues, blockchain-based decentralized AI (DeAI) has emerged as a promising solution. DeAI combines the strengths of both blockchain and AI technologies to enhance the transparency, security, decentralization, and trustworthiness of AI systems. However, a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art DeAI development, particularly for active industry solutions, is still lacking. In this work, we present a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) for blockchain-based DeAI solutions. We propose a taxonomy to classify existing DeAI protocols based on the model lifecycle. Based on this taxonomy, we provide a structured way to clarify the landscape of DeAI protocols and identify their similarities and differences. We analyze the functionalities of blockchain in DeAI, investigating how blockchain features contribute to enhancing the security, transparency, and trustworthiness of AI processes, while also ensuring fair incentives for AI data and model contributors. In addition, we identify key insights and research gaps in developing DeAI protocols, highlighting several critical avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Learning New Concepts, Remembering the Old: A Novel Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance model interpretability by introducing human-understandable concepts within the architecture. However, existing CBMs assume static datasets, limiting their ability to adapt to real-world, continuously evolving data streams. To address this, we define a novel concept-incremental and class-incremental continual learning task for CBMs, enabling models to accumulate new concepts and classes over time while retaining previously learned knowledge. To achieve this, we propose CONceptual Continual Incremental Learning (CONCIL), a framework that prevents catastrophic forgetting by reformulating concept and decision layer updates as linear regression problems, thus eliminating the need for gradient-based updates. CONCIL requires only recursive matrix operations, making it computationally efficient and suitable for real-time and large-scale data applications. Experimental results demonstrate that CONCIL achieves "absolute knowledge memory" and outperforms traditional CBM methods in concept- and class-incremental settings, establishing a new benchmark for continual learning in CBMs.</description>

      <title>End-to-end QKD network with non-localized trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) systems are infamously known for their high demand on hardware, their extremely low key generation rates and their lack of security resulting from a need for trusted nodes which is implied by the absence of quantum repeaters. While they theoretically offer unlimited security, they are therefore practically limited in several regards. In this work we focus on the lack of options to guarantee an end-to-end security service with the currently available technology and infrastructure and propose a novel protocol. We find that one of the stumbling stones on the path towards an end-to-end security service guaranteed by quantum key distribution may be removed by using this protocol. Our proposal combines several parallel instances of twinfield QKD followed by classical postprocessing and communication to allow Alice and Bob to share a secret key. This hybrid approach improves the key rate and range w.r.t. to previous QKD approaches at a contained cost in security. We show that a coalition of intermediary nodes between Alice and Bob is needed to break the new scheme, sharply outperforming the trusted node approach in terms of security. Furthermore, the protocols do not require complex quantum measurements on Alice and Bob's sides, thus being truly end-to-end.</description>

      <title>LIA: Privacy-Preserving Data Quality Evaluation in Federated Learning Using a Lazy Influence Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.11518v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Federated Learning, it is crucial to handle low-quality, corrupted, or malicious data. However, traditional data valuation methods are not suitable due to privacy concerns. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective approach that utilizes a new influence approximation called "lazy influence" to filter and score data while preserving privacy. To do this, each participant uses their own data to estimate the influence of another participant's batch and sends a differentially private obfuscated score to the central coordinator. Our method has been shown to successfully filter out biased and corrupted data in various simulated and real-world settings, achieving a recall rate of over $&gt;90\%$ (sometimes up to $100\%$) while maintaining strong differential privacy guarantees with $\varepsilon \leq 1$.</description>

      <title>A multi-language toolkit for the semi-automated checking of research outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a free and open source toolkit that supports the semi-automated checking of research outputs (SACRO) for privacy disclosure within secure data environments. SACRO is a framework that applies best-practice principles-based statistical disclosure control (SDC) techniques on-the-fly as researchers conduct their analyses. SACRO is designed to assist human checkers rather than seeking to replace them as with current automated rules-based approaches. The toolkit is composed of a lightweight Python package that sits over well-known analysis tools that produce outputs such as tables, plots, and statistical models. This package adds functionality to (i) automatically identify potentially disclosive outputs against a range of commonly used disclosure tests; (ii) apply optional disclosure mitigation strategies as requested; (iii) report reasons for applying SDC; and (iv) produce simple summary documents trusted research environment staff can use to streamline their workflow and maintain auditable records. This creates an explicit change in the dynamics so that SDC is something done with researchers rather than to them, and enables more efficient communication with checkers. A graphical user interface supports human checkers by displaying the requested output and results of the checks in an immediately accessible format, highlighting identified issues, potential mitigation options, and tracking decisions made. The major analytical programming languages used by researchers (Python, R, and Stata) are supported by providing front-end packages that interface with the core Python back-end.

      <title>Just-in-Time Detection of Silent Security Patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-source code is pervasive. In this setting, embedded vulnerabilities are spreading to downstream software at an alarming rate. While such vulnerabilities are generally identified and addressed rapidly, inconsistent maintenance policies may lead security patches to go unnoticed. Indeed, security patches can be {\em silent}, i.e., they do not always come with comprehensive advisories such as CVEs. This lack of transparency leaves users oblivious to available security updates, providing ample opportunity for attackers to exploit unpatched vulnerabilities. Consequently, identifying silent security patches just in time when they are released is essential for preventing n-day attacks, and for ensuring robust and secure maintenance practices. With LLMDA we propose to (1) leverage large language models (LLMs) to augment patch information with generated code change explanations, (2) design a representation learning approach that explores code-text alignment methodologies for feature combination, (3) implement a label-wise training with labelled instructions for guiding the embedding based on security relevance, and (4) rely on a probabilistic batch contrastive learning mechanism for building a high-precision identifier of security patches. We evaluate LLMDA on the PatchDB and SPI-DB literature datasets and show that our approach substantially improves over the state-of-the-art, notably GraphSPD by 20% in terms of F-Measure on the SPI-DB benchmark.</description>

      <title>Peer2PIR: Private Queries for IPFS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer network for storing data in a distributed file system, hosting over 190,000 peers spanning 152 countries. Despite its prominence, the privacy properties that IPFS offers to peers are severely limited. Any query within the network leaks the queried content to other peers. We address IPFS' privacy leakage across three functionalities (peer routing, provider advertisements, and content retrieval), ultimately empowering peers to privately navigate and retrieve content in the network. Our work highlights and addresses novel challenges inherent to integrating PIR into distributed systems. We present our new, private protocols and demonstrate that they incur reasonably low communication and computation overheads. We also provide a systematic comparison of state-of-art PIR protocols in the context of distributed systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Black-Box Membership Inference Attack for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20771v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the rising popularity of AI-generated art and the associated copyright concerns, identifying whether an artwork was used to train a diffusion model is an important research topic. The work approaches this problem from the membership inference attack (MIA) perspective. We first identify the limitation of applying existing MIA methods for proprietary diffusion models: the required access of internal U-nets. To address the above problem, we introduce a novel membership inference attack method that uses only the image-to-image variation API and operates without access to the model's internal U-net. Our method is based on the intuition that the model can more easily obtain an unbiased noise prediction estimate for images from the training set. By applying the API multiple times to the target image, averaging the outputs, and comparing the result to the original image, our approach can classify whether a sample was part of the training set. We validate our method using DDIM and Stable Diffusion setups and further extend both our approach and existing algorithms to the Diffusion Transformer architecture. Our experimental results consistently outperform previous methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Clean-Label Backdoor Attacks in the Physical World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are shown to be vulnerable to backdoor poisoning attacks, with most research focusing on \textbf{digital triggers} -- special patterns added to test-time inputs to induce targeted misclassification. \textbf{Physical triggers}, natural objects within a physical scene, have emerged as a desirable alternative since they enable real-time backdoor activations without digital manipulation. However, current physical backdoor attacks require poisoned inputs to have incorrect labels, making them easily detectable by human inspection. In this paper, we explore a new paradigm of attacks, \textbf{clean-label physical backdoor attacks (CLPBA)}, via experiments on facial recognition and animal classification tasks. Our study reveals that CLPBA could be a serious threat with the right poisoning algorithm and physical trigger. A key finding is that different from digital backdoor attacks which exploit memorization to plant backdoors in deep nets, CLPBA works by embedding the feature of the trigger distribution (i.e., the distribution of trigger samples) to the poisoned images through the perturbations. We also find that representative defenses cannot defend against CLPBA easily since CLPBA fundamentally breaks the core assumptions behind these defenses. Our study highlights accidental backdoor activations as a limitation of CLPBA, happening when unintended objects or classes cause the model to misclassify as the target class. The code and dataset can be found at https://github.com/21thinh/Clean-Label-Physical-Backdoor-Attacks.</description>

      <title>FATH: Authentication-based Test-time Defense against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed as the backbone with additional tools and text information for real-world applications. However, integrating external information into LLM-integrated applications raises significant security concerns. Among these, prompt injection attacks are particularly threatening, where malicious instructions injected in the external text information can exploit LLMs to generate answers as the attackers desire. While both training-time and test-time defense methods have been developed to mitigate such attacks, the unaffordable training costs associated with training-time methods and the limited effectiveness of existing test-time methods make them impractical. This paper introduces a novel test-time defense strategy, named Formatting AuThentication with Hash-based tags (FATH). Unlike existing approaches that prevent LLMs from answering additional instructions in external text, our method implements an authentication system, requiring LLMs to answer all received instructions with a security policy and selectively filter out responses to user instructions as the final output. To achieve this, we utilize hash-based authentication tags to label each response, facilitating accurate identification of responses according to the user's instructions and improving the robustness against adaptive attacks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our defense method can effectively defend against indirect prompt injection attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance under Llama3 and GPT3.5 models across various attack methods.

      <title>Embedded Blockchains: A Synthesis of Blockchains, Spread Spectrum Watermarking, Perceptual Hashing &amp; Digital Signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.00951v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a scheme for detecting manipulated audio and video. The scheme is a synthesis of blockchains, encrypted spread spectrum watermarks, perceptual hashing and digital signatures, which we call an Embedded Blockchain. Within this scheme, we use the blockchain for its data structure of a cryptographically linked list, cryptographic hashing for absolute comparisons, perceptual hashing for flexible comparisons, digital signatures for proof of ownership, and encrypted spread spectrum watermarking to embed the blockchain into the background noise of the media. So each media recording has its own unique blockchain, with each block holding information describing the media segment. The problem of verifying the integrity of the media is recast to traversing the blockchain, block-by-block, and segment-by-segment of the media. If any chain is broken, the difference in the computed and extracted perceptual hash is used to estimate the level of manipulation.</description>

      <title>Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables with Less Memory and Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (IBLTs) with small failure probabilities. IBLTs are highly versatile data structures that have found applications in set reconciliation protocols, error-correcting codes, and even the design of advanced cryptographic primitives. For storing $n$ elements and ensuring correctness with probability at least $1 - \delta$, existing IBLT constructions require $\Omega(n(\frac{\log(1/\delta)}{\log(n)}+1))$ space and they crucially rely on fully random hash functions.
  We present new constructions of IBLTs that are simultaneously more space efficient and require less randomness. For storing $n$ elements with a failure probability of at most $\delta$, our data structure only requires $\mathcal{O}\left(n + \log(1/\delta)\log\log(1/\delta)\right)$ space and $\mathcal{O}\left(\log(\log(n)/\delta)\right)$-wise independent hash functions.
  As a key technical ingredient we show that hashing $n$ keys with any $k$-wise independent hash function $h:U \to [Cn]$ for some sufficiently large constant $C$ guarantees with probability $1 - 2^{-\Omega(k)}$ that at least $n/2$ keys will have a unique hash value. Proving this is non-trivial as $k$ approaches $n$. We believe that the techniques used to prove this statement may be of independent interest.
  We apply our new IBLTs to the encrypted compression problem, recently studied by Fleischhacker, Larsen, Simkin (Eurocrypt 2023). We extend their approach to work for a more general class of encryption schemes and using our new IBLT we achieve an asymptotically better compression rate.</description>

      <title>Practical Membership Inference Attacks against Fine-tuned Large Language Models via Self-prompt Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06062v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) aim to infer whether a target data record has been utilized for model training or not. Existing MIAs designed for large language models (LLMs) can be bifurcated into two types: reference-free and reference-based attacks. Although reference-based attacks appear promising performance by calibrating the probability measured on the target model with reference models, this illusion of privacy risk heavily depends on a reference dataset that closely resembles the training set. Both two types of attacks are predicated on the hypothesis that training records consistently maintain a higher probability of being sampled. However, this hypothesis heavily relies on the overfitting of target models, which will be mitigated by multiple regularization methods and the generalization of LLMs. Thus, these reasons lead to high false-positive rates of MIAs in practical scenarios. We propose a Membership Inference Attack based on Self-calibrated Probabilistic Variation (SPV-MIA). Specifically, we introduce a self-prompt approach, which constructs the dataset to fine-tune the reference model by prompting the target LLM itself. In this manner, the adversary can collect a dataset with a similar distribution from public APIs. Furthermore, we introduce probabilistic variation, a more reliable membership signal based on LLM memorization rather than overfitting, from which we rediscover the neighbour attack with theoretical grounding. Comprehensive evaluation conducted on three datasets and four exemplary LLMs shows that SPV-MIA raises the AUC of MIAs from 0.7 to a significantly high level of 0.9. Our code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/NeurIPS2024_SPV-MIA</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given that no existing graph construction method can generate a perfect graph for a given dataset, graph-based algorithms are often affected by redundant and erroneous edges present within the constructed graphs. In this paper, we view these noisy edges as adversarial attack and propose to use a spectral adversarial robustness evaluation method to mitigate the impact of noisy edges on the performance of graph-based algorithms. Our method identifies the points that are less vulnerable to noisy edges and leverages only these robust points to perform graph-based algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that our methodology is highly effective and outperforms state-of-the-art denoising methods by a large margin.</description>

The findings of this work include on the one hand extended applicability of the quantum Fourier transform to the ring learning with errors problem which has been left open by Grilo et al., who first devised a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for solving noisy linear problems with quantum samples. On the other hand, this paper also shows there exist efficient classical algorithms for short integer solution and size-reduced learning with errors problems if the quantum samples used by the previous studies are given.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Guided Response for Security Operation Centers with Microsoft Copilot for Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09017v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Security operation centers contend with a constant stream of security incidents, ranging from straightforward to highly complex. To address this, we developed Microsoft Copilot for Security Guided Response (CGR), an industry-scale ML architecture that guides security analysts across three key tasks -- (1) investigation, providing essential historical context by identifying similar incidents; (2) triaging to ascertain the nature of the incident -- whether it is a true positive, false positive, or benign positive; and (3) remediation, recommending tailored containment actions. CGR is integrated into the Microsoft Defender XDR product and deployed worldwide, generating millions of recommendations across thousands of customers. Our extensive evaluation, incorporating internal evaluation, collaboration with security experts, and customer feedback, demonstrates that CGR delivers high-quality recommendations across all three tasks. We provide a comprehensive overview of the CGR architecture, setting a precedent as the first cybersecurity company to openly discuss these capabilities in such depth. Additionally, we release GUIDE, the largest public collection of real-world security incidents, spanning 13M evidences across 1M incidents annotated with ground-truth triage labels by customer security analysts. This dataset represents the first large-scale cybersecurity resource of its kind, supporting the development and evaluation of guided response systems and beyond.</description>

      <title>BinEnhance: An Enhancement Framework Based on External Environment Semantics for Binary Code Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary code search plays a crucial role in applications like software reuse detection. Currently, existing models are typically based on either internal code semantics or a combination of function call graphs (CG) and internal code semantics. However, these models have limitations. Internal code semantic models only consider the semantics within the function, ignoring the inter-function semantics, making it difficult to handle situations such as function inlining. The combination of CG and internal code semantics is insufficient for addressing complex real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose BinEnhance, a novel framework designed to leverage the inter-function semantics to enhance the expression of internal code semantics for binary code search. Specifically, BinEnhance constructs an External Environment Semantic Graph (EESG), which establishes a stable and analogous external environment for homologous functions by using different inter-function semantic relations (e.g., call, location, data-co-use). After the construction of EESG, we utilize the embeddings generated by existing internal code semantic models to initialize nodes of EESG. Finally, we design a Semantic Enhancement Model (SEM) that uses Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCNs) and a residual block to learn valuable external semantics on the EESG for generating the enhanced semantics embedding. In addition, BinEnhance utilizes data feature similarity to refine the cosine similarity of semantic embeddings. We conduct experiments under six different tasks (e.g., under function inlining scenario) and the results illustrate the performance and robustness of BinEnhance. The application of BinEnhance to HermesSim, Asm2vec, TREX, Gemini, and Asteria on two public datasets results in an improvement of Mean Average Precision (MAP) from 53.6% to 69.7%. Moreover, the efficiency increases fourfold.</description>

      <title>Differentially private and decentralized randomized power method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The randomized power method has gained significant interest due to its simplicity and efficient handling of large-scale spectral analysis and recommendation tasks. As modern datasets contain sensitive private information, we need to give formal guarantees on the possible privacy leaks caused by this method. This paper focuses on enhancing privacy preserving variants of the method. We propose a strategy to reduce the variance of the noise introduced to achieve Differential Privacy (DP). We also adapt the method to a decentralized framework with a low computational and communication overhead, while preserving the accuracy. We leverage Secure Aggregation (a form of Multi-Party Computation) to allow the algorithm to perform computations using data distributed among multiple users or devices, without revealing individual data. We show that it is possible to use a noise scale in the decentralized setting that is similar to the one in the centralized setting. We improve upon existing convergence bounds for both the centralized and decentralized versions. The proposed method is especially relevant for decentralized applications such as distributed recommender systems, where privacy concerns are paramount.</description>

      <title>A Quality-Centric Framework for Generic Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the generalization issue in deepfake detection by harnessing forgery quality in training data. Generally, the forgery quality of different deepfakes varies: some have easily recognizable forgery clues, while others are highly realistic. Existing works often train detectors on a mix of deepfakes with varying forgery qualities, potentially leading detectors to short-cut the easy-to-spot artifacts from low-quality forgery samples, thereby hurting generalization performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel quality-centric framework for generic deepfake detection, which is composed of a Quality Evaluator, a low-quality data enhancement module, and a learning pacing strategy that explicitly incorporates forgery quality into the training process. The framework is inspired by curriculum learning, which is designed to gradually enable the detector to learn more challenging deepfake samples, starting with easier samples and progressing to more realistic ones. We employ both static and dynamic assessments to assess the forgery quality, combining their scores to produce a final rating for each training sample. The rating score guides the selection of deepfake samples for training, with higher-rated samples having a higher probability of being chosen. Furthermore, we propose a novel frequency data augmentation method specifically designed for low-quality forgery samples, which helps to reduce obvious forgery traces and improve their overall realism. Extensive experiments show that our method can be applied in a plug-and-play manner and significantly enhance the generalization performance.</description>
