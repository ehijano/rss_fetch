      <title>Predicting the role of inequalities on human mobility patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether in search of better trade opportunities or escaping wars, humans have always been on the move. For almost a century, mathematical models of human mobility have been instrumental in the quantification of commuting patterns and migratory fluxes. Equity is a common premise of most of these mathematical models, such that living conditions and job opportunities are assumed to be equivalent across cities. Growing inequalities in modern urban economy and pressing effects of climate change significantly strain this premise. Here, we propose a mobility model that is aware of inequalities across cities in terms of living conditions and job opportunities. Comparing results with real datasets, we show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art in predicting migration patterns in South Sudan and commuting fluxes in the United States. This model paves the way to critical research on resilience and sustainability of urban systems.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional real space renormalization group with well-controlled approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make Kadanoff's block idea into a reliable three-dimensional (3D) real space renormalization group (RG) method. Kadanoff's idea, expressed in spin representation, offers a qualitative intuition for clarifying scaling behavior in criticality, but has difficulty as a quantitative tool due to uncontrolled approximations. A tensor-network reformulation equips the block idea with a measure of RG errors. In 3D, we propose an entanglement filtering scheme to enhance such a block-tensor map, with the lattice reflection symmetry imposed. When the proposed RG is applied to the cubic-lattice Ising model, the RG errors are reduced to about 2% by retaining more couplings. The estimated scaling dimensions of the two relevant fields have errors 0.4% and 0.1% in the best case, compared with the accepted values. The proposed RG is promising as a systematically-improvable real space RG method in 3D. The unique feature of our method is its ability to numerically obtain a 3D critical fixed point in a high-dimensional tensor space. A fixed-point tensor contains much more information than a handful of observables estimated in conventional techniques for analyzing critical systems.</description>

      <title>Two-states Brownian particle in a Harmonic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of a Brownian particle in the overdamped regime in the presence of a harmonic potential, assuming its diffusion coefficient to randomly jump between two distinct values. In particular, we characterize the probability distribution of the particle position and provide detailed expressions for the mean square displacement and the kurtosis. We highlight non-Gaussian behaviour even within the long-term limit carried over with an excess of probability both in the central part and in the distribution's tails. Moreover, when one of the two diffusion coefficients assumes the value zero, we provide evidence that the probability distribution develops a cusp. Most of our results are analytical, and corroborated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Curzon-Ahlborn heat engine: Extending the Yvon engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One famous paper in this field [Am. J. Phys. 43, 22 (1975)] unveiled the efficiency at maximum power (EMP) of the endo-reversible Carnot heat engine, now known as the Curzon-Ahlborn (CA) engine, making a pioneering contribution to the genesis of finite-time thermodynamics. Despite its significance, similar findings have surfaced throughout history; for instance, the Yvon engine proposed by J. Yvon in 1955 shares the exact same EMP as the CA engine. This study extends Yvon's original approach to reanalyze the finite-time optimization of the CA engine. Our investigation not only bridges the gap between the Yvon engine and the CA engine but also serves as a suitable example for teaching undergraduate thermodynamics and engineering thermodynamics, given its concise and easy-to-understand derivation.</description>

      <title>Weak ergodicity breaking with isolated integrable sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider spin chain models with local Hamiltonians that display weak ergodicity breaking. In these models, the majority of the eigenstates are thermal, but there is a distinguished subspace of the Hilbert space in which ergodicity is broken. We achieve such a weak breaking by embedding selected integrable models into larger Hilbert spaces of otherwise chaotic models. The integrable subspaces do not have a tensor product structure with respect to any spatial bipartition, therefore our constructions differ from certain trivial embeddings. We consider multiple mechanisms for such an embedding, and we also review previous examples in the literature. Curiously, all our examples can be seen as perturbations of models with Hilbert space fragmentation, such that the perturbed models are not fragmented anymore.</description>

      <title>A perturbative approach to the macroscopic fluctuation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stationary states of diffusive dynamics driven out of equilibrium by reservoirs. For a small forcing, the system remains close to equilibrium and the large deviation functional of the density can be computed perturbatively by using the macroscopic fluctuation theory. This applies to general domains in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and diffusive dynamics with arbitrary transport coefficients. As a consequence, one can analyse the correlations at the first non trivial order in the forcing and show that, in general, all the long range correlation functions are not equal to 0, in contrast to the exactly solvable models previously known.</description>

      <title>Topological Quantum Spin Glass Order and its realization in qLDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ordered phases of matter have close connections to computation. Two prominent examples are spin glass order, with wide-ranging applications in machine learning and optimization, and topological order, closely related to quantum error correction. Here, we introduce the concept of topological quantum spin glass (TQSG) order which marries these two notions, exhibiting both the complex energy landscapes of spin glasses, and the quantum memory and long-range entanglement characteristic of topologically ordered systems. Using techniques from coding theory and a quantum generalization of Gibbs state decompositions, we show that TQSG order is the low-temperature phase of various quantum LDPC codes on expander graphs, including hypergraph and balanced product codes. Our work introduces a topological analog of spin glasses that preserves quantum information, opening new avenues for both statistical mechanics and quantum computer science.</description>

      <title>Spatial Optical Simulator for Classical Statistical Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical simulators for the Ising model have demonstrated great promise for solving challenging problems in physics and beyond. Here, we develop a spatial optical simulator for a variety of classical statistical systems, including the clock, $XY$, Potts, and Heisenberg models, utilizing a digital micromirror device composed of a large number of tiny mirrors. Spins, with desired amplitudes or phases of the statistical models, are precisely encoded by a patch of mirrors with a superpixel approach. Then, by modulating the light field in a sequence of designed patterns, the spin-spin interaction is realized in such a way that the Hamiltonian symmetries are preserved. We successfully simulate statistical systems on a fully connected network, with ferromagnetic or Mattis-type random interactions, and observe the corresponding phase transitions between the paramagnetic, and the ferromagnetic or spin-glass phases. Our results largely extend the research scope of spatial optical simulators and their versatile applications.</description>

      <title>A Generic Method for Integrating Lindblad Master Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time evolution of Markovian open quantum systems is governed by Lindblad master equations, whose solution can be formally written as the Lindbladian exponential acting on the initial density matrix. By expanding this Lindbladian exponential into the Taylor series, we propose a generic method for integrating Lindblad master equations. In this method, the series is truncated, retaining a finite number of terms, and the iterative actions of Lindbladian on the density matrix follow the corresponding master equation. While mathematically equivalent to the widely-used vectorization method, our method offers significant improvements in the numerical efficiency, especially for systems with many degrees of freedom. Moreover, our proposed method can be integrated seamlessly with tensor networks. Two illustrative examples, a two-level system exhibiting damped Rabi oscillations and a driven dissipative Heisenberg chain, are used to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of our method.</description>

Abstract: We analytically study the exceptional points of a Liouvillian super-operator describing an open quantum system of two interacting qubits with a dissipative bath of polarization applied to one of the qubits. Our focus is the structure of the exceptional point manifolds in the parameter space which we describe in all analytic details. In particular, we characterize the manifold of bifurcation points corresponding to largest dissipation, and describe the relative effective quantum Zeno dynamics in the bifurcation-free regime, which may occur at relatively small dissipation.</description>

      <title>Recursive Algorithm to the Centroid of Free Area for Inherent Structure and Hopping Motion in Deeply Supercooled Binary Hard Disk Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inherent structures, derived by eliminating thermal fluctuations from complex trajectories, illuminate fundamental mechanisms underlying structural relaxation and dynamic heterogeneity in dense glassy systems. However, determining these structures in hard disk/sphere systems presents unique challenges due to the discontinuous nature of inter-particle potentials and resultant flat potential energy landscapes. To address this limitation, we introduce the Recursive Centroid of Free Area algorithm (ReCFA), a novel approach inspired by a steepest descent method, which computes inherent structure configurations in hard disk systems. We conducted comparative analyses between ReCFA, similar methods, and a conventional time-coarse-graining technique, focusing on string-like hopping motions in supercompressed binary hard disks that emulate supercooled liquid behavior. ReCFA demonstrated notable advantages in capturing entropic contributions. The configurations derived through ReCFA exhibited physically reasonable particle displacements analogous to inherent structures in soft particle systems, effectively identifying hopping motions between metastable basins in jammed states. This ReCFA-based analysis enhances our understanding of relaxation dynamics in highly compressed glassy systems, offering a robust analytical tool for investigating both dynamic and structural characteristics across hard and soft particle systems.</description>

      <title>Discretization of Structured Bosonic Environments at Finite Temperature by Interpolative Decomposition: Theory and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theory for a novel method to discretize the spectral density of a bosonic heat bath, as introduced in [H. Takahashi and R. Borrelli, J. Chem. Phys. \textbf{161}, 151101 (2024)]. The approach leverages a low-rank decomposition of the Fourier-transform relation connecting the bath correlation function to its spectral density. By capturing the time, frequency, and temperature dependencies encoded in the spectral density-autocorrelation function relation, our method significantly reduces the degrees of freedom required for simulating open quantum system dynamics. We benchmark our approach against existing methods and demonstrate its efficacy through applications to both simple models and a realistic electron transfer process in biological systems. Additionally, we show that this new approach can be effectively combined with the tensor-train formalism to investigate the quantum dynamics of systems interacting with complex non-Markovian environments. Finally, we provide a perspective on the selection and application of various spectral density discretization techniques.</description>

      <title>Exceptional stationary state in a dephasing many-body open quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a dephasing many-body open quantum system that hosts, together with the infinite-temperature state, another additional stationary state. The latter is exceptional in many respects, as it is pure and retains memory of the initial condition, whereas any orthogonal state evolves towards the infinite-temperature state erasing any information on the initial state. We discuss the approach to stationarity of the model focusing in particular on the fate of interfaces between the two states; a simple classical model based on a membrane picture helps developing an effective hydrodynamic theory even if the dynamics does not feature any conserved quantity. The fact that the model reaches stationary properties on timescales that depend on the system size while the asymptotic decay rate is finite is duly highlighted. We point out the reasons for considering these exceptional stationary states as quantum many-body scars in the open system framework.</description>

      <title>The random coupled-plaquette gauge model and the surface code under circuit-level noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We map the decoding problem of the surface code under depolarizing and syndrome noise to a disordered spin model, which we call the random coupled-plaquette gauge model (RCPGM). By coupling X- and Z-syndrome volumes, this model allows us to optimally account for genuine Y-errors in the surface code in a setting with noisy measurements. Using Parallel Tempering Monte Carlo simulations, we determine the code's fundamental error threshold. Firstly, for the phenomenological noise setting we determine a threshold of $6\%$ under uniform depolarizing and syndrome noise. This is a substantial improvement compared to results obtained via the previously known "uncoupled" random plaquette gauge model (RPGM) in the identical setting, where marginalizing Y-errors leads to a threshold of $4.3\%$. Secondly, we tackle the circuit-level noise scenario, where we use a reduction technique to find effective asymmetric depolarizing and syndrome noise rates to feed into the RCPGM mapping. Despite this reduction technique breaking up some of the correlations contained in the intricacies of circuit-level noise, we find an improvement exceeding that for the phenomenological case. We report a threshold of up to $1.4\%$, to be compared to $0.7\%$ under the identical noise model when marginalizing the Y-errors and mapping to the anisotropic RPGM. These results enlarge the landscape of statistical mechanical mappings for quantum error correction. In particular they provide an underpinning for the broadly held belief that accounting for Y-errors is a major bottleneck in improving surface code decoders. This is highly encouraging for leading efficient practical decoder development, where heuristically accounting for Y-error correlations has seen recent developments such as belief-matching. This suggests that there is further room for improvement of the surface code for fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Coarsening dynamics of Ising-nematic order in a frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phase ordering dynamics of the classical antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ (nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings) Heisenberg model on the square lattice in the strong frustration regime ($J_2/J_1 &gt; 1/2$). While thermal fluctuations preclude any long-range magnetic order at finite temperatures, the system exhibits a long-range spin-driven nematic phase at low temperatures. The transition into the nematic phase is further shown to belong to the two-dimensional Ising universality class based on the critical exponents near the phase transition. Our large-scale stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations find a two-stage phase ordering when the system is quenched from a high-temperature paramagnetic state into the nematic phase. In the early stage, collinear alignments of spins lead to a locally saturated Ising-nematic order. Once domains of well-defined Ising order are developed, the late-stage relaxation is dominated by curvature-driven domain coarsening, as described by the Allen-Cahn equation. The characteristic size of Ising-nematic domains scales as the square root of time, similar to the kinetic Ising model described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our results confirm that the late-stage ordering kinetics of the spin-driven nematic, which is a vestigial order of the frustrated Heisenberg model, belongs to the dynamical universality class of a non-conserved Ising order. Interestingly, the system shows no violation of the superuniversality hypothesis under weak bond disorder. The dynamic scaling invariance is preserved in the presence of weak bond disorder. We also discuss possible applications of our results to materials for which vestigial Ising-nematic order is realized.</description>

      <title>Sphere free energy of scalar field theories with cubic interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dimensional continuation approach to calculating the free energy of $d$-dimensional Euclidean CFT on the round sphere $S^d$ has been used to develop its $4-\epsilon$ expansion for a number of well-known non-supersymmetric theories, such as the $O(N)$ model. The resulting estimate of the sphere free energy $F$ in the 3D Ising model has turned out to be in good agreement with the numerical value obtained using the fuzzy sphere regularization. In this paper, we develop the $6-\epsilon$ expansions for CFTs on $S^d$ described by scalar field theory with cubic interactions and use their resummations to estimate the values of $F$. In particular, we study the theories with purely imaginary coupling constants, which describe non-unitary universality classes arising when certain conformal minimal models are continued above two dimensions. The Yang-Lee model $M(2,5)$ is described by a field theory with one scalar field, while the $D$-series $M(3,8)$ model is described by two scalar fields. We also study the $OSp(1|2)$ symmetric cubic theory of one commuting and two anti-commuting scalar fields, which appears to describe the critical behavior of random spanning forests. In the course of our work, we revisit the calculations of beta functions of marginal operators containing the curvature. We also use another method for approximating $F$, which relies on perturbation theory around the bilocal action near the long-range/short-range crossover. The numerical values it gives for $F$ tend to be in good agreement with other available methods.</description>

      <title>Measuring collective diffusion properties by counting particles in boxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective diffusion, characterised by the collective diffusion coefficient $D_\mathrm{coll}$, is a key quantity for describing the macroscopic transport properties of soft matter systems. However, measuring $D_\mathrm{coll}$ is a fundamental experimental and numerical challenge, as it either relies on nonequilibrium techniques that are hard to interpret or on Fourier-based approaches at equilibrium which are fraught with difficulties associated with Fourier transforms. In this work, we present a novel approach to measure collective diffusion properties by analysing the statistics of particle number counts $N(t)$ in virtual observation boxes of an image at equilibrium, a method we term the "Countoscope". By investigating the equilibrium diffusive dynamics of a 2D colloidal suspension experimentally and numerically, we demonstrate this method can accurately measure $D_\mathrm{coll}$. We validate our results against Fourier-based approaches and establish best practices for measuring $D_\mathrm{coll}$ using fluctuating counts. Remarkably, Fourier techniques struggle with long-range collective measurements because of the non-periodic nature of an experimental image, yet counting fully exploits this property by deliberately using finite observation windows. Finally, we discuss the potential of our method to advance our understanding of collective properties in suspensions, particularly the role of hydrodynamic interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-resolved entanglement, capturing the refined structure of quantum entanglement in systems with global symmetries, has attracted a lot of attention recently. In this manuscript, introducing the notion of symmetry-resolved generalized entropies, we aim to develop a computational framework suitable for the study of excited state symmetry-resolved entanglement as well as the dynamical evolution of symmetry-resolved entanglement in symmetry-preserving out-of-equilibrium settings. We illustrate our framework using the example of (1+1)-d free massless compact boson theory, and benchmark our results using lattice computation in the XX chain. As a byproduct, our computational framework also provides access to the probability distribution of the symmetry charge contained within a subsystem and the corresponding full counting statistics.</description>

      <title>Operator dynamics in Floquet many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems, focusing on generic features of systems that are ergodic, spatially extended, and lack conserved densities. Quantum circuits of various types provide simple models for such systems. We focus on Floquet quantum circuits, comparing their behaviour with what has been found previously for circuits that are random in time. Floquet circuits, which have discrete time-translation symmetry, represent an intermediate case between circuits that are random in time and lack any symmetry, and systems with a time-independent Hamiltonian and continuous time-translation invariance. By making this comparison, one of our aims is to identify signatures of time-translation symmetry in Floquet operator dynamics. To characterise behaviour we examine a variety of quantities in solvable models and numerically: operator autocorrelation functions; the partial spectral form factor; the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC); and the paths in operator space that make the dominant contributions to the ensemble-averaged autocorrelation functions. Our most striking result is that ensemble-averaged autocorrelation functions show behaviour that is distinctively different in Floquet systems compared to systems in which successive time-steps are independent. Specifically, while average autocorrelation functions decay on a microscopic timescale for circuits that are random in time, in Floquet systems they have a late-time tail with a duration that grows parametrically with the size of the operator support. The existence of these tails provides a way to understand deviations of the spectral form factor from random matrix behaviour at times shorter than the Thouless time. In contrast to this feature in autocorrelation functions, we find no new aspects to the behaviour of OTOCs for Floquet models compared to random-in-time circuits.</description>

      <title>Game susceptibility, Correlation and Payoff capacity as a measure of Cooperative behavior in the thermodynamic limit of some Social dilemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analytically, finding the origins of cooperative behavior in infinite-player games is an exciting topic of current interest. In this paper, we compare three analytical methods, i.e., Nash equilibrium mapping (NEM), Darwinian selection (DS) and Aggregate selection (AS), with a numerical Agent based method (ABM) via the game susceptibility, correlation, and payoff capacity as indicators of cooperative behaviour. While the analytical NEM model shows excellent agreement with the numerical ABM, the other analytical models, like AS and DS, show notable divergence with ABM in the thermodynamic limit for the indicators in question. Previously, cooperative behavior was studied by considering game magnetization and individual players' average payoff as indicators. This paper shows that game susceptibility, correlation, and payoff capacity can aid in understanding cooperative behavior in social dilemmas in the thermodynamic limit. The results obtained via NEM and ABM are in good agreement for all three indicators in question, for both Hawk-Dove and the Public goods games. After comparing the results obtained for all five indicators, we see that individual players' average payoff and payoff capacity serve as the best indicators to study cooperative behavior among players in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active matter and driven systems exhibit statistical fluctuations in density and particle positions, providing an indirect indicator of dissipation across multiple length and time scales. Here, we quantitatively relate these measurable fluctuations to a thermodynamic speed limit that constrains the rates of heat and entropy production in nonequilibrium processes. By reparametrizing the speed limit, we show how to infer heat and entropy production rates from directly observable or controllable quantities. This approach can use available experimental data and avoid the need for analytically solvable microscopic models or full time-dependent probability distributions. The heat rate we predict agrees with experimental measurements for a Brownian particle and a microtubule active gel, which validates the approach and suggests potential for the design of experiments.</description>

      <title>Local Time Statistics and Permeable Barrier Crossing: from Poisson to Birth-Death Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Barrier crossing is a widespread phenomenon across natural and engineering systems. While an abundant cross-disciplinary literature on the topic has emerged over the years, the stochastic underpinnings of the process are yet to be linked quantitatively to easily measurable observables. We bridge this gap by developing a microscopic representation of Brownian motion in the presence of permeable barriers that allows to treat barriers with constant asymmetric permeabilities. Our approach relies upon reflected Brownian motion and on the crossing events being Poisson processes subordinated by the local time of the underlying motion at the barrier. Within this paradigm we derive the exact expression for the distribution of the number of crossings, and find an experimentally measurable statistical definition of permeability. We employ Feynman-Kac theory to derive and solve a set of governing birth-death diffusion equations and extend them to the case when barrier permeability is constant and asymmetric. As an application we study a system of infinite, identical and periodically placed asymmetric barriers for which we derive analytically effective transport parameters. This periodic arrangement induces an effective drift at long times whose magnitude depends on the difference in the permeability on either side of the barrier as well as on their absolute values. As the asymmetric permeabilities act akin to localised 'ratchet' potentials that break spatial symmetry and detailed balance, the proposed arrangement of asymmetric barriers provides an example of a noise-induced drift without the need to time-modulate any external force or create temporal correlations on the motion of a diffusing particle. By placing only one asymmetric barrier in a periodic domain we also show the emergence of a non-equilibrium steady state.</description>

      <title>Role of Coupling Asymmetry in the Fully Disordered Kuramoto Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of phase oscillators in the fully disordered Kuramoto model with couplings of defined asymmetry. The mean-field dynamics is reduced to a self-consistent stochastic single-oscillator problem which we analyze perturbatively and by numerical simulations. We elucidate the influence of the asymmetry on the correlation and response function of the system as well as on the distribution of the order parameter. The so-called volcano transition is shown to be robust with respect to a small degree of coupling asymmetry but to disappear when the antisymmetry in the couplings outweighs the symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions are non-analyticities in a dynamical free energy (or return rate) which occur at critical times. Although extensively studied in one dimension, the exact nature of the non-analyticity in two and three dimensions has not yet been fully investigated. In two dimensions, results so far are known only for relatively simple two-band models. Here we study the general two- and three-dimensional cases. We establish the relation between the non-analyticities in different dimensions, and the functional form of the densities of Fisher zeroes. We show, in particular, that entering a critical region where the density of Fisher zeroes is non-zero at the boundary always leads to a cusp in the derivative of the return rate while the return rate itself is smooth. We illustrate our results by obtaining analytical results for exemplary two- and three-dimensional models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perturbing transition rates in a steady nonequilibrium system, e.g. modelled by a Markov jump process, causes a change in the local currents. Their susceptibility is usually expressed via Green-Kubo relations or their nonequilibrium extensions. However, we may also wish to directly express the mutual relation between currents. Such a nonperturbative interrelation was discovered by P.E. Harunari et al. in [1] by applying algebraic graph theory showing the mutual linearity of currents over different edges in a graph. We give a novel and shorter derivation of that current relationship where we express the current-current susceptibility as a difference in mean first-passage times. It allows an extension to multiple currents, which remains affine but the relation is not additive.</description>

      <title>Tuning Higher Order Structure in Colloidal Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09029v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colloidal particles self assemble into a wide range of structures under external AC electric fields due to induced dipolar interactions [Yethiraj and Van Blaaderen Nature 421 513 (2003)]. As a result of these dipolar interactions, at low volume fraction the system is modulated between a hard-sphere like state (in the case of zero applied field) and a "string fluid" upon application of the field. Using both particle-resolved experiments and Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate the emergence of the string fluid with a variety of structural measures including two-body and higher-order correlations. The higher-order structure we probe using three-body spatial correlation functions and a many-body approach based on minimum energy clusters of a dipolar-Lennard-Jones system. This yields a series of geometrically distinct minimum energy clusters upon increasing the strength of the dipolar interaction, which are echoed in the higher-order structure of the colloidal fluids we study here. We find good agreement between experiment and simulation at the two-body level, although some discrepancies are found at higher field strength, where the system falls out of equilibrium. Higher-order correlations exhibit reasonable agreement between experiment and simulation, again with more discrepancy at higher field strength for three--body correlation functions. At higher field strength, the cluster population in our experiments and simulations is dominated by the minimum energy clusters for all sizes $8 \leq m \leq 12$. The agreement that we find here is notable considering that there is no fit parameter in our mapping between experiment and simulation.</description>

      <title>Theory of robust quantum many-body scars in long-range interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12504v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exceptional energy eigenstates of quantum many-body systems associated with violations of thermalization for special non-equilibrium initial states. Their various systematic constructions require fine-tuning of local Hamiltonian parameters. In this work we demonstrate that long-range interacting quantum spin systems generically host robust QMBS. We analyze spectral properties upon raising the power-law decay exponent $\alpha$ of spin-spin interactions from the solvable permutationally-symmetric limit $\alpha=0$. First, we numerically establish that despite spectral signatures of chaos appear for infinitesimal $\alpha$, the towers of $\alpha=0$ energy eigenstates with large collective spin are smoothly deformed as $\alpha$ is increased, and exhibit characteristic QMBS features. To elucidate the nature and fate of these states in larger systems, we introduce an analytical approach based on mapping the spin Hamiltonian onto a relativistic quantum rotor non-linearly coupled to an extensive set of bosonic modes. We analitycally solve for the eigenstates of this interacting impurity model by means of a novel polaron-type canonical transformation, and show their self-consistent localization in large-spin sectors of the original Hamiltonian for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;d$ (with $d$ = spatial dimension of the lattice). Our theory unveils the stability mechanism of such QMBS for arbitrary system size and predicts instances of its breakdown, e.g. near dynamical critical points or in presence of semiclassical chaos, which we verify numerically in long-range quantum Ising chains. As a byproduct, we find a predictive criterion for presence or absence of heating under periodic driving for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;d$, beyond existing Floquet-prethermalization theorems.</description>

Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of a collective decision-making model inspired by honeybee behavior. This model integrates individual exploration for option discovery and social interactions for information sharing, while also considering option qualities. Our assessment of the decision process outcome employs standard consensus metrics and investigates its correlation with convergence time, revealing common trade-offs between speed and accuracy. Furthermore, we show the model's compliance with Weber's Law of relative stimulus perception, aligning with previous analysis of collective decision problems. Our study also identifies non-equilibrium critical behavior in specific limits of the model, where the highest values of consensus are achieved. This result highlights the intriguing relationship between optimal performance, critically, and the fluctuations caused by finite size effects, often seen in biological systems. Our findings are especially relevant for finite adaptive systems, as they provide insights into navigating decision-making scenarios with similar options more effectively.</description>

      <title>Protect Measurement-Induced Phase Transition from Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scrambling dynamics induced by random unitary gates can protect information from low-rate measurements, which underpins the phenomenon known as the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). However, typical decoherence noises disrupts the volume law phase, complicating the observation of MIPT on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate that incorporating quantum-enhanced operations can effectively protect MIPT from environmental noise, thereby enabling its detection in experiment. The transition is characterized by the conditional entanglement entropy (CEE), which is associated with a statistical mechanics model wherein noise and quantum-enhanced operations act as competing external random fields. When the net external field is zero, a ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition is expected, resulting in the MIPT. This zero-field condition also ensures an average apparatus-environment symmetry, making CEE a valid probe of entanglement and establishing the transition as a genuine entanglement phase transition. Additionally, we provide numerical results demonstrate the MIPT in a (2+1)-dimensional quantum circuit under dephasing noise. We also propose a method to estimate the noise rate, enabling the zero-field condition to be achieved experimentally and ensuring the feasibility of our protocol. Our result serves as a concrete example of the power of quantum enhancement in combating noise.</description>

      <title>Coherent Information Phase Transition in a Noisy Quantum Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent information quantifies the transmittable quantum information through a channel and is directly linked to the channel's quantum capacity. In the context of dynamical purification transitions, scrambling dynamics sustain extensive and positive coherent information at low measurement rates, but noises can suppress it to zero or negative values. Here we introduce quantum-enhanced operations into a noisy monitored quantum circuit. This circuit, viewed as a quantum channel, undergoes a phase transition in coherent information from a recoverable phase with positive values to an irrecoverable phase with negative values. This transition is modulated by the relative frequency of noise and quantum-enhanced operations. The existence of a recoverable phase implies that quantum-enhanced operations can facilitate reliable quantum information transmission in the presence of diverse noises. Remarkably, we propose a resource-efficient protocol to characterize this phase transition, effectively avoiding post-selection by utilizing every run of the quantum simulation. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical insights and practical implementation, making the phase transition feasible to demonstrate on realistic noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Rapid optimal work extraction from a quantum-dot information engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conversion of thermal energy into work is usually more efficient in the slow-driving regime, where the power output is vanishingly small. Efficient work extraction for fast driving protocols remains an outstanding challenge at the nanoscale, where fluctuations play a significant role. In this Letter, we use a quantum-dot Szilard engine to extract work from thermal fluctuations with maximum efficiency over two decades of driving speed. We design and implement a family of optimised protocols ranging from the slow- to the fast-driving regime, and measure the engine's efficiency as well as the mean and variance of its power output in each case. These optimised protocols exhibit significant improvements in power and efficiency compared to the naive approach. Our results also show that, when optimising for efficiency, boosting the power output of a Szilard engine inevitably comes at the cost of increased power fluctuations.</description>
