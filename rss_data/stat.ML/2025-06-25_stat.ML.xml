      <title>Simulation-Based Sensitivity Analysis in Optimal Treatment Regimes and Causal Decomposition with Individualized Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal decomposition analysis aims to assess the effect of modifying risk factors on reducing social disparities in outcomes. Recently, this analysis has incorporated individual characteristics when modifying risk factors by utilizing optimal treatment regimes (OTRs). Since the newly defined individualized effects rely on the no omitted confounding assumption, developing sensitivity analyses to account for potential omitted confounding is essential. Moreover, OTRs and individualized effects are primarily based on binary risk factors, and no formal approach currently exists to benchmark the strength of omitted confounding using observed covariates for binary risk factors. To address this gap, we extend a simulation-based sensitivity analysis that simulates unmeasured confounders, addressing two sources of bias emerging from deriving OTRs and estimating individualized effects. Additionally, we propose a formal bounding strategy that benchmarks the strength of omitted confounding for binary risk factors. Using the High School Longitudinal Study 2009 (HSLS:09), we demonstrate this sensitivity analysis and benchmarking method.</description>

      <title>When Diffusion Models Memorize: Inductive Biases in Probability Flow of Minimum-Norm Shallow Neural Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While diffusion models generate high-quality images via probability flow, the theoretical understanding of this process remains incomplete. A key question is when probability flow converges to training samples or more general points on the data manifold. We analyze this by studying the probability flow of shallow ReLU neural network denoisers trained with minimal $\ell^2$ norm. For intuition, we introduce a simpler score flow and show that for orthogonal datasets, both flows follow similar trajectories, converging to a training point or a sum of training points. However, early stopping by the diffusion time scheduler allows probability flow to reach more general manifold points. This reflects the tendency of diffusion models to both memorize training samples and generate novel points that combine aspects of multiple samples, motivating our study of such behavior in simplified settings. We extend these results to obtuse simplex data and, through simulations in the orthogonal case, confirm that probability flow converges to a training point, a sum of training points, or a manifold point. Moreover, memorization decreases when the number of training samples grows, as fewer samples accumulate near training points.</description>

      <title>Posterior Contraction for Sparse Neural Networks in Besov Spaces with Intrinsic Dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work establishes that sparse Bayesian neural networks achieve optimal posterior contraction rates over anisotropic Besov spaces and their hierarchical compositions. These structures reflect the intrinsic dimensionality of the underlying function, thereby mitigating the curse of dimensionality. Our analysis shows that Bayesian neural networks equipped with either sparse or continuous shrinkage priors attain the optimal rates which are dependent on the intrinsic dimension of the true structures. Moreover, we show that these priors enable rate adaptation, allowing the posterior to contract at the optimal rate even when the smoothness level of the true function is unknown. The proposed framework accommodates a broad class of functions, including additive and multiplicative Besov functions as special cases. These results advance the theoretical foundations of Bayesian neural networks and provide rigorous justification for their practical effectiveness in high-dimensional, structured estimation problems.</description>

      <title>Rare dense solutions clusters in asymmetric binary perceptrons -- local entropy via fully lifted RDT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study classical asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) and associated \emph{local entropy} (LE) as potential source of its algorithmic hardness. Isolation of \emph{typical} ABP solutions in SAT phase seemingly suggests a universal algorithmic hardness. Paradoxically, efficient algorithms do exist even for constraint densities $\alpha$ fairly close but at a finite distance (\emph{computational gap}) from the capacity. In recent years, existence of rare large dense clusters and magical ability of fast algorithms to find them have been posited as the conceptual resolution of this paradox. Monotonicity or breakdown of the LEs associated with such \emph{atypical} clusters are predicated to play a key role in their thinning-out or even complete defragmentation.
  Invention of fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) [90,93,94] allows studying random structures \emph{typical} features. A large deviation upgrade, sfl LD RDT [96,97], moves things further and enables \emph{atypical} features characterizations as well. Utilizing the machinery of [96,97] we here develop a generic framework to study LE as an ABP's atypical feature. Already on the second level of lifting we discover that the LE results are closely matching those obtained through replica methods. For classical zero threshold ABP, we obtain that LE breaks down for $\alpha$ in $(0.77,0.78)$ interval which basically matches $\alpha\sim 0.75-0.77$ range that currently best ABP solvers can handle and effectively indicates that LE's behavior might indeed be among key reflections of the ABP's computational gaps presumable existence.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal estimates for the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constants of deep random ReLU neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constants of ReLU neural networks $\Phi: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ with random parameters for $p \in [1,\infty]$. The distribution of the weights follows a variant of the He initialization and the biases are drawn from symmetric distributions. We derive high probability upper and lower bounds for wide networks that differ at most by a factor that is logarithmic in the network's width and linear in its depth. In the special case of shallow networks, we obtain matching bounds. Remarkably, the behavior of the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant varies significantly between the regimes $ p \in [1,2) $ and $ p \in [2,\infty] $. For $p \in [2,\infty]$, the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant behaves similarly to $\Vert g\Vert_{p'}$, where $g \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a $d$-dimensional standard Gaussian vector and $1/p + 1/p' = 1$. In contrast, for $p \in [1,2)$, the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant aligns more closely to $\Vert g \Vert_{2}$.</description>

      <title>The Shape of Consumer Behavior: A Symbolic and Topological Analysis of Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding temporal patterns in online search behavior is crucial for real-time marketing and trend forecasting. Google Trends offers a rich proxy for public interest, yet the high dimensionality and noise of its time-series data present challenges for effective clustering. This study evaluates three unsupervised clustering approaches, Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX), enhanced SAX (eSAX), and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), applied to 20 Google Trends keywords representing major consumer categories. Our results show that while SAX and eSAX offer fast and interpretable clustering for stable time series, they struggle with volatility and complexity, often producing ambiguous ``catch-all'' clusters. TDA, by contrast, captures global structural features through persistent homology and achieves more balanced and meaningful groupings.
  We conclude with practical guidance for using symbolic and topological methods in consumer analytics and suggest that hybrid approaches combining both perspectives hold strong potential for future applications.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Mean Shift Algorithms for Large Bandwidths and Simultaneous Accurate Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean shift (MS) is a non-parametric, density-based, iterative algorithm that has prominent usage in clustering and image segmentation. A rigorous proof for its convergence in full generality remains unknown. Two significant steps in this direction were taken in the paper \cite{Gh1}, which proved that for \textit{sufficiently large bandwidth}, the MS algorithm with the Gaussian kernel always converges in any dimension, and also by the same author in \cite{Gh2}, proved that MS always converges in one dimension for kernels with differentiable, strictly decreasing, convex profiles. In the more recent paper \cite{YT}, they have proved the convergence in more generality,\textit{ without any restriction on the bandwidth}, with the assumption that the KDE $f$ has a continuous Lipschitz gradient on the closure of the convex hull of the trajectory of the iterated sequence of the mode estimate, and also satisfies the {\L}ojasiewicz property there.
  The main theoretical result of this paper is a generalization of those of \cite{Gh1}, where we show that (1) for\textit{ sufficiently large bandwidth} convergence is guaranteed in any dimension with \textit{any radially symmetric and strictly positive definite kernels}. The proof uses two alternate characterizations of radially symmetric positive definite smooth kernels by Schoenberg and Bernstein \cite{Fass}, and borrows some steps from the proofs in \cite{Gh1}. Although the authors acknowledge that the result in that paper is more restrictive than that of \cite{YT} due to the lower bandwidth limit, it uses a different set of assumptions than \cite{YT}, and the proof technique is different.</description>

      <title>Towards AI-assisted Neutrino Flavor Theory Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle physics theories, such as those which explain neutrino flavor mixing, arise from a vast landscape of model-building possibilities. A model's construction typically relies on the intuition of theorists. It also requires considerable effort to identify appropriate symmetry groups, assign field representations, and extract predictions for comparison with experimental data. We develop an Autonomous Model Builder (AMBer), a framework in which a reinforcement learning agent interacts with a streamlined physics software pipeline to search these spaces efficiently. AMBer selects symmetry groups, particle content, and group representation assignments to construct viable models while minimizing the number of free parameters introduced. We validate our approach in well-studied regions of theory space and extend the exploration to a novel, previously unexamined symmetry group. While demonstrated in the context of neutrino flavor theories, this approach of reinforcement learning with physics software feedback may be extended to other theoretical model-building problems in the future.</description>

      <title>Causal Decomposition Analysis with Synergistic Interventions: A Triply-Robust Machine Learning Approach to Addressing Multiple Dimensions of Social Disparities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Educational disparities are rooted in and perpetuate social inequalities across multiple dimensions such as race, socioeconomic status, and geography. To reduce disparities, most intervention strategies focus on a single domain and frequently evaluate their effectiveness by using causal decomposition analysis. However, a growing body of research suggests that single-domain interventions may be insufficient for individuals marginalized on multiple fronts. While interventions across multiple domains are increasingly proposed, there is limited guidance on appropriate methods for evaluating their effectiveness. To address this gap, we develop an extended causal decomposition analysis that simultaneously targets multiple causally ordered intervening factors, allowing for the assessment of their synergistic effects. These scenarios often involve challenges related to model misspecification due to complex interactions among group categories, intervening factors, and their confounders with the outcome. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a triply robust estimator that leverages machine learning techniques to address potential model misspecification. We apply our method to a cohort of students from the High School Longitudinal Study, focusing on math achievement disparities between Black, Hispanic, and White high schoolers. Specifically, we examine how two sequential interventions - equalizing the proportion of students who attend high-performing schools and equalizing enrollment in Algebra I by 9th grade across racial groups - may reduce these disparities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many applications of optimal transport (OT), the object of primary interest is the optimal transport map. This map rearranges mass from one probability distribution to another in the most efficient way possible by minimizing a specified cost. In this paper we review recent advances in estimating and developing limit theorems for the OT map, using samples from the underlying distributions. We also review parallel lines of work that establish similar results for special cases and variants of the basic OT setup. We conclude with a discussion of key directions for future research with the goal of providing practitioners with reliable inferential tools.</description>

      <title>Riemannian generative decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Riemannian representation learning typically relies on approximating densities on chosen manifolds. This involves optimizing difficult objectives, potentially harming models. To completely circumvent this issue, we introduce the Riemannian generative decoder which finds manifold-valued maximum likelihood latents with a Riemannian optimizer while training a decoder network. By discarding the encoder, we vastly simplify the manifold constraint compared to current approaches which often only handle few specific manifolds. We validate our approach on three case studies -- a synthetic branching diffusion process, human migrations inferred from mitochondrial DNA, and cells undergoing a cell division cycle -- each showing that learned representations respect the prescribed geometry and capture intrinsic non-Euclidean structure. Our method requires only a decoder, is compatible with existing architectures, and yields interpretable latent spaces aligned with data geometry.</description>

      <title>Inferring Diffusion Structures of Heterogeneous Network Cascade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network cascade refers to diffusion processes in which outcome changes within part of an interconnected population trigger a sequence of changes across the entire network. These cascades are governed by underlying diffusion networks, which are often latent. Inferring such networks is critical for understanding cascade pathways, uncovering Granger causality of interaction mechanisms among individuals, and enabling tasks such as forecasting or maximizing information propagation. In this project, we propose a novel double mixture directed graph model for inferring multi-layer diffusion networks from cascade data. The proposed model represents cascade pathways as a mixture of diffusion networks across different layers, effectively capturing the strong heterogeneity present in real-world cascades. Additionally, the model imposes layer-specific structural constraints, enabling diffusion networks at different layers to capture complementary cascading patterns at the population level. A key advantage of our model is its convex formulation, which allows us to establish both statistical and computational guarantees for the resulting diffusion network estimates. We conduct extensive simulation studies to demonstrate the model's performance in recovering diverse diffusion structures. Finally, we apply the proposed method to analyze cascades of research topics in the social sciences across U.S. universities, revealing the underlying diffusion networks of research topic propagation among institutions.</description>

      <title>From Minimax Optimal Importance Sampling to Uniformly Ergodic Importance-tempered MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We make two closely related theoretical contributions to the use of importance sampling schemes. First, for independent sampling, we prove that the minimax optimal trial distribution coincides with the target if and only if the target distribution has no atom with probability greater than $1/2$, where "minimax" means that the worst-case asymptotic variance of the self-normalized importance sampling estimator is minimized. When a large atom exists, it should be downweighted by the trial distribution. A similar phenomenon holds for a continuous target distribution concentrated on a small set. Second, we argue that it is often advantageous to run the Metropolis--Hastings algorithm with a tempered stationary distribution, $\pi(x)^\beta$, and correct for the bias by importance weighting. The dynamics of this "importance-tempered" sampling scheme can be described by a continuous-time Markov chain. We prove that for one-dimensional targets with polynomial tails, $\pi(x) \propto (1 + |x|)^{-\gamma}$, this chain is uniformly ergodic if and only if $1/\gamma &lt; \beta &lt; (\gamma - 2)/\gamma$. These results suggest that for target distributions with light or polynomial tails of order $\gamma &gt; 3$, importance tempering can improve the precision of time-average estimators and essentially eliminate the need for burn-in.</description>

      <title>Fully lifted \emph{blirp} interpolation -- a large deviation view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [104] introduced a powerful \emph{fully lifted} (fl) statistical interpolating mechanism. It established a nested connection between blirps (bilinearly indexed random processes) and their decoupled (linearly indexed) comparative counterparts. We here revisit the comparison from [104] and introduce its a \emph{large deviation} upgrade. The new machinery allows to substantially widen the [104]'s range of applicability. In addition to \emph{typical}, studying analytically much harder \emph{atypical} random structures features is now possible as well. To give a bit of a practical flavor, we show how the obtained results connect to the so-called \emph{local entropies} (LE) and their predicated role in understanding solutions clustering and associated \emph{computational gaps} in hard random optimization problems. As was the case in [104], even though the technical considerations often appear as fairly involved, the final interpolating forms admit elegant expressions thereby providing a relatively easy to use tool readily available for further studies. Moreover, as the considered models encompass all well known random structures discussed in [104], the obtained results automatically apply to them as well.</description>

      <title>A large deviation view of \emph{stationarized} fully lifted blirp interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider \emph{bilinearly indexed random processes} (blirp) and study their interpolating comparative mechanisms. Generic introduction of the \emph{fully lifted} (fl) blirp interpolation in [105] was followed by a corresponding stationarization counterpart in [103]. A \emph{large deviation} upgrade of [105] introduced in companion paper [106] is complemented here with the corresponding one of [103]. Similarly to [106], the mechanism that we introduce extends the range of [103]'s applicability so that it encompasses random structures \emph{atypical} features. Among others these include the \emph{local entropies} (LE) which explain atypical solutions clusterings in hard random optimization problems believed to be directly responsible for the presumable existence of the so-called \emph{computational gaps}. Moreover (and similar to [105]), despite on occasion somewhat involved technical considerations, the final forms of the uncovered fundamental interpolating parameters relations are rather elegant and as such provide a valuable tool readily available for further use.</description>

      <title>Duality and Policy Evaluation in Distributionally Robust Bayesian Diffusion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Bayesian diffusion control problem of expected terminal utility maximization. The controller imposes a prior distribution on the unknown drift of an underlying diffusion. The Bayesian optimal control, tracking the posterior distribution of the unknown drift, can be characterized explicitly. However, in practice, the prior will generally be incorrectly specified, and the degree of model misspecification can have a significant impact on policy performance. To mitigate this and reduce overpessimism, we introduce a distributionally robust Bayesian control (DRBC) formulation in which the controller plays a game against an adversary who selects a prior in divergence neighborhood of a baseline prior. The adversarial approach has been studied in economics and efficient algorithms have been proposed in static optimization settings. We develop a strong duality result for our DRBC formulation. Combining these results together with tools from stochastic analysis, we are able to derive a loss that can be efficiently trained (as we demonstrate in our numerical experiments) using a suitable neural network architecture. As a result, we obtain an effective algorithm for computing the DRBC optimal strategy. The methodology for computing the DRBC optimal strategy is greatly simplified, as we show, in the important case in which the adversary chooses a prior from a Kullback-Leibler distributional uncertainty set.</description>

      <title>In-Context Occam's Razor: How Transformers Prefer Simpler Hypotheses on the Fly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables transformers to adapt to new tasks through contextual examples without parameter updates. While existing research has typically studied ICL in fixed-complexity environments, practical language models encounter tasks spanning diverse complexity levels. This paper investigates how transformers navigate hierarchical task structures where higher-complexity categories can perfectly represent any pattern generated by simpler ones. We design well-controlled testbeds based on Markov chains and linear regression that reveal transformers not only identify the appropriate complexity level for each task but also accurately infer the corresponding parameters--even when the in-context examples are compatible with multiple complexity hypotheses. Notably, when presented with data generated by simpler processes, transformers consistently favor the least complex sufficient explanation. We theoretically explain this behavior through a Bayesian framework, demonstrating that transformers effectively implement an in-context Bayesian Occam's razor by balancing model fit against complexity penalties. We further ablate on the roles of model size, training mixture distribution, inference context length, and architecture. Finally, we validate this Occam's razor-like inductive bias on a pretrained GPT-4 model with Boolean-function tasks as case study, suggesting it may be inherent to transformers trained on diverse task distributions.</description>

      <title>Iterative Quantum Feature Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning models that leverage quantum circuits as quantum feature maps (QFMs) are recognized for their enhanced expressive power in learning tasks. Such models have demonstrated rigorous end-to-end quantum speedups for specific families of classification problems. However, deploying deep QFMs on real quantum hardware remains challenging due to circuit noise and hardware constraints. Additionally, variational quantum algorithms often suffer from computational bottlenecks, particularly in accurate gradient estimation, which significantly increases quantum resource demands during training. We propose Iterative Quantum Feature Maps (IQFMs), a hybrid quantum-classical framework that constructs a deep architecture by iteratively connecting shallow QFMs with classically computed augmentation weights. By incorporating contrastive learning and a layer-wise training mechanism, IQFMs effectively reduces quantum runtime and mitigates noise-induced degradation. In tasks involving noisy quantum data, numerical experiments show that IQFMs outperforms quantum convolutional neural networks, without requiring the optimization of variational quantum parameters. Even for a typical classical image classification benchmark, a carefully designed IQFMs achieves performance comparable to that of classical neural networks. This framework presents a promising path to address current limitations and harness the full potential of quantum-enhanced machine learning.</description>

      <title>Overtuning in Hyperparameter Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) aims to identify an optimal hyperparameter configuration (HPC) such that the resulting model generalizes well to unseen data. As the expected generalization error cannot be optimized directly, it is estimated with a resampling strategy, such as holdout or cross-validation. This approach implicitly assumes that minimizing the validation error leads to improved generalization. However, since validation error estimates are inherently stochastic and depend on the resampling strategy, a natural question arises: Can excessive optimization of the validation error lead to overfitting at the HPO level, akin to overfitting in model training based on empirical risk minimization? In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon, which we term overtuning, a form of overfitting specific to HPO. Despite its practical relevance, overtuning has received limited attention in the HPO and AutoML literature. We provide a formal definition of overtuning and distinguish it from related concepts such as meta-overfitting. We then conduct a large-scale reanalysis of HPO benchmark data to assess the prevalence and severity of overtuning. Our results show that overtuning is more common than previously assumed, typically mild but occasionally severe. In approximately 10% of cases, overtuning leads to the selection of a seemingly optimal HPC with worse generalization error than the default or first configuration tried. We further analyze how factors such as performance metric, resampling strategy, dataset size, learning algorithm, and HPO method affect overtuning and discuss mitigation strategies. Our results highlight the need to raise awareness of overtuning, particularly in the small-data regime, indicating that further mitigation strategies should be studied.</description>

      <title>Operator Forces For Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations extend the length and time scale of atomistic simulations by replacing groups of correlated atoms with CG beads. Machine-learned coarse-graining (MLCG) has recently emerged as a promising approach to construct highly accurate force fields for CG molecular dynamics. However, the calibration of MLCG force fields typically hinges on force matching, which demands extensive reference atomistic trajectories with corresponding force labels. In practice, atomistic forces are often not recorded, making traditional force matching infeasible on pre-existing datasets. Recently, noise-based kernels have been introduced to adapt force matching to the low-data regime, including situations in which reference atomistic forces are not present. While this approach produces force fields which recapitulate slow collective motion, it introduces significant local distortions due to the corrupting effects of the noise-based kernel. In this work, we introduce more general kernels based on normalizing flows that substantially reduce these local distortions while preserving global conformational accuracy. We demonstrate our method on small proteins, showing that flow-based kernels can generate high-quality CG forces solely from configurational samples.</description>

      <title>Conservative quantum offline model-based optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline model-based optimization (MBO) refers to the task of optimizing a black-box objective function using only a fixed set of prior input-output data, without any active experimentation. Recent work has introduced quantum extremal learning (QEL), which leverages the expressive power of variational quantum circuits to learn accurate surrogate functions by training on a few data points. However, as widely studied in the classical machine learning literature, predictive models may incorrectly extrapolate objective values in unexplored regions, leading to the selection of overly optimistic solutions. In this paper, we propose integrating QEL with conservative objective models (COM) - a regularization technique aimed at ensuring cautious predictions on out-of-distribution inputs. The resulting hybrid algorithm, COM-QEL, builds on the expressive power of quantum neural networks while safeguarding generalization via conservative modeling. Empirical results on benchmark optimization tasks demonstrate that COM-QEL reliably finds solutions with higher true objective values compared to the original QEL, validating its superiority for offline design problems.</description>

      <title>Geometric-Aware Variational Inference: Robust and Adaptive Regularization with Directional Weight Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks require principled uncertainty quantification, yet existing variational inference methods often employ isotropic Gaussian approximations in weight space that poorly match the network's inherent geometry. We address this mismatch by introducing Concentration-Adapted Perturbations (CAP), a variational framework that models weight uncertainties directly on the unit hypersphere using von Mises-Fisher distributions. Building on recent work in radial-directional posterior decompositions and spherical weight constraints, CAP provides the first complete theoretical framework connecting directional statistics to practical noise regularization in neural networks. Our key contribution is an analytical derivation linking vMF concentration parameters to activation noise variance, enabling each layer to learn its optimal uncertainty level through a novel closed-form KL divergence regularizer. In experiments on CIFAR-10, CAP significantly improves model calibration - reducing Expected Calibration Error by 5.6x - while providing interpretable layer-wise uncertainty profiles. CAP requires minimal computational overhead and integrates seamlessly into standard architectures, offering a theoretically grounded yet practical approach to uncertainty quantification in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Noise Consistency Training: A Native Approach for One-Step Generator in Learning Additional Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of efficient and controllable high-quality content generation remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC). While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation techniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency, adapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints, semantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge. Conventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive modifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This paper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight approach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step generators without requiring access to original training images or retraining the base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and employs a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss aligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are conditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to the new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as minimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the conditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular, data-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step generator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass, surpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both generation quality and computational efficiency.

      <description>arXiv:2506.19755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model regularization requires extensive manual tuning to balance complexity against overfitting. Cross-regularization resolves this tradeoff by directly adapting regularization parameters through validation gradients during training. The method splits parameter optimization - training data guides feature learning while validation data shapes complexity controls - converging provably to cross-validation optima. When implemented through noise injection in neural networks, this approach reveals striking patterns: unexpectedly high noise tolerance and architecture-specific regularization that emerges organically during training. Beyond complexity control, the framework integrates seamlessly with data augmentation, uncertainty calibration and growing datasets while maintaining single-run efficiency through a simple gradient-based approach.</description>

      <title>Exact Matrix Seriation through Mathematical Optimization: Stress and Effectiveness-Based Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix seriation, the problem of permuting the rows and columns of a matrix to uncover latent structure, is a fundamental technique in data science, particularly in the visualization and analysis of relational data. Applications span clustering, anomaly detection, and beyond. In this work, we present a unified framework grounded in mathematical optimization to address matrix seriation from a rigorous, model-based perspective. Our approach leverages combinatorial and mixed-integer optimization to represent seriation objectives and constraints with high fidelity, bridging the gap between traditional heuristic methods and exact solution techniques.
  We introduce new mathematical programming models for neighborhood-based stress criteria, including nonlinear formulations and their linearized counterparts. For structured settings such as Moore and von Neumann neighborhoods, we develop a novel Hamiltonian path-based reformulation that enables effective control over spatial arrangement and interpretability in the reordered matrix.
  To assess the practical impact of our models, we carry out an extensive set of experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, as well as on a newly curated benchmark based on a coauthorship network from the matrix seriation literature. Our results show that these optimization-based formulations not only enhance solution quality and interpretability but also provide a versatile foundation for extending matrix seriation to new domains in data science.</description>

      <title>Constructive Universal Approximation and Finite Sample Memorization by Narrow Deep ReLU Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fully constructive analysis of deep ReLU neural networks for classification and function approximation tasks. First, we prove that any dataset with $N$ distinct points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $M$ output classes can be exactly classified using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) of width $2$ and depth at most $2N + 4M - 1$, with all network parameters constructed explicitly. This result is sharp with respect to width and is interpreted through the lens of simultaneous or ensemble controllability in discrete nonlinear dynamics.
  Second, we show that these explicit constructions yield uniform bounds on the parameter norms and, in particular, provide upper estimates for minimizers of standard regularized training loss functionals in supervised learning. As the regularization parameter vanishes, the trained networks converge to exact classifiers with bounded norm, explaining the effectiveness of overparameterized training in the small-regularization regime.
  We also prove a universal approximation theorem in $L^p(\Omega; \mathbb{R}_+)$ for any bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and $p \in [1, \infty)$, using MLPs of fixed width $d + 1$. The proof is constructive, geometrically motivated, and provides explicit estimates on the network depth when the target function belongs to the Sobolev space $W^{1,p}$. We also extend the approximation and depth estimation results to $L^p(\Omega; \mathbb{R}^m)$ for any $m \geq 1$.
  Our results offer a unified and interpretable framework connecting controllability, expressivity, and training dynamics in deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>Do Vendi Scores Converge with Finite Samples? Truncated Vendi Score for Finite-Sample Convergence Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21719v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating the diversity of generative models without reference data poses methodological challenges. The reference-free Vendi and RKE scores address this by quantifying the diversity of generated data using matrix-based entropy measures. Among these two, the Vendi score is typically computed via the eigendecomposition of an $n \times n$ kernel matrix constructed from n generated samples. However, the prohibitive computational cost of eigendecomposition for large $n$ often limits the number of samples used to fewer than 20,000. In this paper, we investigate the statistical convergence of the Vendi and RKE scores under restricted sample sizes. We numerically demonstrate that, in general, the Vendi score computed with standard sample sizes below 20,000 may not converge to its asymptotic value under infinite sampling. To address this, we introduce the $t$-truncated Vendi score by truncating the eigenspectrum of the kernel matrix, which is provably guaranteed to converge to its population limit with $n=\mathcal{O}(t)$ samples. We further show that existing Nystr\"om and FKEA approximation methods converge to the asymptotic limit of the truncated Vendi score. In contrast to the Vendi score, we prove that the RKE score enjoys universal convergence guarantees across all kernel functions. We conduct several numerical experiments to illustrate the concentration of Nystr\"om and FKEA computed Vendi scores around the truncated Vendi score, and we analyze how the truncated Vendi and RKE scores correlate with the diversity of image and text data.

      <title>Continuous Bayesian Model Selection for Multivariate Causal Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current causal discovery approaches require restrictive model assumptions in the absence of interventional data to ensure structure identifiability. These assumptions often do not hold in real-world applications leading to a loss of guarantees and poor performance in practice. Recent work has shown that, in the bivariate case, Bayesian model selection can greatly improve performance by exchanging restrictive modelling for more flexible assumptions, at the cost of a small probability of making an error. Our work shows that this approach is useful in the important multivariate case as well. We propose a scalable algorithm leveraging a continuous relaxation of the discrete model selection problem. Specifically, we employ the Causal Gaussian Process Conditional Density Estimator (CGP-CDE) as a Bayesian non-parametric model, using its hyperparameters to construct an adjacency matrix. This matrix is then optimised using the marginal likelihood and an acyclicity regulariser, giving the maximum a posteriori causal graph. We demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach, showing it is advantageous to perform multivariate causal discovery without infeasible assumptions using Bayesian model selection.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Proofs for Diffusion Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides an elementary, self-contained analysis of diffusion-based sampling methods for generative modeling. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on continuous-time processes and then discretize, our treatment works directly with discrete-time stochastic processes and yields precise non-asymptotic convergence guarantees under broad assumptions. The key insight is to couple the sampling process of interest with an idealized comparison process that has an explicit Gaussian-convolution structure. We then leverage simple identities from information theory, including the I-MMSE relationship, to bound the discrepancy (in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence) between these two discrete-time processes. In particular, we show that, if the diffusion step sizes are chosen sufficiently small and one can approximate certain conditional mean estimators well, then the sampling distribution is provably close to the target distribution. Our results also provide a transparent view on how to accelerate convergence by using additional randomness in each step to match higher-order moments in the comparison process.</description>

      <title>Robust Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for Large Language Models Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03784v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key technique for aligning the output of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. To learn the reward function, most existing RLHF algorithms use the Bradley-Terry model, which relies on assumptions about human preferences that may not reflect the complexity and variability of real-world judgments. In this paper, we propose a robust algorithm to enhance the performance of existing approaches under such reward model misspecifications. Theoretically, our algorithm reduces the variance of reward and policy estimators, leading to improved regret bounds. Empirical evaluations on LLM benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms existing methods, with 77-81% of responses being favored over baselines on the Anthropic Helpful and Harmless dataset.</description>

      <title>Double Machine Learning for Conditional Moment Restrictions: IV Regression, Proximal Causal Learning and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving conditional moment restrictions (CMRs) is a key problem considered in statistics, causal inference, and econometrics, where the aim is to solve for a function of interest that satisfies some conditional moment equalities. Specifically, many techniques for causal inference, such as instrumental variable (IV) regression and proximal causal learning (PCL), are CMR problems. Most CMR estimators use a two-stage approach, where the first-stage estimation is directly plugged into the second stage to estimate the function of interest. However, naively plugging in the first-stage estimator can cause heavy bias in the second stage. This is particularly the case for recently proposed CMR estimators that use deep neural network (DNN) estimators for both stages, where regularisation and overfitting bias is present. We propose DML-CMR, a two-stage CMR estimator that provides an unbiased estimate with fast convergence rate guarantees. We derive a novel learning objective to reduce bias and develop the DML-CMR algorithm following the double/debiased machine learning (DML) framework. We show that our DML-CMR estimator can achieve the minimax optimal convergence rate of $O(N^{-1/2})$ under parameterisation and mild regularity conditions, where $N$ is the sample size. We apply DML-CMR to a range of problems using DNN estimators, including IV regression and proximal causal learning on real-world datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance against existing CMR estimators and algorithms tailored to those problems.</description>

      <title>Iterative Minimax Games with Coupled Linear Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.04672v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of nonconvex minimax games has gained significant momentum in machine learning and decision science communities due to their fundamental connections to adversarial training scenarios. This work develops a primal-dual alternating proximal gradient (PDAPG) algorithm framework for resolving iterative minimax games featuring nonsmooth nonconvex objectives subject to coupled linear constraints. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees for both nonconvex-strongly concave and nonconvex-concave game configurations, demonstrating that PDAPG achieves an $\varepsilon$-stationary solution within $\mathcal{O}\left( \varepsilon ^{-2} \right)$ iterations for strongly concave settings and $\mathcal{O}\left( \varepsilon ^{-4} \right)$ iterations for concave scenarios. Our analysis provides the first known iteration complexity bounds for this class of constrained minimax games, particularly addressing the critical challenge of coupled linear constraints that induce inherent interdependencies among strategy variables. The proposed game-theoretic framework advances existing solution methodologies by simultaneously handling nonsmooth components and coordinated constraint structures through alternating primal-dual updates.</description>

      <title>ANOVA-boosting for Random Fourier Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose two algorithms for boosting random Fourier feature models for approximating high-dimensional functions. These methods utilize the classical and generalized analysis of variance (ANOVA) decomposition to learn low-order functions, where there are few interactions between the variables. Our algorithms are able to find an index set of important input variables and variable interactions reliably. Furthermore, we generalize already existing random Fourier feature models to an ANOVA setting, where terms of different order can be used. Our algorithms have the advantage of interpretability, meaning that the influence of every input variable is known in the learned model, even for dependent input variables. We give theoretical as well as numerical results that our algorithms perform well for sensitivity analysis. The ANOVA-boosting step reduces the approximation error of existing methods significantly.</description>

      <title>Tree-based variational inference for Poisson log-normal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17361v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When studying ecosystems, hierarchical trees are often used to organize entities based on proximity criteria, such as the taxonomy in microbiology, social classes in geography, or product types in retail businesses, offering valuable insights into entity relationships. Despite their significance, current count-data models do not leverage this structured information. In particular, the widely used Poisson log-normal (PLN) model, known for its ability to model interactions between entities from count data, lacks the possibility to incorporate such hierarchical tree structures, limiting its applicability in domains characterized by such complexities. To address this matter, we introduce the PLN-Tree model as an extension of the PLN model, specifically designed for modeling hierarchical count data. By integrating structured variational inference techniques, we propose an adapted training procedure and establish identifiability results, enhancing both theoretical foundations and practical interpretability. Experiments on synthetic datasets and human gut microbiome data highlight generative improvements when using PLN-Tree, demonstrating the practical interest of knowledge graphs like the taxonomy in microbiome modeling. Additionally, we present a proof-of-concept implication of the identifiability results by illustrating the practical benefits of using identifiable features for classification tasks, showcasing the versatility of the framework.</description>

      <title>An accuracy-runtime trade-off comparison of scalable Gaussian process approximations for spatial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are flexible, probabilistic, non-parametric models widely employed in various fields such as spatial statistics and machine learning. A drawback of Gaussian processes is their computational cost having $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ time and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ memory complexity which makes them prohibitive for large data sets. Numerous approximation techniques have been proposed to address this limitation. In this work, we systematically compare the accuracy of different Gaussian process approximations concerning likelihood evaluation, parameter estimation, and prediction taking into account the computational time required to perform these tasks. In other words, we analyze the trade-off between accuracy and runtime on multiple simulated and large-scale real-world data sets. We find that Vecchia approximations consistently emerge as the most accurate in almost all experiments.</description>

      <title>Fourier Multi-Component and Multi-Layer Neural Networks: Unlocking High-Frequency Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The architecture of a neural network and the selection of its activation function are both fundamental to its performance. Equally vital is ensuring these two elements are well-matched, as their alignment is key to achieving effective representation and learning. In this paper, we introduce the Fourier Multi-Component and Multi-Layer Neural Network (FMMNN), a novel model that creates a strong synergy between them. We demonstrate that FMMNNs are highly effective and flexible in modeling high-frequency components. Our theoretical results demonstrate that FMMNNs have exponential expressive power for function approximation. We also analyze the optimization landscape of FMMNNs and find it to be much more favorable than that of standard fully connected neural networks, especially when dealing with high-frequency features. In addition, we propose a scaled random initialization method for the first layer's weights in FMMNNs, which significantly speeds up training and enhances overall performance. Extensive numerical experiments support our theoretical insights, showing that FMMNNs consistently outperform traditional approaches in accuracy and efficiency across various tasks.</description>

      <title>The Gittins Index: A Design Principle for Decision-Making Under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to minimizing tail latency in queues.</description>
