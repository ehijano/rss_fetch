      <title>Consecutive-gap ratio distribution for crossover ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of spectrum statistics, such as the consecutive-gap ratio distribution, has revealed many interesting properties of many-body complex systems. Here we propose a two-parameter surmise expression for such distribution to describe the crossover between the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) and Poisson statistics. This crossover is observed in the isotropic Heisenberg spin-$1/2$ chain with disordered local field, exhibiting the Many-Body Localization (MBL) transition. Inspired by the analysis of stability in dynamical systems, this crossover is presented as a flow pattern in the parameter space, with the Poisson statistics being the fixed point of the system, which represents the MBL phase. We also analyze an isotropic Heisenberg spin-$1/2$ chain with disordered local exchange coupling and a zero magnetic field. In this case, the system never achieves the MBL phase because of the spin rotation symmetry. This case is more sensitive to finite-size effects than the previous one, and thus the flow pattern resembles a two-dimensional random walk close to its fixed point. We propose a system of linearized stochastic differential equations to estimate this fixed point. We study the continuous-state Markov process that governs the probability of finding the system close to this fixed point as the disorder strength increases. In addition, we discuss the conditions under which the stationary probability distribution is given by a bivariate normal distribution.</description>

      <title>Interacting Hysterons with Asymptotically Small or Large Spans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of interacting hysteretic elements, called hysterons, capture the sequential response and complex memory effects in a wide range of complex systems and can guide the design of intelligent metamaterials. However, even simple models with few hysterons feature a bewildering number and variety of behaviors. Here we study the hysteron model in two physically relevant limits, where {the} response {of a hysteron system} is easier to understand. First, when the hysteron span - the gap between its two hysteretic transitions - dominates all other scales, the range of pathways encoded in transition graphs (t-graphs) becomes limited because many avalanches {are} absent. Second, when the hysteron span becomes vanishingly small, hysterons behave as interacting binary spins, {which require avalanches in order to} exhibit nontrivial pathways. Finally we show that hysterons can be mimicked by pairs of strongly interacting spins, {such} that collections of $n$ interacting hysterons can be mapped to $2n$ interacting spins, albeit {via} highly specific interactions. {Altogether,} our work provides a deeper understanding of the role of the hysteron parameters on their collective behavior, and points to connections and differences between spin- and hysteron-based models of complex matter.</description>

      <title>Exponents and front fluctuations in the quenched Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class of one and two dimensional interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have simulated an automaton version of the quenched Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (qKPZ) equation in one and two dimensions in order to study the scaling properties of the interface at the depinning transition. Specifically, the $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\theta$, and $\delta$ critical exponents characterizing the surface kinetic roughening and depinning behaviors have been directly computed from the simulations. In addition, by studying the height-difference correlation function in real space, we have also been able to directly compute the dynamic correlation length and its associated dynamic critical exponent $z$. The full sets of scaling exponents are largely compatible with those of the Directed Percolation Depinning universality class for one and two dimensional interfaces. Furthermore, we have computed numerically the probability density function (PDF) of the front fluctuations in the growth regime, finding its asymptotic form in one and two dimensions. While the PDF features strongly non-Gaussian skewness and kurtosis values, it also differs from the PDF of the KPZ equation with time-dependent noise for physical substrate dimensions, both in the central part and at the tails of the distribution.</description>

      <title>Photonics-Enhanced Graph Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonics can offer a hardware-native route for machine learning (ML). However, efficient deployment of photonics-enhanced ML requires hybrid workflows that integrate optical processing with conventional CPU/GPU based neural network architectures. Here, we propose such a workflow that combines photonic positional embeddings (PEs) with advanced graph ML models. We introduce a photonics-based method that augments graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with PEs derived from light propagation on synthetic frequency lattices whose couplings match the input graph. We simulate propagation and readout to obtain internode intensity correlation matrices, which are used as PEs in GCNs to provide global structural information. Evaluated on Long Range Graph Benchmark molecular datasets, the method outperforms baseline GCNs with Laplacian based PEs, achieving $6.3\%$ lower mean absolute error for regression and $2.3\%$ higher average precision for classification tasks using a two-layer GCN as a baseline. When implemented in high repetition rate photonic hardware, correlation measurements can enable fast feature generation by bypassing digital simulation of PEs. Our results show that photonic PEs improve GCN performance and support optical acceleration of graph ML.</description>

      <title>Dynamical stability for dense patterns in discrete attractor neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks storing multiple discrete attractors are canonical models of biological memory. Previously, the dynamical stability of such networks could only be guaranteed under highly restrictive conditions. Here, we derive a theory of the local stability of discrete fixed points in a broad class of networks with graded neural activities and in the presence of noise. By directly analyzing the bulk and the outliers of the Jacobian spectrum, we show that all fixed points are stable below a critical load that is distinct from the classical \textit{critical capacity} and depends on the statistics of neural activities in the fixed points as well as the single-neuron activation function. Our analysis highlights the computational benefits of threshold-linear activation and sparse-like patterns.</description>

      <title>A note on the dynamics of extended-context disordered kinetic spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by striking advances in language modeling, there has recently been much interest in developing autogressive sequence models that are amenable to analytical study. In this short note, we consider extensions of simple disordered kinetic glass models from statistical physics. These models have tunable correlations, are easy to sample, and can be solved exactly when the state space dimension is large. In particular, we give an expository derivation of the dynamical mean field theories that describe their asymptotic statistics. We therefore propose that they constitute an interesting set of toy models for autoregressive sequence generation, in which one might study learning dynamics.</description>

      <title>Uncovering origins of heterogeneous superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using quantum sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The family of nickelate superconductors have long been explored as analogs of the high temperature cuprates. Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \emph{in situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged \emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the sub-micron pixel scale.</description>
