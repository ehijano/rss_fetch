      <title>Superconducting Berry Curvature Dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity and Bloch band Berry curvature responses represent two distinct paradigms of quantum coherent phenomena. The former relies on the collective motion of a many-body state while the latter proceeds from the momentum-space winding of Bloch wavefunctions. Here we reveal a superconducting Berry curvature dipole (BCD) that arises as a collective many-body phenomena in noncentrosymmetric superconductors. Strikingly, we find the superconducting BCD is sensitive to the phase of the superconducting gap and depends on the noncentrosymmetric structure of its pairing. This unusual property enables a BCD proximity effect in hybrid quantum materials that induces nonreciprocity even in a target centrosymmetric metal. We find superconducting BCD naturally produces nonreciprocal electromagnetic responses that includes a giant second-order nonlinearity. This renders noncentrosymmetric superconductors an exciting platform for realizing pronounced nonlinearities and its BCD responses a novel diagnostic of the superconducting gap.</description>

      <title>Topological electronic structure and electronic nematicity in candidate kagome superconductors, ATi$_{3}$Bi$_{5}$ (A = Rb, Cs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The newly discovered family of titanium-based kagome metals, ATi$_{3}$Bi$_{5}$ (where A can be Rb or Cs), has been found to exhibit non-trivial band topology and fascinating electronic instabilities, including electronic nematicity and potential bulk superconductivity. Distinct from their vanadium-based counterparts (AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$), which display a charge density wave (CDW) phase that already breaks rotational symmetry, ATi$_{3}$Bi$_{5}$ shows no evidence of CDW, providing a unique platform to study nematicity in its pure form and its interplay with other correlated quantum phenomena, such as superconductivity. In this review, we highlight recent progress in both experimental and theoretical research on ATi$_{3}$Bi$_{5}$ and discuss the unresolved questions and challenges in this burgeoning field.</description>

      <title>Spin Transport in Normal Metal-Ising Superconductor Junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of spin-orbit coupling and superconductivity induces unconventional spin-triplet correlation in Ising superconductors. We theoretically investigate the spin transport through a normal metal-Ising superconductor junction, showing that Ising superconductors also have the characteristic of spin superconductivity.Due to the existence of spin-triplet Cooper pairs, not only charge supercurrent but also spin supercurrent can transport in Ising superconductors.We analyze the transport process in the junction which is mainly contributed by the equal-spin Andreev reflection and spin-flip reflection, and calculate the spin conductance and the spin injection efficiency under different conditions.Our findings broaden the boundary of spin superconductivity and reveal the potential applications of Ising superconductors in spintronics, especially in controlled long-distance dissipationless spin transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Andreev reflection in a normal metal/charge-4e superconductor junction.Compare with the electron-hole conversion in normal charge-2e superconductors, here four electrons participate simultaneously, enriching the possibility of conversion ways.Using nonequilibrium Green's function method, we obtain a four-particle-type Laudauer-B\"uttiker formula with generalized charge-4e anomalous Green's function to describe it.We then calculate and clarify the behavior of the Andreev coefficient with various incident energy and show the conductance contributed by it.Our research makes up the blank of research for transport property of charge-4e superconductors and can be served as hallmarks for future experimental verifications.</description>

      <title>Spin phase regulated spin Josephson supercurrent in topological superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Without applied bias voltage, a superconducting phase difference can drive a charge Josephson supercurrent in a superconductor junction. In analogy, we here theoretically propose a spin phase that intrinsically generates spin Josephson supercurrent, and this spin Josephson effect is studied in a junction of superconducting nanowire (SNW). We show that spin-orbit coupling and magnetic field give rise to spin-triplet superconductivity in the SNW, thus allow the superfluid of both charge and spin. Next we introduce the concept of spin phase that can be generated by controls of spin current, magnetic field or electric field. By the analysis of pairing correlations and Ginzburg-Landau-type theory, it is shown that the spin phase makes spin-up and spin-down $S=1$ Cooper pairs get opposite phases and move oppositely in a Josephson junction, so that a dissipationless pure spin current is induced. We also derive the formula that the spin current is equal to the derivative of Andreev bound state to the spin phase, which is analogous to that of charge Josephson effect. At last, our calculation verifies the existence of spin supercurrent inside the superconducting gap in the topologically nontrivial phase. Our study provides a view on spin Josephson effect and indicates the potential combination of topological superconductivity and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in Janus IV-B transition metal chalcogenide hydrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional Janus transition-metal chalcogenide -hydrides (2D-JTMCs) feature a three layered structure, with a central layer of transition metal atoms, with chalcogenides below and hydogens above. This asymmetry endows 2D-JTMCs with unique and tunable electronic, optical, and mechanical properties. In this paper, we systematically investigate two-dimensional hexagonal 2H and 1T Janus transition metal chalcogenide (JTMC) hydrides (MXH), with M = Ti, Zr, Hf, and X = S, Se, Te. These JTMCs exhibit metallic behavior with single band crossings at the Fermi level, primarily dominated by transition metal d orbitals and phonon stability, evidenced by DFPT calculations. We estimate Tc using the Allen-Dynes formula and the closing superconducting gap by solving anisotropic gap equations of the Migdal-Eliashberg equations. Calculated Tc values for these materials range from 10 K to 35 K.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Inductance and nonlinearity of MgB2 Films at 4K</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the fabrication and characterization of superconducting magnesium diboride (MgB$_2$) thin films intended for quantum-limited devices based non-linear kinetic inductance (NLKI) such as parametric amplifiers with either elevated operating temperatures or expanded frequency ranges. In order to characterize the MgB$_2$ material properties, we have fabricated coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission lines and microwave resonators using $\approx$ 40 nm thick MgB$_2$ films with a measured kinetic inductance of $\sim$ 5.5 pH/$\square$ and internal quality factors, $Q_i \approx 3 \times 10^4$ at 4.2 K. We measure the NLKI in MgB$_2$ by applying a DC bias to a 6 cm long by 4 $\mu$m wide CPW transmission line, and measuring the resulting phase delay caused by the current dependent NLKI. We also measure the current dependent NLKI through CPW resonators that shift down in frequency with increased power applied through the CPW feedline. Using these measurements, we calculate the characteristic non-linear current parameter, $I_*$, for multiple CPW geometries. We find values for corresponding current density, $J_* = 12-22$~MA/cm$^2$ and a ratio of the critical current to the non-linear current parameter, $I_C/I_* = 0.14-0.26$, similar to or higher than values for other superconductors such as NbTiN and TiN.</description>

      <title>Procedures for proper validation of record critical current density claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High critical current density Jc is generally the most important property of any superconductor used for applications. The critical current Ic is most frequently measured by transport 4 probe V-I techniques and the measured Ic is then divided by the cross-sectional area to give the critical current density Jc. This method is normally error-free. Occasionally however, Ic and Jc are computed from measurements of the magnetic moment and two recent papers (Goyal et al. 2024 Nat. Commun. 15, 6523 and Polichetti et al. 2024 arXiv:2410.09197) illustrate some of the perils of reporting properties of REBa2Cu3O7-{\delta} (REBCO) films grown on a coated conductor substrate using only magnetic evaluations. Correct data analysis is made difficult by the persistent use of cgs units in commercial instrument outputs and by misapplication of handbook Bean model formulae, which in this case led to an order of magnitude Jc overestimate, which of course renders the original world record claim invalid. The laudable attempt of the authors to explain their original mistake has unfortunately its own errors. Here we explain explicitly how errors are still present in the second paper and provide correct expressions for the conversion of magnetic moments to Jc values using Bean model expressions. An important conclusion is that record Jc values ought always to be validated by real transport measurements and by cross-reference to similar samples and their reported Jc values.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear photoconductivity in pump-probe spectroscopy. I. Optical coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the optical pump-probe reflection and transmission coefficients when the photoinduced response depends nonlinearly on the incident pump intensity. Under these conditions, we expect the photoconductivity depth profile to change shape as a function of the incident fluence, unlike the case when the photoinduced response is linear in the incident intensity. We consider common optical nonlinearities, including photoconductivity saturation and two-photon absorption, and we derive analytic expressions for the photoconductivity depth profile when one or more is present. We review the theory of the electromagnetic transmission and reflection coefficients in a stratified medium, and we derive general expressions for these coefficients for a medium with an arbitrary photoconductivity depth profile. For several photoconductivity profiles of importance in pump-probe spectroscopy, we show that the wave equation can be transformed into one of three standard differential equations$\unicode{x2014}$the Bessel equation, the hypergeometric equation, and the Heun equation$\unicode{x2014}$with analytic solutions in terms of their associated special functions. From these solutions, we derive exact analytic expressions for the optical coefficients in terms of the photoconductivity at the optical interface, and we discuss their limiting forms in various physical limits. Our results provide a systematic guide for analyzing pump-probe measurements over a wide range of pump intensities, and establishes a framework for constraining the systematic uncertainty associated with nonlinear photoconductivity profile distortion.</description>

      <title>High Field Superconducting Phases of Ultra Clean Single Crystal UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the magnetoresistance of high-quality single crystals of UTe2 with Tc=2.1K in high magnetic fields up to 36T, with the field direction between the b and c-axes. From the angular dependence of the upper critical field Hc2, we found that the field-reentrant superconducting phase near H // b-axis extends up to a field angle (24 deg) from the b to c-axis, where another field-reentrant superconducting phase begins to appear above the metamagnetic transition field, Hm. Our results suggest that the field-reentrant superconductivity below Hm near the b-axis is closely related to the superconductivity above Hm when the field is tilted toward the c-axis. Superconductivity appears to be robust when the field direction is maintained perpendicular to the magnetization easy axis, implying that fluctuations boosting superconductivity may persist. At first glance, these findings resemble the field-reentrant (reinforced) superconductivity observed in ferromagnetic superconductors URhGe and UCoGe, where Ising-type ferromagnetic fluctuations play a crucial role. However, in UTe2, the fluctuations are more complex. The angular dependence of the upper critical field Hc2 contrasts with that of the initial slope of Hc2 near Tc, revealing the anisotropic field response of fluctuations. Thanks to the high-quality samples, quantum oscillations were detected for field directions close to the c-axis using magnetoresistance (Shubnikov-de Haas effect) and torque (de Haas-van Alphen effect) measurements. The angular dependence of frequencies is in good agreement with those observed previously using the field-modulation technique, confirming quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surfaces.</description>

      <title>Charge and spin transport through normal lead coupled to $s$-wave superconductor and a Majorana zero mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-bias charge conductance peak (ZBCCP) is a significant symbol of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). The proximity effect of s-wave superconductor is usually demanded in the fabrication of MZMs. So in transport experiments, the system is inevitably coupled to the s-wave superconductor. Here we study how the ZBCCP is affected by coupling of the s-wave superconductor. The results show that the ZBCCP could be changed into a zero-bias valley due to the coupling of s-wave superconductor, although the conductance at the zero bias still keeps a quantized value $2e^2/h$. So it does not mean no MZM exists when no ZBCCP is experimentally observed. In addition, the spin transport is investigated. Four reflection processes (the normal reflection, spin-flip reflection, normal Andreev reflection, and equal-spin Andreev reflection) usually occur. The reflection coefficients are strongly dependent on the spin direction of the incident electron, and they may be symmetrical or Fano resonance shapes. But the spin conductance always shows a zero-bias peak with the height $e/2\pi$ regardless of the direction of the spin bias and the coupling strength of the s-wave superconductor. So measuring spin transport properties could be a more reliable method to judge the existence of MZMs.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transition driven by magnetic field in one-dimensional topological superconductor rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the energy spectrum and transport property of a one-dimensional Kitaev quantum ring in a threading magnetic field. It is demonstrated that the magnetic field can effectively induce topological phase transitions for the ring in the topologically nontrivial phase at the zero magnetic field. However, for the ring in the topologically trivial phase at the zero field, there is no topological phase transition, and the energy spectrum of the system is always gapped. The magnetic field can control the appearance and disappearance of Majorana zero-energy states in the Kitaev quantum ring, when one half of the ring is in the topologically nontrivial phase and the other half is in the topologically trivial phase. Furthermore, we calculate the transport properties of the ring connected by two semi-infinite leads. It is found that the resonant peaks of transmission coefficient TQT correspond to the critical points of topological phase transition. In addition, we extend our findings to a more realistic quantum ring adopting a semiconductor nanowire with high spin-orbit coupling, superconducting s-wave pairing, and Zeeman splitting, and prove that our findings are universal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The photon-assisted tunneling of Majorana bound states in a Majorana nanowire driven by the periodic field is studied both theoretically and numerically. We find that Majorana bound states exhibit an anomalous photon-assisted tunneling signal which is different from an ordinary fermionic state : the height of photonic sidebands is related to the degree of Majorana nonlocality. Moreover, we show that the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) charge and spin components of subgap states can be well revealed by the local conductance. Our work illuminates the effect of driving field on Majorana bound states and provides a systematic scheme to directly measure BCS information of overlapping Majorana bound states</description>

Abstract: We investigated the infrared-active phonons in ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn3S3 using optical spectroscopy. Below the Curie temperature (T~175~K), we observed asymmetric Fano lineshapes of phonons peaks in the optical conductivities, reflecting the presence of electron-phonon coupling (EPC). Additionally, the detected phonon signals by the polar Kerr rotation and the ellipticity spectroscopy indicate the circular dichroism (CD) of phonons. We attribute the CD of phonons to their distinct couplings with charge excitations on the tilted Weyl nodal rings in two circularly polarized channels. Our findings provide experimental evidence that, without external fields, phonons can also become circularly polarized by coupling with the electronic topology. Since the magnetic exchange splitting gradually shifts the topological bands in Co3Sn2S2, the CD of phonons exhibits significant temperature dependence, hinting at a promising approach for manipulation.</description>

Abstract: Despite being a pillar of quantum mechanics, little attention has been paid to the onset of Fermi's golden rule as a discrete microscopic bath of modes approaches the macroscopic thermodynamic limit and forms a continuum. Motivated by recent experiments in circuit quantum electrodynamics, we tackle this question through the lens of single-photon decay in a finite transmission line coupled to a qubit ("quantum impurity"). We consider a single-photon state, coupled via the nonlinear impurity to several baths formed by multi-photon states with different number of photons, which are inherently discrete due to the finite size of the line. We focus on the late-time dynamics of the single-photon, and uncover the conditions under which the photon's decoherence rate approaches the decay rate predicted by Fermi's golden rule. We show that it is necessary to keep a small but finite escape rate (unrelated to the impurity) for each single-photon mode to obtain a finite long-time decay rate. We analyze the contribution of the baths formed by many-body states with different number of photons, and illustrate how the decay rate induced by some bath of $n$ photon states is enhanced by the presence of other baths of $m \neq n$ photon states, highlighting the contribution of cascade photon decay processes. Our formalism could be used to analyze recent experiments in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Rapid cooling of the Cassiopeia A neutron star due to superfluid quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid cooling of the neutron star in Cassiopeia A is speculated to arise from an enhanced neutrino emission caused by the onset of $^3P_2$-wave neutron superfluidity in the core. However, the neutrino emissivity due to Cooper-pair breaking and formation is too small to yield the observed cooling rate. Here, we show that such a rapid cooling can be explained once the non-Fermi liquid behavior of the non-superfluid neutron liquid induced by superfluid quantum criticality is included into the theoretical description of neutron star cooling, without assuming the existence of additional energy loss processes. Our results indicate that the neutron star in Cassiopeia A remains in the thermal relaxation stage, which is greatly prolonged by the non-Fermi liquid behavior. The good agreement between our theoretical results and recent observational cooling data points to the pivotal role played by superfluid quantum criticality in neutron stars.</description>
