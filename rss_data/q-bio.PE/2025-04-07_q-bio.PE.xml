      <title>Cooperation guides evolution in a minimal model of biological evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A challenging simulation of evolutionary dynamics based on a three-state cellular automaton is used as a test of how cooperation can drive the evolution of complex traits. Building on the approach of Wolfram (2025), the fitness of a cellular automaton is determined by the number of updates it endures before returning to an empty configuration. In our population-based model, groups of automata are assessed either by summing individual fitness or by the maximum fitness in the group; this second scheme mimics cooperation by allowing fit rules to support their less fit group mates. We show that cooperation substantially improves the population's ability to evolve longer-lived rules, illustrating a Baldwin Effect for Cooperation: higher diversity across individuals unlock otherwise inaccessible evolutionary paths.</description>

      <title>The Rhythm of Aging: Stability and Drift in Human Senescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human aging is marked by a steady rise in mortality risk with age - a process demographers describe as senescence. While life expectancy has improved dramatically over the past century, a fundamental question remains: is the rate at which mortality accelerates biologically fixed, or has it shifted across generations? Vaupel's hypothesis suggests that the pace of aging is stable - that humans are not aging more slowly, but simply starting later. To test this, we analyze cohort mortality data from France, Denmark, Italy, and Sweden. We use a two-step framework to first isolate senescent mortality, then decompose the Gompertz slope into three parts: a biological constant, a potential trend, and a cumulative period effect. The results show that most variation in the rate of aging is not biological in origin. Once non-senescent deaths and historical shocks are accounted for, the Gompertz slope is remarkably stable. The fluctuations we see are not signs of changing senescence, but echoes of shared history. Aging itself, it seems, has stayed the same. These findings suggest that while longevity has shifted, the fundamental rhythm of human aging may be biologically fixed - shaped not by evolution, but by history.</description>

      <title>Exploiting individual differences to bootstrap communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Establishing a communication system is hard because the intended meaning of a signal is unknown to its receiver when first produced, and the signaller also has no idea how that signal will be interpreted. Most theoretical accounts of the emergence of communication systems rely on feedback to reinforce behaviours that have led to successful communication in the past. However, providing such feedback requires already being able to communicate the meaning that was intended or interpreted. Therefore these accounts cannot explain how communication can be bootstrapped from non-communicative behaviours. Here we present a model that shows how a communication system, capable of expressing an unbounded number of meanings, can emerge as a result of individual behavioural differences in a large population without any pre-existing means to determine communicative success. The two key cognitive capabilities responsible for this outcome are behaving predictably in a given situation, and an alignment of psychological states ahead of signal production that derives from shared intentionality. Since both capabilities can exist independently of communication, our results are compatible with theories in which large flexible socially-learned communication systems like language are the product of a general but well-developed capacity for social cognition.</description>

      <title>Societal self-regulation induces complex infection dynamics and chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classically, endemic infectious diseases are expected to display relatively stable, predictable infection dynamics. Accordingly, basic disease models such as the susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible model display stable endemic states or recurrent seasonal waves. However, if the human population reacts to high infection numbers by mitigating the spread of the disease, then this delayed behavioral feedback loop can generate infection waves itself, driven by periodic mitigation and subsequent relaxation. We show that such behavioral reactions, together with a seasonal effect of comparable impact, can cause complex and unpredictable infection dynamics, including Arnold tongues, coexisting attractors, and chaos. Importantly, these arise in epidemiologically relevant parameter regions where the costs associated to infections and mitigation are jointly minimized. By comparing our model to data, we find signs that COVID-19 was mitigated in a way that favored complex infection dynamics. Our results challenge the intuition that endemic disease dynamics necessarily implies predictability and seasonal waves and show the emergence of complex infection dynamics when humans optimize their reaction to increasing infection numbers.</description>
