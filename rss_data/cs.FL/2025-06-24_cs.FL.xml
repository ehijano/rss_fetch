      <title>In-Memory Sorting-Searching with Cayley Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a computing model to reduce the workload of CPU. It relies on the data intensive computation in memory, where the data reside, and effectively realizes an in-memory computing (IMC) platform. Each memory word, with additional logic, acts as a tiny processing element which forms the node of a Cayley tree. The Cayley tree in turn defines the framework for solving the data intensive computational problems. It finds the solutions for in-memory searching, computing the max (min) in-memory and in-memory sorting while reducing the involvement of CPU. The worst case time complexities of the IMC based solutions for in-memory searching and computing max (min) in-memory are $\mathcal{O}\log{n}$. Such solutions are independent of the order of elements in the list. The worst case time complexity of in-memory sorting, on the other hand, is $\mathcal{O}(n\log{n})$. Two types of hardware implementations of the IMC platform are proposed. One is based on the existing/conventional memory architecture, and the other one is on a newly defined memory architecture. The solutions are further implemented in FPGA platform to prove the effectiveness of the IMC architecture while comparing with the state-of-the art designs.</description>

      <title>Low complexity binary words avoiding $(5/2)^+$-powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rote words are infinite words that contain $2n$ factors of length $n$ for every $n \geq 1$. Shallit and Shur, as well as Ollinger and Shallit, showed that there are Rote words that avoid $(5/2)^+$-powers and that this is best possible. In this note we give a structure theorem for the Rote words that avoid $(5/2)^+$-powers, confirming a conjecture of Ollinger and Shallit.</description>

      <title>Word-Representable Graphs and Locality of Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relationship between $k$-repre\-sentable graphs and graphs representable by $k$-local words. In particular, we show that every graph representable by a $k$-local word is $(k+1)$-representable. A previous result about graphs represented by $1$-local words is revisited with new insights. Moreover, we investigate both classes of graphs w.r.t. hereditary and in particular the speed as a measure. We prove that the latter ones belong to the factorial layer and that the graphs in this classes have bounded clique-width.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic modelling and safety assurance of an agriculture robot providing light-treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continued adoption of agricultural robots postulates the farmer's trust in the reliability, robustness and safety of the new technology. This motivates our work on safety assurance of agricultural robots, particularly their ability to detect, track and avoid obstacles and humans. This paper considers a probabilistic modelling and risk analysis framework for use in the early development phases. Starting off with hazard identification and a risk assessment matrix, the behaviour of the mobile robot platform, sensor and perception system, and any humans present are captured using three state machines. An auto-generated probabilistic model is then solved and analysed using the probabilistic model checker PRISM. The result provides unique insight into fundamental development and engineering aspects by quantifying the effect of the risk mitigation actions and risk reduction associated with distinct design concepts. These include implications of adopting a higher performance and more expensive Object Detection System or opting for a more elaborate warning system to increase human awareness. Although this paper mainly focuses on the initial concept-development phase, the proposed safety assurance framework can also be used during implementation, and subsequent deployment and operation phases.</description>

      <title>A Verification Methodology for Safety Assurance of Robotic Autonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous robots deployed in shared human environments, such as agricultural settings, require rigorous safety assurance to meet both functional reliability and regulatory compliance. These systems must operate in dynamic, unstructured environments, interact safely with humans, and respond effectively to a wide range of potential hazards. This paper presents a verification workflow for the safety assurance of an autonomous agricultural robot, covering the entire development life-cycle, from concept study and design to runtime verification. The outlined methodology begins with a systematic hazard analysis and risk assessment to identify potential risks and derive corresponding safety requirements. A formal model of the safety controller is then developed to capture its behaviour and verify that the controller satisfies the specified safety properties with respect to these requirements. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a field robot operating in an agricultural setting. The results show that the methodology can be effectively used to verify safety-critical properties and facilitate the early identification of design issues, contributing to the development of safer robots and autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Feasability of Learning Weighted Automata on a Semiring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07806v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the seminal work by Angluin and the introduction of the L*-algorithm, active learning of automata by membership and equivalence queries has been extensively studied to learn various extensions of automata. For weighted automata, algorithms for restricted cases have been developed in the literature, but so far there was no global approach or understanding how these algorithms could apply (or not) in the general case. In this paper we chart the boundaries of the Angluin approach. We use a class of hypothesis automata which are constructed, in Angluin's style, by using membership and equivalence queries and solving certain finite systems of linear equations over the semiring, and we show the theoretical limitations of this approach. We classify functions with respect to how guessable they are, corresponding to the existence of hypothesis automata computing a given function, and how such an hypothesis automaton can be found. Of course, from an algorithmic standpoint, knowing that a solution (hypothesis automaton) exists need not translate into an effective algorithm to find one. We relate our work to the existing literature with a discussion of some known properties ensuring algorithmic solutions, illustrating the ideas over several familiar semirings (including the natural numbers).</description>

      <title>Linear Time Subsequence and Supersequence Regex Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that checking whether a given string $w$ matches a given regular expression $r$ can be done in quadratic time $O(|w|\cdot |r|)$ and that this cannot be improved to a truly subquadratic running time of $O((|w|\cdot |r|)^{1-\epsilon})$ assuming the strong exponential time hypothesis (SETH). We study a different matching paradigm where we ask instead whether $w$ has a subsequence that matches $r$, and show that regex matching in this sense can be solved in linear time $O(|w| + |r|)$. Further, the same holds if we ask for a supersequence. We show that the quantitative variants where we want to compute a longest or shortest subsequence or supersequence of $w$ that matches $r$ can be solved in $O(|w| \cdot |r|)$, i. e., asymptotically no worse than classical regex matching; and we show that $O(|w| + |r|)$ is conditionally not possible for these problems. We also investigate these questions with respect to other natural string relations like the infix, prefix, left-extension or extension relation instead of the subsequence and supersequence relation. We further study the complexity of the universal problem where we ask if all subsequences (or supersequences, infixes, prefixes, left-extensions or extensions) of an input string satisfy a given regular expression.</description>
