      <title>Comments on "Procedures for proper validation of record critical current density claims" by Chiara Tarantini and David C. Larbalestier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide comments on article titled "Procedures for proper validation of record critical current density claims" by Chiara Tarantini and David C. Larbalestier, arXiv:2410.22195. We respond to claims and assertions that the expressions for calculation of $J_{c,mag}$ from magnetic moments proposed in Polichetti et al. 2024, arXiv:2410.09197, are incorrect. We show that the analysis presented in Tarantini and Larbalestier is wrong. We also re-emphasize the expression presented in Polichetti et al. for calculation of $J_{c,mag}$ from magnetic moments in which the pre-factor is dimensionless and has NO units. We make the case for establishment of national user facilities for measurement of transport $J_c(H,T,\theta)$ that are easily accessible in an equitable and rapid manner to enable much needed advances in the field.</description>

      <title>Charge density waves and superconductivity in the electron-positive fermion gas using a simple intuitive model. Part I: The model, instabilities, and phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron-positive fermion gas in three dimensions and $T=0$ is modeled as two independent fermion gases interacting via the coulomb interaction. The main advantage of the simple model is that all existing results from the electron gas can be directly used for the positive fermion gas, which is the same as the electron gas, but scaled for the mass of the positive fermion. Additional screening from the positive fermions together with use of an accurate local field factor naturally introduces charge density waves in addition to the $q=0$ instability that occurs when the bulk modulus equals zero. The electron-positive fermion gas is completely specified by the density $r_s$ and the mass ratio $M/m$. Although the problem and model can be simply stated, the resulting phase diagram is complex and not fully understood.
  The results of the simple model are exact formulas, and are in close agreement with earlier numerical results obtained using density functional theory in their region of overlap. Using these results, the electron-electron, positive fermion-positive fermion and electron-positive fermion many body effective interactions are calculated in the following paper. For conditions close to the charge density wave, the positive fermion contribution to the electron-electron interaction, which is attractive and the source of the superconductivity, becomes large and significantly enhances the superconducting transition temperature, as well as leading to a large $T^2$ contribution to the normal state electrical resistivity.</description>

      <title>Expanding the operational temperature window of a superconducting spin valve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To increase the efficiency of the superconducting spin valve (SSV), special attention should be paid to the choice of ferromagnetic materials for the F1/F2/S SSV multilayer. Here, we report the preparation and the superconducting properties of the SSV heterostructures where Pb is used as the superconducting S layer. In the magnetic part of the structure, we use the same starting material, the Heusler alloy Co$_2$Cr$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Al$_{y}$, for both F1 and F2 layers. We utilize the tunability of the magnetic properties of this alloy, which, depending on the deposition conditions, forms either an almost fully spin-polarized half-metallic F1 layer or a weakly ferromagnetic F2 layer. We demonstrate that the combination of the distinct properties of these two layers boosts the generation of the long-range triplet component of the superconducting condensate in the fabricated SSV structures and yields superior values of the triplet spin-valve effect of more than 1 K and of the operational temperature window of the SSV up to 0.6 K.</description>

      <title>Two characteristic contributions to the superconducting state of 2$H$-NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiband superconductivity arises when multiple electronic bands contribute to the formation of the superconducting state, allowing distinct pairing interactions and gap structures. Here, we present field- and temperature-dependent data on the vortex lattice structure in 2$H$-NbSe$_2$ as a contribution to the ongoing debate on the nature of the superconductivity in this material. The field-dependent data clearly show that there are two distinct superconducting bands, and the contribution of one of them to the vortex lattice signal is completely suppressed for magnetic fields well below $B\mathrm{_{c2}}$. By combining the temperature and field scans, we can deduce that there is a noticeable degree of interband coupling. From the observed temperature dependences, we find that at low field and zero temperature, the two gaps in temperature units are 13.1 and 6.5 K ($\Delta_{0}$ = 1.88 and 0.94 $k\mathrm{_{B}} T\mathrm{_{c}} $); the band with the larger gap gives just under two-thirds of the superfluid density. The penetration depth extrapolated to zero field and zero temperature is 160 nm.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in WBe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WBe2, which occurs in space group 194, with hexagonal symmetry P63/mmc, is prepared by arc-melting at temperatures above 2200 C, where Be vapor loss is significant. This study is motivated by recent work on MoB2 and WB2, both superconductors (Tc=32 and 17 K respectively) under high (~70 GPa) pressure. In order to avoid the known Be-rich superconducting phases (WBe13 and WBe22) in the complex phase diagram, both known to be superconducting at 4.1 K, the sample was prepared with a slight (~5%) excess of W. The resultant sample, prepared using high purity (99.999%) Be, is essentially single phase WBe2, with some spread in its superconducting properties due to the known homogeneity range. (WBe2 forms in space group 194 between approximately W1.02Be1.98 and W0.88Be2.12.) Characterization was carried out with x-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, rho, in zero and applied magnetic fields, and specific heat. The resistivity in zero and applied fields and specific heat data indicate that our sample of WBe2 is a bulk superconductor at ambient pressure with a Tc(onset) in the resistivity at 1.05 K, and Tc(rho-&gt;0) at ~0.86 K. There is no signature of superconductivity in rho at 4.1 K, indicating successful avoidance of WBe13 and WBe22. The resistivity data in field indicate an upper critical field of approximately 400 gauss.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Quantum Anomaly Detection on Noisy Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether in fundamental physics, cybersecurity or finance, the detection of anomalies with machine learning techniques is a highly relevant and active field of research, as it potentially accelerates the discovery of novel physics or criminal activities. We provide a systematic analysis of the generalization properties of the One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) algorithm, using projected quantum kernels for a realistic dataset of the latter application. These results were both theoretically simulated and experimentally validated on trapped-ion and superconducting quantum processors, by leveraging partial state tomography to obtain precise approximations of the quantum states that are used to estimate the quantum kernels. Moreover, we analyzed both platforms respective hardware-efficient feature maps over a wide range of anomaly ratios and showed that for our financial dataset in all anomaly regimes, the quantum-enhanced OCSVMs lead to better generalization properties compared to the purely classical approach. As such our work bridges the gap between theory and practice in the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era and paves the path towards useful quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Engineering superconducting contacts transparent to a bipolar graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene's exceptional electronic mobility, gate-tunability, and contact transparency with superconducting materials make it ideal for exploring the superconducting proximity effect. However, the work function difference between graphene and superconductors causes unavoidable doping of graphene near contacts, forming a p-n junction in the hole-doped regime and reducing contact transparency. This challenges the device implementation that exploits graphene's bipolarity. To address this limitation, we developed a new fabrication scheme for two-dimensional superconducting contacts that allows independent control over charge concentration and polarity for both the graphene in contact with superconductors and the graphene channel. Contact transparency, conductance enhancement, and Josephson coupling were measured to confirm transparent contacts to both polarities of graphene. Moreover, we demonstrated the Andreev process in the quantum Hall edge state at a negative filling factor of {\nu} = -2. This scheme will open avenues for realizing various theoretical propositions utilizing the bipolarity of graphene combined with superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Phase sensitive information from a planar Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Josephson tunneling across a planar junction generally depends on the relative twist angle, $\theta$, between the two layers. However, if under a discrete rotation, the order parameter in one layer is odd and the other is even (as, e.g., for a $s$-wave to $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave junction under a $\pi/2$ rotation) then the bulk Josephson current vanishes for all $\theta$. Even in this case, we show that for a finite junction, the Josephson current, $J$, has a nonzero edge contribution that depends on $\theta$ and the orientation of the junction edges in ways that can serve as an unambiguous probe of the order parameter symmetry of any time-reversal preserving system (including multiband systems and those in which spin-orbit coupling is significant). We also analyze the microscopic considerations that determine the magnitude of $J$.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from spin-canting fluctuations in rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rhombohedral graphene multilayers host various broken-symmetry metallic phases as well as superconductors whose pairing mechanism and order parameter symmetry remain unsettled. Strikingly, experiments have revealed prominent new superconducting regions in rhombohedral bilayer and trilayer graphene devices with proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling. We propose that these superconductors descend from a common spin-canted normal state that spontaneously breaks a U(1) spin symmetry and thus supports soft magnon modes. In particular, we show that these soft modes can mediate pairing through inter-band scattering events that are symmetry-forbidden in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, thus providing a promising explanation for spin-orbit-enabled pairing. Numerous other experimental observations -- including nontrivial dependence of superconductivity on the spin-orbit coupling strength, in-plane magnetic fields, and Fermi surface structure -- also naturally follow from our scenario.</description>

      <title>Tilted stripes origin in ${\mathrm{La}}_{1.88}{\mathrm{Sr}}_{0.12}{\mathrm{CuO}}_{4}$ revealed by anisotropic next-nearest neighbor hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.10264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin- and charge- stripe order has been extensively studied in the superconducting cuprates, among which underdoped ${\mathrm{La}}_{2-x}{\mathrm{Sr}}_{x}{\mathrm{CuO}}_{4}$ (LSCO) is an archetype with static spin stripes at low temperatures. An intriguing, but not completely understood, phenomenon in LSCO is that the stripes are tilted away from the high-symmetry Cu-Cu directions. Using high-resolution neutron scattering on LSCO with $x=0.12$, we find two coexisting phases at low temperatures, one with static spin stripes and the other with fluctuating ones, both sharing the same tilt angle. Our numerical calculations using the doped Hubbard model elucidate the tilting's origin, attributing it to anisotropic next-nearest neighbor hopping $t^{\prime}$, consistent with the material's slight orthorhombicity. Our results underscore the model's success in describing specific details of the ground state of this real material and highlight the role of $t^\prime$ in the Hamiltonian, revealing the delicate interplay between stripes and superconductivity across theoretical and experimental contexts.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of non-Hermitian BCS superfluids in a dissipative asymmetric Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Fermi-Hubbard model with asymmetric hopping and complex-valued interactions, which can be realized by collective one-body loss and two-body loss. By means of the NH BCS theory, we find that the weak asymmetry of the hopping does not affect the BCS superfluidity since it only affects the imaginary part of the eigenvalues of the BdG Hamiltonian. Systematic analysis in the d-dimensional hypercubic lattices clarifies that the singularity in the density of states affects the phase boundary between the normal and dissipation-induced superfluid states. Our results can be tested in ultracold atoms by using the photoassociation techniques and a nonlocal Rabi coupling with local losses and postselecting null measurement outcomes with the use of the quantum-gas microscope.</description>
