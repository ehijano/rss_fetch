      <title>Infinitesimal Homeostasis in Mass-Action Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homeostasis occurs in a biological system when a chosen output variable remains approximately constant despite changes in an input variable. In this work we specifically focus on biological systems which may be represented as chemical reaction networks and consider their infinitesimal homeostasis, where the derivative of the input-output function is zero. The specific challenge of chemical reaction networks is that they often obey various conservation laws complicating the standard input-output analysis. We derive several results that allow to verify the existence of infinitesimal homeostasis points both in the absence of conservation and under conservation laws where conserved quantities serve as input parameters. In particular, we introduce the notion of infinitesimal concentration robustness, where the output variable remains nearly constant despite fluctuations in the conserved quantities. We provide several examples of chemical networks which illustrate our results both in deterministic and stochastic settings.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Space of Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Living systems are usually maintained out of equilibrium and exhibit complex dynamical behaviors. The external energy supply often comes from chemical fluxes that can keep some species concentrations constant. Furthermore, the properties of the underlying chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are also instrumental in establishing robust biological functioning. Hence, capturing the emergent complexity of living systems and the role of their non-equilibrium nature is fundamental to uncover constraints and properties of the CRNs underpinning their functions. In particular, while kinetics plays a key role in shaping detailed dynamical phenomena, the range of operations of any CRN must be fundamentally constrained by thermodynamics, as they necessarily operate with a given energy budget. Here, we derive universal thermodynamic upper and lower bounds for the accessible space of species concentrations in a generic CRN. The resulting region determines the "thermodynamic space" of the CRN, a concept we introduce in this work. Moreover, we obtain similar bounds also for the affinities, shedding light on how global thermodynamic properties can limit local non-equilibrium quantities. We illustrate our results in two paradigmatic examples, the Schl\"ogl model for bistability and a minimal self-assembly process, demonstrating how the onset of complex behaviors is intimately tangled with the presence of non-equilibrium driving. In summary, our work unveils the exact form of the accessible space in which a CRN must work as a function of its energy budget, shedding light on the non-equilibrium origin of a variety of phenomena, from amplification to pattern formation. Ultimately, by providing a general tool for analyzing CRNs, the presented framework constitutes a stepping stone to deepen our ability to predict complex out-of-equilibrium behaviors and design artificial chemical reaction systems.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Molecular Generation with Hierarchical Textual Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02845v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing an effective molecular generation framework even with a limited number of molecules is often important for its practical deployment, e.g., drug discovery, since acquiring task-related molecular data requires expensive and time-consuming experimental costs. To tackle this issue, we introduce Hierarchical textual Inversion for Molecular generation (HI-Mol), a novel data-efficient molecular generation method. HI-Mol is inspired by the importance of hierarchical information, e.g., both coarse- and fine-grained features, in understanding the molecule distribution. We propose to use multi-level embeddings to reflect such hierarchical features based on the adoption of the recent textual inversion technique in the visual domain, which achieves data-efficient image generation. Compared to the conventional textual inversion method in the image domain using a single-level token embedding, our multi-level token embeddings allow the model to effectively learn the underlying low-shot molecule distribution. We then generate molecules based on the interpolation of the multi-level token embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of HI-Mol with notable data-efficiency. For instance, on QM9, HI-Mol outperforms the prior state-of-the-art method with 50x less training data. We also show the effectiveness of molecules generated by HI-Mol in low-shot molecular property prediction.</description>
