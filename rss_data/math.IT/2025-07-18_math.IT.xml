      <title>Robust Resource Allocation for Pinching-Antenna Systems under Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna technology has lately showcased its promising capability for reconfiguring wireless propagation environments, especially in high-frequency communication systems like millimeter-wave and terahertz bands. By dynamically placing the antenna over a dielectric waveguide, line-of-sight (LoS) connections can be made to significantly improve system performance. Although recent research have illustrated the advantages of pinching-antenna-assisted designs, they mainly presuppose complete knowledge of user locations -- an impractical assumption in real-world systems. To address this issue, the robust resource allocation in a multi-user pinching antenna downlink system with uncertain user positions is investigated, aiming to minimize total transmit power while satisfying individual outage probability constraints. First, we address the single-user case, deriving the optimal pinching antenna position and obtaining the corresponding power allocation using a bisection method combined with geometric analysis. We then extend this solution to the multi-user case. In this case, we optimize the pinching antenna position using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to handle the resulting non-convex and non-differentiable optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional fixed-antenna systems and validate the effectiveness of the PSO-based antenna placement strategy under location uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Interface for Semantic Communication with Bit Importance Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint source-channel coding (JSCC) is an effective approach for semantic communication. However, current JSCC methods are difficult to integrate with existing communication network architectures, where application and network providers are typically different entities. Recently, a novel paradigm termed Split DeepJSCC has been under consideration to address this challenge. Split DeepJSCC employs a bit-level interface that enables separate design of source and channel codes, ensuring compatibility with existing communication networks while preserving the advantages of JSCC in terms of semantic fidelity and channel adaptability. In this paper, we propose a learning-based interface design by treating its parameters as trainable, achieving improved end-to-end performance compared to Split DeepJSCC. In particular, the interface enables specification of bit-level importance at the output of the source code. Furthermore, we propose an Importance-Aware Net that utilizes the interface-derived bit importance information, enabling dynamical adaptation to diverse channel bandwidth ratios and time-varying channel conditions. Experimental results show that our method improves performance in wireless image transmission tasks. This work provides a potential solution for realizing semantic communications in existing wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Robust Beamforming Design for Secure Near-Field ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter investigates the robust beamforming design for a near-field secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system with multiple communication users (CUs) and targets, as well as multiple eavesdroppers. Taking into account the channel uncertainty constraints, we maximize the minimum sensing beampattern gain for targets, subject to the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for each CU and the maximum SINR constraint for each eavesdropper, as well as the ISAC transmit power constraint. The formulated design problem is non-convex. As a low-complexity suboptimal solution, we first apply the S-Procedure to convert semi-infinite channel uncertainty constraints into linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and then use the state-of-the-art sequential rank-one constraint relaxation (SROCR) method to address the rank-one constraints. The numerical results show that the proposed ISAC beamforming design scheme outperforms the existing semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and other baseline schemes, and it significantly enhances security and robustness for near-field ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Secure Pinching Antenna-aided ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, a pinching antenna (PA)-aided scheme for establishing a secure integrated sensing and communication system (ISAC) is investigated. The underlying system comprises a dual-functional radar communication (DFRC) base station (BS) linked to multiple waveguides to serve several downlink users while sensing a set of malicious targets in a given area. The PA-aided BS aims at preserving communication confidentiality with the legitimate users while being able to detect malicious targets. One objective of the proposed scheme is to optimize the PA locations, based on which an optimal design of the legitimate signal beamforming and artificial noise covariance matrices is provided to maximize the network's sensing performance, subject to secrecy and total power constraints. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme through numerical examples and compare that against a traditional DFRC ISAC system with a uniform linear array of half-wavelength-spaced antennas. We show that the proposed scheme outperforms the baseline PA-aided scheme with equidistant PAs by $3$ dB in terms of illumination power, while it can provide gains of up to $30$ dB of the same metric against a traditional ISAC system with half-wavelength-space uniform linear arrays.</description>

      <title>A Framework of Distributed Source Encryption using Mutual Information Security Criterion and the Strong Converse Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reinvestigate the general distributed secure source coding based on the common key cryptosystem proposed by Oohama and Santoso (ITW 2021). They proposed a framework of distributed source encryption and derived the necessary and sufficient conditions to have reliable and secure transmission. However, the bounds of the rate region, which specifies both necessary and sufficient conditions to have reliable and secure transmission under the proposed cryptosystem, were derived based on a self-tailored non-standard} security criterion. In this paper we adopt the standard security criterion, i.e., standard mutual information. We successfully establish the bounds of the rate region based on this security criterion. Information spectrum method and a variant of Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem play an important role in deriving the result.</description>

      <title>Analytical Optimization for Antenna Placement in Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the main issue in pinching-antenna system design, antenna location optimization is key to realizing channel reconfigurability and system flexibility. Most existing works in this area adopt sophisticated optimization and learning tools to identify the optimal antenna locations in a numerical manner, where insightful understandings of the pinching antenna placement are still missing. Motivated by this research gap, this paper aims to carry out analytical optimization for pinching antenna placement, where closed-form solutions for the optimal antenna locations are obtained to reveal the impact of antenna placement on the system performance. In particular, for the user-fairness-oriented orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based transmission, analytical results are obtained to reveal that the pinching antenna needs to be activated at the place that would be beneficial to all served users; however, the users' distances to the waveguide have no impact on the location selection. For the greedy-allocation-based OMA transmission, an asymptotic study based on a high signal-to-noise ratio approximation is carried out to show that the optimal antenna location is in close proximity to the user who is nearest to the waveguide. For non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based transmission, even with a user-fairness-oriented objective, the obtained analytical results show that the optimal antenna location is not the position that can benefit all users, but rather is near the user positioned closest to the waveguide.</description>

      <title>Differential Communication in Channels with Mobility and Delay Spread using Zak-OTFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zak-transform based orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS) is a delay-Doppler (DD) domain modulation scheme in which the signal processing is carried out in the DD domain. The channel when viewed in the DD domain is predictable. However, even with Zak-OTFS, pilots need to be sent periodically, albeit at a lower rate. In this paper, we propose a differential communication scheme for Zak-OTFS systems that alleviates the need for periodic pilot transmission. Towards this, we analytically show that the detected data can be used as a pilot and that the channel estimate obtained from the detected data can enable further detection enabling the "differential" aspect of the communication. Specifically, we leverage the prediction capability of the DD channel in Zak-OTFS to use the channel estimate (obtained from detected data symbols treated as pilots) in the previous instant to detect data in the next instant and propagate this forward. The advantages are two fold. First, it allows the data symbols to enjoy higher energy since the energy that would otherwise be required for pilot symbols can also be allocated to data symbols. Second, it allows for full spectral efficiency compared to point or embedded pilots. Comparison with the full spectral efficiency achieving spread pilot scheme shows that the proposed method achieves better bit-error rate at lower complexity.</description>

      <title>Trace Reconstruction with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The general trace reconstruction problem seeks to recover an original sequence from its noisy copies independently corrupted by deletions, insertions, and substitutions. This problem arises in applications such as DNA data storage, a promising storage medium due to its high information density and longevity. However, errors introduced during DNA synthesis, storage, and sequencing require correction through algorithms and codes, with trace reconstruction often used as part of the data retrieval process. In this work, we propose TReconLM, which leverages language models trained on next-token prediction for trace reconstruction. We pretrain language models on synthetic data and fine-tune on real-world data to adapt to technology-specific error patterns. TReconLM outperforms state-of-the-art trace reconstruction algorithms, including prior deep learning approaches, recovering a substantially higher fraction of sequences without error.</description>

      <title>Partial decidability protocol for the Wang tiling problem from statistical mechanics and chaotic mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a partial decidability protocol for the Wang tiling problem (which is the prototype of undecidable problems in combinatorics and statistical physics) by constructing a suitable mapping from tilings of finite squares of different sizes. Such mapping depends on the initial family of Wang tiles (the alphabet) with which one would like to tile the plane. This allows to define effective entropy and temperature associated to the alphabet (together with the corresponding partition function). We identify a subclass of good alphabets by observing that when the entropy and temperature of a given alphabet are well-behaved in the thermodynamical sense then such alphabet can tile the infinite two-dimensional plane. Our proposal is tested successfully with the known available good alphabets (which produce periodic tilings, aperiodic but self-similar tilings as well as tilings which are neither periodic nor self-similar). Our analysis shows that the Kendall Tau coefficient is able to distinguish alphabets with a good thermodynamical behavior from alphabets with bad thermodynamical behavior. The transition from good to undecidable behavior is related to a transition from non-chaotic to chaotic regime in discrete dynamical systems of logistic type.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Age of Incorrect Information: A Performance Metric for Status Updates in Virtual Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual dynamic environments (VDEs) such as the Metaverse and digital twins (DTs) require proper representation of the interacting entities to map their characteristics within the simulated or augmented space. Keeping these representations accurate and up-to-date is crucial for seamless interaction and system reliability. In this paper, we propose bidirectional age of incorrect information (BAoII) to address this aspect. BAoII quantifies the time-dependent penalty paid by an entity in a VDE due to incorrect or outdated knowledge about itself and the overall dynamically changing space. This extends the concept of age of incorrect information for a bidirectional information exchange, capturing that a VDE requires mutual awareness of the entity's own representation, measured in the virtual space, and what the other entities share about their representations. Using a continuous-time Markov chain model, we derive a closed-form expression for long-term BAoII and identify a transmission cost threshold for optimal update strategies. We describe a trade-off between communication cost and information freshness and validate our model through numerical simulations, demonstrating the impact of BAoII on evaluating system performance and highlighting its relevance for real-time collaboration in the Metaverse and DTs.</description>

      <title>Extremely Large Full Duplex MIMO for Simultaneous Downlink Communications and Monostatic Sensing at Sub-THz Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The in-band Full Duplex (FD) technology is lately gaining attention as an enabler for the emerging paradigm of Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC), which envisions seamless integration of sensing mechanisms for unconnected entities into next generation wireless networks. In this paper, we present an FD Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) system with extremely large antenna arrays at its transceiver module, which is optimized, considering two emerging analog beamforming architectures, for simultaneous DownLink (DL) communications and monostatic-type sensing intended at the sub-THz frequencies, with the latter operation relying on received reflections of the transmitted information-bearing signals. A novel optimization framework for the joint design of the analog and digital transmit beamforming, analog receive combining, and the digital canceler for the self-interference signal is devised with the objective to maximize the achievable DL rate, while meeting a predefined threshold for the position error bound for the unknown three-dimensional parameters of a passive target. Capitalizing on the distinctive features of the beamforming architectures with fully-connected networks of phase shifters and partially-connected arrays of metamaterials, two ISAC designs are presented. Our simulation results showcase the superiority of both proposed designs over state-of-the-art schemes, highlighting the role of various system parameters in the trade-off between the communication and sensing functionalities.</description>

      <title>ToDMA: Large Model-Driven Token-Domain Multiple Access for Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Token communications (TokCom) is an emerging generative semantic communication concept that reduces transmission rates by using context and multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based token processing, with tokens serving as universal semantic units across modalities. In this paper, we propose a semantic multiple access scheme in the token domain, referred to as token domain multiple access (ToDMA), where a large number of devices share a token codebook and a modulation codebook for source and channel coding, respectively. Specifically, each transmitter first tokenizes its source signal and modulate each token to a codeword. At the receiver, compressed sensing is employed first to detect active tokens and the corresponding channel state information (CSI) from the superposed signals. Then, the source token sequences are reconstructed by clustering the token-associated CSI across multiple time slots. In case of token collisions, some active tokens cannot be assigned and some positions in the reconstructed token sequences are empty. We propose to use pre-trained MLLMs to leverage the context, predict masked tokens, and thus mitigate token collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ToDMA framework for both text and image transmission tasks, achieving significantly lower latency compared to context-unaware orthogonal communication schemes, while also delivering superior distortion and perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art context-unaware non-orthogonal communication methods.</description>

      <title>Token Communications: A Large Model-Driven Framework for Cross-modal Context-aware Semantic Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12096v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce token communications (TokCom), a large model-driven framework to leverage cross-modal context information in generative semantic communications (GenSC). TokCom is a new paradigm, motivated by the recent success of generative foundation models and multimodal large language models (GFM/MLLMs), where the communication units are tokens, enabling efficient transformer-based token processing at the transmitter and receiver. In this paper, we introduce the potential opportunities and challenges of leveraging context in GenSC, explore how to integrate GFM/MLLMs-based token processing into semantic communication systems to leverage cross-modal context effectively at affordable complexity, present the key principles for efficient TokCom at various layers in future wireless networks. In a typical image semantic communication setup, we demonstrate a significant improvement of the bandwidth efficiency, achieved by TokCom by leveraging the context information among tokens. Finally, the potential research directions are identified to facilitate adoption of TokCom in future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Transformation and Analysis of Timelines through Learning via Surprisability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analysis of high-dimensional timeline data and the identification of outliers and anomalies is critical across diverse domains, including sensor readings, biological and medical data, historical records, and global statistics. However, conventional analysis techniques often struggle with challenges such as high dimensionality, complex distributions, and sparsity. These limitations hinder the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex temporal datasets, making it difficult to identify trending features, outliers, and anomalies effectively. Inspired by surprisability -- a cognitive science concept describing how humans instinctively focus on unexpected deviations - we propose Learning via Surprisability (LvS), a novel approach for transforming high-dimensional timeline data. LvS quantifies and prioritizes anomalies in time-series data by formalizing deviations from expected behavior. LvS bridges cognitive theories of attention with computational methods, enabling the detection of anomalies and shifts in a way that preserves critical context, offering a new lens for interpreting complex datasets. We demonstrate the usefulness of LvS on three high-dimensional timeline use cases: a time series of sensor data, a global dataset of mortality causes over multiple years, and a textual corpus containing over two centuries of State of the Union Addresses by U.S. presidents. Our results show that the LvS transformation enables efficient and interpretable identification of outliers, anomalies, and the most variable features along the timeline.</description>

      <title>List Decoding Expander-Based Codes up to Capacity in Near-Linear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new framework based on graph regularity lemmas, for list decoding and list recovery of codes based on spectral expanders. Using existing algorithms for computing regularity decompositions of sparse graphs in (randomized) near-linear time, and appropriate choices for the constant-sized inner/base codes, we prove the following:
  - Expander-based codes constructed using the distance amplification technique of Alon, Edmonds and Luby [FOCS 1995] with rate $\rho$, can be list decoded to a radius $1 - \rho - \epsilon$ in near-linear time. By known results, the output list has size $O(1/\epsilon)$.
  - The above codes of Alon, Edmonds and Luby, with rate $\rho$, can also be list recovered to radius $1 - \rho - \epsilon$ in near-linear time, with constant-sized output lists.
  - The Tanner code construction of Sipser and Spielman [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 1996] with distance $\delta$, can be list decoded to radius $\delta - \epsilon$ in near-linear time, with constant-sized output lists.
  Our results imply novel combinatorial as well as algorithmic bounds for each of the above explicit constructions. All of these bounds are obtained via combinatorial rigidity phenomena, proved using (weak) graph regularity. The regularity framework allows us to lift the list decoding and list recovery properties for the local base codes, to the global codes obtained via the above constructions.</description>

      <title>Latent Diffusion Model Based Denoising Receiver for 6G Semantic Communication: From Stochastic Differential Theory to Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel semantic communication framework empowered by generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is proposed, to enhance the robustness against both channel noise and transmission data distribution shifts. A theoretical foundation is established using stochastic differential equations (SDEs), from which a closed-form mapping between any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the optimal denoising timestep is derived. Moreover, to address distribution mismatch, a mathematical scaling method is introduced to align received semantic features with the training distribution of the GAI. Built on this theoretical foundation, a latent diffusion model (LDM)-based semantic communication framework is proposed that combines a variational autoencoder for semantic features extraction, where a pretrained diffusion model is used for denoising. The proposed system is a training-free framework that supports zero-shot generalization, and achieves superior performance under low-SNR and out-of-distribution conditions, offering a scalable and robust solution for future 6G semantic communication systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed semantic communication framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in both pixel-level accuracy and semantic perceptual quality, consistently outperforming baselines across a wide range of SNRs and data distributions without any fine-tuning or post-training.</description>

      <title>Total/dual correlation/coherence, redundancy/synergy, complexity, and O-information for real and complex valued multivariate data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Firstly, assuming Gaussianity, equations for the following information theory measures are presented: total correlation/coherence (TC), dual total correlation/coherence (DTC), O-information, TSE complexity, and redundancy-synergy index (RSI). Since these measures are functions of the covariance matrix "S" and its inverse "S^-1", the associated Wishart and inverse-Wishart distributions are of note. DTC is shown to be the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for the inverse-Wishart pair "(S^-1)" and its diagonal matrix "D=diag(S^-1)", shedding light on its interpretation as a measure of "total partial correlation", -lndetP, with test hypothesis H0: P=I, where "P" is the standardized inverse covariance (i.e. P=(D^-1/2)(S^-1)(D^-1/2). The second aim of this paper introduces a generalization of all these measures for structured groups of variables. For instance, consider three or more groups, each consisting of three or more variables, with predominant redundancy within each group, but with synergistic interactions between groups. O-information will miss the between group synergy (since redundancy occurs more often in the system). In contrast, the structured O-information measure presented here will correctly report predominant synergy between groups. This is a relevant generalization towards structured multivariate information measures. A third aim is the presentation of a framework for quantifying the contribution of "connections" between variables, to the system's TC, DTC, O-information, and TSE complexity. A fourth aim is to present a generalization of the redundancy-synergy index for quantifying the contribution of a group of variables to the system's redundancy-synergy balance. Finally, it is shown that the expressions derived here directly apply to data from several other elliptical distributions. All program codes, data files, and executables are available (https://osf.io/jd37g/).</description>
