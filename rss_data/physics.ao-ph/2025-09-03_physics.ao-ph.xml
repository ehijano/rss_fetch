      <title>The Australian Identification, Nowcasting and Tracking Algorithm (A.I.N.T.)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Australian Identification, Nowcasting and Tracking (AINT) algorithm, a radar-based system for detecting, characterising, and archiving thunderstorm activity across the Australian continent. AINT employs a two-step hysteresis-based identification scheme to separate embedded convective cells, followed by a phase-correlation and optimisation framework for storm tracking and cell matching. Post-processing routines address challenges of ground clutter using clustering and topography-aware filtering, while a linear correction is applied to account for biases in maximum estimated size of hail (MESH) introduced by reflectivity interpolation in linear Z units. The resulting dataset provides both cell-based statistics and gridded storm products for every radar-identified thunderstorm, offering a high-resolution, quality-controlled archive for severe storm research, and risk modelling.</description>

      <title>A Dataset of Weather Station-Scale Photosynthetic Phenology in Mid- to High-Latitude Regions of the Northern Hemisphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study extracted photosynthetic phenology indicators (SOS, POS, EOS) from daily GPP data at the weather-station scale for the mid- to high-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere from 2001 to 2019. The resulting dataset covers nearly 60,000 site-years, with more than 1,000 stations maintaining complete 19-year records. Results reveal pronounced spatial variability, with distinct trends across vegetation types and aridity zones. Compared with flux networks and satellite-based products, this dataset greatly enhances data availability for phenology studies and provides a solid foundation for assessing the impacts of local hydrothermal conditions and extreme climate events on phenology.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Ekman-Stokes Model for Coupled Ocean-Wave-Atmosphere Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate representation of atmosphere-ocean boundary layers, including the interplay of turbulence, surface waves, and air-sea fluxes, remains a challenge in geophysical fluid dynamics, particularly for climate simulations. This study introduces a stochastic coupled Ekman-Stokes model (SCESM) developed within the physically consistent Location Uncertainty framework, explicitly incorporating random turbulent fluctuations and surface wave effects. The SCESM integrates established parameterizations for air-sea fluxes, turbulent viscosity, and Stokes drift, and its performance is rigorously assessed through ensemble simulations compared against observations from the LOTUS field experiment. A performance ranking analysis quantifies the impact of different model components, highlighting the critical role of explicit uncertainty representation in both oceanic and atmospheric dynamics for accurately capturing system variability. Among the tested configurations, the full model version -- including both Stokes drift and wave-induced mixing -- shows the best agreement with observations. Wave-induced mixing terms improve model performance, while wave-dependent surface roughness enhances air-sea fluxes but reduces the relative influence of wave-driven mixing. This fully coupled stochastic framework provides a foundation for advancing boundary layer parameterizations in large-scale climate models.</description>
