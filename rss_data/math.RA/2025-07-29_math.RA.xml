      <title>A Note on Weak Post-Hopf Algebra Structures on the Sweedler Hopf Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By omitting the unitary constraint from the definition of weak post-Hopf algebras, we introduce the concept of relaxed weak post-Hopf algebras, offering a thorough characterization of all feasible relaxed weak post-Hopf algebraic structures on the Sweedler Hopf algebra. This work reveals a distinct class of relaxed weak post-Hopf algebraic configurations, diverging from previously established weak post-Hopf algebraic frameworks.</description>

      <title>A class of twisted partial Hopf actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will introduce a novel method for constructing numerous examples of twisted partial Hopf actions. Utilizing split quaternions, split semi-quaternions, and ${1\over4}$-quaternions as our subjects of study, we have obtained a class of twisted partial Hopf actions by examining the twisted partial actions of Sweedler Hopf algebra on these structures.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notions of Hopf group braces, post-Hopf group algebras and Rota-Baxter Hopf group algebras as important generalizations of Hopf brace, post Hopf algebra and Rota-Baxter Hopf algebras respectively. We also discuss their relationships. Explicitly under the condition of cocomutativity, Hopf group braces, post-Hopf group algebras could be mutually obtained, and Rota-Baxter Hopf group algebras could lead to Hopf group braces.</description>

      <title>Tangent Lie Algebras of Automorphism Groups of Free Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an analogue of the Andreadakis-Johnson filtration for automorphism groups of free algebras and introduce the notion of tangent Lie algebras for certain automorphism groups, defined as subalgebras of the Lie algebra of derivations. We show that, for many classical varieties of algebras, the tangent Lie algebra is contained in the Lie algebra of derivations with constant divergence. We also introduce the concepts of approximately tame and absolutely wild automorphisms of free algebras in arbitrary varieties and employ tangent Lie algebras to investigate their properties. It is shown that nearly all known examples of wild automorphisms of free algebras are absolutely wild--with the notable exceptions of the Nagata and Anick automorphisms. We show that the Bergman automorphism of free matrix algebras of order two is absolutely wild. Furthermore, we prove that free algebras in any variety of polynilpotent Lie algebras -- except for the abelian and metabelian varieties -- also possess absolutely wild automorphisms.</description>

      <title>A characterization of endo-commutativity of 3-dimensional curled algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A curled algebra is a non-associative algebra in which $x$ and $x^2$ are linearly dependent for every element $x$. An algebra is called endo-commutative, if the square mapping from the algebra to itself preserves multiplication. In this paper, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a 3-dimensional curled algebra over an arbitrary field to be endo-commutative, expressed in terms of the properties of its underlying linear basis.</description>

      <title>On the graded singularity category of Abelian quotient singularities, I. Smooth categorical compactification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a singularity which is the quotient of an affine space $V$ by a finite Abelian group $G \subseteq \mathrm{SL}(V)$, we study the DG enhancement $\mathcal{D}^{b}(\mathrm{tails}(k[V]^G))$ of the bounded derived category of the non-commutative projective space $\mathrm{tails}(k[V]^G)$ and the DG enhancement $\mathcal{D}_{sg}^{\mathbb{Z}}(k[V]^G)$ of its graded singularity category. In this paper, we construct smooth categorical compactifications, in the sense of Efimov, of $\mathcal{D}^b(\mathrm{tails}(k[V]^G))$ and $\mathcal{D}_{sg}^{\mathbb{Z}}(k[V]^G)$ respectively, via the non-commutative crepant resolution of $k[V]^G$. We give explicit constructions of canonical classical generators in the kernels of such compactifications.</description>

      <title>Higher-rank graphs and the graded $K$-theory of Kumjian-Pask Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper lays out the foundations of graded $K$-theory for Leavitt algebras associated with higher-rank graphs, also known as Kumjian-Pask algebras, establishing it as a potential tool for their classification.
  For a row-finite $k$-graph $\Lambda$ without sources, we show that there exists a $\mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{Z}^k]$-module isomorphism between the graded zeroth (integral) homology $H_0^{gr}(\mathcal{G}_\Lambda)$ of the infinite path groupoid $\mathcal{G}_\Lambda$ and the graded Grothendieck group $K_0^{gr}(KP_\mathsf{k}(\Lambda))$ of the Kumjian-Pask algebra $KP_\mathsf{k}(\Lambda)$, which respects the positive cones (i.e., the talented monoids).
  We demonstrate that the $k$-graph moves of in-splitting and sink deletion defined by Eckhardt et al. (Canad. J. Math. 2022) preserve the graded $K$-theory of associated Kumjian-Pask algebras and produce algebras which are graded Morita equivalent, thus providing evidence that graded $K$-theory may be an effective invariant for classifying certain Kumjian-Pask algebras.
  We also determine a natural sufficient condition regarding the fullness of the graded Grothendieck group functor. More precisely, for two row-finite $k$-graphs $\Lambda$ and $\Omega$ without sources and with finite object sets, we obtain a sufficient criterion for lifting a pointed order-preserving $\mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{Z}^k]$-module homomorphism between $K_0^{gr}(KP_\mathsf{k}(\Lambda))$ and $K_0^{gr}(KP_\mathsf{k}(\Omega))$ to a unital graded ring homomorphism between $KP_\mathsf{k}(\Lambda)$ and $KP_\mathsf{k}(\Omega)$. For this we adapt, in the setting of $k$-graphs, the bridging bimodule technique recently introduced by Abrams, Ruiz and Tomforde (Algebr. Represent. Theory 2024).</description>

      <title>The Phantom of Davis-Wielandt Shell: A Unified Framework for Graphical Stability Analysis of MIMO LTI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework based on Davis-Wielandt (DW) shell for graphical stability analysis of multi-input and multi-output linear time-invariant feedback systems. Connections between DW shells and various graphical descriptions, as well as gain and phase measures, are established through an intuitive geometric perspective. Within this framework, we examine the relationships and relative conservatism among various separation conditions. A rotated Scaled Relative Graph (SRG) concept is proposed as a mixed gain-phase representation, from which a closed-loop stability criterion is derived and shown to be the least conservative among the existing 2-D graphical conditions for bi-component feedback loops. We also propose a reliable algorithm for visualizing the rotated SRGs and include an example to demonstrate the non-conservatism of the proposed condition.</description>

      <title>On the Irreducible Morphisms for Skew group algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an algebraically closed field K, let G be a finite abelian group of K-linear automorphisms of a finite-dimensional path algebra KQ of a quiver Q. Under certain assumptions on the action of G, we show the existence of a certain kind of covering that we call a Galois semi-covering functor, which becomes a Galois covering when the group action is free. We study the module category of its skew group algebra under this functor. As an application, we obtain a complete description of the irreducible morphisms and almost split sequences of skew group algebras and show that the (stable) rank is preserved under skewness. In particular, we determine the stable rank of skew-gentle algebras.</description>

      <title>Coadjoint orbits of low dimension for nilradicals of Borel subalgebras in classical types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak g$ be a classical simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb F$ of characteristic zero or large enough, and let $\mathfrak n$ be a maximal nilpotent subalgebra of $\mathfrak g$. The main tool in representation theory of $\mathfrak n$ is the orbit method, which classifies primitive ideals in the universal enveloping algebra ${\rm U}(\mathfrak n)$ and unitary representations of the unipotent group $N=\exp(\mathfrak n)$ in terms of coadjoint orbits on the dual space $\mathfrak n^*$. In the paper, we describe explicitly coadjoint orbits of low dimension for $\mathfrak n$ as above. The answer is given in terms of subsets of positive roots. As a corollary, we provide a way to calculate the number of irreducible complex representations of dimensions $q$, $q^2$ and $q^3$ for a maximal unipotent subgroup $N(q)$ in a classical Chevalley group $G(q)$ over a finite field $\mathbb F_q$ with $q$ elements. It turned out that this number is a polynomial in $q-1$ with nonnegative integer coefficients, which agrees with Isaac's conjecture.</description>

Abstract: Given a field $\mathbb{F}$, we introduce a novel group $SD(\mathbb{F})$ of its self-maps: the solutions $f \colon \mathbb{F} \twoheadrightarrow \mathbb{F}$ to the functional equation $f \left( (x+y)/(x-y) \right) = (f(x) + f(y))/(f(x) - f(y))$ for all $ x \neq y$ in $\mathbb{F}$. We compute this group for all fields algebraic over $\mathbb{F}_p$. In particular, this group distinguishes $\mathbb{F}_5$ among all finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$, and in fact among all subfields of $\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}$.</description>

      <title>An introduction to the symmetric group algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is an introduction to the group algebras of the symmetric groups, written for a quarter-long graduate course. After recalling the definition of group algebras (and monoid algebras) in general, as well as basic properties of permutations, we introduce several families of elements in the symmetric group algebras $\mathbf{k}[S_n]$ such as the Young--Jucys--Murphy elements, the (sign-)integrals and the conjugacy class sums. Then comes a chapter on group actions and representations in general, followed by the core of this text: a study of the representations of symmetric groups (i.e., of left $\mathbf{k}[S_n]$-modules), including the classical theory of Young tableaux and Young symmetrizers. We prove in detail the main facts including the characterization of irreducible representations (in characteristic $0$), the Garnir relations, the standard basis theorem, the description of duals of Specht modules, and the hook length formula, as well as a number of less known results. Finally, we describe several bases of $\mathbf{k}[S_n]$ that arise from the study of Specht modules, including the Murphy cellular bases.
  The methods used are elementary and computational. We aim to assume as little as possible of the base ring $\mathbf{k}$, and to use as little as possible from representation theory (nothing more advanced than Maschke and Jordan--H\"older).
  Over 100 exercises (without solutions) are scattered through the text.</description>

      <title>Smith normal forms of bivariate polynomial matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1978, Frost and Storey asserted that a bivariate polynomial matrix is equivalent to its Smith normal form if and only if the reduced minors of all orders generate the unit ideal. In this paper, we first demonstrate by constructing an example that for any given positive integer s with s &gt;= 2, there exists a square bivariate polynomial matrix M with the degree of det(M) in y equal to s, for which the condition that reduced minors of all orders generate the unit ideal is not a sufficient condition for M to be equivalent to its Smith normal form. Subsequently, we prove that for any square bivariate polynomial matrix M where the degree of det(M) in y is at most 1, Frost and Storey's assertion holds. Using the Quillen-Suslin theorem, we further extend our consideration of M to rank-deficient and non-square cases.</description>

      <title>Explicit and Effectively Symmetric Runge-Kutta Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is a key property of numerical methods. The geometric properties of symmetric schemes make them an attractive option for integrating Hamiltonian systems, whilst their ability to exactly recover the initial condition without the need to store the entire solution trajectory makes them ideal for the efficient implementation of Neural ODEs. In this work, we present a Hopf algebraic approach to the study of symmetric B-series methods. We show that every B-series method can be written as the composition of a symmetric and "antisymmetric" component, and explore the structure of this decomposition for Runge-Kutta schemes. A major bottleneck of symmetric Runge-Kutta schemes is their implicit nature, which requires solving a nonlinear system at each step. By introducing a new set of order conditions which minimise the antisymmetric component of a scheme, we derive what we call Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes -- a new class of explicit Runge-Kutta schemes with near-symmetric properties. We present examples of second-order EES schemes and demonstrate that, despite their low order, these schemes readily outperform higher-order explicit schemes such as RK4 and RK5, and achieve results comparable to implicit symmetric schemes at a significantly lower computational cost.</description>

      <title>Extensions realizing affine datum : central extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of extensions realizing affine datum is specialized to central extensions in varieties with a difference term which leads to generalizations of several classical theorems on central extensions from group theory. We establish a 1-dimensional Hochschild-Serre sequence for a central extension equipped with affine datum. This is used to develop a Schur-Hopf formula which characterizes the $2^{\mathrm{nd}}$-cohomology group of regular datum in terms of the transgression map and commutators in free presentations. We prove, assuming the existence of an idempotent, the existence of covers and provide a cohomological characterization of perfect algebras. The class of varieties with a difference term contain all varieties of algebras with modular congruence lattices; for example, any variety of groups with multiple operators in the parlance of P.J. Higgins or algebras of Loday-type - analogous results recently established for these algebras can be recovered by specialization.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties of Positive Definite Matrices over Symmetrized Tropical Algebras and Valued Ordered fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10602v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of positive definite and positive semi-definite symmetric matrices within the framework of symmetrized tropical algebra, an extension of tropical algebra adapted to ordered valued fields.
  We focus on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices. We
  prove that the eigenvalues of a positive (semi)-definite matrix in the tropical symmetrized setting coincide with its diagonal entries. Then, we show that the images by the valuation of the eigenvalues of a positive definite matrix over a valued nonarchimedean ordered field coincide with the eigenvalues of an associated matrix in the symmetrized tropical algebra. Moreover, under a genericity condition, we characterize the images of the eigenvectors under the map keeping track both of the nonarchimedean valuation and sign, showing that they coincide with tropical eigenvectors in the symmetrized algebra. These results offer new insights into the spectral theory of matrices over tropical semirings, and provide combinatorial formul\ae\ for log-limits of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of parametric families of real positive definite matrices.</description>

      <title>Classical Yang-Baxter equations and Nijenhuis operators for Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper the conditions that when a Lie algebra is Nijenhuis are investigated. Furthermore all the Nijenhuis operators on $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ under the standard Cartan-Weyl basis are given. On the other hand, the relations between the classical Yang-Baxter equation and Nijenhuis operators $N$ on a Lie algebra and $P$ on a Lie coalgebra are derived by means of the bialgebraic theory for Nijenhuis Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Characterizing categoricity in the class $Add(M)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19641v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the condition of being categorical in a tail of cardinals can be characterized for the class of $R$-modules of the form $\Add(M)$. More precisely, let $R$ be a ring and $M$ be an $R$-module which can be generated by $\leq \aleph$ elements. Then $\Add(M)$ is $\kappa$-categorical in all $\kappa&gt;\Vert R\Vert+\aleph+\aleph_0$ if and only if $\Add(M)$ is $\kappa$-categorical in some $\kappa&gt;\Vert R\Vert+\aleph+\aleph_0$; if and only if every $R$-module of cardinal $\kappa$ in $\Add(M)$ is $M$-free for all $\kappa&gt;\Vert R\Vert+\aleph+\aleph_0$; if and only if every $R$-module of cardinal $(\Vert R\Vert+\aleph+\aleph_0)^{+}$ in $\Add(M)$ is $M$-free.
  As an application, we show that the class of pure-projective $R$-modules is categorical in some (all) big cardinal if and only if $R$ is $R\cong M_n(D)$ where $D$ is a division ring and $n\geq 1$; the class of semisimple $R$-modules is categorical in some (all) big cardinal if and only if $R$ admits a unique simple module up to isomorphism, partly answering a question proposed in [5, Mazari-Armida M., Characterizing categoricity in several classes of modules. J. Algebra 617, 382-401 (2023)].</description>

      <title>Twisted traces on abelian quantum Higgs and Coulomb branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15198v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study twisted traces on the quantum Higgs branches $A_{\operatorname{Higgs}}$ of $3d, \mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theories, that is, the quantum Hamiltonian reductions of Weyl algebras. In theories which are good, we define a twisted trace that arises naturally from the correlation functions of the gauge theory. We show that this trace induces an inner product and a short star product on $A_{\operatorname{Higgs}}$.
  We analyze this trace in the case of an abelian gauge group and show that it has a natural expansion in terms of the twisted traces of Verma modules, confirming a conjecture of the first author and Okazaki. This expansion has a natural interpretation in terms of 3-d mirror symmetry, and we predict that it can be interpreted as an Atiyah-Bott fixed-point formula under the quantum Hikita isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Partially Dualized Quasi-Hopf Algebras Reconstructed from Dual Tensor Categories to Finite-Dimensional Hopf Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathsf{Rep}(H)$ be the category of finite-dimensional representations of a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra $H$. Andruskiewitsch and Mombelli proved in 2007 that each indecomposable exact $\mathsf{Rep}(H)$-module category has form $\mathsf{Rep}(B)$ for some indecomposable exact left $H$-comodule algebra $B$. This paper reconstructs and determines a quasi-Hopf algebra structure from the dual tensor category of $\mathsf{Rep}(H)$ with respect to $\mathsf{Rep}(B)$, when $B$ is a left coideal subalgebra of $H$. Consequently, it is categorically Morita equivalent to $H$, and some other elementary properties are also studied. As applications, our construction could be applied to imply some classical results on bismash products of matched pair of groups and bosonizations of dually paired Hopf algebras.</description>
