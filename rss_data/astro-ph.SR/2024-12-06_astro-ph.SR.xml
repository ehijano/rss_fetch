      <title>Oxygen Isotope Ratios in Hydrogen-Deficient Carbon Stars: A Correlation with Effective Temperature and Implications for White Dwarf Merger Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen-deficient Carbon (HdC) stars are a class of supergiants with anomalous chemical compositions, suggesting that they are remnants of CO-He white dwarf (WD) mergers. This class comprises two spectroscopically similar subclasses - dusty R Coronae Borealis (RCB) and dustless Hydrogen-deficient Carbon (dLHdC) stars. Both subclasses have a stark overabundance of $^{18}\textrm{O}$ in their atmospheres, but spectroscopic differences between them remain poorly studied. We present high-resolution ($R \approx 75000$) K-band spectra of six RCB and six dLHdC stars, including four newly discovered dLHdC stars, making this the largest sample to date. We develop a semi-automated fitting routine to measure $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}$ ratios for this sample, tripling the number of dLHdC stars with oxygen isotope ratios measured from high resolution spectra. All six dLHdC stars have $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}&lt;1$, while the RCB stars have $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}&gt;4$. Additionally, for the first time, we find a trend of decreasing $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}$ ratios with increasing effective temperature for HdC stars, consistent with predictions of theoretical WD merger models. However, we note that current models overpredict the low $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}$ ratios of dLHdC stars by two orders of magnitude. We also measure abundances of C, N, O, Fe, S, Si, Mg, Na, and Ca for these stars. We observe a correlation between the abundances of $^{14}\textrm{N}$ and $^{18}\textrm{O}$ in our sample, suggesting that a fixed fraction of the $^{14}\textrm{N}$ is converted to $^{18}\textrm{O}$ in these stars via $\alpha$-capture. Our results affirm the emerging picture that the mass ratio/total mass of the WD binary determine whether an RCB or dLHdC is formed post-merger.</description>

      <title>Photospheric Swirls in a Quiet-Sun Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swirl-shaped flow structures have been observed throughout the solar atmosphere, in both emission and absorption, at different altitudes and locations, and are believed to be associated with magnetic structures. However, the distribution patterns of such swirls, especially their spatial positions, remain unclear. Using the Automated Swirl Detection Algorithm (ASDA), we identified swirls from the high-resolution photospheric observations, centered on Fe I 630.25 nm, of a quiet region near the Sun's central meridian by the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. Through a detailed study of the locations of the detected small-scale swirls with an average radius of $\sim$300 km, we found that most of them are located in lanes between mesogranules (which have an average diameter of $\sim$5.4 Mm) instead of the commonly believed intergranular lanes. The squared rotation, expansion/contraction, vector speeds, and proxy kinetic energy are all found to follow Gaussian distributions. Their rotation speed, expansion/contraction speed, and circulation are positively correlated with their radius. These results suggest that photospheric swirls at different scales and locations across the observational 56.5" $\times$ 57.5" field-of-view (FOV) could share the same triggering mechanism at preferred spatial and energy scales. A comparison with previous work suggests that the number of photospheric swirls is positively correlated with the number of local magnetic concentrations, stressing the close relation between swirls and local magnetic concentrations:the number of swirls should positively correlate with the number and strength of local magnetic concentrations.</description>

      <title>Observational properties of 155 O- and B-type massive pulsating stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The O- and B-type (OB-type) pulsating stars are important objects to study the structure and evolution of massive stars through asteroseismology. A large amount of data from various sky surveys provide an unprecedented opportunity to search for and study this kind of variable star. We identify 155 OB-type pulsating stars or candidates, including 38 Oe/Be stars or candidates, from the data observed by TESS, LAMOST, and GAIA, which are almost new. Among the 155 objects, 87 samples are identified as SPB stars including 37 objects with pure low-frequency and 50 objects with both low- and high-frequency pulsation, and 14 samples are identified as BCEP stars with both low- and high-frequency pulsation. The H-R diagram shows that these SPB and BCEP stars are mainly located in their instability regions and in the evolutionary stage of the main-sequence with a mass range of 2.5-20 $M_{\odot}$ and 7-20 $M_{\odot}$. Two special objects show fourier spectra similar to BCEP stars but with different positions in H-R, Period-Temperature (P-T), and Period-Luminosity (P-L) diagrams. Meanwhile, 52 other targets are identified as candidates of OB-type pulsating stars. We also derive the preliminary results of the P-L relation for SPB and BCEP stars, respectively. This work also indicates that in addition to the H-R diagram, P-T and P-L diagrams are also very useful for the classification of SPB and BCEP. Further detailed analysis of these objects can dramatically increase our understanding of theories of evolution and structure for massive OB-type pulsating stars.</description>

      <title>A catalog of new slowly pulsating B-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports the discovery of new slowly pulsating B-type stars. Based on the photometric, spectral, and astrometric data of TESS, LAMOST, and Gaia surveys, we have found 286 new slowly pulsating B-type stars (SPB stars) and 21 candidates. Among these, 20 are Be stars or candidates with emission line profiles. It is shown that these SPB stars have luminosities between 40 and 2850 $L_{\odot}$ and effective temperatures ranging from 10000K to 21000K. Their pulsation periods are from 0.14 to 6.5 days with amplitude ranges of 0.2-20 mmag in TESS band. It is indicated that these targets follow the distribution of the SPB stars in the period-luminosity (P-L) and the period-temperature (P-T) diagrams. Their positions on the H-R diagram reveal that most of these pulsators are distributed in the instability region of SPB stars, in the main-sequence evolutionary stage, and with mass ranges of 2.5-7 $M_{\odot}$. However, there are some targets beyond the red edge of the theoretical instability region, which should be caused by the rapid rotation reducing the measured effective temperature. The discovery of these new SPB stars increases the total number by over 60\%, which are significant samples for further investigating the structure and evolution of intermediate-mass and even massive stars by asteroseismology.</description>

      <title>Observational Properties of 155 $\beta$ Cephei pulsating variable stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\beta$ Cephei pulsating variable (BCEP) stars are the most massive pulsating variable stars in the main sequence, exhibiting both p- and g-mode pulsations. In this study, we identified 155 BCEP stars or candidates using data from TESS and Gaia, of which 83 were first confirmed as BCEP stars. They have visual magnitudes ranging from 8 to 12 mag and effective temperatures between approximately 20,000 and 30,000 K, while the parallaxes of most targets are between 0.2 and 0.6 mas. The study indicates that these BCEP stars have pulsation periods ranging from 0.06 to 0.31 days, with amplitudes ranging from 0.1 to 55.8 mmag in the TESS band. Additionally, the number of BCEP stars increases as the pulsation amplitude decreases. These targets align with the distribution region of BCEP stars in the luminosity-period (L-P) and temperature-period (T-P) diagrams. We have updated the L-P relation of BCEP stars. The Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram indicates that these targets are in the main-sequence evolutionary phase, with masses ranging from 7 to 20 $M_{\odot}$ and luminosities between 2800 and 71,000 $L_{\odot}$. They are almost in the theoretical instability region of BCEP stars but as previously reported, this region at the low-mass end (red) is not filled. The distribution of the pulsation constant indicates that the dominant pulsation periods of BCEP stars consist mainly of low-order p-mode pulsations with a high proportion of radial fundamental modes. These BCEP stars are excellent objects for enhancing our understanding of the structure and evolution of massive stars through asteroseismology.</description>

      <title>Jets are the most robust observable ingredient of common envelope evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I examine images of 50 planetary nebulae (PNe) with observable post-common envelope evolution (CEE) binary central stars and find that jets are about 40 percent more common than dense equatorial outflows. Because, in some cases, energetic jets can compress an equatorial outflow and because fast jets might disperse early in the PN evolution and avoid detection, the CEE process is likelier to launch jets than to eject a dense equatorial outflow by a larger factor than 1.4. In most cases, the companion, mainly a main sequence star, launches the jets as it accretes mass from the envelope of the giant star. By CEE jets, I also refer to jets launched shortly before the onset of the CEE, likely a grazing envelope evolution phase, and shortly after the CEE. The jets and the accretion of mass by the companion before, during, and after the CEE affect envelope mass removal and the final orbital separation. Most numerical simulations of the CEE ignore jets, and those that include jets omit other processes. Despite the considerable progress in the last decade with tens of hydrodynamical simulations of the CEE, we are still far from correctly simulating the CEE. Including jets in simulations of the CEE requires heavy computer resources, but it must be the next step.</description>

      <title>Modeling the astrosphere of LHS~1140</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic ray (CR) flux, as well as the hydrogen flux into the atmosphere of an exoplanet, can change the composition of the atmosphere. Here, we present the CR and hydrogen flux on top of the atmosphere. To do so, we have to study the 3D multifluid MHD structure of astrospheres. We discuss the shock structure of the stellar wind of LHS 1140 using four different models: HD and MHD single-fluid models, as well as multifluid models for both cases, including a neutral hydrogen flow from the interstellar medium. The CR flux in a multifluid model as well as the ionization rate in an exoplanetary atmosphere are also presented. The astrosphere is modeled using the 3D Cronos code, while the CR flux at LHS 1140 b is calculated using both a 1D and a 3D stochastic galactic CR modulation code. Finally, the atmospheric ionization and radiation dose is estimated using the AtRIS code. Results. It is shown that the 3D multifluid positions of the termination shock differ remarkably from those found in the 3D ideal-single fluid hydrodynamic case. CR fluxes computed using a 1D approach are completely different from those calculated using the 3D modulation code and show an essentially unmodulated spectrum at the exoplanet in question. Utilizing these spectra, ionization rates and radiation exposure within the atmosphere of LHS 1140 b are derived. The termination shock, astropause, and bow shock distances must be taken from the 3D multifluid MHD model to determine the CR fluxes correctly. Moreover, because of the tiny astrosphere, the exoplanet is submerged in the neutral hydrogen flow of the interstellar medium, which will influence the exoplanetary atmosphere. A 3D approach to Galactic\0 cosmic ray (GCR) modulation in astrospheres is also necessary to avoid unrealistic estimates of GCR intensities.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric molecular blobs shape up circumstellar envelopes of AGB stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During their thermally pulsing phase, Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars eject material that forms extended dusty envelopes. Visible polarimetric imaging found clumpy dust clouds within two stellar radii of several oxygen-rich stars. Inhomogeneous molecular gas has also been observed in multiple emission lines within several stellar radii of different oxygen rich stars, including W Hya and Mira. At the stellar surface level, infrared images have revealed intricate structures around the carbon semi-regular variable R Scl and in the S-type star $\pi^{\mathrm{1}}$ Gru. Infrared images have also shown clumpy dust structures within a few stellar radii of the prototypical carbon AGB star IRC+10216, and studies of the molecular gas distribution beyond the dust formation zone have also shown complex circumstellar structures. Because of the lack of sufficient spatial resolution, however, the distribution of molecular gas in the stellar atmosphere and the dust formation zone of AGB carbon stars is not known, nor is how it is subsequently expelled.
  Here we report observations with a resolution of one stellar radius of the recently formed dust and molecular gas in the atmosphere of IRC+10216. Lines of HCN, SiS, and SiC$_2$ appear at different radii and in different clumps, which we interpret as large convective cells in the photosphere, as seen in Betelgeuse. The convective cells coalesce with pulsation causing anisotropies that, together with companions, shape its circumstellar envelope.</description>

      <title>A Spectrophotometric analysis and dust properties of classical nova V5584 Sgr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, optical observations of the nova V5584 Sgr are presented. These observations cover different phases including pre-maximum, early decline, and nebular. The spectra are dominated by hydrogen Balmer, Fe II, and O I lines with P-Cygni profiles in the early phase, which are subsequently observed in complete emission. The presence of numerous Fe II lines and low ejecta velocity aligns with the Fe II type nova classification. From optical and NIR colors it is clear that this nova manifests dust formation in the ejecta. The dust temperature and mass were estimated from a spectral energy distribution (SED) fit to the JHK band magnitudes and the WISE data. Light curve analysis shows t$_2$ and t$_3$ values of $\sim$ 26 and $\sim$ 48 days, classifying the nova as moderately fast. The physical and chemical properties during early decline and later phases were evaluated using the photoionization code CLOUDY. The best-fit model parameters from two epochs of multiwavelength spectra are compatible with a hot white dwarf source with a roughly constant luminosity of $\sim$ (2.08 $\pm$ 0.10) $\times$ 10$^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We find an ejected mass of $\sim$ (1.59 $\pm$ 0.04) $\times$ 10$^{-4}$M$_{\odot}$. Abundance analysis indicates that the ejecta is significantly enriched relative to solar values, with O/H = 30.2, C/H = 10.8, He/H = 1.8, Mg/H = 1.68, Na/H = 1.55, and N/H = 45.5 in the early decline phase, and O/H = 4.5, Ne/H = 1.5, and N/H = 24.5 in the nebular phase.</description>

      <title>Near-infrared spectroscopy of the LMC recurrent nova LMCN 1968-12a</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have obtained near-infrared ($0.80-2.45\mu$m) spectra of the recurrent nova LMCN 1968-12a on two occasions during its 2024 August eruption. This is the first near-infrared spectroscopy of an extragalactic nova. The initial spectrum, on day 8.48, caught the nova in the coronal phase, with the [SiX] $1.43\mu$m line being extremely strong. This line had a luminosity of $\sim95$L$_\odot$, and is clearly a very powerful coolant. Its presence, together with the absence of [SiIX] 1.56$\mu$m, implies a coronal temperature $\gtrsim3\times10^6$K, possibly amongst the highest recorded coronal temperature in a nova eruption. With the exception of the [SiX] line, the near-infrared spectra are remarkable for being devoid of metal lines. We suggest that this is due, in part, to the exceptionally high temperature of the coronal gas, causing ions, whose emission lines would normally appear in the near-infrared spectrum, to be collisionally ionised to higher stages.</description>

      <title>Investigating Kozai-Lidov Oscillations and Disc Tearing in Be Star Discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent simulations of Be stars in misaligned binary systems have revealed that misalignment between the disc and binary orbit can cause the disc to undergo Kozai-Lidov (KL) oscillations or disc-tearing. We build on our previous suite of three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of equal-mass systems by simulating eight new misaligned Be star binary systems, with mass-ratios of 0.1 and 0.5, or equal-mass systems with varying viscosity. We find the same phenomena occur as previously for mass ratios of 0.5, while the mass ratio of 0.1 does not cause KL oscillations or disc-tearing for the parameters examined. With increased viscosity in our equal-mass simulations, we show that these phenomena and other oscillations are damped out and do not occur. We also briefly compare two viscosity prescriptions and find they can produce the same qualitative disc evolution. Next, we use the radiative transfer code HDUST to predict observable trends of a KL oscillation, and show how the observables oscillate in sync with disc inclination and cause large changes in the polarization position angle. Our models generate highly complex line profiles, including triple-peak profiles that are known to occur in Be stars. The mapping between the SPH simulations and these triple-peak features gives us hints as to where they originate. Finally, we construct interferometric predictions of how a gap in the disc, produced by KL oscillations or disc-tearing, perturbs the visibility versus baseline curve at multiple wavelengths, and can cause large changes to the differential phase profile across an emission line.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Efficacy of Topologically Derived Time-Series for Flare Forecasting. I. Dataset Preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate forecasting of solar flares is considered a key goal within the solar physics and space weather communities. There is significant potential for flare prediction to be improved by incorporating topological fluxes of magnetogram datasets, without the need to invoke three-dimensional magnetic field extrapolations. Topological quantities such as magnetic helicity and magnetic winding have shown significant potential towards this aim, and provide spatio-temporal information about the complexity of active region magnetic fields. This study develops time-series that are derived from the spatial fluxes of helicity and winding that show significant potential for solar flare prediction. It is demonstrated that time-series signals, which correlate with flare onset times, also exhibit clear spatial correlations with eruptive activity; establishing a potential causal relationship. A significant database of helicity and winding fluxes and associated time series across 144 active regions is generated using SHARP data processed with the ARTop code that forms the basis of the time-series and spatial investigations conducted here. We find that a number of time-series in this dataset often exhibit extremal signals that occur 1-8 hours before a flare. This, publicly available, living dataset will allow users to incorporate these data into their own flare prediction algorithms.</description>

      <title>The Red Supergiant Problem: As Seen from the Local Group's Red Supergiant Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The red supergiant (RSG) problem, which describes the apparent lack of high-luminosity progenitors detected in Type II supernova (SN) pre-images, has been a contentious topic for two decades. We re-assess this problem using a new RSG population of the Milky Way supplemented with RSGs from other galaxies in the Local Group. In particular, we quantify the uncertainties inherent to assumptions made regarding the star's temperature or spectral type and the corresponding bolometric correction. We find that only M3 or later RSGs reproduce the steepness seen from the SN II pre-imaged sample. To assess the significance of the RSG problem, we build a metallicity-weighted cumulative luminosity distribution of M3 or later RSGs and directly compare it to the luminosity distribution of SN II pre-imaged progenitors. We find no evidence of missing high-luminosity pre-imaged progenitors since the uncertainties on the pre-imaged SN progenitors and single-band derived luminosity are too large to meaningfully infer population differences.</description>

      <title>Optical constraints on the coldest metal-poor population</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coldest metal-poor population made of T and Y dwarfs are archaeological tracers of our Galaxy because they are very old and have kept the pristine material. The optical properties of these objects are important to characterise their atmospheric properties. We aim at characterising further the optical properties of ultracool metal-poor population with deep far-red optical images and parallax determinations. We solve trigonometric parallaxes of five metal-poor T dwarf candidates using 2-year monitoring with Calar-Alto 3.5-m telescope. We obtain $z'$-band photometry for the other 12 metal-poor T dwarf candidates using the 10.4-m GTC, the 8.2-m VLT, and the DES, increasing the sample of T subdwarfs with optical photometry from 12 to 24. We report a 3-$\sigma$ limit for the Accident in five optical bands using the 10.4-m GTC. We confirm four T subdwarfs and the Accident as a Y subdwarf, and propose two more Y subdwarf candidates. We emphasise that the $z_{PS1}-W1$ colour combining with the $W1-W2$ colour could break the metallicity-temperature degeneracy for T and possibly for Y dwarfs. The $z_{PS1}-W1$ colour shifts redward when metallicity decreases for a certain temperature, which is not predicted by state-of-the-art ultracool models. The Accident has the reddest $z_{PS1}-W1$ colour among our sample. The $z_{PS1}-W1$ colour will be useful to search for other examples of this cold and old population in upcoming and existing deep optical and infrared large-area surveys.</description>

      <title>Journey to the center of the common envelope evolution. Inner dynamics of the post-dynamical inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of common envelope evolution are often terminated soon after the initial dynamical plunge of the companion transitions into a long-lasting post-dynamical inspiral with slowly varying semi-major axis, $a_\text{b}$. This premature termination is often due to insufficient numerical resolution and challenges associated with the softening of the gravitational potential of the two cores. In this work, we use statically-refined 3D hydrodynamical simulations to study binaries orbiting inside a common envelope, exploring the effects of varying numerical resolution, $\delta$, gravitational potential softening prescriptions, and the associated softening lengthscale, $\epsilon$. We find that quantities such as the binary inspiral timescale or the volume-averaged shearing rate typically converge to asymptotic values only for $\epsilon \le 0.1 a_\text{b}$ and $\delta \le 6 \times 10^{-3}a_\text{b}$ with smaller $\epsilon$ requiring correspondingly smaller $\delta$. After a few tens of binary orbits, the two cores become surrounded by a corotating, nearly hydrostatic gas structure, resembling the shared envelope of a contact binary. We propose that this structure is responsible for the slowing down of the dynamical inspiral, leading to an asymptotic inspiral timescale of approximately $10^5$ orbital periods for a binary mass ratio $q=1/3$, and approximately $10^6$ orbital periods for a binary mass ratio $q=1$. By investigating kinetic helicity, we argue that the magnetic field is unlikely to organize into large-scale structures via the usual $\alpha$--effect during the post-dynamical phase. Even in the absence of magnetic fields, we observe intermittent polar outflows collimated by partially centrifugally evacuated polar funnels. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Expanding the ultracompacts: gravitational wave-driven mass transfer in the shortest-period binaries with accretion disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of three ultracompact binary white dwarf systems hosting accretion disks, with orbital periods of 7.95, 8.68, and 13.15 minutes. This significantly augments the population of mass-transferring binaries at the shortest periods, and provides the first evidence that accretors in ultracompacts can be dense enough to host accretion disks even below 10 minutes (where previously only direct-impact accretors were known). In the two shortest-period systems, we measured changes in the orbital periods driven by the combined effect of gravitational wave emission and mass transfer; we find $\dot{P}$ is negative in one case, and positive in the other. This is only the second system measured with a positive $\dot{P}$, and it the most compact binary known that has survived a period minimum. Using these systems as examples, we show how the measurement of $\dot{P}$ is a powerful tool in constraining the physical properties of binaries, e.g. the mass and mass-radius relation of the donor stars. We find that the chirp masses of ultracompact binaries at these periods seem to cluster around $\mathcal{M}_c \sim 0.3 M_\odot$, perhaps suggesting a common origin for these systems or a selection bias in electromagnetic discoveries. Our new systems are among the highest-amplitude known gravitational wave sources in the millihertz regime, providing exquisite opportunity for multi-messenger study with future space-based observatories such as \textit{LISA} and TianQin; we discuss how such systems provide fascinating laboratories to study the unique regime where the accretion process is mediated by gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Image-Constrained Modeling with Hubble and Keck Images Reveals that OGLE-2012-BLG-0563Lb is a Jupiter-Mass planet Orbiting a K Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high angular resolution imaging from the {\sl Hubble Space Telescope} combined with adaptive optics imaging results from the {\sl Keck}-II telescope to determine the mass of the OGLE-2012-BLG-0563L host star and planet to be $M_{\rm host} = 0.801\pm 0.033M_\odot$ and $M_{\rm planet} = 1.116 \pm 0.087 M_{\rm Jupiter}$, respectively, located at a distance of $D_L = 5.46\pm 0.56\,$kpc. There is a close-wide degeneracy in the light curve models that indicates star-planet projected separation of $1.50\pm 0.16\,$AU for the close model and $8.41\pm 0.87\,$AU for the wide model. We used the image-constrained modeling method to analyze the light curve data with constraints from this high angular resolution image analysis. This revealed systematic errors in some of the ground-based light curve photometry that led to an estimate of the angular Einstein Radius, $\theta_E$, that was too large by a factor of $\sim 2$. The host star mass is a factor of 2.4 larger than the value presented in the \citet{fukui15} discovery paper. Although most systematic photometry errors seen in ground-based microlensing light curve photometry will not be repeated in data from the {\sl Roman Space Telescope}'s Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey, we argue that image constrained modeling will be a valuable method to identify possible systematic errors in {\sl Roman} photometry.</description>

      <title>Blue Loops, Cepheids, and Forays into Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The blue loop stage of intermediate mass stars has been called a "magnifying glass", where even seemingly small effects in prior stages of evolution, as well as assumptions about stellar composition, rotation, and convection, produce discernible changes. As such, blue loops, and especially the existence and properties of Cepheids, can serve as a laboratory where feebly connected Beyond Standard Model particles such as axions can be gainfully studied. We undertake a careful study of the effects of these putative particles on the blue loop, paying close attention to the evolution of the core potential and the hydrogen profile. Our simulations, performed with MESA, place bounds on the axion-photon coupling using the galactic Cepheid S Mus, with dynamically-determined mass of $6 M_\odot$, as a benchmark. The effects of varying convective overshoot on the core potential and hydrogen profile, and the ensuing changes in the axion constraints, are carefully studied. Along the way, we explore the "mirror principle" induced by the hydrogen burning shell and contrast our results with those existing in the literature. Less conservative (but more stringent) bounds on the axion-photon coupling are given for a $9 M_\odot$ model, which is the heaviest that can be simulated if overshoot is incorporated, and tentative projections are given for a $12 M_\odot$ model, which is approximately the heaviest tail of the mass distribution of galactic Cepheids determined by pulsation models using Gaia DR2. Our main message is that the reliable simulation and observation (ideally, through dynamical mass determination) of massive Cepheids constitutes an important frontier in axion searches, challenges in modeling uncertainties in the microphysics of the blue loop stage notwithstanding.</description>

      <title>Radial Oscillations in Hybrid Stars with Slow Quark Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the radial oscillations of hybrid neutron stars, characterized by a composition of hadronic external layers and a quark matter core. Utilizing a density-dependent relativistic mean-field model that incorporates hyperons and baryons for describing hadronic matter, and a density-dependent quark model for quark matter, we analyze the ten lowest eigenfrequencies and their corresponding oscillation functions. Our focus lies on neutron stars with equations-of-state involving N, N + $\Delta$, N + H, and N + H + $\Delta$, featuring a phase transition to quark matter. Emphasizing the effects of a slow phase transition at the hadron-quark interface, we observe that the maximum mass is attained before the fundamental mode's frequency decreases for slow phase transitions. This observation implies the stability of stellar configurations with higher central densities than the maximum mass, called Slow Stable Hybrid Stars (SSHSs), even under small radial perturbations. The length of these SSHS branch depends upon the energy density jump between two phases and the stiffness of the quark EoS.</description>

      <title>Deep imaging of three accelerating stars using SHARK-NIR and LMIRCam at LBT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combination of detection techniques enhances our ability to identify companions orbiting nearby stars. We employed high-contrast imaging to constrain mass and separation of possible companions responsible for the significant proper motion anomalies of the nearby stars HIP 11696, HIP 47110 and HIP 36277. These targets were observed using the LBT's high-contrast camera, SHARK-NIR, in H-band using a Gaussian coronagraph, and with the LMIRCam instrument in the L'-band and using a vAPP coronagraph. Both observations were conducted simultaneously. Additionally, constraints at short separations from the host star are derived analyzing the renormalized unit weight error (RUWE) values from the Gaia catalogue. We find that the companion responsible for the anomaly signal of HIP 11696 is likely positioned at a distance from 2.5 to 28 astronomical units from its host. Its mass is estimated to be between 4 and 16 Jupiter masses, with the greater mass possible only at the upper end of the separation range. Similar limits were obtained for HIP 47110 where the companion should reside between 3 and 30 au with a mass between 3 and 10 MJup. For HIP 36277, we identified a faint stellar companion at large separation, though it might be substellar depending on the assumed age for the star. Considering the older age, this object accounts for the absolute value of the PMa vector but not for its direction. Additionally, we found a substellar candidate companion at a closer separation that could explain the PMa signal, considering a younger age for the system.</description>

      <title>Time-Frequency Correlation of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts: Correlated Aftershocks Tend to Exhibit Downward Frequency Drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The production mechanism of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains elusive, and potential correlations between burst occurrence times and various burst properties may offer important clues. Among them, the spectral peak frequency is particularly important because it may encode direct information about the physical conditions and environment at the emission site. Analyzing over 4,000 bursts from the three most active sources -- FRB 20121102A, FRB 20201124A, and FRB 20220912A -- we measure the two-point correlation function $\xi(\Delta t, \Delta\nu_{\:\rm peak}\:)$ in the two-dimensional space of time separation $\Delta t$ and peak frequency shift $\Delta\nu_{\:\rm peak}\:$ between burst pairs. We find a universal trend of asymmetry about $\Delta\nu_{\:\rm peak}\:$ at high statistical significance; $\xi(\Delta\nu_{\:\rm peak}\:)$ decreases as $\Delta\nu_{\:\rm peak}\:$ increases from negative to positive values in the region of short time separation ($\Delta t &lt; 0.3$ s), where physically correlated aftershock events produce a strong time correlation signal. This indicates that aftershocks tend to exhibit systematically lower peak frequencies than mainshocks, with this tendency becoming stronger at shorter $\Delta t$. We argue that the "sad trombone effect" -- the downward frequency drift observed among sub-pulses within a single event -- is not confined within a single event but manifests as a statistical nature that extends continuously to independent yet physically correlated aftershocks with time separations up to $\Delta t \sim 0.3$ s. This discovery provides new insights into underlying physical processes of repeater FRBs.</description>

      <title>From Misaligned Sub-Saturns to Aligned Brown Dwarfs: The Highest $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ Systems Exhibit Low Obliquities, Even around Hot Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a pattern emerging from stellar obliquity measurements in single-star systems: planets with high planet-to-star mass ratios ($M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$$&gt;$ $2\times10^{-3}$) -- such as super-Jupiters, brown dwarf companions, and M-dwarfs hosting Jupiter-like planets -- tend to be aligned, even around hot stars. This alignment represents a 3.7$\sigma$ deviation from the obliquity distribution observed in systems with lower mass ratios ($M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$$&lt;$ $2\times10^{-3}$), which predominantly include Jupiters and sub-Saturns. The only known outlier system, XO-3, exhibits misalignment confirmed via our newly collected Rossiter-McLaughlin effect measurement ($\lambda=41.8^{+2.1}_{-2.0}$ degrees). However, the relatively large $\textit{Gaia}$ Renormalized Unit Weight Error (RUWE) of XO-3 suggests that it may harbor an undetected binary companion, potentially contributing to its misalignment. Given that tidal realignment mechanisms are weak for hot stars, the observed alignment in high $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ systems is likely $\textit{primordial}$ rather than resulting from tidal interactions. One possible explanation is that only dynamically isolated planets can continue accreting gas and evolve into super-Jupiters while maintaining their primordial alignment. Conversely, planets formed in compact configurations may be unable to grow beyond the gap-opening mass, for which our work suggests an empirical boundary $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$$=$ $2\times10^{-3}$, identified between aligned high $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ systems and misaligned low $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ systems, with dynamical instabilities contributing to the diverse spin-orbit misalignments observed in the latter.</description>

Abstract: Galactic double white dwarfs are predominant sources of gravitational waves in the millihertz frequencies accessible to space-borne gravitational wave detectors. With advances in multi-messenger astronomy, an increasing number of double white dwarf systems will be discovered through both electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. In this paper, we simulated two populations of double white dwarfs originating from different star formation histories (hereafter referred to as Model 1 and Model 2) using the binary population synthesis method. We predicted the number of double white dwarfs in our Galaxy detectable by TianQin and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) individually, as well as through their joint observation. In addition, we performed an analysis to evaluate the accuracy of the parameter estimation using the Fisher information matrix. Furthermore, we predicted the number of detached eclipsing double white dwarfs detectable by Gaia and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (VRO). Our study found that over the nominal mission durations, TianQin, LISA, and their joint observation can detect at least five thousand and potentially several tens of thousands of double white dwarfs with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 7. Gaia and VRO are expected to detect at least several dozen and up to several hundred eclipsing double white dwarfs with orbital periods less than 30 hours. We also found that several dozen eclipsing double white dwarfs can be detected jointly through electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Evolving massive stars to core collapse with GENEC: Extension of equation of state, opacities and effective nuclear network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stars with initial mass above roughly 8 solar masses will evolve to form a core made of iron group elements at which point no further exothermic nuclear reactions between charged nuclei may prevent the core collapse. Electron captures, neutrino losses, and the photo-disintegration of heavy nuclei trigger the collapse of these stars. Models at the brink of core collapse are produced using stellar evolution codes and these pre-collapse models may be used in the study of the subsequent dynamical evolution (including their explosion as supernovae and the formation of compact remnants such as neutron stars or black holes). We upgrade the physical ingredients employed by the GENeva stellar Evolution Code, GENEC, so that it may cover the regime of high temperatures and high densities required to produce progenitors of core-collapse. We have improved GENEC in three directions, equation of state, the nuclear reaction network and the radiative and conductive opacities adapted for the computation of the advanced phases of evolution. We produce a small grid of pre-supernova models of stars with zero-age main sequence masses of 15, 20 and 25 solar masses at solar and less than half solar metallicities. The results are compared with analogous models produced with the MESA code. The global properties of our new models, particularly of their inner cores, are comparable to models computed with MESA and pre-existing progenitors in the literature. Between codes the exact shell structure varies impacting explosion predictions. Using GENEC with state-of-the-art physics, we have produced massive stellar progenitors prior to collapse. These progenitors are suitable for follow-up studies, including the dynamical collapse and supernova phases. Larger grids of supernova progenitors are now feasible, with potential for further dynamical evolution.</description>

      <title>Modeling High Mass X-ray Binaries to Double Neutron Stars through Common Envelope Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present detailed evolutionary simulations of wide binary systems with high-mass ($8-20\,M_{\odot}$) donor stars and a $1.4\,M_{\odot}$ neutron star. Mass transfer in such binaries is dynamically unstable and common envelope (CE) evolution is followed. We use a recently developed prescription to deal with CE evolution and consider various CE ejection efficiencies varying in the range of $0.1-3.0$. We focus on the evolutionary consequences of the binaries survived CE evolution. We demonstrate that it is possible for the binaries to enter a CE decoupling phase (CEDP) when the donor stars are partially stripped leaving a hydrogen envelope of $\lesssim1.0-4.0\,M_\odot$ after CE evolution. This phase is expected to last $\sim 10^4-10^5\,\rm yr$, during which mass transfer occurs stably via Roche lobe overflow with super-Eddington rates. Identification of some X-ray binaries in a CEDP is important for the understanding of the physics of CE evolution itself, the origin of ultraluminous X-ray sources, and the recycling process of accreting pulsars. Also, we discuss the formation of double neutron stars and the occurrence of ultra-stripped supernovae according to the results from our simulations. On the whole, the properties of post-CE binaries are sensitive to the options of CE ejection efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Smart Kanata: A Framework for Autonomous Decision Making in Rapid Follow-up Observations of Cataclysmic Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the early stages of transient events provides crucial information about the fundamental physical processes in cataclysmic variables (CVs). However, determining an appropriate observation mode immediately after the discovery of a new transient presents challenges due to significant uncertainties regarding its nature. We developed a framework designed for autonomous decision making in prompt follow-up observations of CVs using the Kanata 1.5-m telescope. The system, named Smart Kanata, first estimates the class probabilities of variable star types using a generative model. It then selects the optimal observation mode from three possible options based on the mutual information calculated from the class probabilities. We have operated the system for ~300 days and obtained 21 samples, among which automated observations were successfully performed for a nova and a microlensing event. In the time-series spectra of the nova V4370 Oph, we detected a rapid deepening of the absorption component of the H_alpha line. These initial results demonstrate the capability of Smart Kanata in facilitating rapid observations and improving our understanding of outbursts and eruptions of CVs and other galactic transients.</description>

      <title>Association between Recurrent Novae and Nova Super-Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17652v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nova super-remnants (NSRs) are substantially extended structures (up to ~130 parsecs across) encompassing recurrent novae. NSRs grow as a result of frequent nova eruptions transporting vast quantities of the locally surrounding interstellar medium away from the binary system over many millennia into a thin high-density shell, as the central white dwarf grows towards the Chandrasekhar limit. The prototypical NSR, first identified as such in 2014, is situated in the Andromeda Galaxy and belongs to the annually erupting nova, M31N 2008-12a (or '12a'). In this short review, modelling of evolving NSRs (including the 12a NSR) will be outlined as motivation towards searching for more of these phenomena in the Galaxy and beyond. The latest developments in this upcoming subfield of nova research will then be presented including the discovery of two new Galactic nova super-remnants (and their consequent modelling) and the first survey undertaken with the sole purpose of finding NSRs in the Andromeda Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>
