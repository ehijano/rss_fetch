      <title>Blow-Up Dynamics for the $L^2$ critical case of the $2$D Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the blow-up dynamics for the $L^2$ critical two-dimensional Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} \partial_t u+\partial_{x_1} (\Delta u+u^3)=0, \mbox{ } x=(x_1,x_2)\in \mathbb{R}^2, \mbox{ } t \in \mathbb{R}\\ u(0,x_1,x_2)=u_0(x_1,x_2)\in H^1(\mathbb{R}^2), \end{cases} \end{equation*} with initial data $u_0$ slightly exceeding the mass of the ground state $Q$. Employing methodologies analogous to the Martel-Merle-Raphael blow-up theory for $L^2$ critical equations, more precisely for the critical NLS equation and the quintic generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation, we categorize the solution behaviors into three outcomes: asymptotic stability, finite-time blow-up, or divergence from the soliton's vicinity. The construction of the blow-up solution involves the bubbling of the solitary wave which ensures the universal behavior and stability of the blow-up.</description>

      <title>Regularity theory of a gradient degenerate Neumann problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the regularity and comparison principle for a gradient degenerate Neumann problem. The problem is a generalization of the Signorini or thin obstacle problem which appears in the study of certain singular anisotropic free boundary problems arising from homogenization. In scaling terms, the problem is critical since the gradient degeneracy and the Neumann PDE operator are of the same order. We show the (optimal) $C^{1,\frac{1}{2}}$ regularity in dimension $d=2$ and we show the same regularity result in $d\geq 3$ conditional on the assumption that the degenerate values of the solution do not accumulate. We also prove a comparison principle characterizing minimal supersolutions, which we believe will have applications to homogenization and other related scaling limits.</description>

      <title>A simple way to well-posedness in $H^{1}$ of a delay differential equation from cell biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an application of recent well-posedness results in the theory of delay differential equations for ordinary differential equations arXiv:2308.04730 to a generalized population model for stem cell maturation. The weak approach using Sobolev-spaces we take allows for a larger class of initial prehistories and makes checking the requirements for well-posedness of such a model considerably easier compared to previous approaches. In fact the present approach is a possible means to guarantee that the solution manifold is not empty, which is a necessary requirement for a $C^{1}$-approach to work.</description>

      <title>On smooth and peaked traveling waves in a local model for shallow water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new model equation for Stokes gravity waves based on conformal transformations of Euler's equations. The local version of the model equation is relevant for dynamics of shallow water waves. It allows us to characterize the traveling periodic waves both in the case of smooth and peaked waves and to solve the existence problem exactly, albeit not in elementary functions. Spectral stability of smooth waves with respect to co-periodic perturbations is proven analytically based on the exact count of eigenvalues in a constrained spectral problem.</description>

      <title>Gradient ascend method for fully nonlinear parabolic differential equations with convex nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a generic numerical schemes for fully nonlinear parabolic PDEs on the full domain, where the nonlinearity is convex on the Hessian of the solution. The main idea behind this paper is reduction: we reduce the fully nonlinear problem to a series of simpler semilinear ones parameterized by the diffusion term and take the maximum over the solution of those problems through a novel gradient ascend method on the diffusion coefficient that we introduced for such semilinear PDEs. The promise of this study is a step toward the proof-of-concept that for any arbitrary numerical scheme for semilinear parabolic PDEs, one can build an iterative methods based on gradient ascent to converge to the solution of a fully nonlinear problem. Therefore, investment in our effort to create more efficient semilinear PDEs leads to efficiency for fully nonlinear PDEs. We leverage the theoretical results of Soner et al. [2012] to obtain numerical schemes for fully nonlinear PDEs and to justify the convergence in our methodology. The method is tested in a numerical experiment on the fully problem of portfolio optimization under stochastic volatility model.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the fractal uncertainty exponent and a spectral gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove two results on Fractal Uncertainty Principle (FUP) for discrete Cantor sets with large alphabets. First, we give an example of an alphabet with dimension $\delta \in (\frac12,1)$ where the FUP exponent is exponentially small as the size of the alphabet grows. Secondly, for $\delta \in (0,\frac12]$ we show that a similar alphabet has a large FUP exponent, arbitrarily close to the optimal upper bound of $\frac12-\frac\delta2$, if we dilate the Fourier transform by a factor satisfying a generic Diophantine condition. We give an application of the latter result to spectral gaps for open quantum baker's maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the existence, uniqueness, and asymptotic behaviors of mild solutions of a parabolic evolution equations on complex plane, in which the diffusion operator has the form \(\overline{\Box}_{\varphi} = \overline{D}\, \overline{D}^{\ast}\), where \(\overline{D} f = \bar{\partial}f + \varphi_{\bar{z}} f\), the function \(\varphi\) is smooth and subharmonic on \(\mathbb{C}\), and \(\overline{D}^{\ast}\) is the formal adjoint of \(\overline{D}\). Our method combines certain estimates of heat kernel associating with the homogeneous linear equation of Raich \cite{raich06} and a fixed point argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear steady Boltzmann equation in the half space, with phase transition and Dirichlet boundary condition. In particular, we study the regularity of the solution to the half-space problem in the situation that the gas is in contact with its condensed phase. We propose a novel kinetic weight and establish a weighted $C^1$ estimate under the spatial domain $x\in [0,\infty)$, which is unbounded and not strictly convex. Additionally, we prove the $W^{1,p}$ estimate without any weight for $p&lt;2$.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of ground state solutions for the planar Schr\"odinger-Newton equation on the disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the existence and qualitative properties of positive ground state solutions for the planar Schr\"odinger-Newton equation on the disc. First, we prove the existence and radial symmetry of all the positive ground state solutions by employing the symmetric decreasing rearrangement and Talenti's inequality. Next, we develop Newton's theorem and then use the contraction mapping principle to establish the uniqueness of the positive ground state solution for the Schr\"odinger-Newton equation on the disc in the two dimensional case. Finally, we show that the unique positive ground state solution converges to the trivial solution as the radius $R$ tending to infinity, which is totally different from the higher dimensional case in \cite{Guo-Wang-Yi}.</description>

      <title>Average speeds of time almost periodic traveling waves for rapidly/slowly oscillating reaction-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the propagation dynamics of time almost periodic reaction-diffusion equations. Assuming the existence of a time almost periodic traveling wave connecting two stable steady states, we focus especially on the asymptotic behavior of average wave speeds in both rapidly oscillating and slowly oscillating environments. We prove that, in the rapidly oscillating case, the average speed converges to the constant wave speed of the homogenized equation; while in the slowly oscillating case, it approximates the arithmetic mean of the constant wave speeds for a family of equations with frozen coefficients. In both cases, we provide estimates on the convergence rates showing that, in comparison to the limiting speeds, the deviations of average speeds for almost periodic traveling waves are at most linear in certain sense. Furthermore, our explicit formulas for the limiting speeds indicate that temporal variations have significant influences on wave propagation. Even in periodic environments, it can alter the propagation direction of bistable equations.</description>

      <title>Large amplitude quasi-periodic traveling waves in two dimensional forced rotating fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence of quasi-periodic traveling wave solutions for the $\beta$-plane equation on $\mathbb{T}^2$ with a large quasi-periodic traveling wave external force. These solutions exhibit large sizes, which depend on the frequency of oscillations of the external force. Due to the presence of small divisors, the proof relies on a nonlinear Nash-Moser scheme tailored to construct nonlinear waves of large size. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of constructing quasi-periodic solutions for a quasilinear PDE in dimensions greater than one, with a 1-smoothing dispersion relation that is highly degenerate - indicating an infinite-dimensional kernel for the linear principal operator. This degeneracy challenge is overcome by preserving the traveling-wave structure, the conservation of momentum and by implementing normal form methods for the linearized system with sublinear dispersion relation in higher space dimension.</description>

      <title>Transport of low regularity Gaussian measures for the 1d quintic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the 1d nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) on the torus with initial data distributed according to the Gaussian measure with covariance operator $(1 - \Delta)^{-s}$, where $\Delta$ is the Laplace operator. We prove that the Gaussian measures are quasi-invariant along the flow of (NLS) for the full range $s &gt; \frac{3}{2}$. This improves a previous result obtained by Planchon, Tzvetkov and Visciglia (in 2019), where the quasi-invariance is proven for $s=2k$, for all integers $k\geq 1$. In our approach, to prove the quasi-invariance, we directly establish an explicit formula for the Radon-Nikodym derivative $G_s(t,.)$ of the transported measures, which is obtained as the limit of truncated Radon-Nikodym derivatives $G_{s,N}(t,.)$ for transported measures associated with a truncated system. We also prove that the Radon-Nikodym derivatives belong to $L^p$, $p&gt;1$, with respect to $H^1(\mathbb{T})$-cutoff Gaussian measures, relying on the introduction of weighted Gaussian measures produced by a normal form reduction, following a recent work by Sun and Tzvetkov (in 2023). Additionally, we prove that the truncated densities $G_{s,N}(t,.)$ converges to $G_s(t,.)$ in $L^p$ (with respect to the $H^1(\mathbb{T})$-cutoff Gaussian measures).</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and stability for the two-phase periodic quasistationary Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-phase horizontally periodic quasistationary Stokes flow in $\mathbb{R}^2$, describing the motion of two immiscible fluids with equal viscosities that are separated by a sharp interface, which is parameterized as the graph of a function $f=f(t)$, is considered in the general case when both gravity and surface tension effects are included. Using potential theory, the moving boundary problem is formulated as a fully nonlinear and nonlocal parabolic problem for the function $f$. Based on abstract parabolic theory, it is proven that the problem is well-posed in all subcritical spaces $\mathrm{H}^r(\mathbb{S})$, $r\in(3/2,2)$. Moreover, the stability properties of the flat equilibria are analyzed in dependence on the physical properties of the fluids.</description>

      <title>Modelling formation of stationary periodic patterns in growing population of motile bacteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological pattern formation is one of the most intriguing phenomena in nature. Simplest examples of such patterns are represented by travelling waves and stationary periodic patterns which occur during various biological processes including morphogenesis and population dynamics. Formation of these patterns in populations of motile microorganisms such as Dictyostelium discoideum and E. coli have been shown in a number of experimental studies. Conditions for formation of various types of patterns are commonly addressed in mathematical studies of dynamical systems containing diffusive and advection terms. In this work, we do mathematical study of spatio-temporal patterns forming in growing population of chemotactically active bacteria. In particular, we perform linear analysis to find conditions for formation of stationary periodic patterns, and nonlinear (Fourier) analysis to find characteristics, such as amplitude and wavelength, of these patterns. We verify our analytical results by means of numerical simulations.</description>

To establish this achievement, we develop the zero number argument for nonlinear equations with unbounded coefficients and construct a family of auxiliary backward self-similar solutions through nontrivial ODE analysis.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the non-radial energy-critical inhomogeneous NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the focusing inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation \[ i\partial_t u + \Delta u + |x|^{-b}|u|^\alpha u = 0\qtq{on}\R\times\R^N, \] with $\alpha=\tfrac{4-2b}{N-2}$, $N=\{3,4,5\}$ and $0&lt;b\leq \min\Big\{\tfrac{6-N}{2},\tfrac{4}{N}$\Big\}. This paper establishes global well-posedness and scattering for the non-radial energy-critical case in $\dot{H}^1(\R^N)$. It extends the previous research by Murphy and the first author \cite{GM}, which focused on the case $(N,\alpha,b)=(3,2,1)$. The novelty here, beyond considering higher dimensions, lies in our assumption of the condition $\sup_{t\in I}\|\nabla u(t)\|_{L^2}&lt;\|\nabla Q\|_{L^2}$, which is weaker than the condition stated in \cite{Guzman}. Consequently, if a solution has energy and kinetic energy less than the ground state $Q$ at some point, then the solution is global and scatters. Moreover, we show scattering for the defocusing case. On the other hand, in this work, we also investigate the blow-up issue with nonradial data for $N\geq 3$ in $H^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$. This implies that our result holds without classical assumptions such as spherically symmetric data or $|x|u_0 \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^N)$.

      <description>arXiv:2406.06715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present exact solutions describing dynamics of two algebraic solitons in the massive Thirring model. Each algebraic soliton corresponds to a simple embedded eigenvalue in the Kaup--Newell spectral problem and attains the maximal mass among the family of solitary waves traveling with the same speed. By coalescence of speeds of the two algebraic solitons, we find a new solution for an algebraic double-soliton which corresponds to a double embedded eigenvalue. We show that the double-soliton attains the double mass of a single soliton and describes a slow interaction of two identical algebraic solitons.</description>

      <title>Convergence of bi-spatial pullback random attractors and stochastic Liouville type equations for nonautonomous stochastic p-Laplacian lattice system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider convergence properties of the long-term behaviors with respect to the coefficient of the stochastic term for a nonautonomous stochastic $p$-Laplacian lattice equation with multiplicative noise. First, the upper semi-continuity of pullback random $(\ell^2,\ell^q)$-attractor is proved for each $q\in[1,+\infty)$. Then, a convergence result of the time-dependent invariant sample Borel probability measures is obtained in $\ell^2$. Next, we show that the invariant sample measures satisfy a stochastic Liouville type equation and a termwise convergence of the stochastic Liouville type equations is verified. Furthermore, each family of the invariant sample measures is turned out to be a sample statistical solution, which hence also fulfills a convergence consequence.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Magnetohydrodynamics Models as Scaling Limits of Stochastic Induction Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic properties of a stochastic model for the induction equations of the magnetic field in a three dimensional periodic domain. The turbulent velocity field driving the electromotive force on the magnetic field is modeled by a noise white in time. For this model we rigorously take a scaling limit leading to a deterministic model. While in case of isotropic turbulence this produces an additional dissipation in the limit model which influences also the decay rate of the Magnetic field in the stochastic model, the case of turbulence devoloped in a preferential direction allows us to find a dynamo effect.</description>

      <title>From rank-based models with common noise to pathwise entropy solutions of SPDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mean field limit of a rank-based model with common noise, which arises as an extension to models for the market capitalization of firms in stochastic portfolio theory. We show that, under certain conditions on the drift and diffusion coefficients, the empirical cumulative distribution function converges to the solution of a stochastic PDE. A key step in the proof, which is of independent interest, is to show that any solution to an associated martingale problem is also a pathwise entropy solution to the stochastic PDE, a notion introduced in a recent series of papers [32, 33, 19, 16, 17].</description>

Abstract: In this article, we first introduce the quermassintegrals for compact hypersurfaces with capillary boundaries in hyperbolic space from a variational viewpoint, and then we solve an isoperimetric type problem in hyperbolic space. By constructing a new locally constrained inverse curvature flow, we obtain the Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities for convex capillary hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space. This generalizes a theorem of Brendle-Guan-Li \cite{BGL} for convex closed hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space.</description>

      <title>Morse Index Stability for the Ginzburg-Landau Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the behaviour of critical points of the Ginzburg-Landau perturbation of the Dirichlet energy into the sphere $E_\varepsilon(u):=\int_\Sigma \frac{1}{2}|du|^2_h\ \,dvol_h +\frac{1}{4\varepsilon^2}(1-|u|^2)^2\,dvol_h=\int_{\Sigma}e_{\varepsilon}(u)$. Our first main result is a precise point-wise estimate for $e_\varepsilon(u_k)$ in the regions where compactness fails, which also implies the $L^{2,1}$ quantization in the bubbling process. Our second main result consists in applying the method developed in a previous joint paper with T. Rivi\`ere to study the upper-semi-continuity of the extended Morse index to sequences of critical points of $E_{\epsilon}$: given a sequence of critical points $u_{\varepsilon_k}:\Sigma\to \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ of $E_\varepsilon$ that converges in the bubble tree sense to a harmonic map $u_\infty\in W^{1,2}(\Sigma,{S}^{n})$ and bubbles $v^i_{\infty}:\mathbb{R}^2\to {S}^{n}$, we show that the extended Morse indices of the maps $v^i,u_\infty$ control the extended Morse index of the sequence $u_{\varepsilon_k}$ for $k$ large enough.</description>

      <title>Existence and asymptotic autonomous robustness of random attractors for three-dimensional stochastic globally modified Navier-Stokes equations on unbounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we discuss the existence and asymptotically autonomous robustness (AAR) (almost surely) of random attractors for 3D stochastic globally modified Navier-Stokes equations (SGMNSE) on Poincar\'e domains (which may be bounded or unbounded). Our aim is to investigate the existence and AAR of random attractors for 3D SGMNSE when the time-dependent forcing converges to a time-independent function under the perturbation of linear multiplicative noise as well as additive noise. The main approach is to provide a way to justify that, on some uniformly tempered universe, the usual pullback asymptotic compactness of the solution operators is uniform across an infinite time-interval $(-\infty,\tau]$. The backward uniform ``tail-smallness'' and ``flattening-property'' of the solutions over $(-\infty,\tau]$ have been demonstrated to achieve this goal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to establish the existence as well as AAR of random attractors for 3D SGMNSE on unbounded domains.</description>

      <title>On constant mean curvature 1-immersions of surfaces into hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Bryant on constant mean curvature (CMC) $1$-immersions of surfaces into the hyperbolic space H^3 and after the results of Tarantello (2023), we pursue a possible parametrization for the moduli space of (CMC) 1-immersions of a surface S (closed, orientable and of genus &gt;1) into hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Those immersions enter as "critical" object in our analysis. In fact, they can be attained only as limits of the (CMC) c-immersions (as c tends to 1), obtained in Huang-Lucia-Tarantello (2022), for |c|&lt;1. However, such passage to the limit can be prevented by possible blow-up phenomena, so that the pullback metrics of the (CMC) c-immersions may yield (at the limit) to a singular metric with conical singularities at finitely many points (the blow-up points). In case of genus g=2, blow up can occur only at a single point, and in Tarantello (2023) it was shown how it could be prevented and the passage to the limit ensured in terms of the Kodaira map. In this note we sharpen this result and for genus g=2, we obtaina condition (we believe sharp) which involves only the Kodaira map on the six Weierstrass points. In addition we tackle the case of higher genus, where multiple blow-up points occur. In this case, we need to identify a suitable replacement of the Kodaira map, now defined on the space of non-zero effective divisors. More importantly, we need to improve in a substantial way the asymptotic analysis of Tarantello (2023) limited to the case of "blow-up" with minimal mass. In this direction we give a contribution which best applies to the case of genus g=3, but also provides a relevant step and a convincing indication on what should happen in the general case.</description>

Abstract: We consider the 3D Boltzmann equation with the constant collision kernel. We investigate the well/ill-posedness problem using the methods from nonlinear dispersive PDEs. We construct a family of special solutions, which are neither near equilibrium nor self-similar, to the equation, and prove that the well/ill-posedness threshold in $H^{s}$ Sobolev space is exactly at regularity $s=1$, despite the fact that the equation is scale invariant at $s=\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01142v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whereas many different models exist in the mathematical and physics literature for ground states of non-relativistic crystals, the relativistic case has been much less studied and we are not aware of any mathematical result on a fully relativistic treatment of crystals. In this paper, we introduce a mean-field relativistic energy for crystals in terms of periodic density matrices. This model is inspired both from a recent definition of the Dirac-Fock ground state for atoms and molecules, due to one of us, and from the non-relativistic Hartree-Fock model for crystals. We prove the existence of a ground state when the number of electrons per cell is not too large.</description>

      <title>A stability result for the first Robin-Neumann eigenvalue: A double perturbation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega=\Omega_0\setminus \overline{\Theta}\subset \mathbb{R}^n$, $n\geq 2$, where $\Omega_0$ and $\Theta$ are two open, bounded and convex sets such that $\overline{\Theta}\subset \Omega_0$ and let $\beta&lt;0$ be a given parameter. We consider the eigenvalue problem for the Laplace operator associated to $\Omega$, with Robin boundary condition on $\partial \Omega_0$ and Neumann boundary condition on $\partial \Theta$. In [Paoli-Piscitelli-Trani, ESAIM-COCV '20] it is proved that the spherical shell is the only maximizer for the first Robin-Neumann eigenvalue in the class of domains $\Omega$ with fixed outer perimeter and volume.
  We establish a quantitative version of the afore-mentioned isoperimetric inequality; the main novelty consists in the introduction of a new type of hybrid asymmetry, that turns out to be the suitable one to treat the different conditions on the outer and internal boundary. Up to our knowledge, in this context, this is the first stability result in which both the outer and the inner boundary are perturbed.</description>

Abstract: We prove Calder\'on-Zygmund type estimates of weak solutions to non-homogeneous nonlocal parabolic equations under a minimal regularity requirement on kernel coefficients. In particular, the right-hand side is presented by a sum of fractional Laplacian type data and a non-divergence type data. Interestingly, even though the kernel coefficients are discontinuous, we obtain a significant increment of fractional differentiability for the solutions, which is not observed in the corresponding local parabolic equations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove Strichartz estimates for the $(k,a)$-generalized Laguerre operators $a^{-1}(-|x|^{2-a}\Delta_k+|x|^a)$ which were introduced by Ben Sa\"{\i}d-Kobayashi-{\0}rsted, and for the operators $|x|^{2-a}\Delta_k$. Here $k$ denotes a non-negative multiplicity function for the Dunkl Laplacian $\Delta_k$ and $a$ denotes a positive real number satisfying certain conditions. The cases $a=1,2$ were studied previously. We consider more general cases here. The proof depends on symbol-type estimates of special functions and a discrete analog of the stationary phase theorem inspired by the work of Ionescu-Jerison.</description>

      <title>A Nystr\"{o}m Method for Scattering by a Two-layered Medium with a Rough Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problems of scattering of time-harmonic acoustic waves by a two-layered medium with a non-locally perturbed boundary (called a rough boundary in this paper) in two dimensions, where a Dirichlet or impedance boundary condition is imposed on the boundary. The two-layered medium is composed of two unbounded media with different physical properties and the interface between the two media is considered to be a planar surface. We formulate the considered scattering problems as the boundary value problems and prove that each boundary value problem has a unique solution by utilizing the integral equation method associated with the two-layered Green function. Moreover, we develop the Nystr\"{o}m method for numerically solving the considered boundary value problems, based on the proposed integral equation formulations. We establish the convergence results of the Nystr\"{o}m method with the convergence rates depending on the smoothness of the rough boundary. It is worth noting that in establishing the well-posedness of the boundary value problems as well as the convergence results of the Nystr\"{o}m method, an essential role is played by the investigation of the asymptotic properties of the two-layered Green function for small and large arguments. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out to show the effectiveness of the Nystr\"{o}m method.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the Ricci flow for complete metrics with bounded geometry depends continuously on initial conditions for finite time with no loss of regularity. This relies on our recent work where sectoriality for the generator of the Ricci-DeTurck flow is proved. We use this to prove that for initial metrics sufficiently close in H\"older norm to a rotationally symmetric asymptotically hyperbolic metric and satisfying a simple curvature condition, but a priori distant from the hyperbolic metric, Ricci flow converges to the hyperbolic metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to the study of spectral asymmetry. Working with the operator $\operatorname{curl}:=*\mathrm{d}$ on a connected oriented closed Riemannian 3-manifold, we construct, by means of microlocal analysis, the asymmetry operator -- a scalar pseudodifferential operator of order $-3$. The latter is completely determined by the Riemannian manifold and its orientation, and encodes information about spectral asymmetry. The asymmetry operator generalises and contains the classical eta invariant traditionally associated with the asymmetry of the spectrum, which can be recovered by computing its regularised operator trace. Remarkably, the whole construction is direct and explicit, and does not involve analytic continuation or algebraic topology.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the Anderson localization, strong dynamical localization and the $(\frac 12-)$-H\"older continuity of the integrated density of states (IDS) for some multi-dimensional discrete quasi-periodic (QP) Schr\"odinger operators with asymmetric $C^2$-cosine type potentials. We extend both the iteration scheme of \cite{CSZ23a} and the interlacing method of \cite{FV21} to handle asymmetric Rellich functions with collapsed gaps.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Framework for Partial Differential Equation Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel variational quantum framework for linear partial differential equation (PDE) constrained optimization problems. Such problems arise in many scientific and engineering domains. For instance, in aerodynamics, the PDE constraints are the conservation laws such as momentum, mass and energy balance, the design variables are vehicle shape parameters and material properties, and the objective could be to minimize the effect of transient heat loads on the vehicle or to maximize the lift-to-drag ratio. The proposed framework utilizes the variational quantum linear system (VQLS) algorithm and a black box optimizer as its two main building blocks. VQLS is used to solve the linear system, arising from the discretization of the PDE constraints for given design parameters, and evaluate the design cost/objective function. The black box optimizer is used to select next set of parameter values based on this evaluated cost, leading to nested bi-level optimization structure within a hybrid classical-quantum setting. We present detailed computational error and complexity analysis to highlight the potential advantages of our proposed framework over classical techniques. We implement our framework using the PennyLane library, apply it to a heat transfer optimization problem, and present simulation results using Bayesian optimization as the black box optimizer.</description>

      <title>Second-order optimality conditions for the sparse optimal control of nonviscous Cahn-Hilliard systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the optimal control of an initial-boundary value problem for the classical nonviscous Cahn-Hilliard system with zero Neumann boundary conditions. Phase field systems of this type govern the evolution of diffusive phase transition processes with conserved order parameter. For such systems, optimal control problems have been studied in the past. We focus here on the situation when the cost functional of the optimal control problem contains a sparsity-enhancing nondifferentiable term like the L1-norm. For such cases, we establish first-order necessary and second-order sufficient optimality conditions for locally optimal controls, where in the approach to second-order sufficient conditions we employ a technique introduced by E. Casas, C. Ryll and F. Tr\"oltzsch in the paper [SIAM J. Control Optim. 53 (2015), 2168-2202]. The main novelty of this paper is that this method, which has recently been successfully applied to systems of viscous Cahn-Hilliard type, can be adapted also to the classical nonviscous case. Since in the case without viscosity the solutions to the state and adjoint systems turn out to be considerably less regular than in the viscous case, numerous additional technical difficulties have to be overcome, and additional conditions have to be imposed. In particular, we have to restrict ourselves to the case when the nonlinearity driving the phase separation is regular, while in the presence of a viscosity term also nonlinearities of logarithmic type turn could be admitted. In addition, the implicit function theorem, which was employed to establish the needed differentiability properties of the control-to-state operator in the viscous case, does not apply in our situation and has to be substituted by other arguments.</description>

      <title>Adversarial flows: A gradient flow characterization of adversarial attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A popular method to perform adversarial attacks on neuronal networks is the so-called fast gradient sign method and its iterative variant. In this paper, we interpret this method as an explicit Euler discretization of a differential inclusion, where we also show convergence of the discretization to the associated gradient flow. To do so, we consider the concept of p-curves of maximal slope in the case $p=\infty$. We prove existence of $\infty$-curves of maximum slope and derive an alternative characterization via differential inclusions. Furthermore, we also consider Wasserstein gradient flows for potential energies, where we show that curves in the Wasserstein space can be characterized by a representing measure on the space of curves in the underlying Banach space, which fulfill the differential inclusion. The application of our theory to the finite-dimensional setting is twofold: On the one hand, we show that a whole class of normalized gradient descent methods (in particular signed gradient descent) converge, up to subsequences, to the flow, when sending the step size to zero. On the other hand, in the distributional setting, we show that the inner optimization task of adversarial training objective can be characterized via $\infty$-curves of maximum slope on an appropriate optimal transport space.</description>
