      <title>Composite media, almost touching disks and the maximum principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the setting of two disks in a domain in $\mathbb{R}^2$ which are almost touching and have finite and positive conductivities, giving rise to a divergence form elliptic equation with discontinuous coefficients. We use the maximum principle to give a new proof of a gradient bound of Li-Vogelius.</description>

      <title>Tools for stability analysis of fractional reaction diffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linearization principle states that the stability (or instability) of solutions to a suitable linearization of a nonlinear problem implies the stability (or instability) of solutions to the original nonlinear problem. In this work, we prove this principle for solutions of abstract fractional reaction-diffusion equations with a fractional derivative in time of order $\alpha\in (0,1)$. Then, we apply these results to particular fractional reaction-diffusion equations, obtaining, for example, the counterpart of the classical Turing instability in the case of fractional equations.</description>

      <title>Traveling Wave Solutions to a Large Class of Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier (BNSF) system, introduced by Howard Brenner, was developed to address some deficiencies in the classical Navier-Stokes-Fourier system, based on the concept of volume velocity. We consider the one-dimensional BNSF system in Lagrangian mass coordinates, incorporating temperature-dependent transport coefficients, which yields a more physically realistic framework. We establish the existence and uniqueness of monotone traveling wave solutions (or viscous shocks) to the BNSF system with any positive $C^2$ dissipation coefficients, provided that the shock amplitude is sufficiently small. We utilize geometric singular perturbation theory as in the constant coefficient case [13]; however, due to the arbitrary nonlinearities of the coefficients, we employ the implicit function theorem, which grants robustness to our approach. This work is motivated by [12], which proves a contraction property of any large solutions to the BNSF system around the traveling wave solutions. Thus, we also derive some quantitative estimates on the traveling wave solutions that play a fundamental role in [12].</description>

      <title>Analysis and Numerical Approximation to Interactive Dynamics of Navier Stokes-Plate Interaction PDE System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Navier-Stokes fluid-plate interaction (FSI) system which describes the evolutions of the fluid contained within a 3D cavity, as it interacts with a deformable elastic membrane on the ``free" upper boundary of the cavity. These models arise in various aeroelastic and biomedical applications as well as in the control of ocular pressure, and sloshing phenomena. We analyze the well-posedness of weak solutions to the stationary ($\lambda$-parametrized) coupled PDE system by way of invoking the nonlinear generalization of the abstract variational formulations which was introduced in \cite{girault2012finite}, wherein an inf-sup approach is followed to show existence-uniqueness of solutions under a small data assumption.
  In addition, we provide a numerical approximation scheme of the infinite dimensional coupled system via a finite element method approximation (FEM). The numerical results use a standard conforming scheme and handle the introduced nonlinearities via Picard iterations. Numerical results are obtained for an appropriate test problem satisfying the necessary boundary conditions and coupling. Moreover, error bounds between the FEM and theoretical solution in terms of the characteristic mesh size are supplied in appropriate Sobolev norms which agree with the established literature. These FEM approximations of the coupled system with their associated error bounds validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Ill-posedness of the Euler equations and inviscid limit of the Navie-Stokes equations in Besov spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem to the incompressible Euler and Navie-Stokes equations on the d-dimensional torus.Our aim of this paper is two fold. Firstly, we construct a new initial data and present a simple proof of the ill-posedness of the Euler equations in different senses: (1) the solution map of the Euler equations starting from $u_0$ is discontinuous at $t = 0$ in $B^s_{p,\infty}$ with $s&gt;0$ and $1\leq p \leq \infty$, which covers the result obtained by Cheskidov and Shvydkoy in ;(2) the solution map of the Euler equations is not continuous as a map from $B^s_{p,\infty}$ to $L^\infty_T(B^s_{p,\infty})$;(3) the solution map of the Euler equations cannot be Holder continuous in time variable in Besov spaces $B^s_{p,r}$.</description>

      <title>Trapping by repulsion: the NLS with a delta-prime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence and provide explicit expressions for the stationary states of the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation with a repulsive delta-prime potential and a focusing nonlinearity of power type. Furthermore, we prove that, if the nonlinearity is subcritical, then ground states exist for any strength of the delta-prime interaction and for every positive value of the mass.
  This result supplies an example of ground states arising from a repulsive potential, a counterintuitive phenomenon explained by the emergence of an additional dimension in the energy space, induced by the delta-prime interaction. This new dimension contains states of lower energy and is thus responsible for the existence of nonlinear ground states that do not originate from linear eigenfunctions.
  The explicit form of the ground states is derived by addressing the ancillary problem of minimizing the action functional on the Nehari manifold. We solve such problem in the subcritical, critical, and supercritical regimes.</description>

      <title>Self-similar vorticity around the boundary and non-uniqueness of solutions to the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in the half space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show the non-uniqueness of mild solutions to the two-dimensional forced Navier-Stokes equations in the half space under the noslip boundary condition, following the program established by Albritton, Bru{\'e}, and Colombo in 2022. Our construction of non-unique solutions is based on the instability of self-similar vorticity at high Reynolds numbers which concentrates around the boundary at the initial time. In our construction, therefore, a kind of boundary layer has to be taken into account in the analysis, contrasting to the known results where the unstable self-similar vorticity is located away from the boundary with $O(1)$ distance around the initial time.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to define a field-road system in 2D where the road is a merely 1D-rectifiable set. For this purpose we introduce a general setting in order to define a parabolic problem onto a rectifiable set, which is coupled with another more classical parabolic problem outside this set, with transmission conditions.</description>

      <title>Global Existence and Incompressible Limit for Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations in Bounded Domains with Large Bulk Viscosity Coefficient and Large Initial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with the Navier-slip boundary conditions in a general two-dimensional bounded simply connected domain. For initial density that is allowed to vanish, we establish the global existence and exponential decay of weak, strong, and classical solutions when the bulk viscosity coefficient is suitably large, without any restrictions on the size of the initial data. Furthermore, we prove that when the bulk viscosity coefficient tends to infinity, the solutions of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations converge to those of the inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The key idea is to utilize the logarithmic interpolation inequality on general bounded domains and apply the compensated compactness lemma.</description>

      <title>Renormalized variational principles and Hardy-type inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset{\mathbb R}^2$ be a bounded domain on which Hardy's inequality holds. We prove that $[\exp(u^2)-1]/\delta^2\in L^1(\Omega)$ if $u\in H^1_0(\Omega)$, where $\delta$ denotes the distance to $\partial\Omega$. The corresponding higher-dimensional result is also given. These results contain both Hardy's and Trudinger's inequalities, and yield a new variational characterization of the maximal solution of the Liouville equation on smooth domains, in terms of a renormalized functional. A global $H^1$ bound on the difference between the maximal solution and the first term of its asymptotic expansion follows.</description>

      <title>Long-time Existence and Incompressible Limit of Weak and Classical Solutions to the Cauchy Problem for Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations with Large Bulk Viscosity Coefficient and Large Initial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Cauchy problem for the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the constant state as far field, which could be vacuum or nonvacuum. Under the assumption of a sufficiently large bulk viscosity coefficient, we establish the long-time existence of weak, strong, and classical solutions, without imposing any extra restrictions on the initial velocity divergence. Moreover, we demonstrate that the solutions of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations converge to solutions of the inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, as the bulk viscosity coefficient tends to infinity. The incompressible limit of the weak solutions holds even without requiring the initial velocity to be divergence-free. The key obstacle in the Cauchy problem is the failure of the Poincar\'e's inequality. This could be resolved by introducing a time-dependent Poincar\'e's type inequality, but it needs imposing weighted-integrability conditions on the initial density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove generalizations to the L^p setting of the Hardy-Rellich inequalities on domains of R^N with singularity given by the distance function to the boundary. The inequalities we obtain are either sharp in bounded domains, where we provide concrete minimizing sequences, or give a new bound for the sharp constant, while also depending on the geometric properties of the domain and its boundary. We also give applications to the existence and non-existence of solutions for a singular problem using variational methods and a Pohozaev identity.</description>

      <title>Homogenisation and spectral convergence of high-contrast convolution type operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper deals with homogenisation problems for high-contrast symmetric convolution-type operators with integrable kernels in media with a periodic microstructure. We adapt the two-scale convergence method to nonlocal convolution-type operators and obtain the homogenisation result both for problems stated in the whole space and in bounded domains with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition.
  Our main focus is on spectral analysis. We describe the spectrum of the limit two-scale operator and characterize the limit behaviour of the spectrum of the original problem as the microstructure period tends to zero. It is shown that the spectrum of the limit operator is a subset the limit of the spectrum of the original operator, and that they need not coincide.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with a 2D channel flow that is periodic horizontally but bounded above and below by hard walls. We assume the presence of horizontal viscosity only. We study the well-posedness, large-time behavior, and stability of solutions. For global well-posedness, we aim to assume less differentiability on initial velocity $(u_0, v_0)$: in particular, we assume $u_0,v_0\in L^2(\Omega)$ and $\partial_y u_0 \in L^2(\Omega)$.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Vertical Viscosity in Two-Dimensional Anisotropic Navier-Stokes Equations with No-Slip Boundary Conditions: An $L^p$ result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the inviscid limit problem for the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with anisotropic viscosity. The fluid is assumed to be bounded above and below by impenetrable walls, with a no-slip boundary condition imposed on the bottom wall. For $H^2$ initial velocity, we establish strong convergence in the $L^p$ norm to the limiting problem as the vertical viscosity approaches zero, for any $2\leq p &lt;\infty$. The main challenge lies in the mismatch of boundary conditions - specifically, the no-slip condition in the original problem versus the slip condition in the limiting problem.</description>

      <title>Free boundary regularity for a tumor growth model with obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an existence and regularity theory for solutions to a geometric free boundary problem motivated by models of tumor growth. In this setting, the tumor invades an accessible region $D$, its motion is directed along a constant vector $V$, and it cannot penetrate another region $K$ acting as an obstacle to the spread of the tumor. Due to the non variational structure of the problem, we show existence of viscosity solutions via Perron's method. Subsequently, we prove interior regularity for the free boundary near regular points by means of an improvement of flatness argument. We further analyze the boundary regularity and we prove that the free boundary meets the obstacle as a $C^{1,\alpha}$ graph. A key step in the analysis of the boundary regularity involves the study of a thin obstacle problem with oblique boundary conditions, for which we establish $C^{1,\alpha}$ estimates.</description>

Abstract: Given any $f$ a locally finitely piecewise affine homeomorphism of $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ onto $\Delta \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ (for $d=3, 4$) such that $f\in W^{1,p}(\Omega, \mathbb{R}^d)$ and $f^{-1}\in W^{1,q}(\Delta, \mathbb{R}^d)$, $1\leq p ,q &lt; \infty$ and any $\epsilon &gt;0$ we construct a diffeomorphism $\tilde{f}$ such that
  $$\|f-\tilde{f}\|_{W^{1,p}(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^d)} + \|f^{-1}-\tilde{f}^{-1}\|_{W^{1,q}(\Delta,\mathbb{R}^d)} &lt; \epsilon.$$</description>

      <title>High order uniform in time schemes for weakly nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce two multiscale numerical schemes for the time integration of weakly nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations, built upon the discretization of Picard iterates of the solution. These high-order schemes are designed to achieve high precision with respect to the small nonlinearity parameter under particular CFL condition. By exploiting the scattering properties of these schemes thanks to a low-frequency projected linear flow, we also establish its uniform accuracy over long time horizons. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the theoretical results, and these schemes are further applied to investigate dynamics in the framework of wave turbulence.</description>

      <title>Moments, Time-Inversion and Source Identification for the Heat Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the initial source identification problem for the heat equation, a notably ill-posed inverse problem characterized by exponential instability. Departing from classical Tikhonov regularization, we propose a novel approach based on moment analysis of the heat flow, transforming the problem into a more stable inverse moment formulation. By evolving the measured terminal time moments backward through their governing ODE system, we recover the moments of the initial distribution. We then reconstruct the source by solving a convex optimization problem that minimizes the total variation of a measure subject to these moment constraints. This formulation naturally promotes sparsity, yielding atomic solutions that are sums of Dirac measures. Compared to existing methods, our moment-based approach reduces exponential error growth to polynomial growth with respect to the terminal time. We provide explicit error estimates on the recovered initial distributions in terms of moment order, terminal time, and measurement errors. In addition, we develop efficient numerical discretization schemes and demonstrate significant stability improvements of our approach through comprehensive numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Cauchy problem for the localized wave propagation in continuous model of the one-dimensional diatomic crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the continuous model of the localized wave propagation corresponding to the one-dimensional diatomic crystal lattice. From the mathematical point of view the problem can be described in terms of the Cauchy problem with localized initial data for a system of two pseudo-differential equations. We assume two small parameters in this formulation -- the lattice step and the size if the initial perturbation. We construct the asymptotic solution of the continuous Cauchy problem with respect to the size of perturbation.
  The ratio of the small parameters drastically affects the form of the solution. We consider two situations -- when the size of the perturbation is sufficiently large and when it is comparable with the lattice step. In each situations we provide analytical formulae for the asymptotic solution via Airy function.</description>

      <title>Sharper bounds on the box-counting dimension of singularities in the hyperdissipative Navier-Stokes system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study upper bounds on the box-counting dimension of the set of potential singular points in suitable weak solutions to the 3D incompressible hyperdissipative Navier-Stokes system
  \begin{equation*} \partial_t u + (-\Delta)^{\alpha}u+(u\cdot \nabla)u+\nabla p = 0, \qquad \operatorname{div} u = 0, \end{equation*} for $\alpha\in(1,5/4)$. Our main observation is that a classical iteration scheme developed in [11] and used in [27] to improve upper bounds for the full Laplacian case can be extended to the hyperdissipative case with properly chosen local quantities that are scale-invariant, despite non-locality of fractional Laplacian. This is achieved by matching up the correct orders of the temporal-spatial scales of the required estimates that effectively quantify $(-\Delta)^{\alpha}$ during the iterations. In particular, we adopt the hyperdissipative framework built in the recent breakthrough [5] where the upper bounds on the box-counting dimension of the set of potential singularities in $\alpha$ are given by \begin{equation*}
  L(\alpha)= \frac{15-2\alpha-8\alpha^2}{3} \quad \mbox{for}\quad 1&lt;\alpha&lt;\frac{5}{4}. \end{equation*} In this paper, we generalize the iteration scheme [27] designed for $\alpha=1$ to the case $1&lt;\alpha&lt;5/4$, which leads to the newly established bound \begin{equation*}
  J(\alpha)= \frac{36(3-\alpha)(3+2\alpha)(5-4\alpha)}{-64\alpha^3+272\alpha^2-300\alpha+369} \quad \mbox{for} \quad 1&lt;\alpha&lt;\frac{5}{4}, \end{equation*} improving the aforementioned bound $L(\alpha)$ obtained in [5].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $H$-convergence of nonlocal linear operators in fractional divergence form, where the oscillations of the matrices are prescribed outside the reference domain. Our compactness argument bypasses the failure of the classical localisation techniques that mismatch with the nonlocal nature of the operators involved. If symmetry is also assumed, we extend the equivalence between the $H$-convergence of the operators and the $\Gamma$-convergence of the associated energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a Mean Field Games (MFG) system in a real, separable infinite dimensional Hilbert space. The system consists of a second order parabolic type equation, called Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation in the paper, coupled with a nonlinear Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. Both equations contain a Kolmogorov operator. Solutions to the HJB equation are interpreted in the mild solution sense and solutions to the FP equation are interpreted in an appropriate weak sense. We prove well-posedness of the considered MFG system under certain conditions. The existence of a solution to the MFG system is proved using Tikhonov's fixed point theorem in a proper space. Uniqueness of solutions is obtained under typical separability and Lasry-Lions type monotonicity conditions.</description>

Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the global well-posedness and orbital stability of odd periodic traveling waves for the $\phi^4$-equation in the Sobolev space of periodic functions with zero mean. We establish new results on the global well-posedness of weak solutions by combining a semigroup approach with energy estimates. As a consequence, we prove the orbital stability of odd periodic waves by applying a Morse index theorem to the constrained linearized operator defined in the Sobolev space with the zero mean property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we describe the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate interacting with a degenerate Fermi gas, at zero temperature. First, we analyze the mean-field approximation of the many-body Schr\"odinger dynamics and prove emergence of a coupled Hartree-type system of equations. We obtain rigorous error control that yields a non-trivial scaling window in which the approximation is meaningful. Second, starting from this Hartree system, we identify a novel scaling regime in which the fermion distribution behaves semi-clasically, but the boson field remains quantum-mechanical; this is one of the main contributions of the present article. In this regime, the bosons are much lighter and more numerous than the fermions. We then prove convergence to a coupled Vlasov-Hartee system of equations with an explicit convergence rate.</description>

      <title>An extrapolation result in the variational setting: improved regularity, compactness, and applications to quasilinear systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the variational setting for SPDE on a Gelfand triple $(V, H, V^*)$. Under the standard conditions on a linear coercive pair $(A,B)$, and a symmetry condition on $A$ we manage to extrapolate the classical $L^2$-estimates in time to $L^p$-estimates for some $p&gt;2$ without any further conditions on $(A,B)$. As a consequence we obtain several other a priori regularity results of the paths of the solution.
  Under the assumption that $V$ embeds compactly into $H$, we derive a universal compactness result quantifying over all $(A,B)$. As an application of the compactness result we prove global existence of weak solutions to a system of second order quasi-linear equations.</description>

      <title>A Lee-Huang-Yang type expansion for the thermodynamic energy density of a dilute mixture of Bose gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a dilute gas in 3D composed of two species of bosons interacting through positive inter-species and intra-species pairwise potentials. We prove a second order expansion for the energy density in the thermodynamic limit. For the case of compactly supported, integrable potentials, we derive the correct second order of the expansion. If we make the further assumption of having soft potentials, we also derive the correct coefficient of the second order and the resulting formula is coherent with the physics literature. If we let the density and scattering length of one of the species go to zero, we obtain the Lee-Huang-Yang formula for one species of bosons. The paper also contains a proof of BEC for a mixture of bosons in a box with length scale larger than the Gross-Pitaevskii one.</description>

      <title>An ansatz for constructing explicit solutions of Hessian equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a (variation of quadrics) ansatz for constructing explicit, real-valued solutions to broad classes of complex Hessian equations on domains in $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ and real Hessian equations on domains in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. In the complex setting, our method simultaneously addresses the deformed Hermitian--Yang--Mills/Leung--Yau--Zaslow (dHYM/LYZ) equation, the Monge--Amp\`ere equation, and the $J$-equation. Under this ansatz each PDE reduces to a second-order system of ordinary differential equations admitting explicit first integrals. These ODE systems integrate in closed form via abelian integrals, producing wide families of explicit solutions together with a detailed description. In particular, on $\mathbb{C}^3$, we construct entire dHYM/LYZ solutions of arbitrary subcritical phase, and on $\mathbb{R}^3$ we produce entire special Lagrangian solutions of arbitrary subcritical phase. More generally, in any complex or real dimension, our ansatz yields entire solutions of certain subcritical phases for both the dHYM/LYZ and special Lagrangian equations. Some of these solutions develop singularities on compact regions. In the special Lagrangian case we show that, after a natural extension across the singular locus, these blow-up solutions coincide with previously known complete special Lagrangian submanifolds obtained via a different ansatz.</description>
