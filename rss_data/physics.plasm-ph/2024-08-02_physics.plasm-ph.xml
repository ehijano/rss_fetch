      <title>First Access to ELM-free Negative Triangularity at Low Aspect Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A plasma scenario with negative triangularity (NT) shaping is achieved on MAST-U for the first time. While edge localized modes (ELMs) are eventually suppressed as the triangularity is decreased below $\delta$ &lt; -0.06, an extended period of H-mode operation with Type-III ELMs is sustained at less negative $\delta$ even through access to the second stability region for ideal ballooning modes is closed. This documents a qualitative difference from the ELM-free access conditions documented in NT scenarios on conventional aspect ratio machines. The electron temperature at the pedestal top drops across the transition to ELM-free operation, but a steady rise in core temperature as $\delta$ is decreased allows for similar normalized beta in the ELM-free NT and H-mode positive triangularity shapes.</description>

      <title>Effects of plasma nonuniformity on zero frequency zonal structure generation by drift Alfven wave instabilities in toroidal plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effects of plasma nonuniformity on zero frequency zonal structure (ZFZS) excitation by drift Alfven wave (DAW) instabilities in toroidal plasmas are investigated using nonlinear gyrokinetic theory. The governing equations describing nonlinear interactions among ZFZS and DAWs are derived, with the contribution of DAWs self-beating and radial modulation accounted for on the same footing. The obtained equations are then used to derive the nonlinear dispersion relation, which is then applied to investigate ZFZS generation in several scenarios. In particular, it is found that, the condition for zonal flow excitation by kinetic ballooning mode (KBM) could be sensitive to plasma parameters, and more detailed investigation is needed to understand KBM nonlinear saturation, crucial for bulk plasma transport in future reactors.</description>

      <title>Highly-efficient electron ponderomotive acceleration in underdense plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-plasma accelerators represent a promising technology for future compact accelerating systems, enabling the acceleration of tens of pC to above $1\,$GeV over just a few centimeters. Nonetheless, these devices currently lack the stability, beam quality and average current of conventional systems. While many efforts have focused on improving acceleration stability and quality, little progress has been made in increasing the beam's average current, which is essential for future laser-plasma-based applications. In this paper, we investigate a laser-plasma acceleration regime aimed at increasing the beam average current with energies up to few-MeVs, efficiently enhancing the beam charge. We present experimental results on configurations that allow reaching charges of $5-30\,$nC and a maximum conversion efficiency of around $14\,$%. Through comprehensive Particle-In-Cell simulations, we interpret the experimental results and present a detailed study on electron dynamics. From our analysis, we show that most electrons are not trapped in a plasma wave; rather, they experience ponderomotive acceleration. Thus, we prove the laser pulse as the main driver of the particles' energy gain process.</description>

      <title>Matched Guiding and Controlled Injection in Dark-Current-Free, 10-GeV-Class, Channel-Guided Laser Plasma Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the high intensity laser propagation throughout meter-scale, channel-guided LPAs by adjusting the length of the plasma channel on a shot-by-shot basis, showing high quality guiding of 500 TW laser pulses over 30 cm in a hydrogen plasma of density $n_0 \approx 1 \times 10^{17} \, \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. We observed transverse energy transport of higher-order modes in the first $\approx 12 \, \mathrm{cm}$ of the plasma channel, followed by quasi-matched propagation, and the gradual, dark-current-free depletion of laser energy to the wakefield. We quantify the laser-to-wake transfer efficiency limitations of currently available PW-class laser systems, and demonstrate via simulation how control over the laser mode can significantly improve accelerated beam parameters. Using just 21.3 J of laser energy, and triggering localized electron injection into the accelerator, we observed electron bunches with single, quasimonoenergetic peaks, relative energy spreads as low as 3 % and energy up to 9.2 GeV with charge extending beyond 10 GeV.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic windings, surface helicity and their applications in plasma physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [J. Cantarella, J. Parsley, J. Geom. Phys. 60:1127 (2010)] Cantarella and Parsley introduced the notion of submanifold helicity. In the present paper we investigate properties of surface helicity and in particular answer two open questions posed in the aforementioned work: (i) We give a precise mathematically rigorous physical interpretation of surface helicity in terms of linking of distinct field lines. (ii) We prove that surface helicity is non-trivial if and only if the underlying surface has non-trivial topology (i.e. at least one hole).
  We then focus on toroidal surfaces which are of relevance in plasma physics and express surface helicity in terms of average poloidal and toroidal windings of the individual field lines of the underlying vector field which enables us to provide a connection between surface helicity and rotational transform. Further, we show how some of our results may be utilised in the context of coil designs for plasma fusion confinement devices in order to obtain coil configurations of particular "simple" shape.
  Lastly, we consider the problem of optimising surface helicity among toroidal surfaces of fixed area and show that toroidal surfaces admitting a symmetry constitute global minimisers.</description>
