      <title>Implications for the formation of Oort cloud-like structures and interstellar comets in dense environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most stars form in dense stellar environments, where frequent close encounters can strongly perturb and reshape the early architecture of planetary systems. The solar system, with its rich population of distant comets, provides a natural laboratory to study these processes. We perform detailed numerical simulations using the LonelyPlanets framework that combines NBODY6++GPU and REBOUND, to explore the evolution of debris disks around solar system analogues embedded in stellar clusters. Two initial configurations are considered, an $Extended$ and a $Compact$ model, each containing four giant planets and either an extended or compact debris disk. We find that compact disks primarily form Kuiper belt and scattered disk-like populations through planet-disk interactions, while extended disks are more strongly shaped by stellar encounters, producing Oort cloud-like structures and interstellar comets with ejection velocities of 1-3 km/s. Stellar perturbations are most effective for encounter inclinations between $0^{\circ}$ and $30^{\circ}$, giving rise to distinct dynamical populations, like Sednoids, and inner Oort cloud analogues, and a characteristic tail in semi-major axis-eccentricity space. In coplanar encounters, the disk remains largely flattened, whereas polar flybys redistribute angular momentum vertically, producing nearly isotropic outer populations that resemble an emerging Oort cloud. Our results suggest that cometary reservoirs and interstellar objects are natural byproducts of planet-disk interactions and stellar flybys in dense clusters, linking the architecture of outer planetary systems to their birth environments.</description>

      <title>Giant Planet Evolution with MESA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of gaseous planets is a complex process influenced by various physical parameters and processes. In this study, we present critical modifications to the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code to enhance its applicability to giant planet modelling. We introduce an equation of state specifically tailored for materials at planetary conditions. The equation of state considers the thermodynamic properties of hydrogen-helium mixtures and heavy elements, improving the accuracy of internal structure calculations. We also present modifications to the radiative opacity to allow the modelling of grains, clouds and opacity windows. Furthermore, we refine the treatment of convective mixing processes in MESA to better replicate convective mixing with the presence of composition gradients. Finally, we add a treatment for helium rain and settling. These modifications aim to enhance the predictive capabilities of MESA for giant planet evolution and are publicly available. We hope that these improvements will lead to a deeper understanding of giant planet evolution in the solar system and beyond.</description>

      <title>Rheological Lunar Regolith Simulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regolith simulants are essential for space research and technology development. Yet, their physical properties often differ from those of true planetary soil, particularly when compared to regolith properties in-situ, that experience notably reduced gravity.
  We focus on lunar regolith simulants and explore various techniques to modify existing simulants to replicate the mechanical/rheological behavior of Moon regolith in true lunar conditions. Our results are validated against data from in-situ tests conducted during the Luna and Apollo missions, enabling a direct comparison of physical properties of our enhanced simulants to true Lunar regolith, on the Moon. Analyzed in the Mohr-Coulomb model framework, the friction angle of most simulants is generally close to that of true regolith, but the measured cohesion is often higher on the Moon, notably due to the reduced gravity environment. We propose a method to increase the cohesion of an existing simulant and assess the mechanical behavior of our rheological regolith simulant using a standardized geotechnical, shear test. The experimental results are then directly compared to in-situ data, providing a quantitative basis for evaluating the fidelity of the enhanced simulants.</description>

      <title>Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Roman Sees Where You Are: Predicting Exoplanet Transit Yields in the Rosette Nebula with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young stars host only a small fraction of the known exoplanet population because their photometric variability, magnetic activity, and frequent placement in dense, poorly-resolved regions hamper exoplanet detections. Yet, measuring planets at these ages is crucial since these phases are when dynamical processes that drive planetary migration are most active. We assess the expected yield of a hypothetical Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope transit survey of the Rosette Nebula, a $\sim10\,\mathrm{Myr}$ star-forming region with a dense and diverse stellar population. Using the Roman Exposure Time Calculator to quantify sensitivity to Rosette members, we establish detection thresholds for companions and evaluate yields via Monte Carlo injection-recovery simulations. We predict the detection of $33 \pm 9$ young transiting exoplanets orbiting stellar hosts in a month-long survey, and $29 \pm 8$ in a two-week survey. The extended baseline primarily improves sensitivity to longer-period planets orbiting FGK stars, while most M dwarf detections are well-sampled within two weeks. Irrespective of the temporal baseline, transit detections are dominated by of 1-2\,$R_\oplus$ super-Earths and sub-Neptunes with $P\lesssim8$\,days. Such a sample would substantially expand the census of only three detected planets younger than $20\,\mathrm{Myr}$, probing an age regime in which planetary radii remain inflated, the stability of close-in orbits is uncertain, and planetary migration may still be ongoing. This survey offers a path to constrain early planetary evolution and establish prime follow-up targets for the James Webb Space Telescope, Vera Rubin Observatory, and the Habitable Worlds Observatory.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity to Sub-Io-sized Exosatellite Transits in the MIRI LRS Lightcurve of the Nearest Substellar Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST's unprecedented sensitivity enables precise spectrophotometric monitoring of substellar worlds, revealing atmospheric variability driven by mechanisms operating across different pressure levels. This same precision now permits exceptionally sensitive searches for transiting exosatellites, small terrestrial companions to these worlds. Using a novel simultaneous dual-band search method to address host variability, we present a search for transiting exosatellites in an 8-hour JWST/MIRI LRS lightcurve of the nearby ($2.0\,pc$) substellar binary WISE J1049-5319AB, composed of two $\sim30 M_{\rm Jup}$ brown dwarfs separated by $3.5\,au$ and viewed near edge-on. Although we detect no statistically significant transits, our injection-recovery tests demonstrate sensitivity to satellites as small as $0.275\,R_{\oplus}$ ($0.96\,R_{\rm Io}$ or $\sim$1 lunar radius), corresponding to 300ppm transit depths, and satellite-to-host mass ratios $&gt;$$10^{-6}$. This approach paves the way for detecting Galilean-moon analogs around directly imaged brown dwarfs, free-floating planets, and wide-orbit exoplanets, dozens of which are already scheduled for JWST lightcurve monitoring. In our Solar System, each giant planet hosts on average 3.5 moons above this threshold, suggesting that JWST now probes a regime where such companions are expected to be abundant. The technique and sensitivities demonstrated here mark a critical step toward detecting exosatellites and ultimately enabling constraints on the occurrence rates of small terrestrial worlds orbiting $1\text{-}70$$M_{\rm Jup}$ hosts.</description>

      <title>The Dynamical Environment within the Habitable Zone of the Gaia-4 and Gaia-5 Planetary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanetary systems exhibit a broad range of architectures which, in turn, enable a variety of dynamical environments. Many of the known planetary systems do not transit the host star, and so we measure the minimum masses of their planets, making it difficult to fully assess the dynamical environment within the system. Astrometry can resolve the mass ambiguity and thus allow a more complete dynamical analysis of systems to be conducted. Gaia-4 and Gaia-5 are two such systems, whose study with radial velocities and data from the Gaia mission revealed that each star harbors a massive planet on a highly eccentric orbit. In this work, we provide the results of a dynamical analysis of each system, including calculations of the Habitable Zone (HZ), from which we show that the presence of the known companions largely exclude the presence of planets within the HZ. We discuss the diagnostics of potential past planet-planet scattering events, and the occurrence of similar systems whereby a giant planet on an eccentric orbit can substantially disrupt orbital integrity of terrestrial planets. These "wrecking ball" systems have an impact on the target selection for planned direct imaging missions that seek to identify potentially habitable environments.</description>

      <title>Wind-AE: A Fast, Open-source 1D Photoevaporation Code with Metal and Multi-frequency X-ray Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Throughout their lives, short period exoplanets (&lt;100 days) experience X-ray and extreme-UV (XUV) stellar irradiation that can heat and photoionize planets' upper atmospheres, driving transonic outflows. This photoevaporative mass loss plays a role in both evolution and observed demographics; however, mass loss rates are not currently directly observable and can only be inferred from models. To that end, we present an open-source fast 1D, XUV multi-frequency, multispecies, steady-state, hydrodynamic Parker Wind photoevaporation relaxation model based on Murray-Clay et al. (2009,arXiv:0811.0006). The model can move smoothly between high and low flux regimes and accepts custom multi-frequency stellar spectra. While the inclusion of high-energy X-rays increases mass loss rates ($\dot{M}$), metals decrease $\dot{M}$, and the net result for a typical hot Jupiter is a similar $\dot{M}$, but a hotter, faster, and more gradually ionized wind. We find that mulitfrequency photons (e.g., 13.6-2000eV) are absorbed over a broader range of heights in the atmosphere resulting in a wind-launch radius, $R_{XUV}$, that is of order 10 nanobars for all but the highest surface gravity planets. Grids of H/He solar metallicity atmospheres reveal that, for typical hot Jupiters like HD 209458b, $R_{XUV}$~1.1-1.8$R_P$ for low-fluxes, meaning that the energy-limited mass loss rate, $\dot{M}_{Elim}(R)$, computed at $R=R_P$ is a good approximation. However, for planets with low escape velocities, like many sub-Neptunes and super-Earths, $R_{XUV}$ can be &gt;&gt;$R_P$, making it necessary to use $\dot{M}_{Elim}(R=R_{XUV})$ to avoid significantly underestimating mass loss rates. For both high escape velocities and large incident fluxes, radiative cooling is significant and energy-limited mass loss overestimates $\dot{M}$.</description>

      <title>Lunar Navigation System Optimization for Targeted Coverage with Semi-Analytical Station Keeping Model and Earth-GPS Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of an indigenous Lunar Navigation Satellite System (LNSS) is receiving growing attention due to the surge in planned lunar missions and the limited accessibility of Earth-based Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in the cislunar environment. Several studies have explored LNSS architecture using geometric analysis in both near and distant lunar orbits. The existing LNSS optimization efforts have primarily focused on global lunar coverage using analytical station-keeping models with low accuracy. Furthermore, current south pole-focused research is restricted to Elliptical Lunar Frozen Orbits (ELFOs) and lacks comprehensive optimization approach. Additionally, integration with Earth GNSS systems for ephemeris computation and time synchronization has not been adequately addressed in prior studies. In this work, we present a comprehensive LNSS mission design framework based on evolutionary multi-objective optimization integrated with a high-fidelity numerical lunar orbit propagation model. The optimization simultaneously considers navigation performance in the lunar south pole region, semi-analytical continuous station-keeping maneuver model for realistic dV estimate, and GPS-LNSS integration analysis parameters. The resulting Pareto front offers a diverse set of LNSS configurations that balance coverage, accuracy, and dV requirements. Notably, the optimization identifies diverse non-frozen elliptical orbit solutions that achieve over 90% south pole coverage with acceptable navigation accuracy using as few as six satellites and dV of less than 0.4 km/s per satellite per year. This represents a significant reduction in constellation size compared to previous studies, offering a cost-effective yet operationally efficient solution for future LNSS missions.</description>

      <title>Bistability, Oscillations, and Multistability on Hycean Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24224v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hycean planets are hypothetical exoplanets characterized by $H_2O$ oceans and $H_2$-rich atmospheres. These planets are high-priority targets for biosignature searches, as they combine abundant surface liquid water with easy-to-characterize $H_2$-rich atmospheres. Perhaps their most unusual climate feature is convective inhibition, which can dramatically alter a planet's temperature structure. However, so far hycean planets have mostly been investigated using 1D models that do not account for convective inhibition, and its effects are still poorly understood. This work develops pen-and-paper theory to analyze the effects of moist convective inhibition on hycean planets. The theory is tested and verified against a 1D radiative-convective model. We show that hycean planets near the onset of convective inhibition can exhibit either bistability or oscillations, due to the inhibition layer's trapping of heat and moisture. Meanwhile, hot hycean planets exhibit multistability, in which the inhibition layer and surface climate show multiple stable equilibria due to the lack of constraints on the water cycle inside the inhibition layer. The water cycle inside the inhibition layer is influenced by numerous processes that are challenging to resolve in 1D, including turbulent diffusion, convective overshoot and large-scale circulations. Our results demonstrate that hycean planets have unexpectedly rich climate dynamics. Meanwhile, previous claims about hycean planets should be treated with caution until confirmed with more self-consistent 1D and 3D models; this includes the claim that K2-18b might be habitable, and the proposal to infer $H_2O$ oceans on sub-Neptunes from JWST measurements of chemical species in their upper atmospheres.</description>

      <title>What is the nature of late infall streamers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing observational evidence suggests that Class II protoplanetary disks may undergo substantial interactions with their environment in the form of late infall. This mass inflow predominantly manifests itself in the form of so-called streamers: filaments and arcs of gas connecting large-scale, extended gas structures to disk scales. Prevalent late infall has far-reaching consequences for planet formation theory, challenging the long-standing treatment of evolved disks in isolation. In this work, we investigate the emergence of late-infall streamers in different formation scenarios, their morphology and multiplicity, as well as their dependence on environmental conditions. We conduct this investigation by performing 3D hydrodynamical simulation using the grid-based code FARGO3D, which we post-process to obtain synthetic observations using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC3D. We find that, while a late infall event in the form of a single encounter with a "cloudlet" of gas can produce a streamer via an interplay between the fall-back of bound material and shocks, such features dissipate quickly, on a timescale of ~10 kyr. Furthermore, we find that streamers can also form naturally in a turbulent, dense environment without the need for such encounters, which could act to reconcile short-lived streamers with ubiquitous detection of these structures. Here, we find multiple co-existing streamers for a disk velocity relative to the interstellar medium of $v_\mathrm{sys}=0.5~\mathrm{km}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and a turbulent velocity dispersion of $\sigma_\mathrm{turb}=0.5~\mathrm{km}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We find considerable dependence of the streamer morphology on the environment, which may act as a utility to constrain the physical conditions of the gas surrounding planet-forming disk, and therefore the conditions under which planets form.</description>

      <title>A Deep Search for Exomoons Around WISE 0855 With JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST is collecting time-series observations of many free-floating planets (FFPs) to study their weather, but these light curves are the ideal datasets to search for exomoons that transit the FFP during observations. In this paper, we present observations of the planetary-mass Y dwarf ($T=250-285K$, $M = 6.5\pm3.5 M_{Jup}$, d = 2.3$\,$pc) WISE J085510.83-071442.5 (WISE 0855), whose proximity and brightness make it ideal for a transiting exomoon search. We examine 11 hours of time-series spectra from the JWST Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) whose sensitivity, in combination with Gaussian process (GP) modeling, allows for the disentanglement of exomoon transits from WISE 0855's variability. We do not find statistically significant evidence of an exomoon transit in this dataset. Using injection and recovery tests of artificial transits for depths ranging between 0.1-1% (0.35-1.12 $R_{\oplus}$) we explore the exomoon parameter space where we could successfully detect transits. For transit depths $\geq 0.5\%$ (1.96$\,R_{\text{Titan}}$), our detection rate is 96%, which, for WISE 0855, corresponds to a moon with a companion-to-host mass ratio similar to that of Titan and Saturn. Given our sensitivity, transit probabilities, and our observational duration, we determine a $\sim$91% probability of detecting a Titan mass analog exomoon after 18 such observations if every observed system hosts a Titan mass analog exomoon in a Galilean-like system. This suggests that JWST observations of dozens of FFPs could yield meaningful constraints on the occurrence rate of exomoons. This paper is the first demonstration that JWST is sensitive to Galilean moon mass analogs around FFPs.</description>

      <title>On The Applicability of Ring-Moon Cycles to Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of rings and moons around exoplanets is likely to be one of the next great discoveries in exoplanet research. Using theories developed for the Solar System, we explore the possibility of coupled ring-moon cycles around exoplanets and what these processes mean for the observability of these features. Around Neptune- and Earth-like planets, we find that ring-moon cycles are capable of producing long-lived rings of comparable and greater relative transit depths than Saturn's. In multi-planet systems, secular spin-orbit resonances can provide the necessary planetary obliquity for these rings to contribute noticeably to transit lightcurves. We model the geometry of a ring's cross-section at various angles in comparison to the cross-section of a transiting planet to determine whether the ring may be detectable during the planet's transit. Ringed planets have also been proposed as an alternative to inflated planetary radii seen in transit, leading to abnormally low observed densities. Ring-moon cycles can produce late-forming and sometimes long-lived rings that can have the potential of explaining at least some of these observations. We also discuss some inconsistencies in the calculation of exoplanet oblateness due to rotation that we have come across in the course of this work.</description>

      <title>Horizontal and vertical exoplanet thermal structure from a JWST spectroscopic eclipse map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly-irradiated giant exoplanets known as "ultra-hot Jupiters" are anticipated to exhibit large variations of atmospheric temperature and chemistry as a function of longitude, latitude, and altitude. Previous observations have hinted at these variations, but the existing data have been fundamentally restricted to probing hemisphere-integrated spectra, thereby providing only coarse information on atmospheric gradients. Here we present a spectroscopic eclipse map of an extrasolar planet, resolving the atmosphere in multiple dimensions simultaneously. We analyze a secondary eclipse of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-18b observed with the NIRISS instrument on JWST. The mapping reveals weaker longitudinal temperature gradients than were predicted by theoretical models, indicating the importance of hydrogen dissociation and/or nightside clouds in shaping global thermal emission. Additionally, we identify two thermally distinct regions of the planet's atmosphere: a "hotspot" surrounding the substellar point and a "ring" near the dayside limbs. The hotspot region shows a strongly inverted thermal structure due to the presence of optical absorbers and a water abundance marginally lower than the hemispheric average, in accordance with theoretical predictions. The ring region shows colder temperatures and poorly constrained chemical abundances. Similar future analyses will reveal three-dimensional thermal, chemical, and dynamical properties of a broad range of exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Surface Binding Energies for Amorphous Plagioclase Feldspar Calculated using Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the well-established presence of amorphous compounds on planetary bodies such as the Moon and Mercury due to space weathering, the direct effect of atomic arrangement on the surface binding energies (SBEs) of elements on these bodies remains largely unexplored. Accurate SBE values are essential for reliably predicting sputtering yields and the energy distribution of ejecta. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to quantify SBEs for the different elements sputtered from amorphous atomic arrangements of the plagioclase feldspar end members, albite and anorthite, and compare to their crystalline counterparts. Results show that while the mean elemental SBEs from amorphous surfaces are not significantly different from their crystalline counterparts, the random orientation in amorphous structures gives rise to a spectrum of bonding configurations, resulting in a distribution of SBEs with a wider range. This contrasts with the clearly discretized set of SBE values associated with the ordered atomic structure of crystalline surfaces. We then consider sputtering by H, He, and a solar wind combination of 96% H and 4% He. For each of these cases, we demonstrate that there is minimal difference (&lt;10% for albite and &lt;20% for anorthite) between the sputtering yields of amorphous and crystalline surfaces. We attribute these results to the presence of the same elemental bonds across different atomic arrangements, which leads to similar mean SBEs and, consequently, comparable sputtering yields.</description>

      <title>Magrathea v2: A planetary interior modeling platform in C++</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magrathea is an open-source C++ code for modeling the internal structure of differentiated planets. The initial release, Huang et al. (2022), introduced the base solver, a modular framework for defining equations of state (EOSs) used within phase diagrams for each differentiated layer, and outlined a series of planned extensions. Many of those updates are now implemented. Magrathea v2 is a more versatile platform that supports a winder range of compositions, adds new tools for composition retrieval, and makes it easier for users to adapt the code to their own models.</description>

      <title>LEVITAS: Levitodynamics for Accurate Individual Particle Sensing in Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately observing the rarefied media of the upper atmosphere, exosphere, and planetary and solar system environments and beyond requires highly sensitive metrological techniques. We present the operating concept and architecture of an in-situ sensing solution based on the dynamics of a levitated nanoparticle (levitodynamics). It can detect and measure impacts of individual particles in rarefied media. Dubbed `LEVITAS', our sensor consists of a dispenser of dielectric nanoparticles and optical trapping of a single nanoparticle in the focus of a laser beam. The trapped nanoparticle constitutes a harmonic oscillator at frequencies in the kilohertz range whose position can be tracked at the standard quantum limit by interferometric detection of the laser photons it scatters. Here, we simulate microcanonical impacts on the nanoparticle and show that the density, velocity, temperature, and composition of the surrounding medium can be estimated accurately. We illustrate the performance of LEVITAS in circumstances ranging from low Earth orbit out to exospheric distances, across which individual impacts can be detected at favourable rates. Furthermore, LEVITAS may be employed to accurately measure highly rarefied neutral distributions within vastly different areas of momentum space. This we demonstrate by simulating the measurement of high-velocity neutral gas particles from the interstellar medium penetrating the heliosphere and flowing through our solar system.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI Imaging of the Warm Dust Component of the Epsilon Eridani Debris Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present JWST/MIRI observations of the debris disk surrounding the nearby, solar analog Epsilon Eridani obtained as part of the Archetypal Debris Disk GTO program. Multi-wavelength images from 15, 18, 21, and 25.5 $\mu m$ show a smooth dust distribution with no evidence of sculpting by massive planets outside of 5 au. Maps of the color temperature and opacity constrain the dust properties while radiative transfer modeling of a warm dust component traces the interaction between the debris disk and Epsilon Eri b ($\sim$3.5 au). Dynamical and collisional modeling further shows that the disk morphology is dominated by dust produced in the outer planetesimal belt ($\sim 70 \, au$) moving inward via stellar wind drag. We confirm the presence of a disk interior to the Epsilon Eri b orbit first detected from mid-IR interferometry. Drag dominated inner disk regions have also been observed around Vega and Fomalhaut hinting at the diversity of asteroid belt analogs.</description>

      <title>Icy or rocky? Convective or stable? New interior models of Uranus and Neptune</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new framework for constructing agnostic and yet physical models for planetary interiors and apply it to Uranus and Neptune. Unlike previous research that either impose rigid assumptions or rely on simplified empirical profiles, our approach bridges both paradigms. Starting from randomly generated density profiles, we applied an iterative algorithm that converges towards models that simultaneously satisfy hydrostatic equilibrium, match the observed gravitational moments, and remain thermodynamically and compositionally consistent. The inferred interior models for Uranus and Neptune span a wide range of possible interior structures, in particular encompassing both water-dominated and rock-dominated configurations (rock-to-water mass ratios between 0.04-3.92 for Uranus and 0.20-1.78 for Neptune). All models contain convective regions with ionic water and have temperature-pressure profiles that remain above the demixing curves for hydrogen-helium-water mixtures. This offers both a plausible explanation for the observed non-dipolar magnetic fields and indicates that no hydrogen-helium-water demixing occurs. We find a higher H-He mass fraction in the outermost convection zones for Uranus (0.62-0.73) compared to Neptune (0.25-0.49) and that Uranus' magnetic field is likely generated deeper in the interior compared to Neptune. We infer upper limits of 0.69-0.74 (Uranus) versus 0.78-0.92 (Neptune) for the outer edges of the dynamo regions in units of normalised radii. Overall, our findings challenge the conventional classification of Uranus and Neptune as 'ice giants' and underscore the need for improved observational data or formation constraints to break compositional degeneracy.</description>
