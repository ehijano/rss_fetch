      <title>MIN: Multi-channel Interaction Network for Drug-Target Interaction with Protein Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional drug discovery processes are both time-consuming and require extensive professional expertise. With the accumulation of drug-target interaction (DTI) data from experimental studies, leveraging modern machine-learning techniques to discern patterns between drugs and target proteins has become increasingly feasible. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-channel Interaction Network (MIN), a novel framework designed to predict DTIs through two primary components: a representation learning module and a multi-channel interaction module. The representation learning module features a C-Score Predictor-assisted screening mechanism, which selects critical residues to enhance prediction accuracy and reduce noise. The multi-channel interaction module incorporates a structure-agnostic channel, a structure-aware channel, and an extended-mixture channel, facilitating the identification of interaction patterns at various levels for optimal complementarity. Additionally, contrastive learning is utilized to harmonize the representations of diverse data types. Our experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that MIN surpasses other strong DTI prediction methods. Furthermore, the case study reveals a high overlap between the residues selected by the C-Score Predictor and those in actual binding pockets, underscoring MIN's explainability capability. These findings affirm that MIN is not only a potent tool for DTI prediction but also offers fresh insights into the prediction of protein binding sites.</description>

      <title>Dynamical modelling of the frailty index indicates that health reaches a tipping point near age 75</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frailty index (FI) serves as a useful quantitative summary of age-related health. We quantitatively modelled FI trajectories with age. We fit directly to longitudinal transitions in health attributes from normal to deficit and vice-versa. We used data from two large longitudinal studies: the Health and Retirement Study and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. The studies included 47592 individuals with 254357 total visits. Using damage (deficit emergence) and repair (deficit recovery) transitions we estimated changes to robustness and resilience, respectively. We find that both robustness and resilience decrease continuously with both increasing age and FI. Remarkably, these declines caused a tipping point in health near age 75, when damage and repair rates are equal. Beyond this tipping point, the ongoing loss of both robustness and resilience leads to a sharp increase in the FI and a commensurate increase in risk of mortality. This tipping point was observed in both sexes, noting that males showed higher initial robustness and resilience, and commensurately steeper decline, consistent with the sex-frailty paradox. We infer that robustness and resilience mitigate environmental stressors only up to an age of 75, beyond which health deficits will increasingly accumulate leading to death.</description>

      <title>dsLassoCov: a federated machine learning approach incorporating covariate control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has been widely adopted in biomedical research, fueled by the increasing availability of data. However, integrating datasets across institutions is challenging due to legal restrictions and data governance complexities. Federated learning allows the direct, privacy preserving training of machine learning models using geographically distributed datasets, but faces the challenge of how to appropriately control for covariate effects. The naive implementation of conventional covariate control methods in federated learning scenarios is often impractical due to the substantial communication costs, particularly with high-dimensional data. To address this issue, we introduce dsLassoCov, a machine learning approach designed to control for covariate effects and allow an efficient training in federated learning. In biomedical analysis, this allow the biomarker selection against the confounding effects. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that dsLassoCov can efficiently and effectively manage confounding effects during model training. In our real-world data analysis, we replicated a large-scale Exposome analysis using data from six geographically distinct databases, achieving results consistent with previous studies. By resolving the challenge of covariate control, our proposed approach can accelerate the application of federated learning in large-scale biomedical studies.</description>

      <title>Annotation-guided Protein Design with Multi-Level Domain Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16866v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The core challenge of de novo protein design lies in creating proteins with specific functions or properties, guided by certain conditions. Current models explore to generate protein using structural and evolutionary guidance, which only provide indirect conditions concerning functions and properties. However, textual annotations of proteins, especially the annotations for protein domains, which directly describe the protein's high-level functionalities, properties, and their correlation with target amino acid sequences, remain unexplored in the context of protein design tasks. In this paper, we propose Protein-Annotation Alignment Generation, PAAG, a multi-modality protein design framework that integrates the textual annotations extracted from protein database for controllable generation in sequence space. Specifically, within a multi-level alignment module, PAAG can explicitly generate proteins containing specific domains conditioned on the corresponding domain annotations, and can even design novel proteins with flexible combinations of different kinds of annotations. Our experimental results underscore the superiority of the aligned protein representations from PAAG over 7 prediction tasks. Furthermore, PAAG demonstrates a significant increase in generation success rate (24.7% vs 4.7% in zinc finger, and 54.3% vs 22.0% in the immunoglobulin domain) in comparison to the existing model. We anticipate that PAAG will broaden the horizons of protein design by leveraging the knowledge from between textual annotation and proteins.</description>

      <title>A Real-Time Suite of Biological Cell Image Analysis Software for Computers, Smartphones, and Smart Glasses, Suitable for Resource-Constrained Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15735v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introduction: Methods for personalizing medical treatment are the focal point of contemporary clinical research. In cancer care, for instance, we can analyze the effects of therapies at the level of individual cells. Complete characterization of treatment efficacy and evaluation of why some individuals respond to specific regimens, whereas others do not, requires additional approaches to genetic sequencing at single time points. Methods for the continuous analysis of changes in phenotype, such as morphology and motion tracking of cellular proteins and organelles over time frames spanning the minute-hour scales, can provide important insight to patient treatment options. The integration of measurements of intracellular dynamics and the contribution of multiple genetic pathways in degenerative diseases is vital for the development of biomarkers for the early detection of pathogenesis and therapy efficacy.
  Methods: We have developed a software suite (DataSet Tracker) for real-time analysis designed to run on computers, smartphones, and smart glasses hardware and suitable for resource-constrained, on-the-fly computing in microscopes without internet connectivity; a demo is available for viewing at datasetanalysis.com.
  Results: Our objective is to present the community with an integrated, easy to use by all, tool for resolving the complex dynamics of the cytoskeletal meshworks, intracytoplasmic membranous networks, and vesicle trafficking. It is our goal to have this integrated tool approved for use in the clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Which Augmentation Should I Use? An Empirical Investigation of Augmentations for Self-Supervised Phonocardiogram Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00502v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in deep learning, its application in real-world medical settings, such as phonocardiogram (PCG) classification, remains limited. A significant barrier is the lack of high-quality annotated datasets, which hampers the development of robust, generalizable models that can perform well on newly collected, out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) contrastive learning, has shown promise in mitigating the issue of data scarcity by using unlabeled data to enhance model robustness. Even though SSL methods have been proposed and researched in other domains, works focusing on the impact of data augmentations on model robustness for PCG classification are limited. In particular, while augmentations are a key component in SSL, selecting the most suitable policy during training is highly challenging. Improper augmentations can lead to substantial performance degradation and even hinder a network's ability to learn meaningful representations. Addressing this gap, our research aims to explore and evaluate a wide range of audio-based augmentations and uncover combinations that enhance SSL model performance in PCG classification. We conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis across multiple datasets, assessing the impact of various augmentations on model performance. Our findings reveal that depending on the training distribution, augmentation choice significantly influences model robustness, with fully-supervised models experiencing up to a 32\% drop in effectiveness when evaluated on unseen data, while SSL models demonstrate greater resilience, losing only 10\% or even improving in some cases. This study also highlights the most promising and appropriate augmentations for PCG signal processing, by calculating their effect size on training. These insights equip researchers with valuable guidelines for developing reliable models in PCG signal processing.</description>

      <title>LA4SR: illuminating the dark proteome with generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI language models (LMs) show promise for biological sequence analysis. We re-engineered open-source LMs (GPT-2, BLOOM, DistilRoBERTa, ELECTRA, and Mamba, ranging from 70M to 12B parameters) for microbial sequence classification. The models achieved F1 scores up to 95 and operated 16,580x faster and at 2.9x the recall of BLASTP. They effectively classified the algal dark proteome - uncharacterized proteins comprising about 65% of total proteins - validated on new data including a new, complete Hi-C/Pacbio Chlamydomonas genome. Larger (&gt;1B) LA4SR models reached high accuracy (F1 &gt; 86) when trained on less than 2% of available data, rapidly achieving strong generalization capacity. High accuracy was achieved when training data had intact or scrambled terminal information, demonstrating robust generalization to incomplete sequences. Finally, we provide custom AI explainability software tools for attributing amino acid patterns to AI generative processes and interpret their outputs in evolutionary and biophysical contexts.</description>
