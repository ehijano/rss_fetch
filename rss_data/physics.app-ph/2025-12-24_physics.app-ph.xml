      <title>Microstructured Electrode-Piezopolymer Interface for Ultrasound Transducers with Enhanced Flexibility and Acoustic Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound transducers made from rigid piezoceramics are difficult to adapt for wearable or conformal applications. Piezopolymer-based transducers offer a practical alternative; however, most existing studies focus on piezoelectric materials, while the influence of electrode material and electrode-polymer interface remains underexplored. This study leverages different interface-engineering strategies to examine the influence of electrode-piezopolymer interface morphology on piezoelectric, dielectric, and acoustic behavior in flexible transducers. Devices were fabricated using silver (Ag), gold (Au), graphene flakes (GF), laser-induced graphene (LIG), and Au-decorated LIG electrodes, enabling comparison across interfacial architectures. LIG-based transducers showed strong acoustic and piezoelectric output due to partial infiltration of the piezopolymer into the porous LIG network, which enhances interfacial contact and stress transfer. Au-based transducers achieved comparable acoustic output. In contrast, dense Ag electrodes and layered GF films provided limited coupling, resulting in reduced electromechanical response. LIG-based transducers exhibited the highest flexibility and durability, retaining stable performance after 10,000 bending cycles and an eight-week aging study, whereas GF, Ag, and Au devices degraded under bending, and Ag electrodes declined over time. These findings demonstrate that engineering the electrode-polymer interface is critical for high-performance flexible ultrasound transducers and identify LIG as a strong candidate for wearable imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Effect of discreteness on domain wall stability in a plate coupled to a foundation of bistable elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surfaces and structures capable of multiple stable configurations have attracted growing interest for on-demand shape morphing. In this work, we consider an elastic compliant plate coupled to a two-dimensional foundation comprising an array of bistable elements, a system that can form and retain complex continuous morphologies without sustained actuation via creation of stable domain walls separating regions in different stable states. These domain walls exhibit three distinct behaviors: expansion, shrinking, and metastable pinning. These arise from two limits of foundation discreteness. In the continuum limit, where bistable units are strongly coupled, domain walls undergo global phase transitions analogous to first-order phase transitions. In the anti-continuum limit, discreteness introduces Peierls-Nabarro-type energy modulations that lead to metastable pinning. To quantify these behaviors and the transition between the two limits, we develop a reduced-order model that captures the total potential energy of configurations with domain walls and validate it using finite element analysis (FEA). For axisymmetric domain walls, the model yields phase diagrams identifying the regimes of expansion, shrinking, and pinning as functions of bistable-potential asymmetry, relative foundation discreteness, and domain-wall size. We then extend the analysis to non-axisymmetric geometries and establish local geometric criteria that predict the stability of convex and concave polygonal domain walls, confirmed by simulations. Together, these results clarify how discreteness enables stability through energy-landscape modulation, provide predictive design rules for multistable reconfigurable surfaces, and offer insights into domain-wall stability more generally in elastically coupled multistable metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Ultrasonic metamaterial at MHz frequencies using microstructured glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic metamaterials enhance traditional material properties through microstructure engineering, providing new opportunities to shape sound fields in applications ranging from biomedical imaging, clinical therapy to non-destructive testing. However, at the MHz frequency ranges, only a few metamaterial architectures exist. They are often highly attenuating or difficult to manufacture, and generally provide limited 3D control over sound propagation. Here, we introduce a MHz-frequency ultrasonic metamaterial based on laser-engraved glass. By structuring meta-voxels with different engraving patterns, we define a fully-3D, anisotropic metamaterial exhibiting local variations in the sound speed of up to 20% compared to unstructured glass, and losses 100x lower than in comparable 3D printed metamaterials. We use this metamaterial to define a library of standard elements that can be modularly combined to create and shape complex-patterned ultrasonic fields. Our experiments are supported by a theoretical model, which provides additional insights into the microstructural origin of the metamaterial behavior and opens the door to designing tailored ultrasound fields and responses.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Information Security via Wave-Field Selectivity and Structured Wavefront Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel secure wireless transmission architecture that enables the co-existence of spatial field modulation (SFM) and digital bandpass modulation (DBM), utilizing multi-mode vortex waves and programmable meta-surfaces (PMS). Distinct from conventional joint modulation schemes, our approach establishes two logically independent transmission channels--SFM and DBM--thereby eliminating the need for joint signal design or time synchronization. Specifically, the orthogonality of vortex wave modes is exploited to construct a high-capacity multi-mode DBM channel, in which each mode carries modulated symbols independently. As the composite waveform passes through the PMS, energy from different vortex modes is spatially focused onto distinct positions, dynamically determined by the PMS configuration. This spatial mapping forms a unique lookup table that encodes additional information in the electro-magnetic (EM) field distribution, effectively enabling a second, concurrent SFM channel. To enhance physical-layer security, the DBM channel transmits encrypted symbols transformed via dynamic symbol-domain mapping, while the corresponding mapping relations--or key information--are carried by the SFM channel. This lightweight dual-channel encryption strategy provides strong confidentiality without requiring complex joint decoding. To validate the feasibility of the proposed architecture, we design and implement a proof-of-concept prototype system, and conduct experimental demonstrations under real-world wireless communication conditions. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the co-existent DBM-SFM design in achieving reliable and secure transmission. The proposed architecture offers a scalable, low-complexity, and secure transmission solution for future IoT networks, especially in scenarios demanding both spectral efficiency and physical-layer confidentiality.</description>

      <title>LiquiFab -- Building with liquids in weightlessness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing digital manufacturing methods can be broadly divided into subtractive approaches, where material is removed from a bulk to reveal the desired form, and additive methods, in which material is introduced voxel-by-voxel to create an object.
  We here show a fundamentally different method for the fabrication of three-dimensional objects that is neither subtractive nor additive. Instead of removal or layer-by-layer material deposition, in LiquiFab we shape an entire volume of liquid polymer by subjecting it to a set of geometrical constraints under conditions of weightlessness. The physics of liquid interfaces then drives the polymer to naturally adopt a configuration that minimizes its surface energy. On Earth, we achieve weightlessness through neutral buoyancy, and show that a small, well-defined set of boundary surfaces can be used to drive the liquid into a desired form that is then solidified. By sequentially applying this process, complex architectures can be assembled from successive liquid-formed elements.
  Unlike additive manufacturing, where every point within the object must be individually visited by a print head or light field, LiquiFab forms the entire structure simultaneously. This makes the process highly scalable and opens the door to rapid manufacturing of large objects both on Earth and in space.</description>

      <title>Visual Event Detection over AI-Edge LEO Satellites with AoI Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non terrestrial networks (NTNs), particularly low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems, play a vital role in supporting future mission critical applications such as disaster relief. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-native communications enable LEO satellites to act as intelligent edge nodes capable of on board learning and task oriented inference. However, the limited link budget, coupled with severe path loss and fading, significantly constrains reliable downlink transmission. This paper proposes a deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC)-based downlink scheme for AI-native LEO networks, optimized for goal-oriented visual inference. In the DJSCC approach, only semantically meaningful features are extracted and transmitted, whereas conventional separate source-channel coding (SSCC) transmits the original image data. To evaluate information freshness and visual event detection performance, this work introduces the age of misclassified information (AoMI) metric and a threshold based AoI analysis that measures the proportion of users meeting application specific timeliness requirements. Simulation results show that the proposed DJSCC scheme provides higher inference accuracy, lower average AoMI, and greater threshold compliance than the conventional SSCC baseline, enabling semantic communication in AI native LEO satellite networks for 6G and beyond.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency loading of 2,400 Ytterbium atoms in optical tweezer arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform for quantum computation, simulation, and metrology. Among them, alkaline-earth-like atoms exhibit distinct advantages, including long coherence time and high-fidelity Rydberg gates. However, their scalability has lagged behind that of the alkali atoms. Here, we report 2,400 Ytterbium-174 atoms trapped in an optical tweezer array with enhanced single-atom loading efficiency of 83.5(1)%. Notably, the loading efficiency is largely maintained for array sizes ranging from dozens to thousands, exhibiting excellent scalability. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the enhanced loading method by showing that the enhancement exists robustly across a range of interatomic potentials, suggesting its utility for other atomic species. To establish the capability of the 174Yb arrays toward universal quantum computation, we propose to encode the qubit in the ground-clock state manifold and estimate a 99.9% two-qubit gate fidelity with experimentally feasible parameters. Our work advances the prospects for realizing large-scale quantum computers using alkaline-earth-like atoms.</description>

      <title>Enabling atom-clad waveguide operation in a microfabricated alkali vapor-photonic integrated circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating alkali atomic vapors with nanophotonic devices offers a scalable route to quantum technologies that leverage strong atom-photon interactions. While there have been many approaches to such integration, the general reliance on traditional glass vapor cells, distilled alkali metals, and epoxy sealing limits reproducibility and scalability. Moreover, mitigating adverse Rb-photonics interactions is essential, particularly as devices become more compact and the alkali source lies in close proximity to the photonic elements. Here, we demonstrate the successful operation of compact and fully integrated devices that combine silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits (PICs) with microfabricated borosilicate vapor cells and pill-type rubidium (Rb) dispensers through hermetic seals via anodic bonding. We show how successful operation hinges on optically activating the dispenser in a low-power pulsed mode, releasing controlled amounts of Rb vapor on demand while mitigating photonic degradation. Simultaneously, a counter-propagating desorption laser completely suppresses Rb-induced losses and enables waveguide-based atomic vapor spectroscopy. Using this approach, we demonstrate repeatable control of vapor density by tuning activation pulse length, duty cycle, and device temperature. These results establish a compact, manufacturable, and scalable vapor-PIC device, and set the stage for future demonstrations in cavity quantum electrodynamics, quantum nonlinear optics, and chip-scale atomic sensors.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid quantum devices using surface acoustic waves show promise as key elements of quantum information processors. We report measurements of integrated flip-chip devices consisting of semiconductor quantum dots and surface acoustic wave resonators in lithium niobate. We observed that the pyroelectric effect in lithium niobate inhibited the operation of quantum dots in the integrated devices. GaAs/AlGaAs devices suffered from unintentional carrier depletion, and Si/SiGe devices suffered from electrostatic discharge. Our results highlight the importance of mitigating pyroelectric effects in semiconductor-lithium niobate hybrid devices for continued progress in quantum interconnects and transducers.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Imaging of Periodic Structures using Extreme Ultraviolet Scatterometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic scattering and imaging with coherent, ultrafast, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light sources can resolve charge, phonon and spin processes on their intrinsic length and time scales. However, full field coherent diffraction imaging requires scanning of the sample combined with computational phase retrieval, making it challenging to quickly acquire a large series of dynamic frames. In this work, we demonstrate a technique for extracting dynamic 1D images of the average unit cell in a periodic sample from traditional EUV scatterometry data by analyzing the changing intensities of the far field diffracted orders. Starting from a system of equations relating small changes in far field diffraction to phase and amplitude perturbations at the sample plane, it is shown that under certain conditions, changes to the $n$th diffracted order map exclusively onto the $n$th Fourier component of the perturbation via a closed-form relation. We show through rigorous coupled-wave analysis simulations that our method can provide a good approximation even outside the scalar diffraction theory framework in which it is derived. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate this reconstruction method by exiting 1D nickel nanowires on a diamond substrate using an infrared laser pump pulse, and measuring their relaxation using a time-delayed EUV probe pulse, to visualize nanoscale phonon dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Various optical ultrasound microsensors have been developed with size ranging from tens to hundreds of micrometers. However, it becomes challenging to further minimize these sensors' size. In this work, we proposed a method that use a tapered fiber-based micro-waveguide (TFMW) attaching to the optical microsensor to bypass this challenge. The TFMW not only serves as the waveguide to transport ultrasound, but can also deliver light and actively excite ultrasound. In this study, we proposed the design and analyzed its performance using theoretical analysis and simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Porous ceramic microspheres are a desirable substance for bone tissue reconstruction and delivery applications. This study focuses on Mg-Ca silicate microspheres encapsulated in biodegradable poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) to serve as a biocompatible carrier for the controlled release of vancomycin hydrochloride. In this regard, diopside (MgCaSi2O6), bredigite (MgCa7Si4O16) and akermanite (MgCa2Si2O7) powders were synthesized by sol-gel and subsequent calcination methods. Then, porous akermanite, diopside and bredigite microspheres of 700-1000 um in diameter were fabricated by using carbon porogen, droplet extrusion and sintering, then loaded with the drug and eventually coated with PLGA. The bare microspheres showed a considerable burst release mode of the drug into a physiological medium, whereas PLGA coating of the microspheres reduced the burst release level. To investigate effective mechanisms governing in the drug release from the carriers, the contribution of burst, degradation, and diffusion was analyzed by the sequential quadratic programming algorithm method. It was found that the relative contribution of diffusion to bioresorption is ranked as diopside &gt; akermanite &gt; bredigite, whereas PLGA coating dominates the diffusion mechanism. The dental pulp stem cells cytocompatibility MTT assay of the microspheres also showed that the drug loading deteriorates but PLGA coating improves the cell biocompatibility significantly. Comparatively, the biocompatibility of the PLGA-coated microspheres was ranked as akermanite &gt; diopside &gt; bredigite, as a result of a compromise between the release of the constituting ions of the ceramic carriers and vancomycin molecules. It was eventually concluded that PLGA-coated Mg-Ca silicate microspheres are promising candidates for drug-delivery bone tissue engineering and dental bone grafting applications.</description>

      <title>Microscopic and spectroscopic evidences for multiple ion-exchange reactions controlling biomineralization of CaO.MgO.2SiO2 nanoceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study is focused on the mechanism of in vitro biomineralization on the surface of CaO.MgO.2SiO2 (diopside) nanostructured coatings by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy assessments. A homogeneous diopside coating of almost 2 um in thickness was deposited on a medical-grade stainless steel by coprecipitation, dipping and sintering sequences. After soaking the sample in a simulated body fluid (SBF) for 14 days, a layer with the thickness of 8 {\mu}m is recognized to be substituted for the primary diopside deposit, suggesting the mineralization of apatite on the surface. Investigations revealed that the newly-formed layer is predominantly composed of Ca, P and Si, albeit with a biased accumulations of P and Si towards the surface and substrate, respectively. The variations in the ionic composition and pH of the SBF due to the incubation of the sample were also correlated with the above-interpreted biomineralization. In conclusion, the multiple ion-exchange reactions related to Ca, Mg, Si and P were found to be responsible for the in vitro bioactivity of nanodiopside.</description>

      <title>Dielectric and gate metal engineering for threshold voltage modulation in enhancement mode monolayer MoS2 field effect transistors</title>

Abstract: Excellent gate electrostatics in field effect transistors (FETs) based on two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide (2D TMD) channels can dramatically decrease static power dissipation. Energy efficient FETs operate in enhancement mode with small and positive threshold voltage (Vth) for n-type devices. However, most state-of-the-art FETs based on monolayer MoS2 channel operate in depletion mode with negative Vth due to doping from the underlying dielectric substrate. In this work, we identify key properties of the semiconductor/dielectric interface (MoS2 on industrially relevant high dielectric constant (k) HfO2, ZrO2 and hBN for reference) responsible for realizing enhancement-mode operation of 2D MoS2 channel FETs. We find that hBN and ZrO2 dielectric substrates provide low defect interfaces with MoS2 that enables effective modulation of the Vth using gate metals of different work functions (WFs). We use photoluminescence (PL) and synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to investigate doping levels in monolayer MoS2 on different dielectrics with different WF gate metals. We complement the FET and spectroscopic measurements with capacitance-voltage analysis on dielectrics with varying thicknesses, which confirm that Vth modulation in ZrO2 devices is correlated with WF of the gate metals - in contrast with HfO2 devices that exhibit signatures of Vth pinning induced by oxide/interface defect states. Finally, we demonstrate FETs using a 2D MoS2 channel and a 6 nm of ZrO2 dielectric, achieving a subthreshold swing of 87 mV dec-1 and a threshold voltage of 0.1 V. Our results offer insights into the role of dielectric/semiconductor interface in 2D MoS2 based FETs for realizing enhancement mode FETs and highlight the potential of ZrO2 as a scalable high-k dielectric.</description>

      <title>High efficiency and compact lithium niobate non-resonant recirculating phase modulator and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High modulation efficiency and a compact footprint are critical for next-generation electro-optic (EO) modulators. We introduce a new class of non-resonant recirculating phase modulators (PMs) that boosts modulation efficiency by repeatedly modulating the optical field within a single, non-resonant waveguide, while fundamentally removing the loop-length matching constraint that has limited prior recirculating schemes. This architectural breakthrough simultaneously enables a much smaller device footprint and an extended low-V$\pi$ bandwidth, without relying on narrowband resonances. Building on this concept, we experimentally demonstrate both a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) and a cascaded PM, and verify their versatility in finite impulse response (FIR) filtering and optical frequency comb (OFC) generation. The recirculating MZM operates as a 4-tap rectangular-window FIR filter with 110 GHz bandwidth in a compact 2.889$\times$0.58 mm$^2$ footprint. The cascaded PM achieves a 3.40 GHz low-V$\pi$ bandwidth, a 110 GHz resonant EO bandwidth, and a V$\pi$L of 0.7 V$\cdot$cm, and generates 20 OFC lines under a 33 dBm microwave drive. These results demonstrate, for the first time, a practical and highly efficient non-resonant recirculating modulation platform, laying the groundwork for scalable high-order mode recirculating modulators (RMs) and opening new opportunities in optical communications, sensing, and microwave photonics.</description>

      <title>Thermal wakefield structure in plasma acceleration processes: insights from fluid models and PIC simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on the process of plasma acceleration in the presence of non-negligible thermal effects, wherein a driver of relativistic electrons perturbs a warm neutral plasma and generates a wakefield structure. We study the acceleration process via numerical simulations based on fluid models with different thermal closure assumptions, and also provide systematic comparisons against ground-truth data coming from particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. The focus of the analysis is on the first electron depletion bubble after the driver, where we provide a detailed characterization of its size and the electromagnetic fields developed inside. Our results are instrumental in determining the correct thermal closure assumption to be used in fluid models for the numerical simulations of plasma acceleration processes, as well as elucidating the corresponding limits of applicability.</description>

      <title>Reductive Contact and Dipolar Interface Engineering Enable Stable Flexible CsSnI3 Nanowire Photodetectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lead-free tin-based halide perovskites are attractive for flexible and environmentally benign optoelectronics, but their application is limited by the rapid oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ and poor operational stability. Here, we report a flexible CsSnI3 nanowire photodetector that achieves both high near-infrared photoresponse and long-term stability through synergistic aluminium-substrate contact engineering and dipolar interface modification. A 0.2 mm anodized aluminium foil serves as the flexible substrate, where localized laser ablation exposes metallic aluminium regions that act as reductive sites, effectively suppressing Sn2+ oxidation during nanowire growth. Simultaneously, a polar interlayer of 3-fluoro-2-nitroanisole is introduced to improve energy-level alignment, suppress interfacial deprotonation, and enhance charge extraction. The resulting device exhibits a responsivity of 0.39 A W-1, a specific detectivity of 1.38 * 10^13 Jones, and a wide linear dynamic range of 156 dB under 850 nm illumination. Moreover, the device retains over 85% of its initial photocurrent after 60 days in ambient air and maintains 94% of its initial photocurrent after 1000 bending cycles. This work establishes an effective strategy for stabilizing Sn-based perovskites toward high-performance flexible optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Optimal navigation in a noisy environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigating toward a known target in a noisy environment is a fundamental problem shared across biological, physical, and engineered systems. Although optimal strategies are often framed in terms of continuous, fine-grained feedback, we show that efficient navigation emerges from a far simpler principle: natural wandering punctuated by intermittent course corrections. Using a controlled robotic platform, active Brownian particle simulations, and scaling theory, we identify a universal trade-off between noise-induced deviation and the finite cost of reorientation, yielding an optimal course correction frequency governed by only a few system parameters. Despite their differing levels of complexity, our experiment and theory collapse onto common quantitative signatures, including first-passage time distribution and non-Gaussian angular dispersion. Our results establish intermittent course-correction as a minimal and robust alternative to continuous feedback, offering a unifying guiding principle for point-to-point navigation in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Snapshot 3D image projection using a diffractive decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D image display is essential for next-generation volumetric imaging; however, dense depth multiplexing for 3D image projection remains challenging because diffraction-induced cross-talk rapidly increases as the axial image planes get closer. Here, we introduce a 3D display system comprising a digital encoder and a diffractive optical decoder, which simultaneously projects different images onto multiple target axial planes with high axial resolution. By leveraging multi-layer diffractive wavefront decoding and deep learning-based end-to-end optimization, the system achieves high-fidelity depth-resolved 3D image projection in a snapshot, enabling axial plane separations on the order of a wavelength. The digital encoder leverages a Fourier encoder network to capture multi-scale spatial and frequency-domain features from input images, integrates axial position encoding, and generates a unified phase representation that simultaneously encodes all images to be axially projected in a single snapshot through a jointly-optimized diffractive decoder. We characterized the impact of diffractive decoder depth, output diffraction efficiency, spatial light modulator resolution, and axial encoding density, revealing trade-offs that govern axial separation and 3D image projection quality. We further demonstrated the capability to display volumetric images containing 28 axial slices, as well as the ability to dynamically reconfigure the axial locations of the image planes, performed on demand. Finally, we experimentally validated the presented approach, demonstrating close agreement between the measured results and the target images. These results establish the diffractive 3D display system as a compact and scalable framework for depth-resolved snapshot 3D image projection, with potential applications in holographic displays, AR/VR interfaces, and volumetric optical computing.</description>

      <title>Optical Pin Beams: Research Progresses and Emerging Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical pin beams (OPBs) represent a novel class of structured light fields engineered for resilient, long-distance propagation. Their exceptional stability and strong resistance to atmospheric turbulence make them a compelling alternative to conventional Gaussian and other structured beams for free-space optical systems. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the physical principles, generation strategies, experimental realizations, and emerging applications of OPBs. By precise spatial modulation of the optical wave vectors, OPBs achieve highly collimated, self-reconstructing propagation with distinctive pin-like features that confer remarkable robustness and self-healing capability. We further discuss several OPB derivatives--including vortex, inverted, and vortex-inverted OPBs--which expand the functional landscape by enabling flexible control over amplitude, phase, polarization, and orbital angular momentum. Experimentally, OPBs have demonstrated outstanding performance across diverse platforms, ranging from free-space and underwater optical communications to optical trapping and super-resolution imaging. With their unique combination of propagation stability, light-field tunability, and environmental adaptability, OPBs hold strong promise for next-generation optical communication, precision sensing, and advanced imaging technologies. This review summarizes recent research progresses in OPBs and highlights key opportunities and prospects for advancing their scientific discoveries and practical applications.</description>

      <title>The origins of the leakage currents of p-n junction and Schottky diodes in all kinds of materials: A novel explanation based on impurity-photovoltaic-effect due to the self-absorption of the room-temperature infrared emission from materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A p-n junction is the basic building block for various semiconductor devices. A Schottky diode has characteristics that are essentially similar to those of the p-n junction diode. As is known, the leakage currents of p-n and Schottky junctions affect the overall performance of the devices and reduce the reliability of the devices. In order to achieve optimum device design, it is essential to fully understand the physical principle of the leakage currents. In traditional theory, defects provide a path for leakage current to travel. In this study, a novel theoretical model based on impurity-photovoltaic-effect is proposed to explain the leakage currents. It is well known that any object at a room-temperature emits infrared (IR) photons due to blackbody radiation. As is also well known, there is no absolutely pure material, and any material contains unavoidable defects associated with impurities. The self-absorption of the IR emission could be achieved through the sub-band-gap excitations due to defect-related intermediate levels in forbidden energy band-gap, creating carriers (electrons and holes). Some of the carriers diffuse into the built-in electric field of the junction. The built-in field then sweeps out electrons and holes in opposite directions, forming IR-generated photocurrent. Therefore, the leakage current is regarded as photocurrent. In addition to p-n junctions, some junctions exist in many semiconductor devices such as p-i-n diode and charge-coupled device (CCD), and these junctions also have built-in field due to contact potential difference. In fact, every semiconductor device contains at least one junction. The novel model is expected to explain the leakage for all kinds of junctions with semiconductor built-in fields.</description>

Abstract: Stencil mask lithography is an advanced technique for fully in-situ fabricating Josephson junctions, which is increasingly being used for multi-terminal Josephson junctions. This study provides information on the optimal mask design and mask reliability. For this, 270 mask designs were systematically fabricated and investigated under scanning electron microscope. Reliable statements are made about mask yield, minimal dimensions, and systematic dependencies on the number of superconducting terminals. We find that stencil mask lithography can be used reliably for fabricating multi-terminal Josephson junctions, enabling lateral mask dimensions down to 40$\,$nm on average.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An increasing number of studies are moving towards the combination of quantum mechanics and gravity, where studying gravity from a very small source mass is a viable starting point. Preparing for such experiments, investigations of weak gravitational forces have employed mechanical resonators to detect time-dependent gravitational forces from actuated source masses. Here, we demonstrate a source mass approach which utilizes capacitive actuation of a 1 mg gold sphere embedded on a silicon nitride membrane, rather than piezoelectric or motorized actuation. The design simultaneously provides a method for microwave optomechanical implementation by coupling the membrane position to the electromagnetic mode of a 3D cavity. The cavity quality factor is not significantly compromised by electromagnetic leakage to the actuation electrode, allowing DC and kilohertz AC voltages to be introduced in the region where electric fields are strongly concentrated. We measure over 700 nm of driven oscillation amplitude and more than ten percent tunability in the mechanical resonance frequency of the loaded membrane, giving the potential to match the oscillations to the frequency range of a detector in future experiments. An optomechanical readout is demonstrated by measuring the cavity resonance at cryogenic temperatures, while room temperature measurements provide complimentary understanding of the mechanisms which influence the mechanical response, including repulsive contact due to collisions within the device.</description>

      <title>Edge-of-chaos enhanced quantum-inspired algorithm for combinatorial optimization</title>

Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. Numerical simulations of them are also useful as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a quantum-inspired algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve surprisingly high performance, namely, almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by physics-inspired approaches.</description>

      <title>FORWARD: Dataset of a forwarder operating in rough terrain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present FORWARD, a high-resolution multimodal dataset of a cut-to-length forwarder operating in rough terrain on two harvest sites in the middle part of Sweden. The forwarder is a large Komatsu model equipped with vehicle telematics sensors, including global positioning via satellite navigation, movement sensors, accelerometers, and engine sensors. The vehicle was additionally equipped with cameras, operator vibration sensors, and multiple IMUs. The data includes event time logs recorded at 5 Hz of driving speed, fuel consumption, vehicle position with centimeter accuracy, and crane use while the vehicle operates in forest areas, aerially laser-scanned with a resolution of around 1500 points per square meter. Production log files (StanForD standard) with time-stamped machine events, extensive video material, and terrain data in various formats are included as well. About 18 hours of regular wood extraction work during three days is annotated from 360-video material into individual work elements and included in the dataset. We also include scenario specifications of conducted experiments on forest roads and in terrain. Scenarios include repeatedly driving the same routes with and without steel tracks, different load weights, and different target driving speeds. The dataset is intended for developing models and algorithms for trafficability, perception, and autonomous control of forest machines using artificial intelligence, simulation, and experiments on physical testbeds. In part, we focus on forwarders traversing terrain, avoiding or handling obstacles, and loading or unloading logs, with consideration for efficiency, fuel consumption, safety, and environmental impact. Other benefits of the open dataset include the ability to explore auto-generation and calibration of forestry machine simulators and automation scenario descriptions using the data recorded in the field.</description>
