      <title>MP-You: A Web-based MPI Simulation Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is an emerging imaging technique with many applications and a very active field of research. This app provides users with the opportunity to develop some intuition about the inner workings of MPI as it is being researched through NIST's Thermal MagIC project in an interactive and fun way. Users can vary different experimental and post-processing parameters to see how the image quality and particle reconstruction changes for different measurement conditions.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the RD50-MPW4 HV-CMOS pixel sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The RD50-MPW4 is the latest HV-CMOS pixel sensor from the CERN-RD50-CMOS working group, designed to evaluate the HV-CMOS technology in terms of spatial resolution, radiation hardness and timing performance. Fabricated by LFoundry using a 150nm process, it features an improved architecture to mitigate crosstalk, which has been an issue with the predecessor RD50-MPW3, allowing more sensitive threshold settings and full matrix operation. Enhancements include separated power domains for peripheral and in-pixel digital readout, a new backside-biasing step, and an improved guard ring structure supporting biasing up to 500V, significantly boosting radiation hardness. Laboratory measurements and test beam results presented in this paper show significant improvements over its predecessor regarding noise behavior, spatial resolution, and efficiency.</description>

      <title>An Inexpensive, Configurable Two-Tone Electron Spin Resonance Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron spin resonance (ESR) is a powerful tool for characterizing and manipulating spin systems, but commercial ESR spectrometers can be expensive and designed to work in narrow frequency bands. This work presents an inexpensive spectrometer that, when coupled with easy-to-design resonators, enables ESR over a broad frequency range, including at frequencies outside the standard bands. It can operate at either a single frequency or at two frequencies simultaneously. The spectrometer is built from off-the-shelf parts and controlled by a field programmable gate array (FPGA), and new capabilities can be easily added by reconfiguring the FPGA and adding or swapping components. We demonstrate the capabilities of the spectrometer using the molecular nanomagnet Cr$_7$Mn.</description>

      <title>SQUIDs for detection of potential dark matter candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) are extremely sensitive magnetic flux sensors which render them useful in a wide array of instrumentation. SQUIDs are often paired with other detectors as a readout mechanism to obtain quantitative insight. SQUIDs have impacted many fields but much less addressed is its impact on the field of fundamental physics, particularly in the search for dark matter. Dark matter is believed to make up around 27% of all mass-energy content of the universe and will provide critical insight into understanding large-scale structures of the universe. Axions and WIMPs are the prominent two dark matter candidates whose search has been fueled by the usage of SQUID read-outs.</description>

      <title>Performance of the Fully-equipped Spin Flip Chopper For Neutron Lifetime Experiment at J-PARC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To solve the ''neutron lifetime puzzle,'' where measured neutron lifetimes differ depending on the measurement methods, an experiment with pulsed neutron beam at J-PARC is in progress. In this experiment, neutrons are bunched into 40-cm lengths using a spin flip chopper (SFC), where the statistical sensitivity was limited by the aperture size of the SFC. The SFC comprises three sets of magnetic supermirrors and two resonant spin flippers. In this paper, we discuss an upgrade to enlarge the apertures of the SFC. With this upgrade, the statistics per unit time of the neutron lifetime experiment increased by a factor of 2.8, while maintaining a signal-to-noise ratio of 250-400 comparable to the previous one. Consequently, the time required to reach a precision of 1 s in the neutron lifetime experiment was reduced from 590 to 170 days, which is a significant reduction in time. This improvement in statistic will also contribute to the reduction of systematic uncertainties, such as background evaluation, fostering further advancements in the neutron lifetime experiments at J-PARC.</description>

      <title>A Novel Diamond-like Carbon based photocathode for PICOSEC Micromegas detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08712v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The PICOSEC Micromegas (MM) detector is a precise timing gaseous detector based on a MM detector operating in a two-stage amplification mode and a Cherenkov radiator. Prototypes equipped with cesium iodide (CsI) photocathodes have shown promising time resolutions as precise as 24 picoseconds (ps) for Minimum Ionizing Particles. However, due to the high hygroscopicity and susceptibility to ion bombardment of the CsI photocathodes, alternative photocathode materials are needed to improve the robustness of PICOSEC MM. Diamond-like Carbon (DLC) film have been introduced as a novel robust photocathode material, which have shown promising results. A batch of DLC photocathodes with different thicknesses were produced and evaluated using ultraviolet light. The quantum efficiency measurements indicate that the optimized thickness of the DLC photocathode is approximately 3 nm. Furthermore, DLC photocathodes show good resistance to ion bombardment in aging test compared to the CsI photocathode. Finally, a PICOSEC MM prototype equipped with DLC photocathodes was tested in muon beams. A time resolution of around 42 ps with a detection efficiency of 97% for 150 GeV/c muons were obtained. These results indicate the great potential of DLC as a photocathode for the PICOSEC MM detector.</description>
