      <title>Lexicase Selection Parameter Analysis: Varying Population Size and Test Case Redundancy with Diagnostic Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lexicase selection is a successful parent selection method in genetic programming that has outperformed other methods across multiple benchmark suites. Unlike other selection methods that require explicit parameters to function, such as tournament size in tournament selection, lexicase selection does not. However, if evolutionary parameters like population size and number of generations affect the effectiveness of a selection method, then lexicase's performance may also be impacted by these `hidden' parameters. Here, we study how these hidden parameters affect lexicase's ability to exploit gradients and maintain specialists using diagnostic metrics. By varying the population size with a fixed evaluation budget, we show that smaller populations tend to have greater exploitation capabilities, whereas larger populations tend to maintain more specialists. We also consider the effect redundant test cases have on specialist maintenance, and find that high redundancy may hinder the ability to optimize and maintain specialists, even for larger populations. Ultimately, we highlight that population size, evaluation budget, and test cases must be carefully considered for the characteristics of the problem being solved.</description>

      <title>Modified Bat Algorithm: A Newly Proposed Approach for Solving Complex and Real-World Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bat Algorithm (BA) is a nature-inspired metaheuristic search algorithm designed to efficiently explore complex problem spaces and find near-optimal solutions. The algorithm is inspired by the echolocation behavior of bats, which acts as a signal system to estimate the distance and hunt prey. Although the BA has proven effective for various optimization problems, it exhibits limited exploration ability and susceptibility to local optima. The algorithm updates velocities and positions based on the current global best solution, causing all agents to converge towards a specific location, potentially leading to local optima issues in optimization problems. On this premise, this paper proposes the Modified Bat Algorithm (MBA) as an enhancement to address the local optima limitation observed in the original BA. MBA incorporates the frequency and velocity of the current best solution, enhancing convergence speed to the optimal solution and preventing local optima entrapment. While the original BA faces diversity issues, both the original BA and MBA are introduced. To assess MBAs performance, three sets of test functions (classical benchmark functions, CEC2005, and CEC2019) are employed, with results compared to those of the original BA, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Dragonfly Algorithm (DA). The outcomes demonstrate the MBAs significant superiority over other algorithms. Additionally, MBA successfully addresses a real-world assignment problem (call center problem), traditionally solved using linear programming methods, with satisfactory results.</description>

      <title>A Pairwise Comparison Relation-assisted Multi-objective Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search Method with Multi-population Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) enables re-searchers to automatically explore vast search spaces and find efficient neural networks. But NAS suffers from a key bottleneck, i.e., numerous architectures need to be evaluated during the search process, which requires a lot of computing resources and time. In order to improve the efficiency of NAS, a series of methods have been proposed to reduce the evaluation time of neural architectures. However, they are not efficient enough and still only focus on the accuracy of architectures. In addition to the classification accuracy, more efficient and smaller network architectures are required in real-world applications. To address the above problems, we propose the SMEM-NAS, a pairwise com-parison relation-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on a multi-population mechanism. In the SMEM-NAS, a surrogate model is constructed based on pairwise compari-son relations to predict the accuracy ranking of architectures, rather than the absolute accuracy. Moreover, two populations cooperate with each other in the search process, i.e., a main population guides the evolution, while a vice population expands the diversity. Our method aims to provide high-performance models that take into account multiple optimization objectives. We conduct a series of experiments on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets to verify its effectiveness. With only a single GPU searching for 0.17 days, competitive architectures can be found by SMEM-NAS which achieves 78.91% accuracy with the MAdds of 570M on the ImageNet. This work makes a significant advance in the important field of NAS.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Mass Customization Manufacturing: Multiobjective Metaheuristic Algorithms for flow shop Production in Smart Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current landscape of massive production industries is undergoing significant transformations driven by emerging customer trends and new smart manufacturing technologies. One such change is the imperative to implement mass customization, wherein products are tailored to individual customer specifications while still ensuring cost efficiency through large-scale production processes. These shifts can profoundly impact various facets of the industry. This study focuses on the necessary adaptations in shop-floor production planning. Specifically, it proposes the use of efficient evolutionary algorithms to tackle the flowshop with missing operations, considering different optimization objectives: makespan, weighted total tardiness, and total completion time. An extensive computational experimentation is conducted across a range of realistic instances, encompassing varying numbers of jobs, operations, and probabilities of missing operations. The findings demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed approach and enable the identification of the most suitable evolutionary algorithms for addressing this problem. Additionally, the impact of the probability of missing operations on optimization objectives is discussed.</description>

      <title>Two new feature selection methods based on learn-heuristic techniques for breast cancer prediction: A comprehensive analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breast cancer is not preventable because of its unknown causes. However, its early diagnosis increases patients' recovery chances. Machine learning (ML) can be utilized to improve treatment outcomes in healthcare operations while diminishing costs and time. In this research, we suggest two novel feature selection (FS) methods based upon an imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) and a bat algorithm (BA) and their combination with ML algorithms. This study aims to enhance diagnostic models' efficiency and present a comprehensive analysis to help clinical physicians make much more precise and reliable decisions than before. K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, decision tree, Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, linear discriminant analysis, random forest, logistic regression, and artificial neural network are some of the methods employed. This paper applied a distinctive integration of evaluation measures and ML algorithms using the wrapper feature selection based on ICA (WFSIC) and BA (WFSB) separately. We compared two proposed approaches for the performance of the classifiers. Also, we compared our best diagnostic model with previous works reported in the literature survey. Experimentations were performed on the Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset. Results reveal that the proposed framework that uses the BA with an accuracy of 99.12\%, surpasses the framework using the ICA and most previous works. Additionally, the RF classifier in the approach of FS based on BA emerges as the best model and outperforms others regarding its criteria. Besides, the results illustrate the role of our techniques in reducing the dataset dimensions up to 90\% and increasing the performance of diagnostic models by over 99\%. Moreover, the result demonstrates that there are more critical features than the optimum dataset obtained by proposed FS approaches that have been selected by most ML models.</description>

      <title>Towards a "universal translator" for neural dynamics at single-cell, single-spike resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuroscience research has made immense progress over the last decade, but our understanding of the brain remains fragmented and piecemeal: the dream of probing an arbitrary brain region and automatically reading out the information encoded in its neural activity remains out of reach. In this work, we build towards a first foundation model for neural spiking data that can solve a diverse set of tasks across multiple brain areas. We introduce a novel self-supervised modeling approach for population activity in which the model alternates between masking out and reconstructing neural activity across different time steps, neurons, and brain regions. To evaluate our approach, we design unsupervised and supervised prediction tasks using the International Brain Laboratory repeated site dataset, which is comprised of Neuropixels recordings targeting the same brain locations across 48 animals and experimental sessions. The prediction tasks include single-neuron and region-level activity prediction, forward prediction, and behavior decoding. We demonstrate that our multi-task-masking (MtM) approach significantly improves the performance of current state-of-the-art population models and enables multi-task learning. We also show that by training on multiple animals, we can improve the generalization ability of the model to unseen animals, paving the way for a foundation model of the brain at single-cell, single-spike resolution.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Decision-Making Process in Reinforcement Learning with Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite tremendous progress, machine learning and deep learning still suffer from incomprehensible predictions. Incomprehensibility, however, is not an option for the use of (deep) reinforcement learning in the real world, as unpredictable actions can seriously harm the involved individuals. In this work, we propose a genetic programming framework to generate explanations for the decision-making process of already trained agents by imitating them with programs. Programs are interpretable and can be executed to generate explanations of why the agent chooses a particular action. Furthermore, we conduct an ablation study that investigates how extending the domain-specific language by using library learning alters the performance of the method. We compare our results with the previous state of the art for this problem and show that we are comparable in performance but require much less hardware resources and computation time.</description>

      <title>Inferring Ingrained Remote Information in AC Power Flows Using Neuromorphic Modality Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we infer ingrained remote information in AC power flows using spiking neural network (SNN) as edge processors for efficient coordination of power electronic converters. This work unifies power and information as a means of data normalization using a multi-modal regime in the form of spikes using energy-efficient neuromorphic processing and semantics theory. Firstly, we organize the synchronous realvalued measurements at each edge and translate them into asynchronous spike-based events to collect sparse data for training of SNN at each edge. Instead of relying on error-dependent supervised data-driven learning theory, we exploit the latency-driven unsupervised Hebbian learning rule to obtain modulation pulses for switching of power electronic converters that can now communicate among each other. Not only does this philosophy block exogenous path arrival for cyber attackers by dismissing the cyber layer, it also entails converter adaptation to system reconfiguration and parameter mismatch issues. We conclude this work by validating its energy-efficient and effective online learning performance under various scenarios in modified IEEE 14-bus system and under experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Variational Potential Flow: A Novel Probabilistic Framework for Energy-Based Generative Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy based models (EBMs) are appealing for their generality and simplicity in data likelihood modeling, but have conventionally been difficult to train due to the unstable and time-consuming implicit MCMC sampling during contrastive divergence training. In this paper, we present a novel energy-based generative framework, Variational Potential Flow (VAPO), that entirely dispenses with implicit MCMC sampling and does not rely on complementary latent models or cooperative training. The VAPO framework aims to learn a potential energy function whose gradient (flow) guides the prior samples, so that their density evolution closely follows an approximate data likelihood homotopy. An energy loss function is then formulated to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between density evolution of the flow-driven prior and the data likelihood homotopy. Images can be generated after training the potential energy, by initializing the samples from Gaussian prior and solving the ODE governing the potential flow on a fixed time interval using generic ODE solvers. Experiment results show that the proposed VAPO framework is capable of generating realistic images on various image datasets. In particular, our proposed framework achieves competitive FID scores for unconditional image generation on the CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets.</description>

      <title>Distance-based mutual congestion feature selection with genetic algorithm for high-dimensional medical datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature selection poses a challenge in small-sample high-dimensional datasets, where the number of features exceeds the number of observations, as seen in microarray, gene expression, and medical datasets. There isn't a universally optimal feature selection method applicable to any data distribution, and as a result, the literature consistently endeavors to address this issue. One recent approach in feature selection is termed frequency-based feature selection. However, existing methods in this domain tend to overlook feature values, focusing solely on the distribution in the response variable. In response, this paper introduces the Distance-based Mutual Congestion (DMC) as a filter method that considers both the feature values and the distribution of observations in the response variable. DMC sorts the features of datasets, and the top 5% are retained and clustered by KMeans to mitigate multicollinearity. This is achieved by randomly selecting one feature from each cluster. The selected features form the feature space, and the search space for the Genetic Algorithm with Adaptive Rates (GAwAR) will be approximated using this feature space. GAwAR approximates the combination of the top 10 features that maximizes prediction accuracy within a wrapper scheme. To prevent premature convergence, GAwAR adaptively updates the crossover and mutation rates. The hybrid DMC-GAwAR is applicable to binary classification datasets, and experimental results demonstrate its superiority over some recent works. The implementation and corresponding data are available at https://github.com/hnematzadeh/DMC-GAwAR</description>

      <title>GPU-accelerated Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization Using Tensorized RVEA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01159v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary multiobjective optimization has witnessed remarkable progress during the past decades. However, existing algorithms often encounter computational challenges in large-scale scenarios, primarily attributed to the absence of hardware acceleration. In response, we introduce a Tensorized Reference Vector Guided Evolutionary Algorithm (TensorRVEA) for harnessing the advancements of GPU acceleration. In TensorRVEA, the key data structures and operators are fully transformed into tensor forms for leveraging GPU-based parallel computing. In numerical benchmark tests involving large-scale populations and problem dimensions, TensorRVEA consistently demonstrates high computational performance, achieving up to over 1000$\times$ speedups. Then, we applied TensorRVEA to the domain of multiobjective neuroevolution for addressing complex challenges in robotic control tasks. Furthermore, we assessed TensorRVEA's extensibility by altering several tensorized reproduction operators. Experimental results demonstrate promising scalability and robustness of TensorRVEA.

      <title>The Platonic Representation Hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that representations in AI models, particularly deep networks, are converging. First, we survey many examples of convergence in the literature: over time and across multiple domains, the ways by which different neural networks represent data are becoming more aligned. Next, we demonstrate convergence across data modalities: as vision models and language models get larger, they measure distance between datapoints in a more and more alike way. We hypothesize that this convergence is driving toward a shared statistical model of reality, akin to Plato's concept of an ideal reality. We term such a representation the platonic representation and discuss several possible selective pressures toward it. Finally, we discuss the implications of these trends, their limitations, and counterexamples to our analysis.</description>

      <title>Predictive Coding Networks and Inference Learning: Tutorial and Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</description>
