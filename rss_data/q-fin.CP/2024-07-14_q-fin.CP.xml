      <title>Attribution Methods in Asset Pricing: Do They Account for Risk?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, machine learning models have been extremely successful. As a result of axiomatic attribution methods, feature contributions have been explained more clearly and rigorously. There are, however, few studies that have examined domain knowledge in conjunction with the axioms. In this study, we examine asset pricing in finance, a field closely related to risk management. Consequently, when applying machine learning models, we must ensure that the attribution methods reflect the underlying risks accurately. In this work, we present and study several axioms derived from asset pricing domain knowledge. It is shown that while Shapley value and Integrated Gradients preserve most axioms, neither can satisfy all axioms. Using extensive analytical and empirical examples, we demonstrate how attribution methods can reflect risks and when they should not be used.</description>

      <title>Internet sentiment exacerbates intraday overtrading, evidence from A-Share market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12001v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Market fluctuations caused by overtrading are important components of systemic market risk. This study examines the effect of investor sentiment on intraday overtrading activities in the Chinese A-share market. Employing high-frequency sentiment indices inferred from social media posts on the Eastmoney forum Guba, the research focuses on constituents of the CSI 300 and CSI 500 indices over a period from 01/01/2018, to 12/30/2022. The empirical analysis indicates that investor sentiment exerts a significantly positive impact on intraday overtrading, with the influence being more pronounced among institutional investors relative to individual traders. Moreover, sentiment-driven overtrading is found to be more prevalent during bull markets as opposed to bear markets. Additionally, the effect of sentiment on overtrading is observed to be more pronounced among individual investors in large-cap stocks compared to small- and mid-cap stocks.</description>
