      <title>Poincare Invariance in Discrete Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A formulation of discrete gravity was recently proposed based on defining a lattice and a shift operator connecting the cells. Spinors on such a space will have rotational SO(d) invariance which is taken as the fundamental symmetry. Inspired by lattice QCD, discrete analogues of curvature and torsion were defined that go smoothly to the corresponding tensors in the continuous limit. In this paper, we show that the absence of diffeomorphism invariance could be replaced by requiring translational invariance in the tangent space by enlarging the tangent space from SO(d) to the inhomogeneous Lorentz group ISO(d) to include translations. We obtain the ISO(d) symmetry by taking instead the Lie group SO(d + 1) and to perform on it Inonu-Wigner contraction. We show that, just as for continuous spaces, the zero torsion constraint converts the translational parameter to a diffeomorphism parameter, thus explaining the effectiveness of this formulation.</description>

      <title>Mass hierarchies in gauge theory with two index symmetric representation matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In gauge theories, the running of the anomalous dimension of a fermion bilinear operator is believed to lead to chiral symmetry breaking when gamma=1. Naively using perturbative results to judge when gamma=1 leads to the possibility of large dynamically generated mass hierarchies in models with both two index symmetric representation and fundamental representation fermions. In this paper we study a holographic model of this physics to predict the separation in scales in the meson spectrum. We study SU(Nc) theories at different Nc with one flavour of two index symmetric representation as a function of the number of fundamental fermion flavours NfF. The largest hierarchy we find is for Nc=7 and NfF=22 where the rho mesons made of the two different representations are separated in scale by a factor of 13. For general Nc the hierarchy can be made greater than 7 by tuning NfF. We display the hierarchy as a function of NfF and investigate the quark mass dependence. These predictions do depend on the extrapolation of gamma from the perturbative regime - even in a pessimistic scenario a distinct gap can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Critical properties of metallic and deconfined quantum critical points in Dirac systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use large-scale fermion quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study metallic and deconfined quantum phase transitions in a bilayer honeycomb model, focusing on their quantum critical and finite-temperature properties. At weak interaction, a fully symmetric Dirac semimetal state is realized. At intermediate and strong interaction, respectively, two long-range-ordered phases that break different symmetries are stabilized. The ordered phases feature partial and full, respectively, gap openings in the fermion spectrum. We clarify the symmetries of the different zero-temperature phases and the symmetry breaking patterns across the two quantum phase transitions between them. The first transition between the disordered and long-range-ordered semimetallic phases has previously been argued to be described by the $(2+1)$-dimensional Gross-Neveu-SO(3) field theory. By performing simulations with an improved symmetric Trotter decomposition, we further substantiate this claim by computing the critical exponents $1/\nu$, $\eta_\phi$, and $\eta_\psi$, which turn out to be consistent with the field-theoretical expectation within numerical and analytical uncertainties. The second transition between the two long-range-ordered phases has previously been proposed as a possible instance of a metallic deconfined quantum critical point. We further develop this scenario by analyzing the spectral functions in the single-particle, particle-hole, and particle-particle channels. Our results indicate gapless excitations with a unique velocity, supporting the emergence of Lorentz symmetry at criticality. We also determine the finite-temperature phase boundaries above the fully gapped state at large interaction, which smoothly vanish near the putative metallic deconfined quantum critical point, consistent with a continuous or weakly first-order transition.</description>

      <title>Sparsity dependence of Krylov state complexity in the SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Krylov state complexity of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model for $N \le 28$ Majorana fermions with $q$-body fermion interaction with $q=4,6,8$ for a range of sparse parameter $k$. Using the peak of the Krylov complexity as a probe, we find change in behavior as we vary $k$ for various $q$. We argue that this captures the change from holographic to non-holographic behavior in the sparse SYK-type models such that model is holographic for all $k \ge k_{\text{min}}$.</description>
