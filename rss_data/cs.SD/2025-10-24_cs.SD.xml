      <title>Vox-Evaluator: Enhancing Stability and Fidelity for Zero-shot TTS with A Multi-Level Evaluator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS), driven by language models, diffusion models and masked generation, have achieved impressive naturalness in speech synthesis. Nevertheless, stability and fidelity remain key challenges, manifesting as mispronunciations, audible noise, and quality degradation. To address these issues, we introduce Vox-Evaluator, a multi-level evaluator designed to guide the correction of erroneous speech segments and preference alignment for TTS systems. It is capable of identifying the temporal boundaries of erroneous segments and providing a holistic quality assessment of the generated speech. Specifically, to refine erroneous segments and enhance the robustness of the zero-shot TTS model, we propose to automatically identify acoustic errors with the evaluator, mask the erroneous segments, and finally regenerate speech conditioning on the correct portions. In addition, the fine-gained information obtained from Vox-Evaluator can guide the preference alignment for TTS model, thereby reducing the bad cases in speech synthesis. Due to the lack of suitable training datasets for the Vox-Evaluator, we also constructed a synthesized text-speech dataset annotated with fine-grained pronunciation errors or audio quality issues. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Vox-Evaluator in enhancing the stability and fidelity of TTS systems through the speech correction mechanism and preference optimization. The demos are shown.</description>

      <title>UniSE: A Unified Framework for Decoder-only Autoregressive LM-based Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of neural audio codecs (NACs) has largely promoted applications of language models (LMs) to speech processing and understanding. However, there lacks the verification on the effectiveness of autoregressive (AR) LMbased models in unifying different sub-tasks of speech enhancement (SE). In this work, we propose UniSE, a unified decoder-only LM-based framework to handle different SE tasks including speech restoration, target speaker extraction and speech separation. It takes input speech features as conditions and generates discrete tokens of the target speech using AR modeling, which facilitates a compatibility between distinct learning patterns of multiple tasks. Experiments on several benchmarks indicate the proposed UniSE can achieve competitive performance compared to discriminative and generative baselines, showing the capacity of LMs in unifying SE tasks. The demo page is available here: https://github.com/hyyan2k/UniSE.</description>

      <title>Speaking Clearly: A Simplified Whisper-Based Codec for Low-Bitrate Speech Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech codecs serve as bridges between continuous speech signals and large language models, yet face an inherent conflict between acoustic fidelity and semantic preservation. To mitigate this conflict, prevailing methods augment acoustic codecs with complex semantic supervision. We explore the opposite direction: a semantic-first approach that starts from a semantically-capable model and adapts it for high-fidelity acoustic reconstruction. Through empirical analysis, we discover that targeted architectural simplification can unlock the acoustic modeling potential of Whisper, a text-aligned Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model. Based on this finding, we propose SimWhisper-Codec, a novel codec that balances the semantic and acoustic preservation by leveraging a frozen, simplified Whisper encoder without requiring external supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that SimWhisper-Codec achieves superior performance in both semantic preservation and acoustic quality compared to semantically-supervised codecs such as Mimi Codec and SpeechTokenizer at similar bitrates, validating the effectiveness of our semantic-first approach. Code is available at https://github.com/ZhangXinWhut/SimWhisper-Codec.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Ear: A Framework for Objectifying Expressiveness from Human Preference Through Efficient Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent speech-to-speech (S2S) models generate intelligible speech but still lack natural expressiveness, largely due to the absence of a reliable evaluation metric. Existing approaches, such as subjective MOS ratings, low-level acoustic features, and emotion recognition are costly, limited, or incomplete. To address this, we present DeEAR (Decoding the Expressive Preference of eAR), a framework that converts human preference for speech expressiveness into an objective score. Grounded in phonetics and psychology, DeEAR evaluates speech across three dimensions: Emotion, Prosody, and Spontaneity, achieving strong alignment with human perception (Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient, SRCC = 0.86) using fewer than 500 annotated samples. Beyond reliable scoring, DeEAR enables fair benchmarking and targeted data curation. It not only distinguishes expressiveness gaps across S2S models but also selects 14K expressive utterances to form ExpressiveSpeech, which improves the expressive score (from 2.0 to 23.4 on a 100-point scale) of S2S models. Demos and codes are available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/ExpressiveSpeech</description>

      <title>Resounding Acoustic Fields with Reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving immersive auditory experiences in virtual environments requires flexible sound modeling that supports dynamic source positions. In this paper, we introduce a task called resounding, which aims to estimate room impulse responses at arbitrary emitter location from a sparse set of measured emitter positions, analogous to the relighting problem in vision. We leverage the reciprocity property and introduce Versa, a physics-inspired approach to facilitating acoustic field learning. Our method creates physically valid samples with dense virtual emitter positions by exchanging emitter and listener poses. We also identify challenges in deploying reciprocity due to emitter/listener gain patterns and propose a self-supervised learning approach to address them. Results show that Versa substantially improve the performance of acoustic field learning on both simulated and real-world datasets across different metrics. Perceptual user studies show that Versa can greatly improve the immersive spatial sound experience. Code, dataset and demo videos are available on the project website: https://waves.seas.upenn.edu/projects/versa.</description>

      <title>R2-SVC: Towards Real-World Robust and Expressive Zero-shot Singing Voice Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-world singing voice conversion (SVC) applications, environmental noise and the demand for expressive output pose significant challenges. Conventional methods, however, are typically designed without accounting for real deployment scenarios, as both training and inference usually rely on clean data. This mismatch hinders practical use, given the inevitable presence of diverse noise sources and artifacts from music separation. To tackle these issues, we propose R2-SVC, a robust and expressive SVC framework. First, we introduce simulation-based robustness enhancement through random fundamental frequency ($F_0$) perturbations and music separation artifact simulations (e.g., reverberation, echo), substantially improving performance under noisy conditions. Second, we enrich speaker representation using domain-specific singing data: alongside clean vocals, we incorporate DNSMOS-filtered separated vocals and public singing corpora, enabling the model to preserve speaker timbre while capturing singing style nuances. Third, we integrate the Neural Source-Filter (NSF) model to explicitly represent harmonic and noise components, enhancing the naturalness and controllability of converted singing. R2-SVC achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple SVC benchmarks under both clean and noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>Controllable Embedding Transformation for Mood-Guided Music Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music representations are the backbone of modern recommendation systems, powering playlist generation, similarity search, and personalized discovery. Yet most embeddings offer little control for adjusting a single musical attribute, e.g., changing only the mood of a track while preserving its genre or instrumentation. In this work, we address the problem of controllable music retrieval through embedding-based transformation, where the objective is to retrieve songs that remain similar to a seed track but are modified along one chosen dimension. We propose a novel framework for mood-guided music embedding transformation, which learns a mapping from a seed audio embedding to a target embedding guided by mood labels, while preserving other musical attributes. Because mood cannot be directly altered in the seed audio, we introduce a sampling mechanism that retrieves proxy targets to balance diversity with similarity to the seed. We train a lightweight translation model using this sampling strategy and introduce a novel joint objective that encourages transformation and information preservation. Extensive experiments on two datasets show strong mood transformation performance while retaining genre and instrumentation far better than training-free baselines, establishing controllable embedding transformation as a promising paradigm for personalized music retrieval.</description>

      <title>SpeechAgent: An End-to-End Mobile Infrastructure for Speech Impairment Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech is essential for human communication, yet millions of people face impairments such as dysarthria, stuttering, and aphasia conditions that often lead to social isolation and reduced participation. Despite recent progress in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies, accessible web and mobile infrastructures for users with impaired speech remain limited, hindering the practical adoption of these advances in daily communication. To bridge this gap, we present SpeechAgent, a mobile SpeechAgent designed to facilitate people with speech impairments in everyday communication. The system integrates large language model (LLM)- driven reasoning with advanced speech processing modules, providing adaptive support tailored to diverse impairment types. To ensure real-world practicality, we develop a structured deployment pipeline that enables real-time speech processing on mobile and edge devices, achieving imperceptible latency while maintaining high accuracy and speech quality. Evaluation on real-world impaired speech datasets and edge-device latency profiling confirms that SpeechAgent delivers both effective and user-friendly performance, demonstrating its feasibility for personalized, day-to-day assistive communication.</description>

      <title>From Generation to Attribution: Music AI Agent Architectures for the Post-Streaming Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping music creation, but its rapid growth exposes structural gaps in attribution, rights management, and economic models. Unlike past media shifts, from live performance to recordings, downloads, and streaming, AI transforms the entire lifecycle of music, collapsing boundaries between creation, distribution, and monetization. However, existing streaming systems, with opaque and concentrated royalty flows, are ill-equipped to handle the scale and complexity of AI-driven production. We propose a content-based Music AI Agent architecture that embeds attribution directly into the creative workflow through block-level retrieval and agentic orchestration. Designed for iterative, session-based interaction, the system organizes music into granular components (Blocks) stored in BlockDB; each use triggers an Attribution Layer event for transparent provenance and real-time settlement. This framework reframes AI from a generative tool into infrastructure for a Fair AI Media Platform. By enabling fine-grained attribution, equitable compensation, and participatory engagement, it points toward a post-streaming paradigm where music functions not as a static catalog but as a collaborative and adaptive ecosystem.</description>

      <title>LeVo: High-Quality Song Generation with Multi-Preference Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and audio language models have significantly improved music generation, particularly in lyrics-to-song generation. However, existing approaches still struggle with the complex composition of songs and the scarcity of high-quality data, leading to limitations in audio quality, musicality, instruction following, and vocal-instrument harmony. To address these challenges, we introduce LeVo, a language model based framework consisting of LeLM and Music Codec. LeLM is capable of parallel modeling of two types of tokens: mixed tokens, which represent the combined audio of vocals and accompaniment to achieve better vocal-instrument harmony, and dual-track tokens, which separately encode vocals and accompaniment for high-quality song generation. It employs two decoder-only transformers and a modular extension training strategy to prevent interference between different token types. To further enhance musicality and instruction following ability, we introduce a multi-preference alignment method based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This method handles diverse human preferences through a semi-automatic data construction process and post-training. Experimental results demonstrate that LeVo significantly outperforms existing open-source methods in both objective and subjective metrics, while performing competitively with industry systems. Ablation studies further justify the effectiveness of our designs. Audio examples and source code are available at https://levo-demo.github.io and https://github.com/tencent-ailab/songgeneration.</description>

      <title>LAMA-UT: Language Agnostic Multilingual ASR through Orthography Unification and Language-Specific Transliteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15299v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building a universal multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model that performs equitably across languages has long been a challenge due to its inherent difficulties. To address this task we introduce a Language-Agnostic Multilingual ASR pipeline through orthography Unification and language-specific Transliteration (LAMA-UT). LAMA-UT operates without any language-specific modules while matching the performance of state-of-the-art models trained on a minimal amount of data. Our pipeline consists of two key steps. First, we utilize a universal transcription generator to unify orthographic features into Romanized form and capture common phonetic characteristics across diverse languages. Second, we utilize a universal converter to transform these universal transcriptions into language-specific ones. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method leveraging universal transcriptions for massively multilingual ASR. Our pipeline achieves a relative error reduction rate of 45% when compared to Whisper and performs comparably to MMS, despite being trained on only 0.1% of Whisper's training data. Furthermore, our pipeline does not rely on any language-specific modules. However, it performs on par with zero-shot ASR approaches which utilize additional language-specific lexicons and language models. We expect this framework to serve as a cornerstone for flexible multilingual ASR systems that are generalizable even to unseen languages.</description>

      <title>Shallow Flow Matching for Coarse-to-Fine Text-to-Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Shallow Flow Matching (SFM), a novel mechanism that enhances flow matching (FM)-based text-to-speech (TTS) models within a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm. Unlike conventional FM modules, which use the coarse representations from the weak generator as conditions, SFM constructs intermediate states along the FM paths from these representations. During training, we introduce an orthogonal projection method to adaptively determine the temporal position of these states, and apply a principled construction strategy based on a single-segment piecewise flow. The SFM inference starts from the intermediate state rather than pure noise, thereby focusing computation on the latter stages of the FM paths. We integrate SFM into multiple TTS models with a lightweight SFM head. Experiments demonstrate that SFM yields consistent gains in speech naturalness across both objective and subjective evaluations, and significantly accelerates inference when using adaptive-step ODE solvers. Demo and codes are available at https://ydqmkkx.github.io/SFMDemo/.</description>

      <title>MCIF: Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction-Following Benchmark from Scientific Talks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have catalyzed the development of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that integrate text, speech, and vision within unified frameworks. As MLLMs evolve from narrow, monolingual, task-specific systems to general-purpose instruction-following models, a key frontier lies in evaluating their multilingual and multimodal capabilities over both long and short contexts. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these dimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on one single modality at a time, rely on short-form contexts, or lack human annotations -- hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across languages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce MCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first multilingual human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks that is designed to evaluate instruction-following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over both short- and long-form inputs. MCIF spans three core modalities -- speech, vision, and text -- and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and Chinese), enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret instructions across languages and combine them with multimodal contextual information. MCIF is released under a CC-BY 4.0 license to encourage open research and progress in MLLMs development.</description>

      <title>MLMA: Towards Multilingual ASR With Mamba-based Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains a challenging task, especially when balancing performance across high- and low-resource languages. Recent advances in sequence modeling suggest that architectures beyond Transformers may offer better scalability and efficiency. In this work, we introduce MLMA (Multilingual Language Modeling with Mamba for ASR), a new approach that leverages the Mamba architecture -- an efficient state-space model optimized for long-context sequence processing -- for multilingual ASR. Using Mamba, MLMA implicitly incorporates language-aware conditioning and shared representations to support robust recognition across diverse languages. Experiments on standard multilingual benchmarks show that MLMA achieves competitive performance compared to Transformer-based architectures. These results highlight Mamba's potential as a strong backbone for scalable, efficient, and accurate multilingual speech recognition.</description>
