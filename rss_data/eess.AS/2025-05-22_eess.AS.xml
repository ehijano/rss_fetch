      <title>ASVspoof2019 vs. ASVspoof5: Assessment and Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ASVspoof challenges are designed to advance the understanding of spoofing speech attacks and encourage the development of robust countermeasure systems. These challenges provide a standardized database for assessing and comparing spoofing-robust automatic speaker verification solutions. The ASVspoof5 challenge introduces a shift in database conditions compared to ASVspoof2019. While ASVspoof2019 has mismatched conditions only in spoofing attacks in the evaluation set, ASVspoof5 incorporates mismatches in both bona fide and spoofed speech statistics. This paper examines the impact of these mismatches, presenting qualitative and quantitative comparisons within and between the two databases. We show the increased difficulty for genuine and spoofed speech and demonstrate that in ASVspoof5, not only are the attacks more challenging, but the genuine speech also shifts toward spoofed speech compared to ASVspoof2019.</description>

      <title>Towards Holistic Evaluation of Large Audio-Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With advancements in large audio-language models (LALMs), which enhance large language models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities, these models are expected to demonstrate universal proficiency across various auditory tasks. While numerous benchmarks have emerged to assess LALMs' performance, they remain fragmented and lack a structured taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive survey and propose a systematic taxonomy for LALM evaluations, categorizing them into four dimensions based on their objectives: (1) General Auditory Awareness and Processing, (2) Knowledge and Reasoning, (3) Dialogue-oriented Ability, and (4) Fairness, Safety, and Trustworthiness. We provide detailed overviews within each category and highlight challenges in this field, offering insights into promising future directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey specifically focused on the evaluations of LALMs, providing clear guidelines for the community. We will release the collection of the surveyed papers and actively maintain it to support ongoing advancements in the field.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Impact of Accent on English Speech: Acoustic and Articulatory Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in AI-driven speech-based applications have transformed diverse industries ranging from healthcare to customer service. However, the increasing prevalence of non-native accented speech in global interactions poses significant challenges for speech-processing systems, which are often trained on datasets dominated by native speech. This study investigates accented English speech through articulatory and acoustic analysis, identifying simpler coordination patterns and higher average pitch than native speech. Using eigenspectra and Vocal Tract Variable-based coordination features, we establish an efficient method for quantifying accent strength without relying on resource-intensive phonetic transcriptions. Our findings provide a new avenue for research on the impacts of accents on speech intelligibility and offer insights for developing inclusive, robust speech processing systems that accommodate diverse linguistic communities.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Biomarkers for Schizophrenia: Towards Individual Symptom Severity Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies on schizophrenia assessments using deep learning typically treat it as a classification task to detect the presence or absence of the disorder, oversimplifying the condition and reducing its clinical applicability. This traditional approach overlooks the complexity of schizophrenia, limiting its practical value in healthcare settings. This study shifts the focus to individual symptom severity estimation using a multimodal approach that integrates speech, video, and text inputs. We develop unimodal models for each modality and a multimodal framework to improve accuracy and robustness. By capturing a more detailed symptom profile, this approach can help in enhancing diagnostic precision and support personalized treatment, offering a scalable and objective tool for mental health assessment.</description>

      <title>AudioMorphix: Training-free audio editing with diffusion probabilistic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Editing sound with precision is a crucial yet underexplored challenge in audio content creation. While existing works can manipulate sounds by text instructions or audio exemplar pairs, they often struggled to modify audio content precisely while preserving fidelity to the original recording. In this work, we introduce a novel editing approach that enables localized modifications to specific time-frequency regions while keeping the remaining of the audio intact by operating on spectrograms directly. To achieve this, we propose AudioMorphix, a training-free audio editor that manipulates a target region on the spectrogram by referring to another recording. Inspired by morphing theory, we conceptualize audio mixing as a process where different sounds blend seamlessly through morphing and can be decomposed back into individual components via demorphing. Our AudioMorphix optimizes the noised latent conditioned on raw input and reference audio while rectifying the guided diffusion process through a series of energy functions. Additionally, we enhance self-attention layers with a cache mechanism to preserve detailed characteristics from the original recordings. To advance audio editing research, we devise a new evaluation benchmark, which includes a curated dataset with a variety of editing instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AudioMorphix yields promising performance on various audio editing tasks, including addition, removal, time shifting and stretching, and pitch shifting, achieving high fidelity and precision. Demo and code are available at this url.</description>

      <title>Meta-PerSER: Few-Shot Listener Personalized Speech Emotion Recognition via Meta-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Meta-PerSER, a novel meta-learning framework that personalizes Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) by adapting to each listener's unique way of interpreting emotion. Conventional SER systems rely on aggregated annotations, which often overlook individual subtleties and lead to inconsistent predictions. In contrast, Meta-PerSER leverages a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) approach enhanced with Combined-Set Meta-Training, Derivative Annealing, and per-layer per-step learning rates, enabling rapid adaptation with only a few labeled examples. By integrating robust representations from pre-trained self-supervised models, our framework first captures general emotional cues and then fine-tunes itself to personal annotation styles. Experiments on the IEMOCAP corpus demonstrate that Meta-PerSER significantly outperforms baseline methods in both seen and unseen data scenarios, highlighting its promise for personalized emotion recognition.</description>

      <title>Dysfluent WFST: A Framework for Zero-Shot Speech Dysfluency Transcription and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic detection of speech dysfluency aids speech-language pathologists in efficient transcription of disordered speech, enhancing diagnostics and treatment planning. Traditional methods, often limited to classification, provide insufficient clinical insight, and text-independent models misclassify dysfluency, especially in context-dependent cases. This work introduces Dysfluent-WFST, a zero-shot decoder that simultaneously transcribes phonemes and detects dysfluency. Unlike previous models, Dysfluent-WFST operates with upstream encoders like WavLM and requires no additional training. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in both phonetic error rate and dysfluency detection on simulated and real speech data. Our approach is lightweight, interpretable, and effective, demonstrating that explicit modeling of pronunciation behavior in decoding, rather than complex architectures, is key to improving dysfluency processing systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Channel Sequence-to-Sequence Neural Diarization: Experimental Results for The MISP 2025 Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the speaker diarization system developed for the Multimodal Information-Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2025 Challenge. First, we utilize the Sequence-to-Sequence Neural Diarization (S2SND) framework to generate initial predictions using single-channel audio. Then, we extend the original S2SND framework to create a new version, Multi-Channel Sequence-to-Sequence Neural Diarization (MC-S2SND), which refines the initial results using multi-channel audio. The final system achieves a diarization error rate (DER) of 8.09% on the evaluation set of the competition database, ranking first place in the speaker diarization task of the MISP 2025 Challenge.</description>

      <title>UBGAN: Enhancing Coded Speech with Blind and Guided Bandwidth Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practical application of speech codecs, a multitude of factors such as the quality of the radio connection, limiting hardware or required user experience necessitate trade-offs between achievable perceptual quality, engendered bitrate and computational complexity. Most conventional and neural speech codecs operate on wideband (WB) speech signals to achieve this compromise. To further enhance the perceptual quality of coded speech, bandwidth extension (BWE) of the transmitted speech is an attractive and popular technique in conventional speech coding. In contrast, neural speech codecs are typically trained end-to-end to a specific set of requirements and are often not easily adaptable. In particular, they are typically trained to operate at a single fixed sampling rate. With the Universal Bandwidth Extension Generative Adversarial Network (UBGAN), we propose a modular and lightweight GAN-based solution that increases the operational flexibility of a wide range of conventional and neural codecs. Our model operates in the subband domain and extends the bandwidth of WB signals from 8 kHz to 16 kHz, resulting in super-wideband (SWB) signals. We further introduce two variants, guided-UBGAN and blind-UBGAN, where the guided version transmits quantized learned representation as a side information at a very low bitrate additional to the bitrate of the codec, while blind-BWE operates without such side-information. Our subjective assessments demonstrate the advantage of UBGAN applied to WB codecs and highlight the generalization capacity of our proposed method across multiple codecs and bitrates.</description>

      <title>HPP-Voice: A Large-Scale Evaluation of Speech Embeddings for Multi-Phenotypic Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human speech contains paralinguistic cues that reflect a speaker's physiological and neurological state, potentially enabling non-invasive detection of various medical phenotypes. We introduce the Human Phenotype Project Voice corpus (HPP-Voice): a dataset of 7,188 recordings in which Hebrew-speaking adults count for 30 seconds, with each speaker linked to up to 15 potentially voice-related phenotypes spanning respiratory, sleep, mental health, metabolic, immune, and neurological conditions. We present a systematic comparison of 14 modern speech embedding models, where modern speech embeddings from these 30-second counting tasks outperform MFCCs and demographics for downstream health condition classifications. We found that embedding learned from a speaker identification model can predict objectively measured moderate to severe sleep apnea in males with an AUC of 0.64 $\pm$ 0.03, while MFCC and demographic features led to AUCs of 0.56 $\pm$ 0.02 and 0.57 $\pm$ 0.02, respectively. Additionally, our results reveal gender-specific patterns in model effectiveness across different medical domains. For males, speaker identification and diarization models consistently outperformed speech foundation models for respiratory conditions (e.g., asthma: 0.61 $\pm$ 0.03 vs. 0.56 $\pm$ 0.02) and sleep-related conditions (insomnia: 0.65 $\pm$ 0.04 vs. 0.59 $\pm$ 0.05). For females, speaker diarization models performed best for smoking status (0.61 $\pm$ 0.02 vs 0.55 $\pm$ 0.02), while Hebrew-specific models performed best (0.59 $\pm$ 0.02 vs. 0.58 $\pm$ 0.02) in classifying anxiety compared to speech foundation models. Our findings provide evidence that a simple counting task can support large-scale, multi-phenotypic voice screening and highlight which embedding families generalize best to specific conditions, insights that can guide future vocal biomarker research and clinical deployment.</description>

      <title>Attractor-Based Speech Separation of Multiple Utterances by Unknown Number of Speakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of single-channel speech separation, where the number of speakers is unknown, and each speaker may speak multiple utterances. We propose a speech separation model that simultaneously performs separation, dynamically estimates the number of speakers, and detects individual speaker activities by integrating an attractor module. The proposed system outperforms existing methods by introducing an attractor-based architecture that effectively combines local and global temporal modeling for multi-utterance scenarios. To evaluate the method in reverberant and noisy conditions, a multi-speaker multi-utterance dataset was synthesized by combining Librispeech speech signals with WHAM! noise signals. The results demonstrate that the proposed system accurately estimates the number of sources. The system effectively detects source activities and separates the corresponding utterances into correct outputs in both known and unknown source count scenarios.</description>

      <title>Performance of Objective Speech Quality Metrics on Languages Beyond Validation Data: A Study of Turkish and Korean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective speech quality measures are widely used to assess the performance of video conferencing platforms and telecommunication systems. They predict human-rated speech quality and are crucial for assessing the systems quality of experience. Despite the widespread use, the quality measures are developed on a limited set of languages. This can be problematic since the performance on unseen languages is consequently not guaranteed or even studied. Here we raise awareness to this issue by investigating the performance of two objective speech quality measures (PESQ and ViSQOL) on Turkish and Korean. Using English as baseline, we show that Turkish samples have significantly higher ViSQOL scores and that for Turkish male speakers the correlation between PESQ and ViSQOL is highest. These results highlight the need to explore biases across metrics and to develop a labeled speech quality dataset with a variety of languages.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Deep Metric Learning for Cross-Modal Audio-Text Alignment in Open-Vocabulary Keyword Spotting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For text enrollment-based open-vocabulary keyword spotting (KWS), acoustic and text embeddings are typically compared at either the phoneme or utterance level. To facilitate this, we optimize acoustic and text encoders using deep metric learning (DML), enabling direct comparison of multi-modal embeddings in a shared embedding space. However, the inherent heterogeneity between audio and text modalities presents a significant challenge. To address this, we propose Modality Adversarial Learning (MAL), which reduces the domain gap in heterogeneous modality representations. Specifically, we train a modality classifier adversarially to encourage both encoders to generate modality-invariant embeddings. Additionally, we apply DML to achieve phoneme-level alignment between audio and text, and conduct comprehensive comparisons across various DML objectives. Experiments on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and LibriPhrase datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>SEED: Speaker Embedding Enhancement Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A primary challenge when deploying speaker recognition systems in real-world applications is performance degradation caused by environmental mismatch. We propose a diffusion-based method that takes speaker embeddings extracted from a pre-trained speaker recognition model and generates refined embeddings. For training, our approach progressively adds Gaussian noise to both clean and noisy speaker embeddings extracted from clean and noisy speech, respectively, via forward process of a diffusion model, and then reconstructs them to clean embeddings in the reverse process. While inferencing, all embeddings are regenerated via diffusion process. Our method needs neither speaker label nor any modification to the existing speaker recognition pipeline. Experiments on evaluation sets simulating environment mismatch scenarios show that our method can improve recognition accuracy by up to 19.6% over baseline models while retaining performance on conventional scenarios. We publish our code here https://github.com/kaistmm/seed-pytorch</description>

      <title>Unlocking Temporal Flexibility: Neural Speech Codec with Variable Frame Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most neural speech codecs achieve bitrate adjustment through intra-frame mechanisms, such as codebook dropout, at a Constant Frame Rate (CFR). However, speech segments inherently have time-varying information density (e.g., silent intervals versus voiced regions). This property makes CFR not optimal in terms of bitrate and token sequence length, hindering efficiency in real-time applications. In this work, we propose a Temporally Flexible Coding (TFC) technique, introducing variable frame rate (VFR) into neural speech codecs for the first time. TFC enables seamlessly tunable average frame rates and dynamically allocates frame rates based on temporal entropy. Experimental results show that a codec with TFC achieves optimal reconstruction quality with high flexibility, and maintains competitive performance even at lower frame rates. Our approach is promising for the integration with other efforts to develop low-frame-rate neural speech codecs for more efficient downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Active Speech Enhancement: Active Speech Denoising Decliping and Deveraberation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for active sound modification: Active Speech Enhancement (ASE). While Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) algorithms focus on suppressing external interference, ASE goes further by actively shaping the speech signal -- both attenuating unwanted noise components and amplifying speech-relevant frequencies -- to improve intelligibility and perceptual quality. To enable this, we propose a novel Transformer-Mamba-based architecture, along with a task-specific loss function designed to jointly optimize interference suppression and signal enrichment. Our method outperforms existing baselines across multiple speech processing tasks -- including denoising, dereverberation, and declipping -- demonstrating the effectiveness of active, targeted modulation in challenging acoustic environments.</description>

      <title>A Novel Deep Learning Framework for Efficient Multichannel Acoustic Feedback Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a deep-learning framework for controlling multichannel acoustic feedback in audio devices. Traditional digital signal processing methods struggle with convergence when dealing with highly correlated noise such as feedback. We introduce a Convolutional Recurrent Network that efficiently combines spatial and temporal processing, significantly enhancing speech enhancement capabilities with lower computational demands. Our approach utilizes three training methods: In-a-Loop Training, Teacher Forcing, and a Hybrid strategy with a Multichannel Wiener Filter, optimizing performance in complex acoustic environments. This scalable framework offers a robust solution for real-world applications, making significant advances in Acoustic Feedback Control technology.</description>

      <title>Source Separation by Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of single-channel audio source separation with the goal of reconstructing $K$ sources from their mixture. We address this ill-posed problem with FLOSS (FLOw matching for Source Separation), a constrained generation method based on flow matching, ensuring strict mixture consistency. Flow matching is a general methodology that, when given samples from two probability distributions defined on the same space, learns an ordinary differential equation to output a sample from one of the distributions when provided with a sample from the other. In our context, we have access to samples from the joint distribution of $K$ sources and so the corresponding samples from the lower-dimensional distribution of their mixture. To apply flow matching, we augment these mixture samples with artificial noise components to ensure the resulting "augmented" distribution matches the dimensionality of the $K$ source distribution. Additionally, as any permutation of the sources yields the same mixture, we adopt an equivariant formulation of flow matching which relies on a suitable custom-designed neural network architecture. We demonstrate the performance of the method for the separation of overlapping speech.</description>

      <title>Selective Invocation for Multilingual ASR: A Cost-effective Approach Adapting to Speech Recognition Difficulty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have significantly advanced, enabling a single model to handle multiple languages, inherent linguistic differences and data imbalances challenge SOTA performance across all languages. While language identification (LID) models can route speech to the appropriate ASR model, they incur high costs from invoking SOTA commercial models and suffer from inaccuracies due to misclassification. To overcome these, we propose SIMA, a selective invocation for multilingual ASR that adapts to the difficulty level of the input speech. Built on a spoken large language model (SLLM), SIMA evaluates whether the input is simple enough for direct transcription or requires the invocation of a SOTA ASR model. Our approach reduces word error rates by 18.7% compared to the SLLM and halves invocation costs compared to LID-based methods. Tests on three datasets show that SIMA is a scalable, cost-effective solution for multilingual ASR applications.</description>

      <title>Discrete Tokens Exhibit Interlanguage Speech Intelligibility Benefit: an Analytical Study Towards Accent-robust ASR Only with Native Speech Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we gained insight that contributes to achieving accent-robust ASR using only native speech data. In human perception of non-native speech, the phenomenon known as "interlanguage speech intelligibility benefit" (ISIB) is observed, where non-native listeners who share the native language with the speaker understand the speech better compared even to native listeners. Based on the idea that discrete tokens extracted from self-supervised learning (SSL) models represent the human perception of speech, we conducted an analytical study on the robustness of discrete token-based ASR to non-native speech, varying the language used for training the tokenization, which is viewed as a technical implementation of ISIB. The results showed that ISIB actually occurred in the discrete token-based ASR. Since our approach relies only on native speech data to simulate the behavior of human perception, it is expected to be applicable to a wide range of accents for which speech data is scarce.</description>

      <title>Prosodically Enhanced Foreign Accent Simulation by Discrete Token-based Resynthesis Only with Native Speech Corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a method for synthesizing foreign-accented speech only with native speech data using discrete tokens obtained from self-supervised learning (SSL) models was proposed. Considering limited availability of accented speech data, this method is expected to make it much easier to simulate foreign accents. By using the synthesized accented speech as listening materials for humans or training data for automatic speech recognition (ASR), both of them will acquire higher robustness against foreign accents. However, the previous method has a fatal flaw that it cannot reproduce duration-related accents. Durational accents are commonly seen when L2 speakers, whose native language has syllable-timed or mora-timed rhythm, speak stress-timed languages, such as English. In this paper, we integrate duration modification to the previous method to simulate foreign accents more accurately. Experiments show that the proposed method successfully replicates durational accents seen in real L2 speech.</description>

      <title>SpecMaskFoley: Steering Pretrained Spectral Masked Generative Transformer Toward Synchronized Video-to-audio Synthesis via ControlNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foley synthesis aims to synthesize high-quality audio that is both semantically and temporally aligned with video frames. Given its broad application in creative industries, the task has gained increasing attention in the research community. To avoid the non-trivial task of training audio generative models from scratch, adapting pretrained audio generative models for video-synchronized foley synthesis presents an attractive direction. ControlNet, a method for adding fine-grained controls to pretrained generative models, has been applied to foley synthesis, but its use has been limited to handcrafted human-readable temporal conditions. In contrast, from-scratch models achieved success by leveraging high-dimensional deep features extracted using pretrained video encoders. We have observed a performance gap between ControlNet-based and from-scratch foley models. To narrow this gap, we propose SpecMaskFoley, a method that steers the pretrained SpecMaskGIT model toward video-synchronized foley synthesis via ControlNet. To unlock the potential of a single ControlNet branch, we resolve the discrepancy between the temporal video features and the time-frequency nature of the pretrained SpecMaskGIT via a frequency-aware temporal feature aligner, eliminating the need for complicated conditioning mechanisms widely used in prior arts. Evaluations on a common foley synthesis benchmark demonstrate that SpecMaskFoley could even outperform strong from-scratch baselines, substantially advancing the development of ControlNet-based foley synthesis models.

      <title>Differentiable K-means for Fully-optimized Discrete Token-based ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of discrete tokens derived from self-supervised learning (SSL) models for various speech-related tasks. These tokens serve not only as substitutes for text in language modeling but also as intermediate representations for tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, discrete tokens are typically obtained via k-means clustering of SSL features independently of downstream tasks, making them suboptimal for specific applications. This paper proposes the use of differentiable k-means, enabling the joint optimization of tokenization and downstream tasks. This approach enables the fine-tuning of the SSL parameters and learning weights for outputs from multiple SSL layers. Experiments were conducted with ASR as a downstream task. ASR accuracy successfully improved owing to the optimized tokens. The acquired tokens also exhibited greater purity of phonetic information, which were found to be useful even in speech resynthesis.</description>

      <title>AudioTrust: Benchmarking the Multifaceted Trustworthiness of Audio Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement and expanding applications of Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) demand a rigorous understanding of their trustworthiness. However, systematic research on evaluating these models, particularly concerning risks unique to the audio modality, remains largely unexplored. Existing evaluation frameworks primarily focus on the text modality or address only a restricted set of safety dimensions, failing to adequately account for the unique characteristics and application scenarios inherent to the audio modality. We introduce AudioTrust-the first multifaceted trustworthiness evaluation framework and benchmark specifically designed for ALLMs. AudioTrust facilitates assessments across six key dimensions: fairness, hallucination, safety, privacy, robustness, and authentication. To comprehensively evaluate these dimensions, AudioTrust is structured around 18 distinct experimental setups. Its core is a meticulously constructed dataset of over 4,420 audio/text samples, drawn from real-world scenarios (e.g., daily conversations, emergency calls, voice assistant interactions), specifically designed to probe the multifaceted trustworthiness of ALLMs. For assessment, the benchmark carefully designs 9 audio-specific evaluation metrics, and we employ a large-scale automated pipeline for objective and scalable scoring of model outputs. Experimental results reveal the trustworthiness boundaries and limitations of current state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source ALLMs when confronted with various high-risk audio scenarios, offering valuable insights for the secure and trustworthy deployment of future audio models. Our platform and benchmark are available at https://github.com/JusperLee/AudioTrust.</description>

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has recently shown remarkable progress, but accurately transcribing children's speech remains a significant challenge. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in improving ASR transcriptions. However, their applications in child speech including conversational scenarios are underexplored. In this study, we explore the use of LLMs in correcting ASR errors for conversational child speech. We demonstrate the promises and challenges of LLMs through experiments on two children's conversational speech datasets with both zero-shot and fine-tuned ASR outputs. We find that while LLMs are helpful in correcting zero-shot ASR outputs and fine-tuned CTC-based ASR outputs, it remains challenging for LLMs to improve ASR performance when incorporating contextual information or when using fine-tuned autoregressive ASR (e.g., Whisper) outputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the capabilities of large-scale pre-trained models evolve, understanding the determinants of their outputs becomes more important. Feature attribution aims to reveal which parts of the input elements contribute the most to model outputs. In speech processing, the unique characteristics of the input signal make the application of feature attribution methods challenging. We study how factors such as input type and aggregation and perturbation timespan impact the reliability of standard feature attribution methods, and how these factors interact with characteristics of each classification task. We find that standard approaches to feature attribution are generally unreliable when applied to the speech domain, with the exception of word-aligned perturbation methods when applied to word-based classification tasks.</description>

      <title>From Tens of Hours to Tens of Thousands: Scaling Back-Translation for Speech Recognition</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) have been largely fueled by massive speech corpora. However, extending coverage to diverse languages with limited resources remains a formidable challenge. This paper introduces Speech Back-Translation, a scalable pipeline that improves multilingual ASR models by converting large-scale text corpora into synthetic speech via off-the-shelf text-to-speech (TTS) models. We demonstrate that just tens of hours of real transcribed speech can effectively train TTS models to generate synthetic speech at hundreds of times the original volume while maintaining high quality. To evaluate synthetic speech quality, we develop an intelligibility-based assessment framework and establish clear thresholds for when synthetic data benefits ASR training. Using Speech Back-Translation, we generate more than 500,000 hours of synthetic speech in ten languages and continue pre-training Whisper-large-v3, achieving average transcription error reductions of over 30\%. These results highlight the scalability and effectiveness of Speech Back-Translation for enhancing multilingual ASR systems.</description>

      <title>ShiftySpeech: A Large-Scale Synthetic Speech Dataset with Distribution Shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05674v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of synthetic speech detection has enjoyed considerable attention, with recent methods achieving low error rates across several established benchmarks. However, to what extent can low error rates on academic benchmarks translate to more realistic conditions? In practice, while the training set is fixed at one point in time, test-time conditions may exhibit distribution shifts relative to the training conditions, such as changes in speaker characteristics, emotional expressiveness, language and acoustic conditions, and the emergence of novel synthesis methods. Although some existing datasets target subsets of these distribution shifts, systematic analysis remains difficult due to inconsistencies between source data and synthesis systems across datasets. This difficulty is further exacerbated by the rapid development of new text-to-speech (TTS) and vocoder systems, which continually expand the diversity of synthetic speech. To enable systematic benchmarking of model performance under distribution shifts, we introduce ShiftySpeech, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 3,000 hours of synthetic speech across 7 source domains, 6 TTS systems, 12 vocoders, and 3 languages. ShiftySpeech is specifically designed to evaluate model generalization under controlled distribution shifts while ensuring broad coverage of modern synthetic speech generation techniques. It fills a key gap in current benchmarks by supporting fine-grained, controlled analysis of generalization robustness. All tested distribution shifts significantly degrade detection performance of state-of-the-art detection approaches based on self-supervised features. Overall, our findings suggest that reliance on synthetic speech detection methods in production environments should be carefully evaluated based on anticipated distribution shifts.</description>

      <title>Improving Noise Robustness of LLM-based Zero-shot TTS via Discrete Acoustic Token Denoising</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) methods tend to preserve the acoustic environment of the audio prompt, leading to degradation in synthesized speech quality when the audio prompt contains noise. In this paper, we propose a novel neural codec-based speech denoiser and integrate it with the advanced LLM-based TTS model, LauraTTS, to achieve noise-robust zero-shot TTS. The proposed codec denoiser consists of an audio codec, a token denoiser, and an embedding refiner. The token denoiser predicts the first two groups of clean acoustic tokens from the noisy ones, which can serve as the acoustic prompt for LauraTTS to synthesize high-quality personalized speech or be converted to clean speech waveforms through the embedding refiner and codec decoder. Experimental results show that our proposed codec denoiser outperforms state-of-the-art speech enhancement (SE) methods, and the proposed noise-robust LauraTTS surpasses the approach using additional SE models.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of text-to-audio music generation models in producing long-form music with prompts that change over time, focusing on soundtrack generation for Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPGs). We introduce Babel Bardo, a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform speech transcriptions into music descriptions for controlling a text-to-music model. Four versions of Babel Bardo were compared in two TRPG campaigns: a baseline using direct speech transcriptions, and three LLM-based versions with varying approaches to music description generation. Evaluations considered audio quality, story alignment, and transition smoothness. Results indicate that detailed music descriptions improve audio quality while maintaining consistency across consecutive descriptions enhances story alignment and transition smoothness.</description>

      <title>Slamming: Training a Speech Language Model on One GPU in a Day</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15814</link>

Abstract: We introduce Slam, a recipe for training high-quality Speech Language Models (SLMs) on a single academic GPU in 24 hours. We do so through empirical analysis of model initialisation and architecture, synthetic training data, preference optimisation with synthetic data and tweaking all other components. We empirically demonstrate that this training recipe also scales well with more compute getting results on par with leading SLMs in a fraction of the compute cost. We hope these insights will make SLM training and research more accessible. In the context of SLM scaling laws, our results far outperform predicted compute optimal performance, giving an optimistic view to SLM feasibility.

      <title>TASTE: Text-Aligned Speech Tokenization and Embedding for Spoken Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent efforts target spoken language models (SLMs) that not only listen but also speak for more natural human-LLM interaction. Joint speech-text modeling is a promising direction to achieve this. However, the effectiveness of recent speech tokens for joint modeling remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce Text-Aligned Speech Tokenization and Embedding (TASTE), a method that directly addresses the modality gap by aligning speech token with the corresponding text transcription during the tokenization stage. We propose a method that can achieve this through a attention-based aggregation mechanism and with speech reconstruction as the training objective. We conduct extensive experiments and show that TASTE can preserve essential paralinguistic information while dramatically reducing the token sequence length. With TASTE, we perform straightforward joint spoken language modeling by using Low-Rank Adaptation on the pre-trained text LLM. Experimental results show that TASTE-based SLMs perform comparable to previous work on SALMON and StoryCloze; while significantly outperform other pre-trained SLMs on speech continuation across subjective and objective evaluations. To our knowledge, TASTE is the first end-to-end approach that utilizes a reconstruction objective to automatically learn a text-aligned speech tokenization and embedding suitable for spoken language modeling. Our demo, code, and model are available at https://mtkresearch.github.io/TASTE-SpokenLM.github.io.</description>

      <title>Neurodyne: Neural Pitch Manipulation with Representation Learning and Cycle-Consistency GAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pitch manipulation is the process of producers adjusting the pitch of an audio segment to a specific key and intonation, which is essential in music production. Neural-network-based pitch-manipulation systems have been popular in recent years due to their superior synthesis quality compared to classical DSP methods. However, their performance is still limited due to their inaccurate feature disentanglement using source-filter models and the lack of paired in- and out-of-tune training data. This work proposes Neurodyne to address these issues. Specifically, Neurodyne uses adversarial representation learning to learn a pitch-independent latent representation to avoid inaccurate disentanglement and cycle-consistency training to create paired training data implicitly. Experimental results on global-key and template-based pitch manipulation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, marking improved synthesis quality while maintaining the original singer identity.</description>
