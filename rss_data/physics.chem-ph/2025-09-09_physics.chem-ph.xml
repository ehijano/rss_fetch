      <title>Anomalous Magnetoresistance Beyond the Julli\`ere Model for Spin Selectivity in Chiral Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The issue of anomalous high magnetoresistance, beyond the Julli\`ere model, observed in nonmagnetic electrode-chiral molecular-ferromagnetic electrode devices has puzzled the community for a long time. Here, by considering the magnetic proximity effect which shifts the nonmagnetic-ferromagnetic interface toward chiral molecules, we show the anomalous high magnetoresistance beyond the spin polarization in ferromagnetic electrodes even in the very weak spin-orbit coupling. Our results are in excellent agreement with the experiments, demonstrating that the spin-orbit coupling plays a fundamental role in chiral-induced spin selectivity and the magnetic proximity effect can dramatically enhance the magnetoresistance. These results elucidate the interaction between chiral molecules and ferromagnetic electrodes and facilitate the design of chiral-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Exponential convergence of the local diabatic representation for nonadiabatic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrete variable local diabatic representation (LDR) provides a divergence-free framework for exact conical intersection dynamics simulation. In this work, we investigate the convergence with respect to the number of "nuclear" grid points and "electronic" states of LDR for the eigenvalue problems using coupled oscillator models. The performance of LDR is compared with traditional approaches based on the Born-Huang ansatz and on the crude adiabatic representation. Our results demonstrate that for weak vibronic couplings, LDR shows similar convergence rate as the exact Born-Huang representation including not only the first-order derivative couplings but also the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections and second-order derivative couplings. Surprisingly, for strong vibronic couplings, LDR shows a significant faster convergence rate with respect to the number of grid points, hence the number of electronic structure computations, than the exact Born-Huang representation. The crude adiabatic representation in generally shows a much slower convergence rate for all cases. The diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections and second-order derivative couplings are found to be important in the Born-Huang framework.</description>

      <title>Stochastic resolution of identity to CC2 for large systems: Excited-state gradients and derivative couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excited-state gradients and derivative couplings are critical for simulating excited-state dynamics. However, their calculations are very expensive within the coupled-cluster framework due to the steep scaling. In this work, we present two implementations of stochastic resolution of identity to CC2 (sRI-CC2) for excited-state analytical gradients and derivative couplings. The first method employs sRI for both Coulomb and exchange terms, reducing the formal scaling to cubic. However, this method has a significant stochastic noise. Consequently, we introduce a substitute, termed partial sRI-CC2, which applies sRI selectively to the exchange terms only. The partial sRI-CC2 shows a quartic scaling with a modest prefactor, rendering it a practical alternative. Compared to conventional RI-CC2, the partial sRI-CC2 can handle systems with hundreds or even thousands of electrons. This work is an extension to our previous implementation of sRI-CC2 method and provides essential ingredients for large-scale nonadiabatic dynamics.</description>

      <title>An orthogonal electronic state view on charge delocalization and transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a configuration interaction (CI) framework which serves quantitative and conceptual purposes for charge delocalization and electron transfer processes in molecular systems. The electronic Hamiltonian is expressed in a basis of charge-localized determinants and used to independently generate adiabatic CI states and charge-localized CI states, both of which are unambiguously defined through a diagonalization procedure. The CI framework offers a simple interpretation of adiabatic states as resonance hybrids of different electron distributions, providing a simple picture for discussing charge-delocalization in chemical bonding. The charge-localized states serve as a convenient orthogonal representation of initial and final states in electron transfer processes, and provides an unambiguous definition of their electronic coupling. These two models enable an analysis of the water dimer hydrogen bond. We demonstrate that although the overall charge delocalization is small, the occurrence of particular ionic contributions are crucial to get the correct electronic description.</description>

      <title>How hydrodynamic interactions alter polymer stretching in turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic interactions (HI) between segments of a polymer have long been known to strongly affect polymer stretching in laminar viscometric flows. Yet the role of HI in fluctuating turbulent flows remains unclear. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we examine the stretching dynamics of bead-spring chains with inter-bead HI, as they are transported in a homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow (within the ultra-dilute, one-way coupling regime). We find that HI-endowed chains exhibit a steeper coil-stretch transition as the elastic relaxation time is increased, i.e., HI cause less stretching of stiff polymers and more stretching of moderately to highly elastic polymers. The probability distribution function of the end-to-end extension is also modified, with HI significantly limiting the range of extensions over which a power-law range appears. On quantifying the repeated stretching and recoiling of chains by computing persistence time distributions, we find that HI delays migration between stretched and coiled states. These effects of HI, which are consistent with chains experiencing an effective conformation-dependent drag, are sensitive to the level of coarse-graining in the bead-spring model. Specifically, an HI-endowed dumbbell, which cannot form a physical coil, is unable to experience the hydrodynamic shielding effect of HI. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating an extension-dependent drag force in dumbbell-based simulations of turbulent polymer solutions. To develop and test such an augmented dumbbell model, we propose the use of a time-correlated Gaussian random flow, in which the turbulent stretching statistics are shown to be well-approximated.</description>

      <title>Double Ionization to CO2 Produces Molecular Oxygen: A Roaming Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a combined experimental and theoretical study on the formation of O2+ by electronimpact double ionization and fragmentation of carbon dioxide (CO2) molecule. Through fragment ions and electron coincidence momentum imaging, we determine unambiguously the ionization mechanism by measuring the projectile energy loss in association with the C+ + O2+ channel. Further potential energy and trajectory calculations enable us to elucidate the dynamical details of this fragmentation process, in which a bond rearrangement pathway is found to proceed via the structural deformation to a triangular intermediate. Moreover, we demonstrate a new roaming pathway for formation of O2+ from CO22+, in which a frustrated C-O bond cleavage leaves the O atom without sufficient energy to escape. The O atom then wanders around varied configuration spaces of the flat potential energy regions and forms a C-O-O2+ intermediate prior to the final products C+ + O2+. Considering the large quantities of free electrons in interstellar space, the processes revealed here are expected to be significant and should be incorporated into atmospheric evolution models.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Two Types of Liquid Structures at Platinum-Water Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Platinum-water interfaces underpin many electrochemical energy conversion processes. However, despite decades of research, the real-space liquid structure of these interfaces remains elusive. Using three-dimensional atomic force microscopy (3D-AFM), we mapped Pt-water interface in real space with angstrom-level resolution. Topographic imaging revealed atomically flat (type I) and stripe-like (type II) surface nanodomains. Force-distance profiles above type I domains exhibited oscillatory decay patterns with periodicity of ~0.33 nm, consistent with water. In contrast, type II domains showed stronger oscillations with larger periodicity of ~0.45 nm and extended decay lengths, indicative of a different liquid structure with stronger correlation and ordering. Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) measurements of pure water and a series of liquid n-alkanes revealed peaks at ~0.31 nm and ~0.46 nm, in agreement with 3D-AFM observations of type I and type II structures, respectively. Our findings uncover the coexistence of two types of liquid structures at Pt-water interfaces modulated by surface heterogeneity, enabling new understandings and design principles for energy conversion applications.</description>

      <title>Ion counting and temperature determination of Coulomb-crystallized laser-cooled ions in traps using convolutional neural networks</title>

Abstract: Coulomb crystals -- ordered structures of cold ions confined in ion traps -- find applications in a variety of research fields. The number and temperature of the ions forming the Coulomb crystals are two key attributes of interest in many trapped-ion experiments. Here, we present a fast and accurate approach to determining these attributes from fluorescence images of the ions based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this approach, we first generate a large number of images of Coulomb crystals with different ion numbers and temperatures using molecular-dynamics simulations and then train CNN models on these images to classify the desired attributes. The classification performance of several common pretrained CNN models was compared in example tasks. We find that for crystals with ion numbers in the range 100--299 and secular temperatures of 5--15 mK, the best-performing model can discern number variations on the level of one ion with an accuracy of 93% and temperature variations by 1 mK with an accuracy of 92%. Since the trained model can be directly integrated into experiments, in-situ determination of these attributes can be realized in a non-invasive fashion, which has the potential to greatly facilitate the analysis and control of trapped ions in real time.</description>

      <title>Uncovering relationships between the electronic self-energy and coupled-cluster doubles theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18910v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the coupled-cluster doubles (CCD) amplitude equations by introduction of the particle-hole-time decoupled electronic self-energy. The resulting analysis leads to an expression for the ground state correlation energy that is exactly of the form obtained in coupled-cluster doubles theory. We demonstrate the relationship to the ionization potential/electron affinity equation-of-motion coupled-cluster doubles (IP/EA-EOM-CCD) eigenvalue problem by coupling the reverse-time self-energy contributions while maintaining particle-hole separability. The formal relationships established are demonstrated by exact solution of the Hubbard dimer.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Ostwald ripening by chemical activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase separation of biomolecular condensates promotes membrane-free compartmentalization in cells. The dynamics of these biocondensates is routinely regulated by energy-consuming processes. Here, we devise a theory pinpointing how active chemical reactions, interconverting molecules between phase-separating and inert forms, can drive faster condensate coarsening. We find that mass conservation limits droplet volume growth to being linear in time regardless of activity, resembling the passive Lifshitz-Slyozov law. However, if reactions are restricted to occur only outside droplets, the rate of Ostwald ripening can be increased by an arbitrarily large factor. Our theory is quantitatively supported by recent experiments on ripening in the presence of fueled interconversion reactions, under precisely the predicted conditions. We posit that the ability to induce rapid biocondensate coarsening can be advantageous in synthetic-biological contexts, e.g., as a regulator of metabolic channeling.</description>
