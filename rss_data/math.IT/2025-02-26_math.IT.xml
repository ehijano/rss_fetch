      <title>Spectral Efficiency Expression for the Non-Linear Schr\"{o}dinger Channel in the Low Noise Limit Using Scattering Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission through optical fibers offers ultra-fast and long-haul communications. However, the search for its ultimate capacity limits in the presence of distributed amplifier noise is complicated by the competition between wave dispersion and non-linearity. In this paper, we exploit the integrability of the Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger Equation, which accurately models optical fiber communications, to derive an expression for the spectral efficiency of an optical fiber communications channel, expressed fully in the scattering data domain of the Non-linear Fourier Transform and valid in the limit of low amplifier noise. We utilize the relationship between the derived noise-covariance operator and the Jacobian of the mapping between the signal and the scattering data to obtain the properties of the former. Emerging from the structure of the covariance operator is the significance of the Gordon-Haus effect in moderating and finally reversing the increase of the spectral efficiency with power. This effect is showcased in numerical simulations for Gaussian input in the high-bandwidth regime.</description>

      <title>Sequential Exchange Monte Carlo: Sampling Method for Multimodal Distribution without Parameter Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Replica Exchange Monte Carlo (REMC) method, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for sampling multimodal distributions, is typically employed in Bayesian inference for complex models. Using the REMC method, multiple probability distributions with different temperatures are defined to enhance sampling efficiency and allow for the high-precision computation of Bayesian free energy. However, the REMC method requires the tuning of many parameters, including the number of distributions, temperature, and step size, which makes it difficult for nonexperts to effectively use. Thus, we propose the Sequential Exchange Monte Carlo (SEMC) method, which automates the tuning of parameters by sequentially determining the temperature and step size. Numerical experiments showed that SEMC is as efficient as parameter-tuned REMC and parameter-tuned Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers (SMCS), which is also effective for the Bayesian inference of complex models.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Movable Antennas for Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has been recognized as a promising technology to enhance the performance of wireless communication and sensing by enabling antenna movement. Such a significant paradigm shift from conventional fixed antennas (FAs) to MAs offers tremendous new opportunities towards realizing more versatile, adaptive and efficient next-generation wireless networks such as 6G. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive tutorial on the fundamentals and advancements in the area of MA-empowered wireless networks. First, we overview the historical development and contemporary applications of MA technologies. Next, to characterize the continuous variation in wireless channels with respect to antenna position and/or orientation, we present new field-response channel models tailored for MAs, which are applicable to narrowband and wideband systems as well as far-field and near-field propagation conditions. Subsequently, we review the state-of-the-art architectures for implementing MAs and discuss their practical constraints. A general optimization framework is then formulated to fully exploit the spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) in antenna movement for performance enhancement in wireless systems. In particular, we delve into two major design issues for MA systems. First, we address the intricate antenna movement optimization problem for various communication and/or sensing systems to maximize the performance gains achievable by MAs. Second, we deal with the challenging channel acquisition issue in MA systems for reconstructing the channel mapping between arbitrary antenna positions inside the transmitter and receiver regions. Moreover, we show existing prototypes developed for MA-aided communication/sensing and the experimental results based on them. Finally, the extension of MA design to other wireless systems and its synergy with other emerging wireless technologies are discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing-Based Sum Rate Maximization for Multi-UAV-Aided Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wireless communication networks, it is difficult to solve many NP-hard problems owing to computational complexity and high cost. Recently, quantum annealing (QA) based on quantum physics was introduced as a key enabler for solving optimization problems quickly. However, only some studies consider quantum-based approaches in wireless communications. Therefore, we investigate the performance of a QA solution to an optimization problem in wireless networks. Specifically, we aim to maximize the sum rate by jointly optimizing clustering, sub-channel assignment, and power allocation in a multi-unmanned aerial vehicle-aided wireless network. We formulate the sum rate maximization problem as a combinatorial optimization problem. Then, we divide it into two sub-problems: 1) a QA-based clustering and 2) sub-channel assignment and power allocation for a given clustering configuration. Subsequently, we obtain an optimized solution for the joint optimization problem by solving these two sub-problems. For the first sub-problem, we convert the problem into a simplified quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model. As for the second sub-problem, we introduce a novel QA algorithm with optimal scaling parameters to address it. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of the sum rate and running time.</description>

      <title>Remote Training in Task-Oriented Communication: Supervised or Self-Supervised with Fine-Tuning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task-oriented communication focuses on extracting and transmitting only the information relevant to specific tasks, effectively minimizing communication overhead. Most existing methods prioritize reducing this overhead during inference, often assuming feasible local training or minimal training communication resources. However, in real-world wireless systems with dynamic connection topologies, training models locally for each new connection is impractical, and task-specific information is often unavailable before establishing connections. Therefore, minimizing training overhead and enabling label-free, task-agnostic pre-training before the connection establishment are essential for effective task-oriented communication. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by employing a mutual information maximization approach grounded in self-supervised learning and information-theoretic analysis. We propose an efficient strategy that pre-trains the transmitter in a task-agnostic and label-free manner, followed by joint fine-tuning of both the transmitter and receiver in a task-specific, label-aware manner. Simulation results show that our proposed method reduces training communication overhead to about half that of full-supervised methods using the SGD optimizer, demonstrating significant improvements in training efficiency.</description>

      <title>Duality of Codes over Non-unital Rings of Order Six</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present some basic theory on the duality of codes over two non-unital rings of order $6$, namely $H_{23}$ and $H_{32}$. For a code $\mathcal{C}$ over these rings, we associate a binary code $\mathcal{C}_a$ and a ternary code $\mathcal{C}_b$. We characterize self-orthogonal, self-dual and quasi self-dual (QSD) codes over these rings using the codes $\mathcal{C}_a$ and $\mathcal{C}_b$. In addition, we present a building-up construction for self-orthogonal codes, introduce cyclic codes and linear complementary dual (LCD) codes. We also gave a classification of self-orthogonal codes for short lengths.</description>

      <title>On the number of minimal and next-to-minimal weight codewords of toric codes over hypersimplices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toric codes are a type of evaluation code introduced by J.P. Hansen in 2000. They are produced by evaluating (a vector space composed by) polynomials at the points of $(\mathbb{F}_q^*)^s$, the monomials of these polynomials being related to a certain polytope. Toric codes related to hypersimplices are the result of the evaluation of a vector space of homogeneous monomially square-free polynomials of degree $d$. The dimension and minimum distance of toric codes related to hypersimplices have been determined by Jaramillo et al. in 2021. The next-to-minimal weight in the case $d = 1$ has been determined by Jaramillo-Velez et al. in 2023, and has been determined in the cases where $3 \leq d \leq \frac{s - 2}{2}$ or $\frac{s + 2}{2} \leq d &lt; s$, by Carvalho and Patanker in 2024. In this work we characterize and determine the number of minimal (respectively, next-to-minimal) weight codewords when $3 \leq d &lt; s$ (respectively, $3 \leq d \leq \frac{s - 2}{2}$ or $\frac{s + 2}{2} \leq d &lt; s$).</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Future Wireless Communications: Channel Prediction Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise channel state knowledge is crucial in future wireless communication systems, which drives the need for accurate channel prediction without additional pilot overhead. While machine-learning (ML) methods for channel prediction show potential, existing approaches have limitations in their capability to adapt to environmental changes due to their extensive training requirements. In this paper, we introduce the channel prediction approaches in terms of the temporal channel prediction and the environmental adaptation. Then, we elaborate on the use of the advanced ML-based channel prediction to resolve the issues in traditional ML methods. The numerical results show that the advanced ML-based channel prediction has comparable accuracy with much less training overhead compared to conventional prediction methods. Also, we examine the training process, dataset characteristics, and the impact of source tasks and pre-trained models on channel prediction approaches. Finally, we discuss open challenges and possible future research directions of ML-based channel prediction.</description>

      <title>Optimal Communication-Computation Trade-off in Hierarchical Gradient Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study gradient coding in a hierarchical setting, where there are intermediate nodes between the server and the workers. This structure reduces the bandwidth requirements at the server, which is a bottleneck in conventional gradient coding systems. In this paper, the intermediate nodes, referred to as $\textit{relays}$, process the data received from workers and send the results to the server for the final gradient computation. Our main contribution is deriving the optimal communication-computation trade-off by designing a linear coding scheme inspired by coded computing techniques, considering straggling and adversarial nodes among both relays and workers. The processing of the data in the relays makes it possible to achieve both the relay-to-server and the worker-to-relay communication loads simultaneously optimal with regard to the computation load.</description>

      <title>Equidistant-Sample or Wait-and-Sample to Minimize Age Under Sampling Constraint?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a status update system with a source, a sampler, a transmitter, and a monitor. The source governs a stochastic process that the monitor wants to observe in a timely manner. To achieve this, the sampler samples fresh update packets which the transmitter transmits via an error prone communication channel to the monitor. The transmitter can transmit without any constraint, i.e., it can transmit whenever an update packet is available to the transmitter. However, the sampler is imposed with a sampling rate constraint. The goal of the sampler is to devise an optimal policy that satisfies the resource constraint while minimizing the age of the monitor. We formulate this problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). We find several structures of an optimal policy. We leverage the optimal structures to find a low complexity optimal policy in an explicit manner, without resorting to complex iterative schemes or techniques that require bounding the age.</description>

      <title>Quantifying interdisciplinary synergy in higher STEM education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework to quantify and utilize interdisciplinarity in science and engineering curricula in the case of university-level higher education. We analyze interdisciplinary relations by standardizing large-scale official educational data in Korea using a cutting-edge large language model and constructing knowledge maps for disciplines of scientific education. We design and evaluate single-field and integrated dual-field curricula by adapting pedagogical theory and utilizing information theory-based metrics. We develop standard curricula for individual disciplines and integrated curricula combining two fields, with their interdisciplinarity quantified by the curriculum synergy score. The results indicate higher interdisciplinarity for combinations within or across closely related fields, especially in engineering fields. Based on the analysis, engineering fields constitute the core structure of our design for curriculum interdisciplinarity, while basic natural science fields are located at peripheral stems to provide fundamental concepts.</description>

      <title>The 2-Adjunction that relates Universal Arrows and Extensive Monads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article the 2-adjunction that relates universal arrows and extensive monads is constructed explicitly. This 2-adjunction resembles the one that relates adjunctions and monads since the 2-category of universal arrows is isomorphic to the 2-category of adjunctions and the 2-category of extensive monads is isomorphic to the 2-category of monads. This article would be useful as a foundation for a theory relating pseudo adjunctions and pseudo monads for Gray-categories. On the other hand, it might function as an accesible tool for computer scientists on extensive monads.</description>

      <title>Pauli measurements are not optimal for single-copy tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a fundamental problem in quantum computing. Given $n$ copies of an unknown $N$-qubit state $\rho \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d},d=2^N$, the goal is to learn the state up to an accuracy $\epsilon$ in trace distance, with at least probability 0.99. We are interested in the copy complexity, the minimum number of copies of $\rho$ needed to fulfill the task.
  Pauli measurements have attracted significant attention due to their ease of implementation in limited settings. The best-known upper bound is $O(\frac{N \cdot 12^N}{\epsilon^2})$, and no non-trivial lower bound is known besides the general single-copy lower bound $\Omega(\frac{8^n}{\epsilon^2})$, achieved by hard-to-implement structured POVMs such as MUB, SIC-POVM, and uniform POVM.
  We have made significant progress on this long-standing problem. We first prove a stronger upper bound of $O(\frac{10^N}{\epsilon^2})$. To complement it with a lower bound of $\Omega(\frac{9.118^N}{\epsilon^2})$, which holds under adaptivity. To our knowledge, this demonstrates the first known separation between Pauli measurements and structured POVMs.
  The new lower bound is a consequence of a novel framework for adaptive quantum state tomography with measurement constraints. The main advantage over prior methods is that we can use measurement-dependent hard instances to prove tight lower bounds for Pauli measurements. Moreover, we connect the copy-complexity lower bound to the eigenvalues of the measurement information channel, which governs the measurement's capacity to distinguish states. To demonstrate the generality of the new framework, we obtain tight-bounds for adaptive quantum tomography with $k$-outcome measurements, where we recover existing results and establish new ones.</description>

      <title>Iterative Counterfactual Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) is a method for controlling information or biases in training datasets by generating a complementary dataset with typically opposing biases. Prior work often either relies on hand-crafted rules or algorithmic CDA methods which can leave unwanted information in the augmented dataset. In this work, we show iterative CDA (ICDA) with initial, high-noise interventions can converge to a state with significantly lower noise. Our ICDA procedure produces a dataset where one target signal in the training dataset maintains high mutual information with a corresponding label and the information of spurious signals are reduced. We show training on the augmented datasets produces rationales on documents that better align with human annotation. Our experiments include six human produced datasets and two large-language model generated datasets.</description>

Abstract: In statistics, generalized linear models (GLMs) are widely used for modeling data and can expressively capture potential nonlinear dependence of the model's outcomes on its covariates. Within the broad family of GLMs, those with binary outcomes, which include logistic and probit regressions, are motivated by common tasks such as binary classification with (possibly) non-separable data. In addition, in modern machine learning and statistics, data is often high-dimensional yet has a low intrinsic dimension, making sparsity constraints in models another reasonable consideration. In this work, we propose to use and analyze an iterative hard thresholding (projected gradient descent on the ReLU loss) algorithm, called binary iterative hard thresholding (BIHT), for parameter estimation in sparse GLMs with binary outcomes. We establish that BIHT is statistically efficient and converges to the correct solution for parameter estimation in a general class of sparse binary GLMs. Unlike many other methods for learning GLMs, including maximum likelihood estimation, generalized approximate message passing, and GLM-tron (Kakade et al. 2011; Bahmani et al. 2016), BIHT does not require knowledge of the GLM's link function, offering flexibility and generality in allowing the algorithm to learn arbitrary binary GLMs. As two applications, logistic and probit regression are additionally studied. In this regard, it is shown that in logistic regression, the algorithm is in fact statistically optimal in the sense that the order-wise sample complexity matches (up to logarithmic factors) the lower bound obtained previously. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work achieving statistical optimality for logistic regression in all noise regimes with a computationally efficient algorithm. Moreover, for probit regression, our sample complexity is on the same order as that obtained for logistic regression.</description>

      <title>Random Number Generation from Pulsars</title>

Abstract: Pulsars exhibit signals with precise inter-arrival times that are on the order of milliseconds to seconds depending on the individual pulsar. There is subtle variation in the timing of pulsar signals, primarily due to the presence of gravitational waves, intrinsic variance in the period of the pulsar, and errors in the realization of Terrestrial Time (TT). Traditionally, these variations are dismissed as noise in high-precision timing experiments. In this paper, we show that these variations serve as a natural entropy source for the creation of Random Number Generators (RNG). We also explore the effects of using randomness extractors to increase the entropy of random bits extracted from Pulsar timing data. To evaluate the quality of the Pulsar RNG, we model its entropy as a $k$-source and use well-known cryptographic results to show its closeness to a theoretically ideal uniformly random source. To remain consistent with prior work, we also show that the Pulsar RNG passes well-known statistical tests such as the NIST test suite.</description>

      <title>Reversal Blessing: Thinking Backward May Outpace Thinking Forward in Multi-choice Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models usually use left-to-right (L2R) autoregressive factorization. However, L2R factorization may not always be the best inductive bias. Therefore, we investigate whether alternative factorizations of the text distribution could be beneficial in some tasks. We investigate right-to-left (R2L) training as a compelling alternative, focusing on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) as a test bed for knowledge extraction and reasoning. Through extensive experiments across various model sizes (2B-8B parameters) and training datasets, we find that R2L models can significantly outperform L2R models on several MCQ benchmarks, including logical reasoning, commonsense understanding, and truthfulness assessment tasks. Our analysis reveals that this performance difference may be fundamentally linked to multiple factors including calibration, computability and directional conditional entropy. We ablate the impact of these factors through controlled simulation studies using arithmetic tasks, where the impacting factors can be better disentangled. Our work demonstrates that exploring alternative factorizations of the text distribution can lead to improvements in LLM capabilities and provides theoretical insights into optimal factorization towards approximating human language distribution, and when each reasoning order might be more advantageous.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Received Adaptive Spatial Modulation for Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06894v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel wireless transmission scheme, as named the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted received adaptive spatial modulation (RASM) scheme, is proposed in this paper. In this scheme, the adaptive spatial modulation (ASM)-based antennas selection works at the receiver by employing the characteristics of the RIS in each time slot, where the signal-to-noise ratio at specific selected antennas can be further enhanced with near few powers. Besides for the bits from constellation symbols, the extra bits can be mapped into the indices of receive antenna combinations and conveyed to the receiver through the ASM-based antenna-combination selection, thus providing higher spectral efficiency. To explicitly present the RASM scheme, the analytical performance of bit error rate of it is discussed in this paper. As a trade-off selection, the proposed scheme shows higher spectral efficiency and remains the satisfactory error performance. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate the better performance and exhibit more potential to apply in practical wireless communication.</description>

      <title>Blind and Topological Interference Managements for Bistatic Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03956v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems provide significant enhancements in performance and resource efficiency compared to individual sensing and communication systems, primarily attributed to the collaborative use of wireless resources, radio waveforms, and hardware platforms. This paper focuses on the bistatic ISAC systems with dispersed multi-receivers and one sensor. Compared to a monostatic ISAC system, the main challenge in the bistatic setting is that the information messages are unknown to the sensor and therefore they are seen as interference, while the channel between the transmitters and the sensor is unknown to the transmitters. In order to mitigate the interference at the sensor while maximizing the communication degree of freedom, we introduce two strategies, namely, blind interference alignment and topological interference management. Although well-known in the context of Gaussian interference channels, these strategies are novel in the context of bistttic ISAC. For the bistatic ISAC models with heterogeneous coherence times or with heterogeneous connectivity, the achieved ISAC tradeoff points in terms of communication and sensing degrees of freedom are characterized. In particular, we show that the new tradeoff outperforms the time-sharing between the sensing-only and the communication-only schemes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed schemes significantly improve the channel estimation error for the sensing task compared to treating interference as noise at the sensor.</description>

      <title>Towards accurate and reliable ICU outcome prediction: a multimodal learning framework based on belief function theory using structured EHRs and free-text notes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate Intensive Care Unit (ICU) outcome prediction is critical for improving patient treatment quality and ICU resource allocation. Existing research mainly focuses on structured data, e.g. demographics and vital signs, and lacks effective frameworks to integrate clinical notes from heterogeneous electronic health records (EHRs). This study aims to explore a multimodal framework based on belief function theory that can effectively fuse heterogeneous structured EHRs and free-text notes for accurate and reliable ICU outcome prediction. The fusion strategy accounts for prediction uncertainty within each modality and conflicts between multimodal data. The experiments on MIMIC-III dataset show that our framework provides more accurate and reliable predictions than existing approaches. Specifically, it outperformed the best baseline by 1.05%/1.02% in BACC, 9.74%/6.04% in F1 score, 1.28%/0.9% in AUROC, and 6.21%/2.68% in AUPRC for predicting mortality and PLOS, respectively. Additionally, it improved the reliability of the predictions with a 26.8%/15.1% reduction in the Brier score and a 25.0%/13.3% reduction in negative log-likelihood. By effectively reducing false positives, the model can aid in better allocation of medical resources in the ICU. Furthermore, the proposed method is very versatile and can be extended to analyzing multimodal EHRs for other clinical tasks. The code implementation is available on https://github.com/yuchengruan/evid_multimodal_ehr.</description>

      <title>Bounding User Contributions for User-Level Differentially Private Mean Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of releasing the sample mean of bounded samples in a dataset, privately, under user-level $\varepsilon$-differential privacy (DP). We aim to derive the optimal method of preprocessing data samples, within a canonical class of processing strategies, in terms of the error in estimation. Typical error analyses of such \emph{bounding} (or \emph{clipping}) strategies in the literature assume that the data samples are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and sometimes also that all users contribute the same number of samples (data homogeneity) -- assumptions that do not accurately model real-world data distributions. Our main result in this work is a precise characterization of the preprocessing strategy that gives rise to the smallest \emph{worst-case} error over all datasets -- a \emph{distribution-independent} error metric -- while allowing for data heterogeneity. We also show via experimental studies that even for i.i.d. real-valued samples, our clipping strategy performs much better, in terms of \emph{average-case} error, than the widely used bounding strategy of Amin et al. (2019).</description>

      <title>Parameterized quantum comb and simpler circuits for reversing unknown qubit-unitary operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum combs play a vital role in characterizing and transforming quantum processes, with wide-ranging applications in quantum information processing. However, obtaining the explicit quantum circuit for the desired quantum comb remains a challenging problem. We propose PQComb, a novel framework that employs parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) or quantum neural networks to harness the full potential of quantum combs for diverse quantum process transformation tasks. This method is well-suited for near-term quantum devices and can be applied to various tasks in quantum machine learning. As a notable application, we present two streamlined protocols for the time-reversal simulation of unknown qubit unitary evolutions, reducing the ancilla qubit overhead from six to three compared to the previous best-known method. We also extend PQComb to solve the problems of qutrit unitary transformation and channel discrimination. Furthermore, we demonstrate the hardware efficiency and robustness of our qubit unitary inversion protocol under realistic noise simulations of IBM-Q superconducting quantum hardware, yielding a significant improvement in average similarity over the previous protocol under practical regimes. PQComb's versatility and potential for broader applications in quantum machine learning pave the way for more efficient and practical solutions to complex quantum tasks.</description>

      <title>Geometry and factorization of multivariate Markov chains with applications to the swapping algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12589v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the factorizability and geometry of transition matrices of multivariate Markov chains. Specifically, we demonstrate that the induced chains on factors of a product space can be regarded as information projections with respect to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This perspective yields Han-Shearer type inequalities and submodularity of the entropy rate of Markov chains, as well as applications in the context of large deviations and mixing time comparison. As a concrete algorithmic application, we introduce a projection sampler based on the swapping algorithm, which resamples the highest-temperature coordinate at stationarity at each step. We prove that such practice accelerates the mixing time by multiplicative factors related to the number of temperatures and the dimension of the underlying state space when compared with the original swapping algorithm.</description>

      <title>{ComplexityMeasures.jl}: scalable software to unify and accelerate entropy and complexity timeseries analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the nonlinear timeseries analysis literature, countless quantities have been presented as new ``entropy'' or ``complexity'' measures, often with similar roles. The ever-increasing pool of such measures makes creating a sustainable and all-encompassing software for them difficult both conceptually and pragmatically. Such a software however would be an important tool that can aid researchers make an informed decision of which measure to use and for which application, as well as accelerate novel research. Here we present {ComplexityMeasures.jl}, an easily extendable and highly performant open-source software that implements a vast selection of complexity measures. The software provides 1638 measures with 3,841 lines of source code, averaging only 2.3 lines of code per exported quantity (version 3.7). This is made possible by its mathematically rigorous composable design. In this paper we discuss the software design and demonstrate how it can accelerate complexity-related research in the future. We carefully compare it with alternative software and conclude that {ComplexityMeasures.jl} outclasses the alternatives in several objective aspects of comparison, such as computational performance, overall amount of measures, reliability, and extendability. {ComplexityMeasures.jl} is also a component of the {DynamicalSystems.jl} library for nonlinear dynamics and nonlinear timeseries analysis and follows open source development practices for creating a sustainable community of developers and contributors.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Uncertainty Quantification via Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new and intuitive metric for aleatoric uncertainty quantification (UQ), the prevalence of class collisions defined as the same input being observed in different classes. We use the rate of class collisions to define the collision matrix, a novel and uniquely fine-grained measure of uncertainty. For a classification problem involving $K$ classes, the $K\times K$ collision matrix $S$ measures the inherent difficulty in distinguishing between each pair of classes. We discuss several applications of the collision matrix, establish its fundamental mathematical properties, as well as show its relationship with existing UQ methods, including the Bayes error rate (BER). We also address the new problem of estimating the collision matrix using one-hot labeled data by proposing a series of innovative techniques to estimate $S$. First, we learn a pair-wise contrastive model which accepts two inputs and determines if they belong to the same class. We then show that this contrastive model (which is PAC learnable) can be used to estimate the Gramian matrix of $S$, defined as $G=S^TS$. Finally, we show that under reasonable assumptions, $G$ can be used to uniquely recover $S$, a new result on non-negative matrices which could be of independent interest. With a method to estimate $S$ established, we demonstrate how this estimate of $S$, in conjunction with the contrastive model, can be used to estimate the posterior class portability distribution of any point. Experimental results are also presented to validate our methods of estimating the collision matrix and class posterior distributions on several datasets.</description>
