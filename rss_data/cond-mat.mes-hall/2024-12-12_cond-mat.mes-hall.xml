      <title>Quantum Hydrodynamics Meets Plasmonics and Nonlinear Optics in Two-Dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of quantum-hydrodynamic models to study two-dimensional electron gases, with a focus on nonlocal plasmonics and nonlinear optics. We begin by reviewing the derivation of the Madelung equations from the Wigner distribution function. Using the Madelung equations in conjunction with Poisson's equation, we calculate the spectrum of magnetoplasmons and the magneto-optical conductivity in the electrostatic regime, incorporating nonlocal corrections due to the Fermi pressure. In the absence of a magnetic field, we analyze nonlinear and nonlocal second-harmonic generation, demonstrating how plasmon excitation enhances this process. We further discuss the emergence of self-modulation phenomena driven by nonlinearity, leading to the renormalization of the plasmon dispersion. Notably, we show that nonlinearity amplifies nonlocal effects and, leveraging the hydrodynamic formalism, derive a simple analytic expression for the renormalized spectra. Additionally, we examine the role of the quantum potential, interpreted as a gradient correction to the Thomas--Fermi kinetic energy. Our results provide new insights into quantum effects in plasmonic systems, with significant implications for future advances in nanophotonics through the lens of hydrodynamic theory.</description>

      <title>Topological columnar nano-SQUID based on a 3D topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 3D topological insulator (TI) is wrapped by a metallic surface that is topologically protected. While this surface is promising for generating non-Abelian Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) for topological quantum computing, it is a challenge to gap out the whole surface to get rid of low-energy quasiparticles to realize a well-defined fermion parity. Here we propose a novel TI platform that solves this problem and gives rise to a robust topological phase. It consists of a bulk-insulating rectangular TI nanowire laterally sandwiched by two superconductors. In this structure, the top and bottom surfaces individually work as SNS line junctions, forming a nanometer-scale columnar SQUID in which the nanowire cross-section defines the threading flux $\Phi$. We demonstrate that a TI device of this structure indeed presents SQUID-type oscillations of the critical current $I_c$ as a function of the axial magnetic field with period $\Phi_{0}^s=\frac{h}{2e}$ and can be tuned by a back gate to attain vanishing $I_c$ minima, an indication that the supercurrent is completely surface-dominated. Our theory shows that, when the two junctions are asymmetric, a robust topological phase hosting MZMs occurs periodically for $(n-\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s &lt; \Phi &lt; (n+\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s$ with odd-integer $n$.</description>

      <title>Current density in the anomalous Hall effect regime under weak scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite equilibrium current density arises in the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) as a result of time-reversal symmetry breaking, affecting both the differential current density and total current. This study illustrates the equilibrium current density pattern in a ribbon-shaped system within the AHE regime, consisting of two sets of counterpropagating channels arranged in a zebra crossing pattern. While the middle channels are susceptible to scattering, the edge channels remain relatively robust. Despite this difference, all channels exhibit the same differential current density when subjected to a differential voltage across the two ends of the ribbon. When a differential voltage is applied to both sides of the ribbon, it results in a snaking pattern of differential current density forming across it. Furthermore, in a four-terminal device comprising an AHE ribbon and two normal leads, it is found that Hall conductance is independent of ribbon width within certain scattering strengths due to differences in robustness between middle and edge channels. These findings underscore the significant role played by current density in AHE transport.</description>

      <title>Emergent topological re-entrant phase transition in a generalized quasiperiodic modulated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topological properties of the one-dimensional generalized quasiperiodic modulated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The results reveal that topological re-entrant phase transition emerges. Through the analysis of a real-space winding number , we divide the emergent topological re-entrant phase transitions into two types. The first is the re-entrant phase transition from the traditional topological insulator phase into the topological Anderson insulator phase, and the second is the re-entrant phenomenon from one topological Anderson insulator phase into another topological Anderson insulator phase. These two types of re-entrant phase transition correspond to bounded and unbounded cases of quasiperiodic modulation, respectively. Furthermore, we verify the above topological re-entrant phase transitions by analyzing the Lyapunov exponent and bulk gap. Since Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models have been realized in various artificial systems (such as cold atoms, optical waveguide arrays, ion traps, Rydberg atom arrays, etc.), the two types of topological re-entrant phase transition predicted in this paper are expected to be realized in the near future.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic anomalous Hall effect under anisotropic magnetic dipole versus conventional magnetic dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect in two magnetically ordered systems: One is the ferromagnetic dipole system, and the other is the anisotropic magnetic dipole system, the latter of which has been proposed as a microscopic indicator of the anomalous Hall effect in antiferromagnets with the negligibly small magnetization. We show their similarity and difference in the anomalous Hall effect by analyzing the fundamental tight-binding model on a two-dimensional square lattice. We find that the magnitudes of the anomalous Hall effect in the two systems are similar to each other, while the magnetization in the anisotropic magnetic dipole system is much smaller than that in the ferromagnetic dipole system; this indicates that the microscopic mechanisms are different from each other. We show that such a difference appears in the momentum-resolved Berry curvature resulting from the different types of magnetic order parameters. We also show that the anomalous Hall effect in the anisotropic magnetic dipole system is enhanced when the magnitude of the spin-orbit coupling is smaller than that of the magnetic mean field. Our results provide a possibility of the giant anomalous Hall effect in collinear and coplanar antiferromagnetic systems with the anisotropic magnetic dipole.</description>

      <title>Role of quantum geometric tensor on wavepacket dynamics in two-dimensional non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) characterizes the local geometry of quantum states, and its components directly account for the dynamical effects observed, e.g., in condensed matter systems. In this work, we address the problem of extending the QGT formalism to non-Hermitian systems with gain and loss. In particular, we investigate a wave-packet dynamics in two-band non-Hermitian systems to elucidate how non-Hermiticity affects the definition of QGT. We employ first-order perturbation theory to account for non-adiabatic corrections due to interband mixing. Our results suggest that two different generalizations of the QGT, one defined using only the right eigenstates and the other one using both the left and right eigenstates, both play a significant role in wave-packet dynamics. We then determine the accuracy of the perturbative approach by simulating a wave-packet dynamics in a well studied physical non-Hermitian system -- exciton polaritons in a semiconductor microcavity. Our work aids deeper understanding of quantum geometry and dynamical behaviour in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Fractional spin Josephson effect in topological spin superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological spin superconductors are $p$-wave spin-triplet exciton insulators whose topological edge modes have been shown to obey non-Abelian braiding statistics. Based on a toy model as the spin counterpart of the Kitaev's chain, we study the spin Josephson effect adopting the $S$-matrix as well as the Green's function method. The on-site energies of these topological edge modes lead to a transition between the fractional and integer spin Josephson effects. Moreover, non-vanishing on-site energies will also induce a charge pump through the spin Josephson junction. These two effects, distinct features of topological spin superconductors and absent in Majorana systems, can be utilized for spin transport detection of topological spin superconductors.</description>

      <title>Quadratically enhancing optomechanical entanglement via dark mode control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to enhance quantum entanglement in an optomechanical system consisting of two mechanically coupled mechanical resonators, which are driven by a common electromagnetic field. Each mechanical resonator is linearly and quadratically coupled to the electromagnetic field. Moreover, the mechanical coupling between the resonators is modulated through a given phase that allows interference control in our structure. By tuning this phase, our system exhibits interference like-structure which is reminiscent of bright and dark mode features. The breaking of the dark mode via the phase adjustment leads to an entanglement generation, which is greatly enhanced through the quadratic coupling. Furthermore, the generated entanglement is robust enough against thermal noise and this resilience is improved when the quadratic coupling is accounted. Our work provides a way to enhance quantum entanglement via quadratic coupling which is assisted by interference control. Such quantum resources can be useful for quantum information processing, quantum computing, and other numerous quantum tasks.</description>

      <title>Common-Mode Control and Confinement Inversion of Electrostatically Defined Quantum Dots in a Commercial CMOS Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confining electrons or holes in quantum dots formed in the channel of industry-standard fully depleted silicon-on-insulator CMOS structures is a promising approach to scalable qubit architectures. In this article, we present our results on a calibrated model of a commercial nanostructure using the simulation tool Quantum TCAD, along with our experimental verification of all model predictions. We demonstrate here that quantum dots can be formed in the device channel by applying a combination of a common-mode voltage to the source and drain and a back gate voltage. Moreover, in this approach, the amount of quantum dots can be controlled and modified. Also, we report our results on an effective detuning of the energy levels in the quantum dots by varying the barrier gate voltages. Given the need and importance of scaling to larger numbers of qubits, we demonstrate here the feasibility of simulating and improving the design of quantum dot devices before their fabrication based on a commercial process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information processing currently reaches speeds as high as 800 GHz. However, the underlying transistor technology is quickly approaching its fundamental limits and further progress requires a disruptive approach. One such path is to manipulate quantum properties of solids, such as the valley degree of freedom, with ultrashort controlled lightwaves. Here we employ a sequence of few-optical-cycle visible pulses controlled with attosecond precision to excite and switch the valley pseudospin in a 2D semiconductor. We show that a pair of pulses separated in time with linear orthogonal polarizations can induce a valley-selective population. Additionally, exploiting a four-pump excitation protocol, we perform logic operations such as valley de-excitation and re-excitation at room temperature at rates as high as ~10 THz.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of orbital torque, pumping and mixing conductance in metallic bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conversion between spin and orbital currents is at the origin of the orbital torque and its Onsager reciprocal, the orbital pumping. Here, we propose a phenomenological model to describe the orbital torque in magnetic bilayers composed of an orbital source (i.e., a light metal such as Ti, Ru, CuOx...) and a spin-orbit coupled magnet (i.e., typically Ni, (Co/Pt)$_n$, etc.). This approach accounts for spin-to-orbit and orbit-to-spin conversion in the ferromagnet and at the interface. We show that the orbital torque arises from a compromise between orbital current injection from the orbital source to the ferromagnet and spin current backflow from the ferromagnet back to the orbital source. We also discuss the concept of orbital-mixing conductance and introduce the "orbit-spin-" and "spin-orbit-mixing" conductances that govern the orbital torque and orbital pumping, respectively.</description>

      <title>Distributed Bragg reflector-mediated excitation of InAs/InP quantum dots emitting in the telecom C-band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that optical excitation of InAs quantum dots (QDs) embedded directly in an InP matrix can be mediated via states in a quaternary compound constituting an InP/InGaAlAs bottom distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) and native defects in the InP matrix. It does not only change the carrier relaxation in the structure but could also lead to the imbalanced occupation of QDs with charge carriers, because the band structure favors the transfer of holes. Thermal activation of carrier transfer can be observed as an increase in the emission intensity versus temperature for excitation powers below saturation on the level of both an inhomogeneously broadened QD ensemble and single QD transitions. That increase in the QD emission is accompanied by a decrease in the emission from the InGaAlAs layer at low temperatures. Finally, carrier transfer between the InGaAlAs layer of the DBR and the InAs/InP QDs is directly proven by the photoluminescence excitation spectrum of the QD ensemble. The reported carrier transfer can increase the relaxation time of carriers into the QDs and thus be detrimental to the coherence properties of single and entangled photons. It is important to take it into account while designing QD-based devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confining electrons or holes in quantum dots formed in the channel of industry-standard fully depleted silicon-on-insulator CMOS structures is a promising approach to scalable qubit architectures. In this communication, we present measurement results of a commercial nanostructure fabricated using the GlobalFoundries 22FDX(TM) industrial process. We demonstrate here that quantum dots are formed in the device channel by applying a combination of a back- and gate voltages. We report our results on an effective detuning of the energy levels in the quantum dots by varying the barrier gate voltages in combination with the back-gate voltage. Given the need and importance of scaling to larger numbers of qubits, we demonstrate here the feasibility of single-electron box sensors at the edge of the quantum dot array for effective charge sensing in different operation modes -- sensing charge transitions in a single- and double quantum dots forming the quantum dot array. We also report measurement results demonstrating bias triangle pair formation and precise control over coupled quantum dots with variations in the inter-dot barrier. The reported measurement results demonstrate the ability to control the formation and coupling of multiple quantum dots in a quantum dot array and to sense their charge state via a Single Electron Box sensor in a commercial process for the first time.</description>

      <title>Consequences of magneto-electrical coupling in multiferroic VSe$_{2}$$/$Sc$_{2}$CO$_{2}$ heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures are potential game changers both in understanding the fundamental physics and in the realization of various devices that exploit magnetism at the nanoscale. Multiferroic heterostructures comprising a two-dimensional ferroelectric and a two-dimensional ferromagnet are ideal candidates for electrical control of properties of the ferromagnets that can lead to non-volatile memory devices, for example. Relatively new but immensely promising two-dimensional materials, MXene and transition metal dichalcogenides, can be effectively combined to achieve the goal as both have flexibilities in their structures and compositions that are tunable. In this work, using Density Functional Theory, we have investigated the magneto-electric coupling driven transitions in the electronic ground states of VSe$_{2}$-Sc$_{2}$CO$_{2}$ bi-layer and tri-layer heterostructures. Our results demonstrate that the change in the ferroelectric polarisation in the MXene layer leads to changes in the spin-polarized band structures of the magnetic component VSe$_{2}$ enabling a semiconductor to half-metal transition in these heterostructures. We propose several applications of this magneto-electric coupling in these multiferroic heterostructures that can lead to the efficient operation of Field Effect transistors and achieve non-volatility in memory devices at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>YIG/CoFeB bilayer magnonic diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a magnonic diode based on a bilayer structure of Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) and Cobalt Iron Boron (CoFeB). The bilayer exhibits pronounced non-reciprocal spin-wave propagation, enabled by dipolar coupling and the magnetic properties of the two layers. The YIG layer provides low damping and efficient spin-wave propagation, while the CoFeB layer introduces strong magnetic anisotropy, critical for achieving diode functionality. Experimental results, supported by numerical simulations, show unidirectional propagation of Magnetostatic Surface Spin Waves (MSSW), significantly suppressing backscattered waves. This behavior was confirmed through wavevector-resolved and micro-focused Brillouin Light Scattering measurements and is supported by numerical simulations. The proposed YIG/SiO$_2$/CoFeB bilayer magnonic diode demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging non-reciprocal spin-wave dynamics for functional magnonic devices, paving the way for energy-efficient, wave-based signal processing technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum impurities in finite-temperature Bose gases: Detecting vortex proliferation across the BKT and BEC transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08546v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting vortices in neutral superfluids represents an outstanding experimental challenge. Using stochastic classical-field methods, we theoretically show that a quantum impurity repulsively coupled to a weakly-interacting Bose gas at finite temperature carries direct spectroscopic signatures of vortex proliferation. In two dimensions, we find that a low-energy (attractive) branch in the excitation spectrum becomes prominent when the temperature is tuned across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. We explain this red-shifted resonance as originating from the binding of the impurity to vortices, where the bosons density (and hence, the repulsive Hartree energy) is reduced. This mechanism could be exploited to spectroscopically estimate the BKT transition in excitonic insulators. In contrast, in three dimensions, the impurity spectra reflect the presence of vortex rings well below the condensation temperature, and herald the presence of a thermal gas above the Bose-Einstein condensation transition. Importantly, we expect our results to have impact on the understanding of Bose-polaron formation at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Engineering Majorana Kramers Pairs In Synthetic High Spin Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High spin-Chern-number topological phases provide a promising low-dimensional platform for realizing double-helical edge states. In this letter, we show how these edge states can host a variety of phases driven by electron interaction effects, including multi-channel helical Luttinger liquid, spin density wave, superconducting phases, and a new type of $\pi$-junction analog of the latter two, where the transitions between the phases can be controlled. The superconducting phase in the interacting system is shown to be adiabatically connected to a time-reversal-symmetric topological superconductor in the non-interacting DIII class. This connection stabilizes Majorana Kramers pairs as domain wall states at the interface between the superconducting and $\pi$-spin-density wave phases, with the latter exhibiting a time-reversal-symmetric spin-density wave phase. We discuss the possibility of realizing our proposed scheme for generating Majorana Kramers pairs in a cold-atom based platform with existing techniques, and how it could offer potential advantages over other approaches.</description>

Abstract: A comparative study between zinc oxide graphene-carbon nanotubes nanocomposite and ZnO nanoparticles was carried out to investigate their abilities in the degradation of Rhodamine B dye. We utilized the Modified Hummer method to prepare the graphene oxide nanosheet. Moreover, graphene-carbon nanotubes had been synthesized from GO and multi-walled carbon nanotubes with a hydroxyl group. The hydrothermal method was employed to fabricate the zinc oxide graphene-carbon nanotubes nanocomposite from ZnO nanoparticles and graphene-carbon nanotubes. During the characterization by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), all the significant peaks of ZnO and zinc oxide graphene-carbon nanotubes nanocomposite were found in the same phase angle. In addition, the final nanocomposite was also characterized by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS). Finally, from the dye degradation test, it was apparent that zinc oxide graphene-carbon nanotubes nanocomposite showed superior dye removal ability compared to the ZnO nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Exciton-Polaritons in a Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06952v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate exciton-polaritons in a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor heterostructure, where a static magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the plane. To explore the interplay between magnetic field and a strong light-matter coupling, we employ a fully microscopic theory that explicitly incorporates electrons, holes and photons in a semiconductor microcavity. Furthermore, we exploit a mapping between the 2D harmonic oscillator and the 2D hydrogen atom that allows us to efficiently solve the problem numerically for the entire Rydberg series as well as for the ground-state exciton. In contrast to previous approaches, we can readily obtain the real-space exciton wave functions and we show how they shrink in size with increasing magnetic field, which mirrors their increasing interaction energy and oscillator strength. We compare our theory with recent experiments on exciton-polaritons in GaAs heterostructures in an external magnetic field and we find excellent agreement with the measured polariton energies. Crucially, we are able to capture the observed light-induced changes to the exciton in the regime of very strong light-matter coupling where a perturbative coupled oscillator description breaks down. Our work can guide future experimental efforts to engineer and control Rydberg excitons and exciton-polaritons in a range of 2D materials.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics in response to time-dependent external potentials of the edge modes of a small fractional quantum Hall fluid composed of few particles on a lattice in a bosonic Laughlin-like state at filling {\nu} = 1/2. We show that the nonlinear chiral Luttinger liquid theory provides a quantitatively accurate description even for the small lattices that are available in state-of-the-art experiments, away from the continuum limit. Experimentally-accessible data related to the quantized value of the bulk transverse Hall conductivity are identified both in the linear and the non-linear response to an external excitation. The strong nonlinearity induced by the open boundaries is responsible for sizable quantum blockade effects, leading to the generation of nonclassical states of the edge modes.</description>

Abstract: Quantum heat engines and quantum refrigerators are proposed in three-terminal quantum Hall (QH) and quantum spin Hall (QSH) setups with a voltage-temperature probe in both the linear and nonlinear transport regimes. In the linear response regime, we find that efficiency at maximum power approaches the Van den Broeck limit in both QH and QSH setups. Similarly, in nonlinear response, we find that efficiency at maximum power reaches the Whitney bounds. This is for the first time, we see that in the same setup and using quantum point contacts, the thermoelectric efficiency limits in linear and nonlinear response being achieved.</description>

      <title>Minimal Models and Transport Properties of Unconventional $p$-Wave Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New unconventional compensated magnets with a $p$-wave spin polarization protected by a composite time-reversal translation symmetry have been proposed in the wake of altermagnets. To facilitate the experimental discovery and applications of these unconventional magnets, we construct an effective analytical model. The effective model is based on a minimal tight-binding model for unconventional $p$-wave magnets that clarifies the relation to other magnets with $p$-wave spin-polarized bands. One of the most prominent advantages of our analytical model is the possibility to employ various analytical approaches while capturing essential features of $p$-wave magnets. We illustrate the effective model by evaluating the tunneling conductance in junctions with $p$-wave magnets, revealing a large magnetoresistance, spin filtering, and anisotropic bulk spin conductivity beyond linear response despite the absence of a net magnetization. These results show that unconventional $p$-wave magnets offer several useful functionalities, broadening the material selection for spintronics devices.</description>

Abstract: We consider $30^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer formed by two copies of Haldane model and explore evolution of its properties with varying interlayer coupling strength. Specifically, we compute the system's energy spectrum, its fractal dimensions, topological entanglement entropy, local Chern markers and anomalous Hall conductivity. We find that at weak interlayer coupling, the system remains gapped and retains topological properties of the isolated layers, but at strong interlayer coupling, the system forms a gapless multifractal state. We also establish that anomalous Hall conductivity can be used to characterize the system's topological properties in the same way as a local Chern marker.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic field assisted exciton diffusion in moir\'e superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study exciton energy spectrum and their propagation in moir\'e superlattices formed in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers. In such structures, as a result of weak interlayer interaction, an effective, moir\'e, potential acting on excitons arises. Usually, excitons are considered to be localized in such potential. Here we demonstrate that the coupling of optically active excitons with induced electromagnetic field produces linear in the wavevector energy dispersion even if the quantum mechanical tunneling between the localization sites is suppressed. The effect can be described as a result of the processes of virtual generation-recombination of excitons at the localization sites that results in the $ r^{-3}$ dependence of the transfer matrix element on the intersite distance $r$. Based on the calculated energy spectrum we study exciton propagation in moir\'e superlattices with allowance for the light-exciton interaction. We consider semiclassical diffusion of excitons and take into account exciton-phonon and exciton-static defect scattering. For these mechanisms the diffusion coefficient decreases with increase of the temperature. We also analyze the hopping propagation regime and demonstrate that the temperature dependence of the exciton diffusion coefficient is described by the power-law rather than by an exponential function of the temperature.</description>

      <title>Autonomous demon exploiting heat and information at the trajectory level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an electronic bipartite system consisting of a working substance, in which a refrigeration process is implemented, and of a nonthermal resource region, containing a combination of different thermal baths. In the working substance, heat is extracted from the coldest of two electronic reservoirs (refrigeration) via heat- and particle transport through a quantum dot. This quantum dot of the working substance is capacitively coupled to the resource region. In such a setup, a finite cooling power can be obtained in the working substance, while the energy exchange with the resource region exactly cancels out on average. At the same time, information is always exchanged, even on average, due to the capacitive coupling between the two parts of the bipartite system. The proposed system therefore implements an autonomous demon with fully vanishing heat extraction from the resource. Unlike macroscopic machines, nanoscale machines exhibit large fluctuations in performance, so precision becomes an important performance quantifier. We give a comprehensive description of the thermodynamic performance of the proposed autonomous demon in terms of stochastic trajectories and of full counting statistics and demonstrate that the precision of the cooling power strongly depends on the operation principle of the device. More specifically, the interplay of information flow and counter-balancing heat flows dramatically impacts the trade-off between cooling power, efficiency, and precision. We expect this insight to be of relevance for guiding the design of energy-conversion processes exploiting nonthermal resources.</description>

Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) near the magic angle is a unique platform where the combination of topology and strong correlations gives rise to exotic electronic phases. These phases are gate-tunable and related to the presence of flat electronic bands, isolated by single-particle band gaps. This enables gate-controlled charge confinement, essential for the operation of single-electron transistors (SETs), and allows to explore the interplay of confinement, electron interactions, band renormalisation and the moir\'e superlattice, potentially revealing key paradigms of strong correlations. Here, we present gate-defined SETs in near-magic-angle tBLG with well-tunable Coulomb blockade resonances. These SETs allow to study magnetic field-induced quantum oscillations in the density of states of the source-drain reservoirs, providing insight into gate-tunable Fermi surfaces of tBLG. Comparison with tight-binding calculations highlights the importance of displacement-field-induced band renormalisation crucial for future advanced gate-tunable quantum devices and circuits in tBLG including e.g. quantum dots and Josephson junction arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in semiconductor spin qubits have achieved linear arrays exceeding ten qubits. Moving to two-dimensional (2D) qubit arrays is a critical next step to advance towards fault-tolerant implementations, but it poses substantial fabrication challenges, particularly because enabling control of nearest-neighbor entanglement requires the incorporation of interstitial exchange gates between quantum dots in the qubit architecture. In this work, we present a 2D array of silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) quantum dots with tunable interdot coupling between all adjacent dots. The device is characterized at 4.2 K, where we demonstrate the formation and isolation of double-dot and triple-dot configurations. We show control of all nearest-neighbor tunnel couplings spanning up to 30 decades per volt through the interstitial exchange gates and use advanced modeling tools to estimate the exchange interactions that could be realized among qubits in this architecture. These results represent a significant step towards the development of 2D MOS quantum processors compatible with foundry manufacturing techniques.</description>

      <title>Exact quantization of nonreciprocal quasi-lumped electrical networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following a consistent geometrical description previously introduced in Parra-Rodriguez et al. (2024), we present an exact method for obtaining canonically quantizable Hamiltonian descriptions of nonlinear, nonreciprocal quasi-lumped electrical networks. We identify and classify singularities arising in the quest for Hamiltonian descriptions of general quasi-lumped element networks via the Faddeev-Jackiw technique. We offer systematic solutions to cases previously considered singular--a major challenge in the context of canonical circuit quantization. The solution relies on the correct identification of the reduced classical circuit-state manifold, i.e., a mix of flux and charge fields and functions. Starting from the geometrical description of the transmission line, we provide a complete program including lines coupled to one-port lumped-element networks, as well as multiple lines connected to multiport nonreciprocal lumped-element networks, with intrinsic ultraviolet cutoff. On the way we naturally extend the canonical quantization of transmission lines coupled through frequency-dependent, nonreciprocal linear systems, such as practical circulators. Additionally, we demonstrate how our method seamlessly facilitates the characterization of general nonreciprocal, dissipative linear environments. This is achieved by extending the Caldeira-Leggett formalism, using continuous limits of series of immittance matrices. We provide a tool in the analysis and design of electrical circuits and of special interest in the context of canonical quantization of superconducting networks. For instance, this work will provide a solid ground for a precise non-divergent input-output theory in the presence of nonreciprocal devices, e.g., within (chiral) waveguide QED platforms.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Joule Losses in Memristive Switching Using Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01507</link>

Abstract: This study investigates strategies for minimizing Joule losses in resistive random access memory (ReRAM) cells, which are also referred to as memristive devices. Typically, the structure of ReRAM cells involves a nanoscale layer of resistance-switching material sandwiched between two metal electrodes. The basic question that we ask is what is the optimal driving protocol to switch a memristive device from one state to another. In the case of ideal memristors, in the most basic scenario, the optimal protocol is determined by solving a variational problem without constraints with the help of the Euler-Lagrange equation. In the case of memristive systems, for the same situation, the optimal protocol is found using the method of Lagrange multipliers. We demonstrate the advantages of our approaches through specific examples and compare our results with those of switching with constant voltage or current. Our findings suggest that voltage or current control can be used to reduce Joule losses in emerging memory devices.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependent spin-phonon coupling of boron-vacancy centers in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15493</link>

Abstract: The negatively charged boron-vacancy center ($\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently emerged as a highly promising quantum sensor. Compared to the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, the change with temperature of the spin transition energy of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ is more than an order of magnitude larger, making it a potential nanoscale thermometer with superior sensitivity. However, the underlying mechanism of the observed large temperature dependence remains an open question. In this work, using isotopically purified $\mathrm{h}{}^{10}\mathrm{B}{}^{15}\mathrm{N}$, we systematically characterize the zero-field splitting, hyperfine interaction, and spin relaxation time of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ from 10 to 350$~$K. We carry out first-principle calculations of the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ spin-phonon interaction and show that a second-order effect from finite-temperature phonon excitations is responsible for the observed changes in experiments. By fitting our experimental results to a physically motivated model, we extract the dominant phonon mode which agrees well with our simulations. Finally, we investigate the dynamic nuclear spin polarization process at cryogenic temperatures. Our results provide key insights in $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ centers and their utilization as nanoscale thermometers and phonon sensors.</description>

      <title>Relevance of Anisotropy in the Kondo Effect: Lessons From the Symplectic Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Kondo model with symplectic symmetry was recently put forward as the effective low-energy theory of a superconducting-island device coupled to multiple leads. This model, which possesses non-Fermi liquid physics and effective anyons, was argued to belong to the class of topological Kondo effects. Here, we clarify the extent of stability of its exotic fixed point using perturbative and numerical renormalization group in conjunction with bosonization and conformal field theory. In contrast to previous claims, we show that asymmetry in the coupling to the leads destabilizes the non-Fermi liquid. Other destabilizing perturbations include asymmetry in the superconducting pairing or internal energy of the individual quantum dots in the island. Nevertheless, these perturbations all generate the same relevant operators. Thus, only a small number of couplings need to be tuned individually, and these can be selected according to experimental convenience. Our results highlight a common misconception that anisotropy in single-channel Kondo couplings is always irrelevant. As demonstrated, relevant terms will emerge whenever the group generators do not span the full space of impurity operators. This calls for a more detailed inspection of models that exhibit this property, such as large-spin impurities and SO(M) Kondo models.</description>

      <title>Evolution of flat bands in MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ moir\'e lattices: A study combining machine learning and band unfolding methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e lattices have served as the ideal quantum simulation platform for exploring novel physics due to the flat electronic bands resulting from the long wavelength moir\'e potentials. However, the large sizes of this type of system challenge the first-principles methods for full calculations of their electronic structures, thus bringing difficulties in understanding the nature and evolution of the flat bands. In this study, we investigate the electronic structures of moir\'e patterns of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ by combining ab initio and machine learning methods. We find that a flat band with a bandwidth of about 5 meV emerges below the valence band edge at the K point for the H-stacking at a twist angle of 3.89$^{\circ}$ without spin-orbit coupling effect. Then, it shifts dramatically as the twist angle decreases and becomes about 20 meV higher than the valence band maximum for the twist angle of 3.15$^{\circ}$. Multiple ultra-flat bands emerge as the twist angle is reduced to 1.7$^{\circ}$. The spin-orbit coupling leads to a giant spin splitting comparable to that observed in the untwisted system (about 0.45 eV) and is nearly independent of twisting and stacking. As a result, the K-valley flat band remains the valence band maximum with the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling. Band unfolding reveals that the ultra-flat bands formed by the $\Gamma$ and K valleys show distinct behaviors. The $\Gamma$-valley flat bands are sensitive to the interlayer coupling, thus experiencing dramatic changes as the twist angle decreases. In contrast, the K-valley flat band, which shows a weak dependence on the interlayer coupling, is mainly modulated by structural reconstruction. Therefore, a relatively small angle (2.13$^{\circ}$) is required to generate the K-valley flat band, which experiences a transition from the honeycomb to the triangular lattice as the twist angle decreases.</description>

      <title>Topological Order in the Spectral Riemann Surfaces of Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show topologically ordered states in the complex-valued spectra of non-Hermitian systems. These arise when the distinctive exceptional points in the energy Riemann surfaces of such models are annihilated after threading them across the boundary of the Brillouin zone. This process results in a non-trivially closed branch cut that can be identified with a Fermi arc. Building on an analogy to Kitaev's toric code, these cut lines form non-contractible loops, which parallel the defect lines of the toric-code ground states. Their presence or absence establishes topological order for fully non-degenerate non-Hermitian systems. Excitations above these ground-state analogs are characterized by the occurrence of additional exceptional points. We illustrate the characteristics of the topologically protected states in a non-Hermitian two-band model and provide an outlook toward experimental realizations in metasurfaces and single-photon interferometry.</description>

      <title>Shape and Size-Dependent Surface Plasmonic Resonances of Liquid Metal Alloy (EGaIn) Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liquid metals (LM) are emerging plasmonic nanomaterials with transformable surface plasmon resonances (SPR) due to their liquid-like deformability. This study delves into the plasmonic properties of LM nanoparticles, with a focus on EGaIn (eutectic gallium-indium)-based materials. Leveraging Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations, we explored the localized SPR (LSPR) effects of EGaIn nanoparticles with various shapes, including nanospheres, dimers, nanorods, nanodisks, nanoellipses, nanocubes, and nanocuboids, in the broad range of ultraviolet (UV)-visible-near infrared (NIR) spectrum. EGaIn, known for its unique properties such as low toxicity, negligible vapor pressure, and excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, is appealing in broad wavelength plasmonic applications. In particular, this study reveals uncovered LSPR effects in the visible and NIR wavelength ranges, providing a comprehensive map of LSPR peaks and cross-sections for different shapes of EGaIn nanoparticles. The findings offer insights into correlating EGaIn nanoparticle geometry with their optical properties for diverse applications, ranging from biosensing, nanoelectronics, to optomechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Winding number on 3D lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple numerical method which computes an approximate value of the winding number of a mapping from 3D torus~$T^3$ to the unitary group~$U(N)$, when $T^3$ is approximated by discrete lattice points. Our method consists of a ``tree-level improved'' discretization of the winding number and the gradient flow associated with an ``over-improved'' lattice action. By employing a one-parameter family of mappings from $T^3$ to $SU(2)$ with known winding numbers, we demonstrate that the method works quite well even for coarse lattices, reproducing integer winding numbers in a good accuracy. Our method can trivially be generalized to the case of higher-dimensional tori.</description>

      <title>All-optical polarization control and routing by nonlinear interferometry at the nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces are rapidly establishing as key-enabling platforms for nanophotonics applications. Along with the ability of taming light in subwavelength thicknesses, they can feature multiple functionalities in one device. The generation and control of light polarization by metasurfaces already provided a route towards ultracompact polarimetry devices in the linear regime. If translated to the nonlinear optical regime it may become a key-enabling tool in nonlinear imaging, optical holography and sensing. Here, we report the experimental ultrafast all-optical polarization modulation of upconverted light by all-dielectric metasurfaces via nonlinear interferometry. By controlling the relative phase between a pump beam at $\omega$ and its frequency-double replica at 2$\omega$, we can set the phase relation between two frequency-degenerate upconverted processes at 3$\omega$ $-$ Sum-Frequency Generation (SFG) and Third-Harmonic Generation (THG) $-$ stemming from an AlGaAs metasurface. By exploiting the opposite parity of the two nonlinear process and tuning their relative powers, we can achieve modulation of the polarization states of the light emitted at 3$\omega$ between linear and circular states with a degree of circular polarization (DOCP) up to 83$\%$. In particular, circularly polarized light features opposite handedness symmetrically located in the Fourier space, at coincidence with the first diffraction orders of the metasurface. Moreover, by toggling the phase delay by $\pi$, the handedness can be fully switched between the diffraction. Our work adds an additional layer of modulation in polarization beyond intensity to all-optical routing with precise phase control. The capability to route circular polarization states in the k-space holds significant potential for chiral sensing and advanced imaging techniques.</description>
