      <title>Structure of Banach spaces and besselian Schauder frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize some of the well-known results of Karlin and James to Banach spaces with besselian Schauder frames (then in particular with unconditional Schauder frames). It is well-known that each Banach space with an unconditional Schauder basis has the Pe\l czy\'{n}ski's property (u). Also, that all of the classical Banach spaces ($C(\omega^{\omega})$, $C([0,1])$, $L_{1}([0,1])$, the James's space $\mathcal{J}$, and for each $p\geq q&gt;1$: $K(l_{p},l_{q})$, $l_{p}\otimes_{\pi}l_{q^{*}}$, and $l_{p^{*}}\otimes_{\varepsilon}l_{q}$) have no unconditional Schauder bases. In this paper, we extend these results to Banach spaces with besselian Schauder frames (then in particular with unconditional Schauder frames). Finally, for each Banach space $E$ with a finite dimensional decomposition, we give an explicit method to construct a Schauder frame for $E$. Therefore, the Szarek's famous example becomes an example of a Banach space with a Schauder frame which fails to have a Schauder basis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note we present a far generalization of the following very well-known assertion: assume that we have two orthonormal sequences in a Hilbert space and these sequences are quadratically close to each other. Then if one of these sequences is a basis in the Hilbert space then so is the other one.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic symmetrization, convex bodies, and isoperimetric inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with a P\'olya-Szeg\"o type inequality for anisotropic functionals of Sobolev functions. The relevant inequality entails a double-symmetrization involving both trial functions and functionals. A new approach that uncovers geometric aspects of the inequality is proposed. It relies upon anisotropic isoperimetric inequalities, fine properties of Sobolev functions, and results from the Brunn-Minkowski theory of convex bodies. Importantly, unlike previously available proofs, the one offered in this paper does not require approximation arguments and hence allows for a characterization of extremal functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We completely characterize the bounded composition operators $C_\phi f=f\circ\phi$ on the Paley-Wiener spaces $B^2_{\sigma}$ for $\sigma&gt;0$ that are self-adjoint, unitary, cohyponormal, normal, complex symmetric and hypercyclic. Moreover, we show that if $\phi(0)\notin \mathbb{R}$ or $\phi(0)\in \mathbb{R}$ with $0&lt;|\phi(0)|\leq 1$ (for this case, $\sigma&lt;\pi$) then $C_{\phi}$ is cyclic on $B^2_{\sigma}.$</description>

      <title>The W-weighted m-weak group MP inverse and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the concept of the m-weak group MP inverse of a square matrix to a rectangular matrix, called the W-weighted m-weak group MP inverse, which also unifies the W-weighted weak core inverse and W-weighted DMP inverse. Some properties, characterizations and representations of this new generalized inverse are shown. Additionally, applications of the W-weighted weak group MP inverse are given in solving a constrained optimization problem and a class of consistent matrix equations.</description>

      <title>Spectral set, complete spectral set and dilation for Banach space operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Famous results due to von Neumann, Sz.-Nagy and Arveson assert that the following four statements are equivalent; a Hilbert space operator $T$ is a contraction; the closed unit disk $\overline{\mathbb D}$ is a spectral set for $T$; $T$ can be dilated to a Hilbert space isometry; $\overline{\mathbb D}$ is a complete spectral set for $T$. In this article, we show by counter examples that no two of them are equivalent for Banach space operators. If $\mathcal F_r$ is the family of all Banach space operators having norm less than or equal to $r$ and if $D_R$ denotes the open disk in the complex plane with centre at the origin and radius $R$, then we prove by an application of Bohr's theorem that $\overline{D}_R$ is the minimal spectral set for $\mathcal F_r$ if and only if $r=\frac{R}{3}$. Also, we prove the equivalence of the following two facts: the Bohr radius of $D_R$ is $\frac{R}{3}$ and $\sup \{ r&gt;0\,:\, \overline{D}_R \text{ is a spectral set for } \mathcal F_r \}=\frac{R}{3}$. We found several new characterizations for a Hilbert space in terms of spectral set and complete spectral set for different operators.</description>

      <title>Classification of abelian finite-dimensional $C^*$-algebras by orthogonality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of the article is to prove that if $\mathcal A_1$ and $\mathcal A_2$ are Birkhoff-James isomorphic $C^*$-algebras over the fields $\mathbb F_1$ and $\mathbb F_2$, respectively and if $\mathcal A_1$ finite-dimensional, abelian of dimension greater than one, then $\mathbb F_1=\mathbb F_2$ and $\mathcal A_1$ and $\mathcal A_2$ are (isometrically) $\ast$-isomorphic $C^*$-algebras. Furthermore, it is also proved that for a finite-dimensional $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal A$, we have $\mathcal L_{\mathcal A}^\bot$ is the sum of minimal ideals which are not skew-fields and $\mathcal L_{\mathcal A}^{\bot\bot}$ is the sum of minimal ideals which are skew-fields, where $\mathcal L_{\mathcal A}$ denotes the set of all left-symmetric elements in $\mathcal A$ and for any subset $\mathcal S\subseteq \mathcal A$, the set $\mathcal S^\bot$ represents the set of all elements of $\mathcal A$ which are Birkhoff-James orthogonal to $\mathcal S$. A procedure to extract the minimal ideals which are (commutative) fields is also given.</description>

      <title>Metaplectic Quantum Time--Frequency Analysis, Operator Reconstruction and Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of identifying and reconstructing operators from a diagonal of the Gabor matrix is considered. The framework of Quantum Time--Frequency Analysis is used, wherein this problem is equivalent to the discretisation of the diagonal of the polarised Cohen's class of the operator. Metaplectic geometry allows the generalisation of conditions on appropriate operators, giving sets of operators which can be reconstructed and identified on the diagonal of the discretised polarised Cohen's class of the operator.</description>

      <title>Functions of self-adjoint operators under relatively bounded and relatively trace class perturbations. Relatively operator Lipschitz functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of functions of self-adjoint operators under relatively bounded and relatively trace class perturbation We introduce and study the class of relatively operator Lipschitz functions. An essential role is played by double operator integrals. We also consider study the class of resolvent Lipschitz functions. Then we obtain a trace formula in the case of relatively trace class perturbations and show that the maximal class of function for which the trace formula holds in the case of relatively trace class perturbations coincides with the class of relatively operator Lipschitz functions. Our methods also gives us a new approach to the inequality $\int|\boldsymbol{\xi}(t)|(1+|t|)^{-1}\,{\rm d}t&lt;\infty$ for the spectral shift function $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ in the case of relatively trace class perturbations.</description>

      <title>J-contractive operator valued functions, vector valued de Branges spaces and functional models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) which are constructed from \( J \)-contractive operator valued analytic functions on the upper half plane. First, we discuss the Potapov-Ginzburg transform of a specific class of Fredholm operators, investigate some of its properties, and outline sufficient conditions for a \( J \)-contractive operator to be \( J \)-bicontractive. Subsequently, we construct certain classes of vector valued de Branges spaces and aim to explore the significance of these classes. Using these spaces, we present a functional model for simple Volterra operator nodes. Additionally, we analyze their connections with another classes of de Branges spaces which are based on a pair of Fredholm operator valued analytic functions. Finally, we discuss a functional model for simple, closed, densely defined, symmetric operators with infinite deficiency indices within this framework.</description>

      <title>Invariant subspaces for finite index shifts in Hardy spaces and the invariant subspace problem for finite defect operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we characterize (in terms of inner functions and determinants of certain matrices) the closed subspaces of finite direct sums of $H^2(\mathbb D)$ which are invariant under the shift, thus obtaining a concrete Beurling-type theorem for the finite index shift. Using this characterization we prove that none of such subspaces can be maximal but those of codimension one. By the universality of the shifts it follows that if $X$ is a separable Hilbert space, $T:X\to X$ a bounded linear operator such that $\dim \overline{(I-T^\ast T)X}&lt;\infty$ and $M\subset X$ is a closed $T$-invariant space of dimension greater that one, then there exists a closed $T$-invariant subspace $N\neq\{0\}$ such that $N\subsetneq M$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate theoretically the behavior of Meyer's image cartoon + texture decomposition model. Our main results is a new theorem which shows that, by combining the decomposition model and a well chosen Littlewood-Paley filter, it is possible to extract almost perfectly a certain class of textures. This theorem leads us to the construction of a parameterless multiscale texture separation algorithm. Finally, we propose to extend this algorithm into a directional multiscale texture separation algorithm by designing a directional Littlewood-Paley filter bank. Several experiments show the efficiency of the proposed method both on synthetic and real images.</description>

      <title>The standard $L$-function attached to a vector valued modular form</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define two $L$-functions associated to a common vector valued eigenform $f$ transforming with the ``finite'' Weil representation. The first one can be seen as a standard zeta function defined by the eigenvalues of $f$. The second one can be interpreted as standard $L$-function defined as an Euler product where each $p$-factor is a rational function in terms of two unramified characters of the $p$-adic field $\Q_p$. We show that both $L$-functions are related and prove further that they both can be continued meromorphically to the whole complex $s$-plane.</description>

      <title>How Analysis Can Teach Us the Optimal Way to Design Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematics-informed approach to neural operator design, building upon the theoretical framework established in our prior work. By integrating rigorous mathematical analysis with practical design strategies, we aim to enhance the stability, convergence, generalization, and computational efficiency of neural operators. We revisit key theoretical insights, including stability in high dimensions, exponential convergence, and universality of neural operators. Based on these insights, we provide detailed design recommendations, each supported by mathematical proofs and citations. Our contributions offer a systematic methodology for developing next-gen neural operators with improved performance and reliability.</description>

      <title>Collocation method for a functional equation arising in behavioral sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a nonlocal functional equation that is a generalization of the mathematical model used in behavioral sciences. The equation is built upon an operator that introduces a convex combination and a nonlinear mixing of the function arguments. We show that, provided some growth conditions of the coefficients, there exists a unique solution in the natural Lipschitz space. Furthermore, we prove that the regularity of the solution is inherited from the smoothness properties of the coefficients.
  As a natural numerical method to solve the general case, we consider the collocation scheme of piecewise linear functions. We prove that the method converges with the error bounded by the error of projecting the Lipschitz function onto the piecewise linear polynomial space. Moreover, provided sufficient regularity of the coefficients, the scheme is of the second order measured in the supremum norm.
  A series of numerical experiments verify the proved claims and show that the implementation is computationally cheap and exceeds the frequently used Picard iteration by orders of magnitude in the calculation time.</description>

      <title>H\"ormander's Inequality and Point Evaluations in de Branges Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f$ be an entire function of finite exponential type less than or equal to $\sigma$ which is bounded by $1$ on the real axis and satisfies $f(0) = 1$. Under these assumptions H\"ormander showed that $f$ cannot decay faster than $\cos(\sigma x)$ on the interval $(-\pi/\sigma,\pi/\sigma)$. We extend this result to the setting of de Branges spaces with cosine replaced by the real part of the associated Hermite-Biehler function. We apply this result to study the point evaluation functional and associated extremal functions in de Branges spaces (equivalently in model spaces generated by meromorphic inner functions) generalizing some recent results of Brevig, Chirre, Ortega-Cerd\`a, and Seip.</description>

      <title>Meyers inequality and strong stability for stable-like operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:1207.2715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\alpha\in (0,2)$, let $${\cal E}(u,u)=\int_{\Bbb R^d}\int_{\Bbb R^d} (u(y)-u(x))^2\frac{A(x,y)}{|x-y|^{d+\alpha}}\, dy\, dx$$ be the Dirichlet form for a stable-like operator, let $$\Gamma u(x)=\int_{\Bbb R^d} (u(y)-u(x))^2\frac{A(x,y)}{|x-y|^{d+\alpha}}\, dy,$$ let $L$ be the associated infinitesimal generator, and suppose $A(x,y)$ is jointly measurable, symmetric, bounded, and bounded below by a positive constant. We prove that if $u$ is the weak solution to $Lu=h$, then $\Gamma u\in L^p$ for some $p&gt;2$. This is the analogue of an inequality of Meyers for solutions to divergence form elliptic equations. As an application, we prove strong stability results for stable-like operators. If $A$ is perturbed slightly, we give explicit bounds on how much the semigroup and fundamental solution are perturbed.</description>

      <title>Orthogonality questions in the Hardy space related to $\zeta$-zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.05030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Hardy space approach to the Nyman-Beurling and B\'aez-Duarte criterion for the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) was introduced recently in [18] and further developed in [13]. It states that the RH holds if and only if a particular sequence of functions $(h_k)_{k\geq 2}$ is complete in the Hardy space $H^2$. This article is concerned with orthogonality questions related to the family $(h_k)_{k\geq 2}$. The first goal is to analyze the orthogonal complement of $\mathcal{N}=\mathrm{span}(h_k)_{k\geq 2}$ in $H^2$. Unbounded Toeplitz operators on $H^p$ spaces and de Branges-Rovnyak spaces play a central role and our results show that the size and dimension of $\mathcal{N}^\perp$ reveal information on the zeros of the Riemann $\zeta$-function. The second goal is to show that $(h_k)_{k\geq 2}$ possesses a complete biorthogonal sequence in $H^2$. We also discuss a folklore conjecture about the number of $\zeta$-zeros if the RH fails.</description>

      <title>Density of compactly supported smooth functions $C_C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)$ in Musielak-Orlicz-Sobolev spaces $W^{1,\Phi}(\Omega)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate here the density of the set of the restrictions from $C_C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)$ to $C_C^\infty(\Omega)$ in the Musielak-Orlicz-Sobolev space $W^{1,\Phi}(\Omega)$. It is a continuation of article \cite{KamZyl3}, where we have studied density of $C_C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)$ in $W^{k, \Phi}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for $k\in\mathbb{N}$. The main theorem states that for an open subset $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ with its boundary of class $C^1$, and Musielak-Orlicz function $\Phi$ satisfying {\rm condition (A1)} which is a sort of log-H\"older continuity and the growth condition $\Delta_2$, the set of restrictions of functions from $C_C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d) $ to $\Omega$ is dense in $W^{1,\Phi}(\Omega)$. We obtain a corresponding result in variable exponent Sobolev space $W^{1,p(\cdot)}(\Omega)$ under the assumption that the exponent $p(x)$ is essentially bounded on $\Omega$ and $\Phi(x,t) = t^{p(x)}$, $t\ge 0$, $x\in\Omega$, satisfies the log-H\"older condition.</description>

Abstract: Rational inner functions are a generalization of finite Blaschke products to several variables.

      <description>arXiv:2410.21030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main result of our paper offers an alternative, simpler, proof of Mallat's result on the translation invariance of the limiting behavior of sequences of Wavelet Scattering Transforms, which (unlike Mallat's proof) does not rely on the admissibility condition or on the density of a logarithmic Sobolev space in $L^2$. Furthermore, this result is generalized to a broader class of scattering transforms, including, for instance, a modification of the Fourier Scattering Transform. As a result, we also prove a new upper bound for the translation contraction for the Fourier Scattering Transform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17468v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schneider introduced an inter-dimensional difference body operator on convex bodies and proved an associated inequality. In the prequel to this work, we showed that this concept can be extended to a rich class of operators from convex geometry and proved the associated isoperimetric inequalities. The role of cosine-like operators, which generate convex bodies in $\mathbb R^n$ from those in $\mathbb R^n$, were replaced by inter-dimensional simplicial operators, which generate convex bodies in $\mathbb R^{nm}$ from those in $\mathbb R^{n}$ (or vice versa). In this work, we treat the $L^p$ extensions of these operators, and, furthermore, extend the role of the simplex to arbitrary $m$-dimensional convex bodies containing the origin. We establish $m$th-order $L^p$ isoperimetric inequalities, including the $m$th-order versions of the $L^p$ Petty projection inequality, $L^p$ Busemann-Petty centroid inequality, $L^p$ Santal\'o inequalities, and $L^p$ affine Sobolev inequalities. As an application, we obtain isoperimetric inequalities for the volume of the operator norm of linear functionals $(\mathbb R^n, \|\cdot\|_E) \to (\mathbb R^m, \|\cdot\|_F)$.</description>

      <title>Restrictions of pure states to subspaces of $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through the lens of noncommutative function theory, we study restrictions of pure states to unital subspaces of $C^*$-algebras, in the spirit of the Kadison--Singer question. More precisely, given a unital subspace $M$ of a $C^*$-algebra $B$, the fundamental problem is to describe those pure states $\omega$ on $B$ for which $E_\omega=\{\omega\}$, where $E_\omega$ is the set of states on $B$ extending $\omega|_M$. In other words, we aim to understand when $\omega|_M$ admits a unique extension to a state on $B$. We find that the obvious necessary condition that $\omega|_M$ also be pure is sufficient in some naturally occurring examples, but not in general. Guided by classical results for spaces of continuous functions, we then turn to noncommutative peaking phenomena, and to the several variations on noncommutative peak points that have previously appeared in the literature. We perform a thorough analysis of these various notions, illustrating that all of them are in fact distinct, addressing their existence and, in some cases, their relative abundance. Notably, we find that none of the pre-existing notions provide a solution to our main problem. We are thus naturally led to introduce a new type of peaking behaviour for $\omega$, namely that the set $E_\omega$ be what we call a "pinnacle set". Roughly speaking, our main result is that $\omega|_M$ admits a unique extension to $B$ if and only if $E_\omega$ is an $M$-pinnacle set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr E$ be a Hilbert $\mathscr A$-module over a $C^*$-algebra $\mathscr A$. For each positive linear functional $\omega$ on $\mathscr A$, we consider the localization $\mathscr E_\omega$ of $\mathscr E$, which is the completion of the quotient space $\mathscr E/\mathscr {N}_\omega$, where $\mathscr N_\omega=\{x\in \mathscr E:\omega\langle x,x\rangle=0\}$. Let $\mathscr H$ and $\mathscr K$ be closed submodules of $\mathscr E$ such that $\mathscr H\cap \mathscr K$ is orthogonally complemented, and let $\omega=\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\lambda_j\omega_j$, where $\lambda_j&gt;0$, $\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\lambda_j=1$, and $\omega_j$'s are positive linear functionals on $\mathscr A$. We prove that if $(\mathscr H\cap \mathscr K)_{\omega_j}=\mathscr H_{\omega_j}\cap \mathscr K_{\omega_j}$ for each $j$, then \[ (\mathscr H\cap \mathscr K)_\omega=\mathscr H_\omega\cap \mathscr K_\omega\,. \] Furthermore, let $\mathscr L$ be a closed submodule of a Hilbert $\mathscr A$-module $\mathscr E$ over a $W^*$-algebra $\mathscr A$. We pose the following separation problem: ``Does there exist a normal state $\omega$ such that $\iota_\omega (\mathscr L)$ is not dense in $\mathscr E_\omega $?'' In this paper, among other results, we give an affirmative answer to this problem, when $\mathscr E$ is a self-dual Hilbert $C^*$-module over a $W^*$-algebra $\mathscr A$ such that $\mathscr E\backslash \mathscr L$ has a nonempty interior with respect to the weak$^*$-topology. This is a step toward answering the above problem.</description>

      <title>New matrix perturbation bounds via combinatorial expansion I: Perturbation of eigenspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20207v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix perturbation bounds (such as Weyl and Davis-Kahan) are frequently used in many branches of mathematics. Most of the classical results in this area are optimal, in the worst case analysis. However, in modern applications, both the ground and the nose matrices frequently have extra structural properties. For instance, it is often assumed that the ground matrix is essentially low rank, and the nose matrix is random or pseudo-random. We aim to rebuild a part of perturbation theory, adapting to these modern assumptions. The key idea is to exploit the skewness between the leading eigenvectors of the ground matrix and the noise matrix. We will do this by combining the classical contour integration method with combinatorial ideas, resulting in a new machinery, which has a wide range of applications. Our new bounds are optimal under mild assumptions, with direct applications to central problems in many different areas. Among others, we derive a sharp result for the perturbation of a low rank matrix with random perturbation, answering an open question in this area. Next, we derive new, optimal, results concerning covariance estimator of the spiked model, an important model in statistics, bridging two different directions of current research. Finally, and somewhat unexpectedly, we can use our results on the perturbation of eigenspaces to derive new results concerning eigenvalues of deterministic and random matrices. In particular, we obtain new results concerning the outliers in the deformed Wigner model and the least singular value of random matrices with non-zero mean.</description>

      <title>Bishop-Phelps Type Scalarization for Vector Optimization in Real Topological-Linear Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that scalarization techniques (e.g., in the sense of Gerstewitz; Kasimbeyli; Pascoletti and Serafini; Zaffaroni) are useful for generating (weakly, properly) efficient solutions of vector optimization problems. One recognized approach is the conic scalarization method in vector optimization in real normed spaces proposed by Kasimbeyli (2010, SIAM J Optim 20), which is based on augmented dual cones and Bishop-Phelps type (norm-linear) scalarizing functions. In this paper, we present new results on cone separation in real topological-linear spaces by using Bishop-Phelps type separating cones / separating seminorm-linear functions. Moreover, we study some extensions of known scalarization results in vector optimization (in the sense of Eichfelder; Gerstewitz; Jahn; Kasimbeyli; Pascoletti and Serafini). On this basis, we propose a Bishop-Phelps type scalarization method for vector optimization problems in real topological-linear spaces, which can be seen as an extension of Kasimbeyli's conic scalarization method in real normed spaces. Within this framework, we derive new Bishop-Phelps type scalarization results for the concepts of weak efficiency and different types of proper efficiency.</description>

      <title>Three radii associated to Schur functions on the polydisk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article examines three radii associated to bounded analytic functions on the polydisk: the well-known Bohr radius, the Bohr-Agler radius, and the Schur-Agler radius. We prove explicit upper and lower bounds for the Bohr-Agler radius, an explicit lower bound for the Schur-Agler radius, and an asymptotic upper bound for the Schur-Agler radius. The Bohr-Agler radius obeys the same (known) asymptotic as the Bohr radius while we show the Schur-Agler radius is roughly of the same growth as the Bohr radius. As a corollary, we bound the Bohr radius on the bidisk below by 0.3006. Finally, we improve some estimates of P.G.
