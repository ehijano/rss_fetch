      <title>Scalable extensions to given-data Sobol' index estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given-data methods for variance-based sensitivity analysis have significantly advanced the feasibility of Sobol' index computation for computationally expensive models and models with many inputs. However, the limitations of existing methods still preclude their application to models with an extremely large number of inputs. In this work, we present practical extensions to the existing given-data Sobol' index method, which allow variance-based sensitivity analysis to be efficiently performed on large models such as neural networks, which have $&gt;10^4$ parameterizable inputs. For models of this size, holding all input-output evaluations simultaneously in memory -- as required by existing methods -- can quickly become impractical. These extensions also support nonstandard input distributions with many repeated values, which are not amenable to equiprobable partitions employed by existing given-data methods.
  Our extensions include a general definition of the given-data Sobol' index estimator with arbitrary partition, a streaming algorithm to process input-output samples in batches, and a heuristic to filter out small indices that are indistinguishable from zero indices due to statistical noise. We show that the equiprobable partition employed in existing given-data methods can introduce significant bias into Sobol' index estimates even at large sample sizes and provide numerical analyses that demonstrate why this can occur. We also show that our streaming algorithm can achieve comparable accuracy and runtimes with lower memory requirements, relative to current methods which process all samples at once. We demonstrate our novel developments on two application problems in neural network modeling.</description>

      <title>Global Optimization of Stochastic Black-Box Functions with Arbitrary Noise Distributions using Wilson Score Kernel Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many optimization problems in robotics involve the optimization of time-expensive black-box functions, such as those involving complex simulations or evaluation of real-world experiments. Furthermore, these functions are often stochastic as repeated experiments are subject to unmeasurable disturbances. Bayesian optimization can be used to optimize such methods in an efficient manner by deploying a probabilistic function estimator to estimate with a given confidence so that regions of the search space can be pruned away. Consequently, the success of the Bayesian optimization depends on the function estimator's ability to provide informative confidence bounds. Existing function estimators require many function evaluations to infer the underlying confidence or depend on modeling of the disturbances. In this paper, it is shown that the confidence bounds provided by the Wilson Score Kernel Density Estimator (WS-KDE) are applicable as excellent bounds to any stochastic function with an output confined to the closed interval [0;1] regardless of the distribution of the output. This finding opens up the use of WS-KDE for stable global optimization on a wider range of cost functions. The properties of WS-KDE in the context of Bayesian optimization are demonstrated in simulation and applied to the problem of automated trap design for vibrational part feeders.</description>

      <title>Low-degree lower bounds via almost orthonormal bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-degree polynomials have emerged as a powerful paradigm for providing evidence of statistical-computational gaps across a variety of high-dimensional statistical models [Wein25]. For detection problems -- where the goal is to test a planted distribution $\mathbb{P}'$ against a null distribution $\mathbb{P}$ with independent components -- the standard approach is to bound the advantage using an $\mathbb{L}^2(\mathbb{P})$-orthonormal family of polynomials. However, this method breaks down for estimation tasks or more complex testing problems where $\mathbb{P}$ has some planted structures, so that no simple $\mathbb{L}^2(\mathbb{P})$-orthogonal polynomial family is available. To address this challenge, several technical workarounds have been proposed [SW22,SW25], though their implementation can be delicate. In this work, we propose a more direct proof strategy. Focusing on random graph models, we construct a basis of polynomials that is almost orthonormal under $\mathbb{P}$, in precisely those regimes where statistical-computational gaps arise. This almost orthonormal basis not only yields a direct route to establishing low-degree lower bounds, but also allows us to explicitly identify the polynomials that optimize the low-degree criterion. This, in turn, provides insights into the design of optimal polynomial-time algorithms. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by recovering known low-degree lower bounds, and establishing new ones for problems such as hidden subcliques, stochastic block models, and seriation models.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Estimation using Variance-Gated Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluation of per-sample uncertainty quantification from neural networks is essential for decision-making involving high-risk applications. A common approach is to use the predictive distribution from Bayesian or approximation models and decompose the corresponding predictive uncertainty into epistemic (model-related) and aleatoric (data-related) components. However, additive decomposition has recently been questioned. In this work, we propose an intuitive framework for uncertainty estimation and decomposition based on the signal-to-noise ratio of class probability distributions across different model predictions. We introduce a variance-gated measure that scales predictions by a confidence factor derived from ensembles. We use this measure to discuss the existence of a collapse in the diversity of committee machines.</description>

      <title>Instance-Optimal Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update and Its Quantum Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update (MMWU) is a seminal online learning algorithm with numerous applications. Applied to the matrix version of the Learning from Expert Advice (LEA) problem on the $d$-dimensional spectraplex, it is well known that MMWU achieves the minimax-optimal regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T\log d})$, where $T$ is the time horizon. In this paper, we present an improved algorithm achieving the instance-optimal regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T\cdot S(X||d^{-1}I_d)})$, where $X$ is the comparator in the regret, $I_d$ is the identity matrix, and $S(\cdot||\cdot)$ denotes the quantum relative entropy. Furthermore, our algorithm has the same computational complexity as MMWU, indicating that the improvement in the regret bound is ``free''.
  Technically, we first develop a general potential-based framework for matrix LEA, with MMWU being its special case induced by the standard exponential potential. Then, the crux of our analysis is a new ``one-sided'' Jensen's trace inequality built on a Laplace transform technique, which allows the application of general potential functions beyond exponential to matrix LEA. Our algorithm is finally induced by an optimal potential function from the vector LEA problem, based on the imaginary error function.
  Complementing the above, we provide a memory lower bound for matrix LEA, and explore the applications of our algorithm in quantum learning theory. We show that it outperforms the state of the art for learning quantum states corrupted by depolarization noise, random quantum states, and Gibbs states. In addition, applying our algorithm to linearized convex losses enables predicting nonlinear quantum properties, such as purity, quantum virtual cooling, and R\'{e}nyi-$2$ correlation.</description>

      <title>Similarity-based Outlier Detection for Noisy Object Re-Identification Using Beta Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise, which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection (OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy, contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%), demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios. The implementation of Beta-SOD is available at: https://github.com/waqar3411/Beta-SOD</description>

      <title>STRIDE: Scalable and Interpretable XAI via Subset-Free Functional Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most explainable AI (XAI) frameworks face two practical limitations: the exponential cost of reasoning over feature subsets and the reduced expressiveness of summarizing effects as single scalar values. We present STRIDE, a scalable framework that aims to mitigate both issues by framing explanation as a subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal functional decomposition in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Rather than focusing only on scalar attributions, STRIDE computes functional components f_S(x_S) via an analytical projection scheme based on a recursive kernel-centering procedure, avoiding explicit subset enumeration. In the tabular setups we study, the approach is model-agnostic, provides both local and global views, and is supported by theoretical results on orthogonality and L^2 convergence under stated assumptions. On public tabular benchmarks in our environment, we observed speedups ranging from 0.6 times (slower than TreeSHAP on a small dataset) to 9.7 times (California), with a median approximate 3.0 times across 10 datasets, while maintaining high fidelity (R^2 between 0.81 and 0.999) and substantial rank agreement on most datasets. Overall, STRIDE complements scalar attribution methods by offering a structured functional perspective, enabling novel diagnostics like 'component surgery' to quantitatively measure the impact of specific interactions within our experimental scope.</description>

      <title>Expressive Power of Deep Networks on Manifolds: Simultaneous Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in scientific machine learning is solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex domains, where the curved geometry complicates the approximation of functions and their derivatives required by differential operators. This paper establishes the first simultaneous approximation theory for deep neural networks on manifolds. We prove that a constant-depth $\mathrm{ReLU}^{k-1}$ network with bounded weights--a property that plays a crucial role in controlling generalization error--can approximate any function in the Sobolev space $\mathcal{W}_p^{k}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ to an error of $\varepsilon$ in the $\mathcal{W}_p^{s}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ norm, for $k\geq 3$ and $s&lt;k$, using $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-d/(k-s)})$ nonzero parameters, a rate that overcomes the curse of dimensionality by depending only on the intrinsic dimension $d$. These results readily extend to functions in H\"older-Zygmund spaces. We complement this result with a matching lower bound, proving our construction is nearly optimal by showing the required number of parameters matches up to a logarithmic factor. Our proof of the lower bound introduces novel estimates for the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension and pseudo-dimension of the network's high-order derivative classes. These complexity bounds provide a theoretical cornerstone for learning PDEs on manifolds involving derivatives. Our analysis reveals that the network architecture leverages a sparse structure to efficiently exploit the manifold's low-dimensional geometry.</description>

      <title>Euclidean Distance Deflation Under High-Dimensional Heteroskedastic Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pairwise Euclidean distance calculation is a fundamental step in many machine learning and data analysis algorithms. In real-world applications, however, these distances are frequently distorted by heteroskedastic noise$\unicode{x2014}$a prevalent form of inhomogeneous corruption characterized by variable noise magnitudes across data observations. Such noise inflates the computed distances in a nontrivial way, leading to misrepresentations of the underlying data geometry. In this work, we address the tasks of estimating the noise magnitudes per observation and correcting the pairwise Euclidean distances under heteroskedastic noise. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that in general high-dimensional settings and without assuming prior knowledge on the clean data structure or noise distribution, both tasks can be performed reliably, even when the noise levels vary considerably. Specifically, we develop a principled, hyperparameter-free approach that jointly estimates the noise magnitudes and corrects the distances. We provide theoretical guarantees for our approach, establishing probabilistic bounds on the estimation errors of both noise magnitudes and distances. These bounds, measured in the normalized $\ell_1$ norm, converge to zero at polynomial rates as both feature dimension and dataset size increase. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method accurately estimates distances in challenging regimes, significantly improving the robustness of subsequent distance-based computations. Notably, when applied to single-cell RNA sequencing data, our method yields noise magnitude estimates consistent with an established prototypical model, enabling accurate nearest neighbor identification that is fundamental to many downstream analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes the first polynomial convergence rates for Gaussian kernel ridge regression (KRR) with a fixed hyperparameter in both the uniform and the $L^{2}$-norm. The uniform convergence result closes a gap in the theoretical understanding of KRR with the Gaussian kernel, where no such rates were previously known. In addition, we prove a polynomial $L^{2}$-convergence rate in the case, where the Gaussian kernel's width parameter is fixed. This also contributes to the broader understanding of smooth kernels, for which previously only sub-polynomial $L^{2}$-rates were known in similar settings. Together, these results provide new theoretical justification for the use of Gaussian KRR with fixed hyperparameters in nonparametric regression.</description>

      <title>The Information Dynamics of Generative Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of models in machine learning, yet a unified theoretical understanding of their operation is still developing. This paper provides an integrated perspective on generative diffusion by connecting their dynamic, information-theoretic, and thermodynamic properties under a unified mathematical framework. We demonstrate that the rate of conditional entropy production during generation (i.e. the generative bandwidth) is directly governed by the expected divergence of the score function's vector field. This divergence, in turn, is linked to the branching of trajectories and generative bifurcations, which we characterize as symmetry-breaking phase transitions in the energy landscape. This synthesis offers a powerful insight: the process of generation is fundamentally driven by the controlled, noise-induced breaking of (approximate) symmetries, where peaks in information transfer correspond to critical transitions between possible outcomes. The score function acts as a dynamic non-linear filter that regulates the bandwidth of the noise by suppressing fluctuations that are incompatible with the data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As decentralized AI and edge intelligence become increasingly prevalent, ensuring robustness and trustworthiness in such distributed settings has become a critical issue-especially in the presence of corrupted or adversarial data. Traditional decentralized algorithms are vulnerable to data contamination as they typically rely on simple statistics (e.g., means or sum), motivating the need for more robust statistics. In line with recent work on decentralized estimation of trimmed means and ranks, we develop gossip algorithms for computing a broad class of rank-based statistics, including L-statistics and rank statistics-both known for their robustness to outliers. We apply our method to perform robust distributed two-sample hypothesis testing, introducing the first gossip algorithm for Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. We provide rigorous convergence guarantees, including the first convergence rate bound for asynchronous gossip-based rank estimation. We empirically validate our theoretical results through experiments on diverse network topologies.</description>

      <title>Iterative Methods for Full-Scale Gaussian Process Approximations for Large Spatial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14492v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes are flexible probabilistic regression models which are widely used in statistics and machine learning. However, a drawback is their limited scalability to large data sets. To alleviate this, full-scale approximations (FSAs) combine predictive process methods and covariance tapering, thus approximating both global and local structures. We show how iterative methods can be used to reduce computational costs in calculating likelihoods, gradients, and predictive distributions with FSAs. In particular, we introduce a novel preconditioner and show theoretically and empirically that it accelerates the conjugate gradient method's convergence speed and mitigates its sensitivity with respect to the FSA parameters and the eigenvalue structure of the original covariance matrix, and we demonstrate empirically that it outperforms a state-of-the-art pivoted Cholesky preconditioner. Furthermore, we introduce an accurate and fast way to calculate predictive variances using stochastic simulation and iterative methods. In addition, we show how our newly proposed FITC preconditioner can also be used in iterative methods for Vecchia approximations. In our experiments, it outperforms existing state-of-the-art preconditioners for Vecchia approximations. All methods are implemented in a free C++ software library with high-level Python and R packages.</description>

Abstract: The phenomenon of double descent has challenged the traditional bias-variance trade-off in supervised learning but remains unexplored in unsupervised learning, with some studies arguing for its absence. In this study, we first demonstrate analytically that double descent does not occur in linear unsupervised autoencoders (AEs). In contrast, we show for the first time that both double and triple descent can be observed with nonlinear AEs across various data models and architectural designs. We examine the effects of partial sample and feature noise and highlight the importance of bottleneck size in influencing the double descent curve. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, we uncover model-wise, epoch-wise, and sample-wise double descent across several data types and architectures. Our findings indicate that over-parameterized models not only improve reconstruction but also enhance performance in downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and domain adaptation, highlighting their practical value in complex real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Disentanglement under Dependent Factors of Variation</title>

Abstract: Representation learning is an approach that allows to discover and extract the factors of variation from the data. Intuitively, a representation is said to be disentangled if it separates the different factors of variation in a way that is understandable to humans. Definitions of disentanglement and metrics to measure it usually assume that the factors of variation are independent of each other. However, this is generally false in the real world, which limits the use of these definitions and metrics to very specific and unrealistic scenarios. In this paper we give a definition of disentanglement based on information theory that is also valid when the factors of variation are not independent. Furthermore, we relate this definition to the Information Bottleneck Method. Finally, we propose a method to measure the degree of disentanglement from the given definition that works when the factors of variation are not independent. We show through different experiments that the method proposed in this paper correctly measures disentanglement with non-independent factors of variation, while other methods fail in this scenario.</description>

      <title>Average Causal Effect Estimation in DAGs with Hidden Variables: Beyond Back-Door and Front-Door Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The identification theory for causal effects in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with hidden variables is well established, but methods for estimating and inferring functionals that extend beyond the g-formula remain underdeveloped. Previous studies have introduced semiparametric estimators for such functionals in a broad class of DAGs with hidden variables. While these estimators exhibit desirable statistical properties such as double robustness in certain cases, they also face significant limitations. Notably, they encounter substantial computational challenges, particularly involving density estimation and numerical integration for continuous variables, and their estimates may fall outside the parameter space of the target estimand. Additionally, the asymptotic properties of these estimators is underexplored, especially when integrating flexible statistical and machine learning models for nuisance functional estimations. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing novel one-step corrected plug-in and targeted minimum loss-based estimators of causal effects for a class of hidden variable DAGs that go beyond classical back-door and front-door criteria (known as the treatment primal fixability criterion in prior literature). These estimators leverage data-adaptive machine learning algorithms to minimize modeling assumptions while ensuring key statistical properties including double robustness, efficiency, boundedness within the target parameter space, and asymptotic linearity under $L^2(P)$-rate conditions for nuisance functional estimates that yield root-n consistent causal effect estimates. To ensure our estimation methods are accessible in practice, we provide the flexCausal package in R.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Non-Acyclic GFlowNets in Discrete Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07735</link>

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are a family of generative models that learn to sample objects from a given probability distribution, potentially known up to a normalizing constant. Instead of working in the object space, GFlowNets proceed by sampling trajectories in an appropriately constructed directed acyclic graph environment, greatly relying on the acyclicity of the graph. In our paper, we revisit the theory that relaxes the acyclicity assumption and present a simpler theoretical framework for non-acyclic GFlowNets in discrete environments. Moreover, we provide various novel theoretical insights related to training with fixed backward policies, the nature of flow functions, and connections between entropy-regularized RL and non-acyclic GFlowNets, which naturally generalize the respective concepts and theoretical results from the acyclic setting. In addition, we experimentally re-examine the concept of loss stability in non-acyclic GFlowNet training, as well as validate our own theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Adaptive kernel predictors from feature-learning infinite limits of neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous influential work showed that infinite width limits of neural networks in the lazy training regime are described by kernel machines. Here, we show that neural networks trained in the rich, feature learning infinite-width regime in two different settings are also described by kernel machines, but with data-dependent kernels. For both cases, we provide explicit expressions for the kernel predictors and prescriptions to numerically calculate them. To derive the first predictor, we study the large-width limit of feature-learning Bayesian networks, showing how feature learning leads to task-relevant adaptation of layer kernels and preactivation densities. The saddle point equations governing this limit result in a min-max optimization problem that defines the kernel predictor. To derive the second predictor, we study gradient flow training of randomly initialized networks trained with weight decay in the infinite-width limit using dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). The fixed point equations of the arising DMFT defines the task-adapted internal representations and the kernel predictor. We compare our kernel predictors to kernels derived from lazy regime and demonstrate that our adaptive kernels achieve lower test loss on benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Influence Functions with Flat Validation Minima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Influence Function (IF) is a widely used technique for assessing the impact of individual training samples on model predictions. However, existing IF methods often fail to provide reliable influence estimates in deep neural networks, particularly when applied to noisy training data. This issue does not stem from inaccuracies in parameter change estimation, which has been the primary focus of prior research, but rather from deficiencies in loss change estimation, specifically due to the sharpness of validation risk. In this work, we establish a theoretical connection between influence estimation error, validation set risk, and its sharpness, underscoring the importance of flat validation minima for accurate influence estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a novel estimation form of Influence Function specifically designed for flat validation minima. Experimental results across various tasks validate the superiority of our approach.</description>

      <title>Data-Augmented Few-Shot Neural Stencil Emulation for System Identification of Computer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the modeling of many natural and engineered systems. It can be convenient to express such models as neural PDEs rather than using traditional numerical PDE solvers by replacing part or all of the PDE's governing equations with a neural network representation. Neural PDEs are often easier to differentiate, linearize, reduce, or use for uncertainty quantification than the original numerical solver. They are usually trained on solution trajectories obtained by long time integration of the PDE solver. Here we propose a more sample-efficient data-augmentation strategy for generating neural PDE training data from a computer model by space-filling sampling of local "stencil" states. This approach removes a large degree of spatiotemporal redundancy present in trajectory data and oversamples states that may be rarely visited but help the neural PDE generalize across the state space. We demonstrate that accurate neural PDE stencil operators can be learned from synthetic training data generated by the computational equivalent of 10 timesteps' worth of numerical simulation. Accuracy is further improved if we assume access to a single full-trajectory simulation from the computer model, which is typically available in practice. Across several PDE systems, we show that our data-augmented synthetic stencil data yield better trained neural stencil operators, with clear performance gains compared with naively sampled stencil data from simulation trajectories.</description>
