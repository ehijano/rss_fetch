      <title>A simple numerical model of the water bottle flipping experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The water bottle flip experiment is a recreational, non-conventional illustration of the conservation of angular moment. When a bottle partially filled with water is thrown in a rotational motion, water redistributes throughout the bottle, resulting in an increase of moment of inertia and thus to a decrease in angular velocity, which increases the probability of it falling upright on a table as compared with a bottle filled with ice. The investigation of this phenomenom is accessible to undergraduate students and should allow them to gain better understanding of combined translational and rotational motions in classical mechanics. In addition to reporting a series of detailed experiments and analyzing them using standard image analysis, we provide a simple theoretical framework and subsequent numerical implementation based on the decomposition of the water volume into thin slices of a rigid body that are subjected to fictitious forces in the non-inertial frame of the spinning bottle. This model allows us to capture quantitatively the main experimental findings, including the angular velocity slow-down for a given range of water filling fractions. Finally, we discuss additionnal counter-intuitive effects that contribute to bottle stabilization on landing.</description>

      <title>Simulating spin dynamics with quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: IBM quantum computers are used to simulate the dynamics of small systems of interacting quantum spins. For time-independent systems with fewer than three spins, we compute the exact time evolution at arbitrary times and measure spin expectation values and energy. It is demonstrated that even in such small systems, one can observe the connection between conservation laws and symmetries in the model. Larger systems require approximating the time-evolution operator, and we investigate the case of $N=3$ spins explicitly. While it is shown to be unfeasible to use such devices to probe such larger systems without more advanced algorithms or reliable error correction, we demonstrate that the quantum circuit simulator is an easy-to-use method for studying spin dynamics in systems with $N\sim\mathcal{O}(10)$) spins. The computations presented provide an interesting experimental component to the standard treatment of quantum spin in an undergraduate quantum mechanics course.</description>
