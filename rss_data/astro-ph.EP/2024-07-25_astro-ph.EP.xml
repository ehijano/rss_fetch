      <title>KMT-2021-BLG-2609Lb and KMT-2022-BLG-0303Lb: Microlensing planets identified through signals produced by major-image perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate microlensing data collected by the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) survey. Our investigation reveals that the light curves of two lensing events, KMT-2021-BLG-2609 and KMT-2022-BLG-0303, exhibit a similar anomaly, in which short-term positive deviations appear on the sides of the low-magnification lensing light curves. To unravel the nature of these anomalies, we meticulously analyze each of the lensing events. Our investigations reveal that these anomalies stem from a shared channel, wherein the source passed near the planetary caustic induced by a planet with projected separations from the host star exceeding the Einstein radius. We find that interpreting the anomaly of KMT-2021-BLG-2609 is complicated by the "inner--outer" degeneracy, whereas for KMT-2022-BLG-0303, there is no such issue despite similar lens-system configurations. In addition to this degeneracy, interpreting the anomaly in KMT-2021-BLG-2609 involves an additional degeneracy between a pair of solutions, in which the source partially envelops the caustic and the other three solutions in which the source fully envelopes the caustic. As in an earlier case of this so-called von Schlieffen--Cannae degeneracy, the former solutions have substantially higher mass ratio. Through Bayesian analyses conducted based on the measured lensing observables of the event time scale and angular Einstein radius, the host of KMT-2021-BLG-2609L is determined to be a low-mass star with a mass $\sim 0.2~M_\odot$ in terms of a median posterior value, while the planet's mass ranges from approximately 0.032 to 0.112 times that of Jupiter, depending on the solutions. For the planetary system KMT-2022-BLG-0303L, it features a planet with a mass of approximately $0.51~M_{\rm J}$ and a host star with a mass of about $0.37~M_\odot$. In both cases, the lenses are most likely situated in the bulge.</description>

      <title>Effects of Dust Coagulation on Streaming Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Streaming Instability (SI) in dust has long been thought to be a promising process in triggering planetesimal formation in the protoplanetary disks (PPDs). In this study, we present the first numerical investigation that models the SI in the vertically stratified disk together with the dust coagulation process. Our simulations reveal that, even with the initial small dust sizes, because dust coagulation promotes dust size growth, SI can eventually still be triggered. As such, the dust coagulation process broadens the parameter boundaries obtained from the previous SI studies using single dust species. We describe the various stages of dust dynamics along with their size evolution, and explore the impact of different dust fragmentation velocities. Implications of these results for realistic PPDs are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk). XI. A high-resolution view toward the BHR 71 Class 0 protostellar wide binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the binary Class 0 protostellar system BHR 71 IRS1 and IRS2 as part of the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) ALMA Large Program. We describe the $^{12}$CO ($J$=2--1), $^{13}$CO ($J$=2--1), C$^{18}$O ($J$=2--1), H$_2$CO ($J=3_{2,1}$--$2_{2,0}$), and SiO ($J$=5--4) molecular lines along with the 1.3 mm continuum at high spatial resolution ($\sim$0.08" or $\sim$5 au). Dust continuum emission is detected toward BHR 71 IRS1 and IRS2, with a central compact component and extended continuum emission. The compact components are smooth and show no sign of substructures such as spirals, rings or gaps. However, there is a brightness asymmetry along the minor axis of the presumed disk in IRS1, possibly indicative of an inclined geometrically and optically thick disk-like component. Using a position-velocity diagram analysis of the C$^{18}$O line, clear Keplerian motions were not detected toward either source. If Keplerian rotationally-supported disks are present, they are likely deeply embedded in their envelope. However, we can set upper limits of the central protostellar mass of 0.46 M$_\odot$ and 0.26 M$_\odot$ for BHR 71 IRS1 and BHR 71 IRS2, respectively. Outflows traced by $^{12}$CO and SiO are detected in both sources. The outflows can be divided into two components, a wide-angle outflow and a jet. In IRS1, the jet exhibits a double helical structure, reflecting the removal of angular momentum from the system. In IRS2, the jet is very collimated and shows a chain of knots, suggesting episodic accretion events.</description>

      <title>Climate Change in Hell: Long-Term Variation in Transits of the Evaporating Planet K2-22b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Rocky planets on ultra-short period orbits can have surface magma oceans and rock-vapour atmospheres in which dust can condense. Observations of that dust can inform about the composition surface conditions on these objects. Aims: We constrain the properties and long-term (decade) behaviour of the transiting dust cloud from the "evaporating" planet K2-22b. Methods: We observed K2-22b around 40 predicted transits with MuSCAT ground-based multi-optical channel imagers, and complemented these data with long-term monitoring by the ground-based ATLAS (2018-2024) and space-based TESS (2021-2023) surveys. Results: We detected signals during 7 transits, none of which showed significant wavelength dependence. The expected number of MuSCAT-detected transits is &gt;=22, indicating a decline in mean transit depth since the K2 discovery observations in 2014. Conclusions: Lack of significant wavelength dependence indicates that dust grains are large or the cloud is optically thick. Long-term trends of depth could be due to a magnetic cycle on the host star or overturn of the planet's dayside surface magma ocean. The possibility that K2-22b is disappearing altogether is ruled out by the stability of the transit ephemeris against non-gravitational forces, which constrains the mass to be at least comparable to Ceres.</description>

      <title>Exo-NINJA at Subaru: fiber-fed spectro-imaging of exoplanets and circumstellar disks at R$\sim$4000</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exo-NINJA will realize nearIR R$\sim$4000 diffraction-limited narrow-field spectro-imaging for characterization of exoplanets and circumstellar disk structures. It uniquely combines mid-R spectroscopy, high throughput, and spatial resolution, in contrast to CHARIS, which does spectro-imaging, and REACH, which is single-point (no spatial resolution). Exo-NINJA's spectro-imaging at the telescope diffraction limit will characterize exoplanet atmospheres, detect and map (spatially and spectrally) gas accretion on protoplanets, and also detect exoplanets at small angular separation ($\lambda$/D) from their host star by spectro-astrometry. Exo-NINJA will link two instruments at the Subaru Telescope using a high-throughput hexagonal multi-mode fiber bundle (hexabundle). The fiber coupling resides between the high contrast imaging system SCExAO, which combines ExAO and coronagraph, and the medium-resolution spectrograph NINJA (R$=$4000 at JHK bands). Exo-NINJA will provide an end-to-end throughput of 20% compared to the 1.5% obtained with REACH. Exo-NINJA is scheduled for implementation on the Subaru Telescope's NasIR platform in 2025; we will present a concise overview of its future installation, laboratory tests such as the throughput and focal ratio degradation (FRD) performance of optical fiber imaging hexabundles, in the NIR and the trade-offs for fiber choices for the NINJA-SCExAO hexabundle fiber cable, and the expected on sky performance.</description>

      <title>Validation of Gaia DR3 orbital and acceleration solutions with hierarchical triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using data from Gaia DR3, we construct a sample of 14,791 gravitationally bound wide pairs in which one of the components is an unresolved binary with an astrometric orbital or acceleration solution. These systems are hierarchical triples, with inner binary separations of order $1$ au, and outer separations of $100$-$100,000$ au. Leveraging the fact that the inner binary and outer tertiary should have nearly identical parallaxes, we use the sample to calibrate the parallax uncertainties for orbital and acceleration binary solutions. We find that the parallax uncertainties of orbital solutions are typically underestimated by a factor of $1.3$ at $G&gt;14$, and by a factor of $1.7$ at $G = 8$-$14$. The true parallax uncertainties are nevertheless a factor of $\sim 10$ smaller than those of the single-star astrometric solutions for the same sources. The parallax uncertainties of acceleration solutions are underestimated by larger factors of $2$-$3$ but still represent a significant improvement compared to the sources' single-star solutions. We provide tabulated uncertainty inflation factors for astrometric binary solutions and make the catalog of hierarchical triples publicly available.</description>

      <title>TelescopeML -- I. An End-to-End Python Package for Interpreting Telescope Datasets through Training Machine Learning Models, Generating Statistical Reports, and Visualizing Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are on the verge of a revolutionary era in space exploration, thanks to advancements in telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope (\textit{JWST}). High-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra from exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres have been collected over the past few decades, requiring the development of accurate and reliable pipelines and tools for their analysis. Accurately and swiftly determining the spectroscopic parameters from the observational spectra of these objects is crucial for understanding their atmospheric composition and guiding future follow-up observations. \texttt{TelescopeML} is a Python package developed to perform three main tasks: 1. Process the synthetic astronomical datasets for training a CNN model and prepare the observational dataset for later use for prediction; 2. Train a CNN model by implementing the optimal hyperparameters; and 3. Deploy the trained CNN models on the actual observational data to derive the output spectroscopic parameters.</description>

      <title>SUIM project: measuring the upper atmosphere from the ISS by observations of the CXB transmitted through the Earth rim</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upper atmosphere at the altitude of 60-110 km, the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT), has the least observational data of all atmospheres due to the difficulties of in-situ observations. Previous studies demonstrated that atmospheric occultation of cosmic X-ray sources is an effective technique to investigate the MLT. Aiming to measure the atmospheric density of the MLT continuously, we are developing an X-ray camera, "Soipix for observing Upper atmosphere as Iss experiment Mission (SUIM)", dedicated to atmospheric observations. SUIM will be installed on the exposed area of the International Space Station (ISS) and face the ram direction of the ISS to point toward the Earth rim. Observing the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) transmitted through the atmosphere, we will measure the absorption column density via spectroscopy and thus obtain the density of the upper atmosphere. The X-ray camera is composed of a slit collimator and two X-ray SOI-CMOS pixel sensors (SOIPIX), and will stand on its own and make observations, controlled by a CPU-embedded FPGA "Zynq". We plan to install the SUIM payload on the ISS in 2025 during the solar maximum. In this paper, we report the overview and the development status of this project.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Instrument Control Software of SOXS (Son Of X-Shooter), the forthcoming spectrograph for the ESO New Technology Telescope at the La Silla Observatory, has reached a mature state of development and is approaching the crucial Preliminary Acceptance in Europe phase. Now that all the subsystems have been integrated in the laboratories of the Padova Astronomical Observatory, the team operates for testing purposes with the whole instrument at both engineering and scientific level. These activities will make use of a set of software peculiarities that will be discussed in this contribution. In particular, we focus on the synoptic panel, the co-rotator system special device, on the Active Flexure Compensation system which controls two separate piezo tip-tilt devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Son Of X-Shooter (SOXS) will be the specialized facility to observe any transient event with a flexible scheduler at the ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT) at La Silla, Chile. SOXS is a single object spectrograph offering simultaneous spectral coverage in UV-VIS (350-850 nm) and NIR (800-2000 nm) wavelength regimes with an average of R~4500 for a 1arcsec slit. SOXS also has imaging capabilities in the visible wavelength regime. Currently, SOXS is being integrated at the INAF-Astronomical Observatory of Padova. Subsystem- and system-level tests and verification are ongoing to ensure and confirm that every requirement and performance are met. In this paper, we report on the integration and verification of SOXS as the team and the instrument prepare for the Preliminary Acceptance Europe (PAE).</description>

      <title>Non-Detections of Helium in the Young Sub-Jovian Planets K2-100b, HD 63433b, &amp; V1298 Tau c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We search for excess in-transit absorption of neutral helium at 1.083 $\mu$m in the atmospheres of the young (&lt;800 Myr) sub-Jovian (0.2-0.5 $\rm R_{J}$) planets HD 63433b, K2-100b, and V1298 Tau c using high-resolution (R~25,000) transit observations taken with Keck II/NIRSPEC. Our observations do not show evidence of helium absorption for any of the planets in our sample. We calculate 3$\sigma$ upper limits on the planets' excess helium absorption of &lt;0.47% for HD 63433b, &lt;0.56% for K2-100b, and &lt;1.13% for V1298 Tau c. In terms of equivalent width, we constrain these to &lt;2.52, &lt;4.44, and &lt;8.49 mA for HD 63433b, K2-100b, and V1298 Tau c, respectively. We fit our transmission spectra with one-dimensional Parker wind models to determine upper limits on the planets' mass-loss rates of &lt;7.9$\times10^{10}$, &lt;1.25$\times10^{11}$, and &lt;$7.9\times10^{11}$g s$^{-1}$. Our non-detections align with expectations from one-dimensional hydrodynamic escape models, magnetic fields, and stellar wind confinement. The upper limits we measure for these planets are consistent with predicted trends in system age and He equivalent width from 1D hydrodynamic models.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Jupiter and Saturn with helium rain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase separation between hydrogen and helium at high pressures and temperatures leads to the rainout of helium in the deep interiors of Jupiter and Saturn. This process, also known as "helium rain", affects their long-term evolution. Therefore, modelling the evolution and internal structure of Jupiter and Saturn (and giant exoplanets) relies on the phase diagram of hydrogen and helium. In this work, we simulate the evolution of Jupiter and Saturn with helium rain by applying different phase diagrams of hydrogen and helium. We find that consistency between Jupiter s evolution and the Galileo measurement of its atmospheric helium abundance is achieved only if a shift in temperature in the existing phase diagrams is applied (-1250 K, +350 K or -3850 K depending on the used phase diagram). We next use the shifted phase diagrams to model Saturn s evolution and find consistent solutions for both planets. We confirm that demixing in Jupiter is modest while in Saturn, the process of helium rain is significant. We find that Saturn has a large helium gradient and a helium ocean. Saturn s atmospheric helium mass fraction is estimated to be between 0.13 and 0.16. We also investigate how the used hydrogen-helium equation of state and atmospheric model affect the planetary evolution and find that the predicted cooling times can change by several hundred million years. Constraining the level of super-adiabaticity in the helium gradient formed in Jupiter and Saturn remains challenging and should be investigated in detail in future research. We conclude that further explorations of the immiscibility between hydrogen and helium are valuable as this knowledge directly affects the evolution and current-state structure of Jupiter and Saturn. Finally, we argue that measuring Saturn s atmospheric helium content is crucial for constraining Saturn s evolution as well as the hydrogen-helium phase diagram.</description>

Abstract: Planetary systems with multiple transiting planets are beneficial for understanding planet occurrence rates and system architectures. Although we have yet to find a solar system (SS) analog, future surveys may detect multiple terrestrial planets transiting a Sun-like star. In this work, we simulate transit timing observations of our Solar System as viewed from a distance and based on the actual orbital motions of Venus and the Earth-Moon Barycenter, as influenced by the other SS bodies, with varying noise levels and observing durations. We then retrieve the system's dynamical parameters using an approximate N-body model for transit timing shifts while considering four possible plane-parallel configurations: two planets, three planets, four planets, and five planets.
  We demonstrate that -- with the retrieval applied to simulated transit times of Venus and EMB -- we can: 1) detect Jupiter at high significance (up to 90-s timing noise); 2) measure the masses and orbits of both transiting planets (mass-ratios are down to 4-8% uncertainty for the 3-planet model) ; 3) detect Mars with more than $5\sigma$ given very high level precision (10s of seconds). To accurately characterize Jupiter, we require timing precisions of better than 30 seconds and survey durations longer than 22 years. Accurate retrieval of Mars is possible when the survey baseline is longer than 25 years. Additionally, while Jupiter's mass is underestimated in most of our simulated cases, the addition of Mars improves the posterior mass, suggesting that unseen terrestrials could interfere in the characterization of multi-planetary systems if they are nearly resonant to transiting planets.
  Ultimately, these simulations will help to guide future missions -- such as PLATO, Nautilus, LUVOIR, and Ariel -- in detecting and characterizing exoplanet systems analogous to our Solar System.</description>

      <title>Analyzing JWST/NIRSpec Hydrogen Line Detections at TWA 27B: Constraining Accretion Properties and Geometry</title>

Abstract: Hydrogen lines from forming planets are crucial for understanding planet formation. However, the number of planetary hydrogen line detections is still limited. Recent JWST/NIRSpec observations have detected Paschen and Brackett hydrogen lines at TWA 27 B (2M1207b). TWA 27 B is classified as a planetary-mass companison (PMC) rather than a planet due to its large mass ratio to the central object ($\approx 5 M_\mathrm{J}$ compared to $25 M_\mathrm{J}$). Nevertheless, TWA 27 B's hydrogen line emission is expected to be same as for planets, given its small mass. We aim to constrain the accretion properties and accretion geometry of TWA 27 B, contributing to our understanding of hydrogen line emission mechanism common to both PMCs and planets. We conduct spectral fitting of four bright hydrogen lines (Pa-$\alpha$, Pa-$\beta$, Pa-$\gamma$, Pa-$\delta$) with an accretion-shock emission model tailored for forming planets. We estimate the mass accretion rate at $\dot{M} \approx 3 \times 10^{-9}\, M_\mathrm{J}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ with our fiducial parameters, though this is subject to an uncertainty of up to factor of ten. Our analysis also indicates a dense accretion flow, $n\gtrsim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ just before the shock, implying a small accretion-shock filling factor $f_\mathrm{f}$ on the planetary surface ($f_\mathrm{f} \lesssim 5\times10^{-4}$). This finding suggests that magnetospheric accretion is occurring at TWA 27 B. Additionally, we carry out a comparative analysis of hydrogen-line emission color to identify the emission mechanism, but the associated uncertainties proved too large for definitive conclusions. This underscores the need for further high-precision observational studies to elucidate these emission mechanisms fully.</description>

      <title>Using A One-Class SVM To Optimize Transit Detection</title>

Abstract: As machine learning algorithms become increasingly accessible, a growing number of organizations and researchers are using these technologies to automate the process of exoplanet detection. These mainly utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect periodic dips in lightcurve data. While having approximately 5% lower accuracy than CNNs, the results of this study show that One-Class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be fitted to data up to 84 times faster than simple CNNs and make predictions over 3 times faster on the same datasets using the same hardware. In addition, One-Class SVMs can be run smoothly on unspecialized hardware, removing the need for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) usage. In cases where time and processing power are valuable resources, One-Class SVMs are able to minimize time spent on transit detection tasks while maximizing performance and efficiency.</description>
