      <title>Rota-Baxter groups with weight zero and integration on topological groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rota-Baxter groups with weights $\pm 1$ have attracted quite much attention since their recent introduction, thanks to their connections with Rota-Baxter Lie algebras, factorizations of Lie groups, post- and pre-Lie algebras, braces and set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Despite their expected importance from integrals on groups to pre-groups and Yang-Baxter equations, Rota-Baxter groups with weight zero and other weights has been a challenge to define and their search has been the focus of several attempts.
  By composing an operator with a section map as a perturbation device, we first generalize the notion of a Rota-Baxter operator on a group from the existing case of weight $\pm 1$ to the case where the weight is given by a pair of maps and then a sequence limit of such pairs. From there, two candidates of Rota-Baxter operators with weight zero are given. One of them is the Rota-Baxter operator with limit-weight zero detailed here, with the other candidate introduced in a companion work. This operator is shown to have its tangent map the Rota-Baxter operator with weight zero on Lie algebras. It also gives concrete applications in integrals of maps with values in a class of topological groups called $\RR$-groups, satisfying a multiplicative version of the integration-by-parts formula.
  In parallel, differential groups in this framework is also developed and a group formulation of the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is obtained.</description>

      <title>Quantum-symmetric equivalence is a graded Morita invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if two $m$-homogeneous algebras have Morita equivalent graded module categories, then they are quantum-symmetrically equivalent, that is, there is a monoidal equivalence between the categories of comodules for their associated universal quantum groups (in the sense of Manin) which sends one algebra to the other. As a consequence, any Zhang twist of an $m$-homogeneous algebra is a 2-cocycle twist by some 2-cocycle from its Manin's universal quantum group.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Quantum Toroidal Algebras, Z-algebra Structure and Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new elliptic quantum toroidal algebra U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_tor) associated with an arbitrary toroidal algebra g_tor. We show that U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_tor) contains two elliptic quantum algebras associated with a corresponding affine Lie algebra bg as subalgebras. They are analogue of the horizontal and the vertical subalgebras in the quantum toroidal algebra U_{q,\kappa}(g_tor). A Hopf algebroid structure is introduced as a co-algebra structure of U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_tor) using the Drinfeld comultiplication. We also investigate the Z-algebra structure of U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_tor) and show that the Z-algebra governs the irreducibility of the level (k(\not=0),l)-infinite dimensional U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_tor)-modules in the same way as in the elliptic quantum group U_{q,p}(g). As an example, we construct the level (1,l) irreducible representation of U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_tor) for the simply laced gtor. We also construct the level (0,1) representation of U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_N,tor) and discuss a conjecture on its geometric interpretation as an action on the torus equivariant elliptic cohomology of the affine A_{N-1} quiver variety.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Quantum Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We expose the elliptic quantum groups in the Drinfeld realization associated with both the affine Lie algebra \g and the toroidal algebra \g_tor. There the level-0 and level \not=0 representations appear in a unified way so that one can define the vertex operators as intertwining operators of them. The vertex operators are key for many applications such as a derivation of the elliptic weight functions, integral solutions of the (elliptic) q-KZ equation and a formulation of algebraic analysis of the elliptic solvable lattice models. Identifying the elliptic weight functions with the elliptic stable envelopes we make a correspondence between the level-0 representation of the elliptic quantum group and the equivariant elliptic cohomology. We also emphasize a characterization of the elliptic quantum groups as $q$-deformations of the W-algebras.</description>

      <title>Multiplication formula for Hernandez and Leclerc's quivers with potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study multiplication formula of $F$-polynomial of representations of Hernandez and Leclerc's quivers with potentials. Since the truncated $q$-characters of some real simple modules over a quantum affine group $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{g}})$ can be expressed in terms of such $F$-polynomials, one can describe the product of two simple modules over $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{g}})$ using this multiplication formula.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Self-Correcting Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of infinitely many new candidate non-Abelian self-correcting topological quantum memories in $D\geq 5+1$ spacetime dimensions without particle excitations using local commuting non-Pauli stabilizer lattice models and field theories of $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ higher-form gauge fields with nontrivial topological action. We call such non-Pauli stabilizer models magic stabilizer codes. The family of topological orders have Abelian electric excitations and non-Abelian magnetic excitations that obey Ising-like fusion rules, generalizing the dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_8$ gauge theory in 2+1d. The simplest example includes a new non-Abelian self-correcting memory in 5+1d with Abelian loop excitations and non-Abelian membrane excitations. We use a Peierls argument to demonstrate the self-correction property and the thermal stability, and devise a probablistic local cellular-automaton decoder.</description>

      <title>The centre of the modular affine vertex algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Feigin--Frenkel theorem states that, over the complex numbers, the centre of the universal affine vertex algebra at the critical level is an infinite rank polynomial algebra. The first author and W.~Wang observed that in positive characteristics, the universal affine vertex algebra contains a large central subalgebra known as the $p$-centre. They conjectured that at the critical level the centre should be generated by the Feigin--Frenkel centre and the $p$-centre. In this paper we prove the conjecture for classical simple Lie algebras for $p$ larger than the Coxeter number, and for exceptional Lie algebras in large characteristics. Finally, we give an example which shows that at non-critical level the center is larger than the $p$-centre.</description>

      <title>$q$-deformation of Aomoto complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A degree one element of the Orlik-Solomon algebra of a hyperplane arrangement defines a cochain complex known as the Aomoto complex. The Aomoto complex can be considerd as the ``linear approximation'' of the twisted cochain complex with coefficients in a complex rank one local system.
  In this paper, we discuss $q$-deformations of the Aomoto complex. The $q$-deformation is defined by replacing the entries of representation matrices of the coboundary maps with their $q$-analogues. While the resulting maps do not generally define cochain complexes, for certain special basis derived from real structures, the $q$-deformation becomes again a cochain complex. Moreover, it exhibits universality in the sense that any specialization of $q$ to a complex number yields the cochain complex computing the corresponding local system cohomology group.</description>

      <title>Old and new powerful tools for the normal ordering problem and noncommutative binomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive formal general formulas for noncommutative exponentiation and the exponential function, while also revisiting an unrecognized, and yet powerful theorem. These tools are subsequently applied to derive counterparts for the exponential identity $e^{A+B} = e^A e^B$ and the binomial theorem $(A+B)^n = \sum \binom{n}{k} A^k B^{n-k}$ when the commutator $[B, A]$ is either an arbitrary quadratic polynomial or a monomial in $A$ or $B$. Analogous formulas are found when the commutator is bivariate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel operator bridging between the normal and antinormal forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum automorphism group for hypergraphs, which turns out to generalize the quantum automorphism group of Bichon for classical graphs. Further, we show that our quantum automorphism group acts on hypergraph C*-algebras as recently defined. In particular, this action generalizes the one on graph C*-algebras by Schmidt-Weber in 2018.</description>
