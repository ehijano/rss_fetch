      <title>Maximum size and magnitude of injection-induced slow slip events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid injections can induce aseismic slip, resulting in stress changes that may propagate faster than pore pressure diffusion, potentially triggering seismicity at significant distances from injection wells. Constraining the maximum extent of these aseismic ruptures is thus important for better delineating the influence zone of injections concerning their seismic hazard. Here we derive a scaling relation based on rupture physics for the maximum size of aseismic ruptures, accounting for fluid injections with arbitrary flow rate histories. Moreover, based on mounting evidence that the moment release during these operations is often predominantly aseismic, we derive a scaling relation for the maximum magnitude of aseismic slip events. Our theoretical predictions are consistent with observations over a broad spectrum of event sizes, from laboratory to real-world cases, indicating that fault-zone storativity, background stress state, and injected fluid volume are key determinants of the maximum size and magnitude of injection-induced slow slip events.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Neural Networks with Fourier Features for Seismic Wavefield Simulation in Time-Domain Nonsmooth Complex Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have great potential for flexibility and effectiveness in forward modeling and inversion of seismic waves. However, coordinate-based neural networks (NNs) commonly suffer from the "spectral bias" pathology, which greatly limits their ability to model high-frequency wave propagation in sharp and complex media. We propose a unified framework of Fourier feature physics-informed neural networks (FF-PINNs) for solving the time-domain wave equations. The proposed framework combines the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) strategy with a pre-trained wave velocity surrogate model to mitigate the singularity at the point source. The performance of the activation functions and gradient descent strategies are discussed through ablation experiments. In addition, we evaluate the accuracy comparison of Fourier feature mappings sampled from different families of distributions (Gaussian, Laplace, and uniform). The second-order paraxial approximation-based boundary conditions are incorporated into the loss function as a soft regularizer to eliminate spurious boundary reflections. Through the non-smooth Marmousi and Overthrust model cases, we emphasized the necessity of the absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) constraints. The results of a series of numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method for modeling high-frequency wave propagation in sharp and complex media.</description>

      <title>The role of energetic flow structures on the aeolian transport of sediment and plastic debris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, significant progress has been made in conceptually describing the dynamic aspects of coarse particle entrainment, which has been explored experimentally for open channel flows. The aim of this study is to extend the application of energy criterion to the low mobility aeolian transport of solids (including both natural sediment and anthropogenic debris such as plastics), ranging from incomplete (rocking) to full (rolling) entrainments. This is achieved by linking particle movements to energetic flow events, which are defined as flow structures with the ability to work on particles, setting them into motion. It is hypothesized that such events should impart sufficient energy to the particles, above a certain threshold value. The concept's validity is demonstrated experimentally, using a wind tunnel and laser distance sensor (LDS) to capture the dynamics of an individual target particle, exposed on a rough bed surface. Measurements are acquired at a high spatiotemporal resolution, and synchronously with the instantaneous air velocity at an appropriate distance upwind of the target particle, using a hot film anemometer. This enables the association of flow events with rocking and rolling entrainments. Furthermore, it is shown that rocking and rolling may have distinct energy thresholds. Estimates of the energy transfer efficiency, normalized by the drag coefficient, range over an order of magnitude (from about 0.001 to 0.0048 for rocking, up to about 0.01, for incipient rolling). The proposed event-based theoretical framework is a novel approach to characterizing the energy imparted from the wind to the soil surface and could have potential implications for modelling intermittent creep transport of coarse particles and related aeolian bedforms.</description>
