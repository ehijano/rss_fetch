      <title>Spinwave Bandpass Filters for 6G Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spinwave filters using single-crystal yttrium iron garnet are an attractive technology for integration in frequency adjustable or tunable communication systems. However, existing SW devices do not have sufficient bandwidth for future 5G and 6G communication systems, are too large, or have strong spurious passbands creating unintentional cross-channel interference. Leveraging modern micromachining fabrication methods capable of wafer-scale production, we report a SW ladder filter architecture requiring only a single external magnetic bias. The filters demonstrate loss as low as 2.54 dB, bandwidths up to 663 MHz, center frequency tuning over multiple octaves from 5.7-21.6 GHz, and high linearity with an input referred third-order intercept point over 11 dBm in the passband. The filter's operation is also experimentally demonstrated in a frequency tunable radio system.</description>

      <title>Waveguide-Coupled Mid-Infrared GeSn Membrane Photodetectors on Silicon-on-Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon photonics has thrived in telecommunications over recent decades, and its extension to the mid-infrared range has the potential to unlock valuable opportunities for sensing, imaging, and free-space communications. With this perspective, germanium-tin (GeSn) alloy has been extensively investigated as a silicon-compatible semiconductor with bandgap tunability that covers this entire spectral range. Indeed, a variety of GeSn-based high-performance optoelectronic devices have been demonstrated, confirming the potential of this system for mid-infrared applications. However, the integration of these devices onto silicon photonic platforms remains underexplored. Herein, we demonstrate the fabrication and integration, through transfer-printing, of strain-relaxed GeSn membranes onto silicon-on-insulator waveguides to create integrated detectors operating up to 3.1 $\mu$m at room temperature. Two different designs of waveguide structures are evaluated to study the coupling efficiency between the passive structures and the active membrane detector. A responsivity reaching 0.36 A/W at an operation wavelength of 2.33 $\mu$m is measured under a bias of 1 V. Moreover, the fabrication resulted in multiple working devices exhibiting similar performance using a single transfer printing step, demonstrating the scalability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Leaky-wave Coil Element with Improved Tx-efficiency for 7 T MRI Using a Non-Uniform Current Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging of the human body at ultra-high fields (static magnetic field B0&gt;7 Tesla) is challenging due to the radio-frequency field inhomogeneities in the human body tissues caused by the short wavelength. These effects could be partially mitigated using an array of antennas and by parallel transmission allowing for control of the radio-frequency field distribution in the region of interest. All commonly-used radio-frequency arrays for ultra-high field MRI consist of resonant elements: dipoles, TEM-resonators, loops and individual slots. All these elements rely on standing wave excitation, in the sense that they are resonant devices that produce a field pattern with a constant phase distribution along the commensurable conductor elements. However, it was shown previously, that a non-uniform phase of surface current is required to reach the ultimate intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio or a maximized signal in the desired region of interest. In our work we propose to use a previously demonstrated non-resonant leaky-wave approach to control the phase of currents in radio-frequency coil conductors to increase the B1+ field in the center or in the region of interest. Using this approach, we developed a radio-frequency coil based on a leaky-wave antenna approach with optimized surface current distribution resulting in stronger B1+ in the desired region compared to e.g. a fractionated dipole.</description>

      <title>Efficient integration of self-assembled organic monolayer tunnel barriers in large area pinhole-free magnetic tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-transport properties in hybrid magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) integrating self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as tunnel barriers are critically influenced by spinterface effects, which arise from the electronic properties at ferromagnet (FM)/SAM interfaces. Understanding the mechanisms governing spinterface formation in well-controlled model systems is essential for the rational design of efficient molecular spintronic devices. However, the fabrication of FM/SAM/FM systems remains a significant challenge due to the difficulty in preventing electrical shorts through the SAM tunnel barrier during top FM electrode deposition. In this study, we address these challenges by developing model hybrid MTJs incorporating alkanethiol SAM tunnel barriers grafted under ultra-high vacuum conditions onto single-crystalline Fe(001) bottom electrodes. A soft-landing deposition method is used for the deposition of a top Co FM electrode. The deposition process and the electronic properties of the FM/SAM interfaces are first studied by spatially integrated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Furthermore, ballistic electron emission microscopy (BEEM) and spectroscopy are used to investigate the lateral homogeneity of the organic barrier. Optimal soft-landing deposition conditions allows the preparation of homogeneous Co/SAM interfaces with no evidence of metal diffusion through the SAM at the nanoscale. These observations are further confirmed at the micron-scale by the high-yield patterning of large area (5*5um2) MTJs presenting fingerprints of electron tunneling through the SAM. These findings provide critical insights into the fabrication and optimization of molecular spintronic devices, paving the way for advancements in hybrid MTJ technology.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient coherent amplification of zero-field spin waves in YIG nano-waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmission and processing of information at the nanoscale using spin waves and their quanta - magnons, offers numerous advantages and opportunities that make it a promising next-generation technology for integrated electronics. The main challenges that still need to be addressed to ensure high competitiveness of magnonic devices include finding ways to efficiently amplify spin waves in nanostructures and developing nanocircuits that can operate without the need for an external bias magnetic field. Here we demonstrate how these two challenges can be solved using nano-waveguides fabricated from a low-loss magnetic insulator. We show that by using local parametric pumping with a power of only a few milliwatts, one can achieve coherent amplification of spin-wave pulses by more than two orders of magnitude at zero bias magnetic field. Our results provide a simple solution to problems that have long prevented the implementation of efficient integrated magnonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Electrometer for Time-Resolved Material Science at the Atomic Lattice Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of individual charges plays a crucial role in fundamental material science and the advancement of classical and quantum high-performance technologies that operate with low noise. However, resolving charges at the lattice scale in a time-resolved manner has not been achieved so far. Here, we present the development of an electrometer with 60 ns acquisition steps, leveraging on the spectroscopy of an optically-active spin defect embedded in a solid-state material with a non-linear Stark response. By applying our approach to diamond, a widely used platform for quantum technology applications, we can distinguish the distinct charge traps at the lattice scale, quantify their impact on transport dynamics and noise generation, analyze relevant material properties, and develop strategies for material optimization.</description>

      <title>Self-ion implantation and structural relaxation in amorphous silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-ion implantation amorphization is an established approach to study the structure and properties of amorphous silicon (a-Si). Fluctuation Electron Microscopy (FEM) has consistently observed Medium-Range Order (MRO) in this system that is not consistent with the Continuous Random Network (CRN) model. Using this technique we find that the degree of MRO first increases on thermal annealing and then decreases before finally recrystallizing. We discuss this new result in the light of previous experimental studies and recent theoretical observations on the favorability of the paracrystalline (PC) model over the CRN in a-Si. At ion doses far above the minimum required to amorphize, a high defect density is found in the PC phase, which anneals out at 500oC. The PC structure after 500oC annealing is independent of the initial implantation conditions and appears to represent a metastable and highly-ordered structure. Higher-temperature annealing causes a reduction in the degree of MRO and the structure approaches but does not reach a fully continuous random network before eventually crystallizing above 600oC. The effect of high dose implantation is to increase the defect density in the as-implanted state and the annealing of these defects is likely responsible for the large characteristic heat evolution at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Resonant-Tunnelling Diode Reservoir Computing System for Image Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence continues to push into real-time, edge-based and resource-constrained environments, there is an urgent need for novel, hardware-efficient computational models. In this study, we present and validate a neuromorphic computing architecture based on resonant-tunnelling diodes (RTDs), which exhibit the nonlinear characteristics ideal for physical reservoir computing (RC). We theoretically formulate and numerically implement an RTD-based RC system and demonstrate its effectiveness on two image recognition benchmarks: handwritten digit classification and object recognition using the Fruit~360 dataset. Our results show that this circuit-level architecture delivers promising performance while adhering to the principles of next-generation RC -- eliminating random connectivity in favour of a deterministic nonlinear transformation of input signals.</description>
