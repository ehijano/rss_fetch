      <title>Bounds on the Excess Minimum Risk via Generalized Information Divergence Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given finite-dimensional random vectors $Y$, $X$, and $Z$ that form a Markov chain in that order (i.e., $Y \to X \to Z$), we derive upper bounds on the excess minimum risk using generalized information divergence measures. Here, $Y$ is a target vector to be estimated from an observed feature vector $X$ or its stochastically degraded version $Z$. The excess minimum risk is defined as the difference between the minimum expected loss in estimating $Y$ from $X$ and from $Z$. We present a family of bounds that generalize the mutual information based bound of Gy\"orfi et al. (2023), using the R\'enyi and $\alpha$-Jensen-Shannon divergences, as well as Sibson's mutual information. Our bounds are similar to those developed by Modak et al. (2021) and Aminian et al. (2024) for the generalization error of learning algorithms. However, unlike these works, our bounds do not require the sub-Gaussian parameter to be constant and therefore apply to a broader class of joint distributions over $Y$, $X$, and $Z$. We also provide numerical examples under both constant and non-constant sub-Gaussianity assumptions, illustrating that our generalized divergence based bounds can be tighter than the one based on mutual information for certain regimes of the parameter $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Receivers for Multi-Band Communications and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing multi-level electron transitions, Rydberg Atomic Receivers (RAREs) can detect wireless signals across a wide range of frequency bands, from Megahertz to Terahertz, enabling multi-band communications and sensing (C&amp;S). Current research on multi-band RAREs primarily focuses on experimental demonstrations, lacking an interpretable model to mathematically characterize their mechanisms. This issue leaves the multi-band RARE as a black box, posing challenges in its practical C&amp;S applications. To fill in this gap, this paper investigates the underlying mechanism of multi-band RAREs and explores their optimal performance. For the first time, the closed-form expression of the transfer function of a multi-band RARE is derived by solving the quantum response of Rydberg atoms excited by multi-band signals. The function reveals that a multiband RARE simultaneously serves as both a multi-band atomic mixer for down-converting multi-band signals and a multi-band atomic amplifier that reflects its sensitivity to each band. Further analysis of the atomic amplifier unveils that the gain factor at each frequency band can be decoupled into a global gain term and a Rabi attention term. The former determines the overall sensitivity of a RARE to all frequency bands of wireless signals. The latter influences the allocation of the overall sensitivity to each frequency band, representing a unique attention mechanism of multi-band RAREs. The optimal design of the global gain is provided to maximize the overall sensitivity of multi-band RAREs. Subsequently, the optimal Rabi attentions are also derived to maximize the practical multi-band C&amp;S performance. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the derived transfer function and the superiority of multi-band RAREs.</description>

      <title>Multi-Waveguide Pinching Antennas for ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a novel flexible-antenna technology, called pinching antennas, has attracted growing academic interest. By inserting discrete dielectric materials, pinching antennas can be activated at arbitrary points along waveguides, allowing for flexible customization of large-scale path loss. This paper investigates a multi-waveguide pinching-antenna integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system, where transmit pinching antennas (TPAs) and receive pinching antennas (RPAs) coordinate to simultaneously detect one potential target and serve one downlink user. We formulate a communication rate maximization problem subject to radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirement, transmit power budget, and the allowable movement region of the TPAs, by jointly optimizing TPA locations and transmit beamforming design. To address the non-convexity of the problem, we propose a novel fine-tuning approximation method to reformulate it into a tractable form, followed by a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm to obtain the solution efficiently. Extensive simulations validate both the system design and the proposed algorithm. Results show that the proposed method achieves near-optimal performance compared with the computational-intensive exhaustive search-based benchmark, and pinching-antenna ISAC systems exhibit a distinct communication-sensing trade-off compared with conventional systems.</description>

      <title>Maximally recoverable codes with locality and availability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce maximally recoverable codes with locality and availability. We consider locally repairable codes (LRCs) where certain subsets of $ t $ symbols belong each to $ N $ local repair sets, which are pairwise disjoint after removing the $ t $ symbols, and which are of size $ r+\delta-1 $ and can correct $ \delta-1 $ erasures locally. Classical LRCs with $ N $ disjoint repair sets and LRCs with $ N $-availability are recovered when setting $ t = 1 $ and $ t=\delta-1=1 $, respectively. Allowing $ t &gt; 1 $ enables our codes to reduce the storage overhead for the same locality and availability. In this setting, we define maximally recoverable LRCs (MR-LRCs) as those that can correct any globally correctable erasure pattern given the locality and availability constraints. We provide three explicit constructions, based on MSRD codes, each attaining the smallest finite-field sizes for some parameter regime. Finally, we extend the known lower bound on finite-field sizes from classical MR-LRCs to our setting.</description>

      <title>Robust Distributed Phase Retrieval for Multi-View Compressive Networked Sensing With Outliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines the multi-view compressive phase retrieval problem in a distributed sensor network, where each sensor device, limited by storage and sensing capabilities, can access only intensity measurements from an unknown part of the global sparse vector. The goal is to enable each sensor to recover its observable sparse signal when measurements are corrupted by outliers. To achieve reliable local signal recovery with limited data access, we propose a distributed reconstruction algorithm that enables collaboration among sensor devices without the need to share individual raw data. The proposed scheme employs a two-stage approach that first recovers the amplitude of the global signal (at a central server) and subsequently estimates the observable nonzero signal entries (at each local device). Our analytic results show that perfect global signal amplitude recovery can be achieved under mild conditions on the support size of sparse outliers and the view blockage level. In addition, the exact reconstruction of locally observed signal components is shown to be attainable in the noise-free case by solving a binary optimization problem, subject to a mild requirement on the structure of the sensing matrix. Computer simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Sequences of LCD AG codes and LCP of AG Codes attaining the Tsfasman-Vladut-Zink bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since Massey introduced linear complementary dual (LCD) codes in 1992 and Bhasin et al. later formalized linear complementary pairs (LCPs) of codes - structures with important cryptographic applications - these code families have attracted significant interest. We construct infinite sequences $(C_i)_{i \geq 1}$ of LCD codes and of LCPs $(C', D')_{i \geq 1}$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ obtained from the Garcia-Stichtenoth tower of function fields, where we describe suitable non-special divisors of small degree on each level of the tower. These families attain the Tsfasman-Vl\u{a}du\c{t}-Zink bound and, for sufficiently large $q$ exceed the classic Gilbert-Varshamov bound, providing explicit asymptotically good constructions beyond existential results. We also exhibit infinite sequences of self-orthogonal over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ and, when $q$ is even, self-dual codes from the same tower all meeting the Tsfasman-Vl\u{a}du\c{t}-Zink bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this work is to establish a mathematical framework for the study of symmetric shift registers over the field GF(2). The present paper gives a new approach where the symmetric shift registers are represented by associated systems of nonlinear difference equations. Arithmetical progressions will play a central part. This approach clarifies the underlying structures and makes it easier to determine the minimal periods of the sequences generated by the symmetric shift registers. Key words: Shift registers, nonlinear difference equations, periods, arithmetical progressions, GF(2).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that one can always identify a point on an algebraic variety $X$ uniquely with $\dim X +1$ generic linear measurements taken themselves from a variety under minimal assumptions. As illustrated by several examples the result is sharp, that is, $\dim X$ measurements are in general not enough for unique identifiability.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Beamforming for RIS-Empowered ISAC Systems over Secure Low-Altitude Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging as a cornerstone for next-generation wireless networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems demand innovative solutions to balance spectral efficiency and sensing accuracy. In this paper, we propose a coordinated beamforming framework for a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered ISAC system, where the active precoding at the dual-functional base station (DFBS) and the passive beamforming at the RIS are jointly optimized to provide communication services for legitimate unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) while sensing the unauthorized UAVs. The sum-rate of all legitimate UAVs are maximized, while satisfying the radar sensing signal-to-noise ratio requirements, the transmit power constraints, and the reflection coefficients of the RIS. To address the inherent non-convexity from coupled variables, we propose a low-complexity algorithm integrating fractional programming with alternating optimization, featuring convergence guarantees. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves higher data rate compared to disjoint optimization benchmarks. This underscores RIS's pivotal role in harmonizing communication and target sensing functionalities for low-altitude networks.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics of extensive-width Bayesian neural networks near interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For three decades statistical mechanics has been providing a framework to analyse neural networks. However, the theoretically tractable models, e.g., perceptrons, random features models and kernel machines, or multi-index models and committee machines with few neurons, remained simple compared to those used in applications. In this paper we help reducing the gap between practical networks and their theoretical understanding through a statistical physics analysis of the supervised learning of a two-layer fully connected network with generic weight distribution and activation function, whose hidden layer is large but remains proportional to the inputs dimension. This makes it more realistic than infinitely wide networks where no feature learning occurs, but also more expressive than narrow ones or with fixed inner weights. We focus on the Bayes-optimal learning in the teacher-student scenario, i.e., with a dataset generated by another network with the same architecture. We operate around interpolation, where the number of trainable parameters and of data are comparable and feature learning emerges. Our analysis uncovers a rich phenomenology with various learning transitions as the number of data increases. In particular, the more strongly the features (i.e., hidden neurons of the target) contribute to the observed responses, the less data is needed to learn them. Moreover, when the data is scarce, the model only learns non-linear combinations of the teacher weights, rather than "specialising" by aligning its weights with the teacher's. Specialisation occurs only when enough data becomes available, but it can be hard to find for practical training algorithms, possibly due to statistical-to-computational~gaps.</description>

      <title>Beyond scalar quasi-arithmetic means: Quasi-arithmetic averages and quasi-arithmetic mixtures in information geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10980v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize quasi-arithmetic means beyond scalars by considering the gradient map of a Legendre type real-valued function. The gradient map of a Legendre type function is proven strictly comonotone with a global inverse. It thus yields a generalization of strictly mononotone and differentiable functions generating scalar quasi-arithmetic means. Furthermore, the Legendre transformation gives rise to pairs of dual quasi-arithmetic averages via the convex duality. We study the invariance and equivariance properties under affine transformations of quasi-arithmetic averages via the lens of dually flat spaces of information geometry. We show how these quasi-arithmetic averages are used to express points on dual geodesics and sided barycenters in the dual affine coordinate systems. We then consider quasi-arithmetic mixtures and describe several parametric and non-parametric statistical models which are closed under the quasi-arithmetic mixture operation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deep holes of a linear code are the vectors that achieve the maximum error distance (covering radius) to the code. {Determining the covering radius and deep holes of linear codes is a fundamental problem in coding theory. In this paper, we investigate the problem of deep holes of twisted Reed-Solomon codes.} The covering radius and a standard class of deep holes of twisted Reed-Solomon codes ${\rm TRS}_k(\mathcal{A}, \theta)$ are obtained for a general evaluation set $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q$. Furthermore, we consider the problem of determining all deep holes of the full-length twisted Reed-Solomon codes ${\rm TRS}_k(\mathbb{F}_q, \theta)$. For even $q$, by utilizing the polynomial method and Gauss sums over finite fields, we prove that the standard deep holes are all the deep holes of ${\rm TRS}_k(\mathbb{F}_q, \theta)$ with $\frac{3q-4}{4} \leq k\leq q-4$. For odd $q$, we adopt a different method and employ the results on some equations over finite fields to show that there are also no other deep holes of ${\rm TRS}_k(\mathbb{F}_q, \theta)$ with $\frac{3q+3\sqrt{q}-7}{4} \leq k\leq q-4$. In addition, for the boundary cases of $k=q-3, q-2$ and $q-1$, we completely determine their deep holes using results on certain character sums.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18929v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Insertion, deletion, and substitution (IDS) error-correcting codes have garnered increased attention with recent advancements in DNA storage technology. However, a universal method for designing tailored IDS-correcting codes across varying channel settings remains underexplored. We present an autoencoder-based approach, THEA-code, aimed at efficiently generating IDS-correcting codes for complex IDS channels. In the work, a disturbance-based discretization is proposed to discretize the features of the autoencoder, and a simulated differentiable IDS channel is developed as a differentiable alternative for IDS operations. These innovations facilitate the successful convergence of the autoencoder, producing channel-customized IDS-correcting codes that demonstrate commendable performance across complex IDS channels, particularly in the realistic DNA storage channel.</description>

      <title>Iterative Joint Detection of Kalman Filter and Channel Decoder for Sensor-to-Controller Link in Wireless Networked Control Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose an iterative joint detection algorithm of Kalman filter (KF) and channel decoder for the sensor-to-controller link of wireless networked control systems, which utilizes the prior information of control system to improve control and communication performance. In this algorithm, we first use the KF to estimate the probability density of the control system outputs and calculate the prior probability of received signals to assist decoder. Then, the possible outputs of the control system are traversed to update the prior probability in order to implement iterative detection. The simulation results show that the prior information and the iterative structure can reduce the block error rate performance of communications while improving the root mean square error performance of controls.</description>

      <title>Computing Vanishing Ideals for Toric Codes</title>

Abstract: Motivated by applications to the theory of error-correcting codes, we give methods for computing a generating set for the ideal generated by $\beta$-graded polynomials vanishing on certain subsets of a simplicial complete toric variety $X$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, where $\beta$ is a $d\times r$ matrix whose columns generate a subsemigroup $\mathbb{N}\beta$ of $\mathbb{N}^d$. We also give a method for computing the vanishing ideal of the set of $\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $X$. When $\beta=[w_1 \cdots w_r]$ is a row matrix corresponding to a numerical semigroup $\mathbb{N}\beta=\langle w_1,\dots,w_r \rangle$, $X$ is a weighted projective space and generators of the relevant vanishing ideal is given using generators of defining (toric) ideals of numerical semigroup rings corresponding to semigroups generated by subsets of $\{w_1,\dots,w_r\}$.</description>

      <title>Graphical Models and Efficient Inference Methods for Multivariate Phase Probability Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00459</link>

Abstract: Multivariate phase relationships are important to characterize and understand numerous physical, biological, and chemical systems, from electromagnetic waves to neural oscillations. These systems exhibit complex spatiotemporal dynamics and intricate interdependencies among their constituent elements. While classical models of multivariate phase relationships, such as the wave equation and Kuramoto model, give theoretical models to describe phenomena, the development of statistical tools for hypothesis testing and inference for multivariate phase relationships in complex systems remains limited. This paper introduces a novel probabilistic modeling framework to characterize multivariate phase relationships, with wave-like phenomena serving as a key example. This approach describes spatial patterns and interactions between oscillators through a pairwise exponential family distribution. Building upon the literature of graphical model inference, including methods like Ising models, graphical lasso, and interaction screening, this work bridges the gap between classical wave dynamics and modern statistical approaches. Efficient inference methods are introduced, leveraging the Chow-Liu algorithm for directed tree approximations and interaction screening for general graphical models. Simulated experiments demonstrate the utility of these methods for uncovering wave properties and sparse interaction structures, highlighting their applicability to diverse scientific domains. This framework establishes a new paradigm for statistical modeling of multivariate phase relationships, providing a powerful toolset for exploring the complexity of these systems.</description>

      <title>Binarized Neural Networks Converge Toward Algorithmic Simplicity: Empirical Support for the Learning-as-Compression Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the informational complexity of neural networks is a central challenge in machine learning, with implications for generalization, optimization, and model capacity. While most approaches rely on entropy-based loss functions and statistical metrics, these measures often fail to capture deeper, causally relevant algorithmic regularities embedded in network structure. We propose a shift toward algorithmic information theory, using Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) as a first proxy. Grounded in algorithmic probability (AP) and the universal distribution it defines, our approach characterizes learning dynamics through a formal, causally grounded lens. We apply the Block Decomposition Method (BDM) -- a scalable approximation of algorithmic complexity based on AP -- and demonstrate that it more closely tracks structural changes during training than entropy, consistently exhibiting stronger correlations with training loss across varying model sizes and randomized training runs. These results support the view of training as a process of algorithmic compression, where learning corresponds to the progressive internalization of structured regularities. In doing so, our work offers a principled estimate of learning progression and suggests a framework for complexity-aware learning and regularization, grounded in first principles from information theory, complexity, and computability.</description>
