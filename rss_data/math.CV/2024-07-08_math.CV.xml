      <title>Dynamic problem of a power-law graded half-plane and an associated Carleman problem for two functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A steady state plane problem of an inhomogeneous half-plane subjected to a load running along the boundary at subsonic speed is analyzed. The Lame coefficients and the density of the half-plane are assumed to be power functions of depth. The model is different from the standard static model have been used in contact mechanics since the Sixties and originated from the 1964 Rostovtsev exact solution of the Flamant problem of a power-law graded half-plane. To solve the governing dynamic equations with variable coefficients written in terms of the displacements, we propose a method that, by means of the Fourier and Mellin transforms, maps the model problem to a Carleman boundary value problem for two meromorphic functions in a strip with two shifts or, equivalently, to a system of two difference equations of the second order with variable coefficients. By partial factorization the Carleman problem is recast as a system of four singular integral equations on a segment with a fixed singularity and highly oscillating coefficients. A numerical method for its solution is proposed and tested. Numerical results for the displacement and stress fields are presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Curvature of higher direct images of sheaves of twisted holomorphic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the curvature properties of higher direct images $ R^qf_*\Omega_{X/S}^p(E)$, where $f: X\rightarrow S$ is a family of compact K\"ahler manifolds equipped with a hermitian vector bundle $E \rightarrow X$. We derive a general curvature formula and explore several special cases, including those where $p + q = n$, $q = 0$, and $p = n$, with $E$ being a line bundle. Furthermore, the paper examines the curvature in the context of fiberwise hermitian flat cases, families of Hermite-Einstein vector bundles, and applications to moduli spaces and Weil-Petersson metrics, providing some insight into their geometric and analytical properties.</description>

      <title>Small Hankel operator induced by measurable symbol acting on weighted Bergman spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The boundedness of the small Hankel operator $h^\omega_{f}(g)=\overline{P_\omega}(fg)$ induced by a measurable symbol $f$ and the Bergman projection $P_\omega$ associated to a radial weight $\omega$ acting from the weighted Bergman space $A^p_\omega$ to its conjugate analytic counterpart $\overline{A^p_\omega}$ is characterized on the range $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ when $\omega$ belongs to the class $\mathcal{D}$ of radial weights admitting certain two-sided doubling conditions. On the way to the proof a sharp integral estimate for certain modified Bergman kernels is obtained.</description>

      <title>Shape Prior Segmentation Guided by Harmonic Beltrami Signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel shape prior segmentation method guided by the Harmonic Beltrami Signature (HBS). The HBS is a shape representation fully capturing 2D simply connected shapes, exhibiting resilience against perturbations and invariance to translation, rotation, and scaling. The proposed method integrates the HBS within a quasi-conformal topology preserving segmentation framework, leveraging shape prior knowledge to significantly enhance segmentation performance, especially for low-quality or occluded images. The key innovation lies in the bifurcation of the optimization process into two iterative stages: 1) The computation of a quasi-conformal deformation map, which transforms the unit disk into the targeted segmentation area, driven by image data and other regularization terms; 2) The subsequent refinement of this map is contingent upon minimizing the $L_2$ distance between its Beltrami coefficient and the reference HBS. This shape-constrained refinement ensures that the segmentation adheres to the reference shape(s) by exploiting the inherent invariance, robustness, and discerning shape discriminative capabilities afforded by the HBS. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images validate the method's ability to improve segmentation accuracy over baselines, eliminate preprocessing requirements, resist noise corruption, and flexibly acquire and apply shape priors. Overall, the HBS segmentation framework offers an efficient strategy to robustly incorporate the shape prior knowledge, thereby advancing critical low-level vision tasks.</description>

      <title>On the classificarion of 3-dimensional spherical Sasakian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we consider spherical hypersurfaces in $\mathbb C^2$ with a fixed Reeb vector field as 3-dimensional Sasakian manifolds. We establish the correspondence between three different sets of parameters, namely, those arising from representing the Reeb vector field as an automorphism of the Heisenberg sphere, the parameters used in Stanton's description of rigid spheres, and the parameters arising from the rigid normal forms. We also geometrically describe the moduli space for rigid spheres, and provide geometric distinction between Stanton's hypersurfaces and those found by Ezhov and Schmalz. Finally, we determine the Sasakian automorphism groups of the rigid spheres and detect the homogeneous Sasakian manifolds among them.</description>

      <title>Reductive quotients of klt singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.02812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the quotient of a klt type singularity by a reductive group is of klt type. In particular, given a klt variety $X$ endowed with the action of a reductive group $G$ and admitting a quasi-projective good quotient $X\rightarrow X/\!/G$, we can find a boundary $B$ on $X/\!/G$ so that the pair $(X/\!/G,B)$ is klt. This applies for example to GIT-quotients of klt varieties. Our main result has consequences for complex spaces obtained as quotients of Hamiltonian K\"ahler $G$-manifolds, for collapsings of homogeneous vector bundles as introduced by Kempf, and for good moduli spaces of smooth Artin stacks. In particular, it implies that the good moduli space parametrizing $n$-dimensional K-polystable Fano manifolds of volume $v$ has klt type singularities. As a corresponding result regarding global geometry, we show that quotients of Mori Dream Spaces with klt Cox rings are Mori Dream Spaces with klt Cox ring. This in turn applies to show that projective GIT-quotients of varieties of Fano type are of Fano type; in particular, projective moduli spaces of semistable quiver representations are of Fano type.</description>

      <title>Compact K\"ahler 3-folds with nef anti-canonical bundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that a non-projective compact K\"ahler $3$-fold with nef anti-canonical bundle is, up to a finite \'etale cover, one of the following: a manifold with vanishing first Chern class; the product of a K3 surface and the projective line; or a projective space bundle over a $2$-dimensional torus. This result extends Cao-H\"oring's structure theorem for projective manifolds to compact K\"ahler manifolds in dimension $3$. For the proof, we investigate the Minimal Model Program for compact K\"ahler $3$-folds with nef anti-canonical bundles by using the positivity of direct image sheaves, $\mathbb{Q}$-conic bundles, and orbifold vector bundles.</description>
