      <title>Flexible metadata harvesting for ecology using large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large, open datasets can accelerate ecological research, particularly by enabling researchers to develop new insights by reusing datasets from multiple sources. However, to find the most suitable datasets to combine and integrate, researchers must navigate diverse ecological and environmental data provider platforms with varying metadata availability and standards. To overcome this obstacle, we have developed a large language model (LLM)-based metadata harvester that flexibly extracts metadata from any dataset's landing page, and converts these to a user-defined, unified format using existing metadata standards. We validate that our tool is able to extract both structured and unstructured metadata with equal accuracy, aided by our LLM post-processing protocol. Furthermore, we utilise LLMs to identify links between datasets, both by calculating embedding similarity and by unifying the formats of extracted metadata to enable rule-based processing. Our tool, which flexibly links the metadata of different datasets, can therefore be used for ontology creation or graph-based queries, for example, to find relevant ecological and environmental datasets in a virtual research environment.</description>

      <title>Is Artificial Intelligence Reshaping the Landscape of the International Academic Community of Geosciences?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through bibliometric analysis and topic modeling, we find that artificial intelligence (AI) is positively transforming geosciences research, with a notable increase in AI-related scientific output in recent years. We are encouraged to observe that earth scientists from developing countries have gained better visibility in the recent AI for Science (AI4S) paradigm and that AI is also improving the landscape of international collaboration in geoscience-related research.</description>

      <title>The Importance of the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) in Enhancing the Credibility of Scientific Research: An Analytical Data Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to analyze the vital role played by the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) in enhancing the credibility and reliability of scientific research in the digital age. Through an analytical study of DOI usage data derived from international scientific publishing institutions, the extent of its adoption and its recognition as a global standard for encoding research and academic sources was highlighted. The results showed that the number of scientific records registered using DOIs exceeded 167 million, with more than 30,000 DOI prefixes distributed across over 150 countries, reflecting the significant growth in its use by academic and research institutions. Additionally, more than 3.2 billion monthly DOI resolutions were recorded, indicating the increasing reliance on them for accessing resources. The study also included an analysis of the content types registered with DOIs, showing that scientific articles constituted the majority at 71%, followed by books and conference papers. A notable finding was that 95% of citations linked to DOIs are now openly available, contributing to greater transparency and scientific verifiability. The study concluded that the DOI is not merely an organizational tool but a central element in the structure of modern scientific publishing. It contributes to improving research quality, facilitating verification, and ensuring continued accessibility. The study recommended the broader adoption of DOIs, especially in emerging scientific communities, to achieve greater integration in the global research information infrastructure.</description>

      <title>The Power of Data Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Datasets together with active scientific communities prepared to leverage them can contribute to scientific progress and facilitate making research more equitable. In this study we found that MIMIC, despite its limited amount of funding, managed to provide higher impact per dollar spent through accessible data communities. These findings support the notion that making clinical data available empowers innovation which directly addresses clinical concerns and can set new standards for inclusivity.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Generating Research Topic Ontologies: A Multi-Disciplinary Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ontologies and taxonomies of research fields are critical for managing and organising scientific knowledge, as they facilitate efficient classification, dissemination and retrieval of information. However, the creation and maintenance of such ontologies are expensive and time-consuming tasks, usually requiring the coordinated effort of multiple domain experts. Consequently, ontologies in this space often exhibit uneven coverage across different disciplines, limited inter-domain connectivity, and infrequent updating cycles. In this study, we investigate the capability of several large language models to identify semantic relationships among research topics within three academic domains: biomedicine, physics, and engineering. The models were evaluated under three distinct conditions: zero-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and fine-tuning on existing ontologies. Additionally, we assessed the cross-domain transferability of fine-tuned models by measuring their performance when trained in one domain and subsequently applied to a different one. To support this analysis, we introduce PEM-Rel-8K, a novel dataset consisting of over 8,000 relationships extracted from the most widely adopted taxonomies in the three disciplines considered in this study: MeSH, PhySH, and IEEE. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on PEM-Rel-8K yields excellent performance across all disciplines.</description>

      <title>An analysis of the effects of open science indicators on citations in the French Open Science Monitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the correlation of citation impact with various open science indicators (OSI) within the French Open Science Monitor (FOSM), a dataset comprising approximately 900,000 publications authored by French authors from 2020 to 2022. By integrating data from OpenAlex and Crossref, we analyze open science indicators such as the presence of a pre-print, data sharing, and software sharing in 576,537 publications in the FOSM dataset. Our analysis reveals a positive correlation between these OSI and citation counts. Considering our most complete citation prediction model, we find pre-prints are correlated with a significant positive effect of 19% on citation counts, software sharing of 13.5%, and data sharing of 14.3%. We find large variations in the correlations of OSIs with citations in different research disciplines, and observe that open access status of publications is correlated with a 8.6% increase in citations in our model. While these results remain observational and are limited to the scope of the analysis, they suggest a consistent correlation between citation advantages and open science indicators. Our results may be valuable to policy makers, funding agencies, researchers, publishers, institutions, and other stakeholders who are interested in understanding the academic impacts, or effects, of open science practices.</description>
