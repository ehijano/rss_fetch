      <title>Approximation of discontinuous functions by positive linear operators. A probabilistic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain approximation results for general positive linear operators satisfying mild conditions, when acting on discontinuous functions and absolutely continuous functions having discontinuous derivatives. The upper bounds, given in terms of a local first modulus of continuity, are best possible, in the sense that we can construct particular sequences of operators attaining them. When applied to functions of bounded variation or absolutely continuous functions having derivatives of bounded variation, these upper bounds are better and simpler to compute than the usual total variation bounds. The particular case of the Bernstein polynomials is thoroughly discussed. We use a probabilistic approach based on representations of such operators in terms of expectations of random variables.</description>

      <title>Absolute continuity of non-Gaussian and Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the multiplicative chaos measure associated to the log-correlated random Fourier series, or random wave model, with i.i.d. coefficients taken from a general class of distributions. This measure was shown to be non-degenerate when the inverse temperature is subcritical by Junnila (Int. Math. Res. Not. 2020 (2020), no. 19, 6169-6196). When the coefficients are Gaussian, this measure is an example of a Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC), a well-studied universal object in the study of log-correlated fields. In the case of non-Gaussian coefficients, the resulting chaos is not a GMC in general. However, for inverse temperature inside the $L^1$-regime, we construct a coupling between the non-Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure and a GMC such that the two are almost surely mutually absolutely continuous.</description>

      <title>Differentiability of transition semigroup of generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process: a probabilistic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P_s\phi(x)=\mathbb{E}\, \phi(X^x(s))$, be the transition semigroup on the space $B_b(E)$ of bounded measurable functions on a Banach space $E$, of the Markov family defined by the linear equation with additive noise $$ d X(s)= \left(AX(s) + a\right)ds + BdW(s), \qquad X(0)=x\in E. $$ We give a simple probabilistic proof of the fact that null-controlla\-bility of the corresponding deterministic system $$ d Y(s)= \left(AY(s)+ B\mathcal{U}(t)x)(s)\right)ds, \qquad Y(0)=x, $$ implies that for any $\phi\in B_b(E)$, $P_t\phi$ is infinitely many times Fr\'echet differentiable and that $$ D^nP_t\phi(x)[y_1,\ldots ,y_n]= \mathbb{E}\, \phi(X^x(t))(-1)^nI^n_t(y_1,\ldots, y_n), $$ where $I^n_t(y_1,\ldots,y_n)$ is the symmetric n-fold It\^o integral of the controls $\mathcal{U}(t)y_1,\ldots \mathcal{U}(t)y_n$.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic limit of the symmetric exclusion process on complete Riemannian manifolds and principal bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the symmetric exclusion process (SEP) on random neighbourhood graphs drawn from Poisson point processes on complete connected Riemannian manifolds equipped with a Gibbs reference measure. We obtain diffusions with drift induced by the potential of the Gibbs measure as hydrodynamic limits. This is a consequence of the duality between the (SEP) and random walks approximating weighted Laplacians. We also lift the (SEP) to principal bundles, and we obtain horizontal diffusions with drift as hydrodynamic limits. Examples include the orthonormal frame bundle with the horizontal Laplacian which plays a central role in the Eells-Elworthy-\'Emery construction of Riemannian Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Langevin deformation for R\'enyi entropy on Wasserstein space over Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Langevin deformation for the R\'enyi entropy on the $L^2$-Wasserstein space over $\mathbb{R}^n$ or a Riemannian manifold, which interpolates between the porous medium equation and the Benamou-Brenier geodesic flow on the $L^2$-Wasserstein space and can be regarded as the compressible Euler equations for isentropic gas with damping. We prove the $W$-entropy-information formulae and the the rigidity theorems for the Langevin deformation for the R\'enyi entropy on the Wasserstein space over complete Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature or CD$(0, m)$-condition. Moreover, we prove the monotonicity of the Hamiltonian and the convexity of the Lagrangian along the Langevin deformation of flows. Finally, we prove the convergence of the Langevin deformation for the R\'enyi entropy as $c\rightarrow 0$ and $c\rightarrow \infty$ respectively. Our results are new even in the case of Euclidean spaces and compact or complete Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>Dynamical random field Ising model at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the evolution of the zero-temperature random field Ising model as the mean of the external field $M$ increases from $-\infty$ to $\infty$. We focus on two types of evolutions: the ground state evolution and the Glauber evolution. For the ground state evolution, we investigate the occurrence of global avalanche, a moment where a large fraction of spins flip simultaneously from minus to plus. In two dimensions, no global avalanche occurs, while in three or higher dimensions, there is a phase transition: a global avalanche happens when the noise intensity is small, but not when it is large. Additionally, we study the zero-temperature Glauber evolution, where spins are updated locally to minimize the Hamiltonian. Our results show that for small noise intensity, in dimensions $d =2$ or $3$, most spins flip around a critical time $c_d = \frac{2 \sqrt{d}}{1 + \sqrt{d}}$ (but we cannot decide whether such flipping occurs simultaneously or not). We also connect this process to polluted bootstrap percolation and solve an open problem on it.</description>

      <title>Rubik's Cube Scrambling Requires at Least 26 Random Moves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scrambling the standard 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube corresponds to a random walk on a group containing approximately 43 quintillion elements. Viewing the random walk as a Markov chain, its mixing time determines the number of random moves required to sufficiently scramble a solved cube. With the aid of a supercomputer, we show that the mixing time is at least 26, providing the first non-trivial bound.</description>

      <title>Universality of Persistence of Random Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the probability that a random polynomial with independent, mean-zero and finite variance coefficients has no real zeros. Specifically, we consider a random polynomial of degree $2n$ with coefficients given by an i.i.d. sequence of mean-zero, variance-1 random variables, multiplied by an $\frac{\alpha}{2}$-regularly varying sequence for $\alpha&gt;-1$. We show that the probability of no real zeros is asymptotically $n^{-2(b_{\alpha}+b_0)}$, where $b_{\alpha}$ is the persistence exponents of a mean-zero, one-dimensional stationary Gaussian processes with covariance function as $\mathrm{sech}((t-s)/2)^{\alpha+1}$. Our work generalizes the previous results of Dembo et al. [DPSZ02] and Dembo \&amp; Mukherjee [DM15] by removing the requirement of finite moments of all order or Gaussianity. In particular, in the special case $\alpha = 0$, our findings confirm a conjecture by Poonen and Stoll [PS99, Section 9.1] concerning random polynomials with i.i.d. coefficients.</description>

      <title>Uniform boundary Harnack principle for non-local operators on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a uniform boundary Harnack principle (BHP) on any open sets for a large class of non-local operators on metric measure spaces under a jump measure comparability and tail estimate condition, and an upper bound condition on the distribution function for the exit times from balls. These conditions are satisfied by any non-local operator $\mathcal{L}$ that admits a two-sided mixed stable-like heat kernel bounds when the underlying metric measure spaces have volume doubling and reverse volume doubling properties. The results of this paper are new even for non-local operators on Euclidean spaces. In particular, our results give not only the scale invariant but also uniform BHP for the first time for non-local operators on Euclidean spaces of both divergence form and non-divergence form with measurable coefficients.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit for the cover time of the $\lambda$-biased random walk on a binary tree with $\lambda&lt;1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\lambda$-biased random walk on a binary tree of depth $n$ is the continuous-time Markov chain that has unit mean holding times and, when at a vertex other than the root or a leaf of the tree in question, has a probability of jumping to the parent vertex that is $\lambda$ times the probability of jumping to a particular child. (From the root, it chooses one of the two children with equal probability.) For this process, when $\lambda&lt;1$, we derive an $n\rightarrow \infty$ scaling limit for the cover time, that is, the time taken to visit every vertex. The distributional limit is described in terms of a jump process on a Cantor set that can be seen as the asymptotic boundary of the tree. This conclusion complements previous results obtained when $\lambda\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Sample-Path Large Deviations for L\'evy Processes and Random Walks with Lognormal Increments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large deviations theory for heavy-tailed processes has seen significant advances in the recent past. In particular, Rhee et al. (2019) and Bazhba et al. (2020) established large deviation asymptotics at the sample-path level for L\'evy processes and random walks with regularly varying and (heavy-tailed) Weibull-type increments. This leaves the lognormal case -- one of the three most prominent classes of heavy-tailed distributions, alongside regular variation and Weibull -- open. This article establishes the \emph{extended large deviation principle} (extended LDP) at the sample-path level for one-dimensional L\'evy processes and random walks with lognormal-type increments. Building on these results, we also establish the extended LDPs for multi-dimensional processes with independent coordinates. We demonstrate the sharpness of these results by constructing counterexamples, thereby proving that our results cannot be strengthened to a standard LDP under $J_1$ topology and $M_1'$ topology.</description>

      <title>A large deviation principle for the multispecies stirring process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the multispecies stirring process on the discrete torus. We prove a large deviation principle for the trajectory of the vector of densities of the different species. The technique of proof consists in extending the method of the foundational paper [1] based on the superexponential estimate to the multispecies setting. This requires a careful choice of the corresponding weakly asymmetric dynamics, which is parametrized by fields depending on the various species. We also prove the hydrodynamic limit of this weakly asymmetric dynamics, which is similar to but different from the ABC model in [2]. Using the appropriate asymmetric dynamics, we also obtain that the mobility matrix relating the drift currents to the fields coincides with the covariance matrix of the reversible multinomial distribution, which then further leads to the Einstein relation</description>

Abstract: We consider the contact process with dormancy, where wake-up times follow a renewal process. Without infection between dormant individuals, we show that the process under certain conditions grows at most logarithmically. On the other hand, if infections between dormant individuals are possible, the process survives with positive probability even on finite graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to obtain sharp local propagation of chaos results for a system of N particles with a diffusion coefficient that it not constant and may depend of the empirical measure. This extends the recent works of Lacker [14] and Wang [24] to the case of non constant diffusions. The proof relies on the BBGKY hierarchy to obtain a system of differential inequalities on the relative entropy of k particles, involving the fisher information.</description>

      <title>On the longest increasing subsequence and number of cycles of butterfly permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a square matrix $A$, Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (GEPP) results in the factorization $PA = LU$ where $L$ and $U$ are lower and upper triangular matrices and $P$ is a permutation matrix. If $A$ is a random matrix, then the associated permutation from the $P$ factor is random. We are interested in studying properties of random permutations generated using GEPP. We introduce and present probabilistic results for groups of simple and nonsimple butterfly permutations of order $N = p^n$ for prime $p$, on which GEPP induces the Haar measure when applied to particular ensembles of random butterfly matrices. Of note, the nonsimple butterfly permutations include specific $p$-Sylow subgroups of $S_{p^n}$ for each prime $p$. Moreover, we focus on addressing the questions of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) and the number of cycles for butterfly permutations. Our proof techniques utilize the explicit structural recursive properties of these permutations to answer what are traditionally hard analytical questions using simpler tools. For simple butterfly permutations, we provide full distributional descriptions and Law of Large Numbers (LLN) or Central Limit Theorem (CLT) type results for each statistic. For nonsimple $p$-nary butterfly permutations, we establish lower and upper power law bounds on the expected LIS of the form $N^{\alpha_p}$ and $N^{\beta_p}$ where $\frac12 &lt; \alpha_p &lt; \beta_p &lt; 1$ for each $p$ with $\alpha_p = 1 - o_p(1)$. Additionally, we determine the aysmptotic form for the number of cycles scaled by $(2 - \frac1p)^n$ that limit to new distributions we introduce depending only on $p$ whose positive integer moments satisfy explicit recursion formulas for each $p$; in particular, this characterizes a full CLT result for the number of cycles for any uniform $p$-Sylow subgroup of $S_{p^n}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper proposes and implements a methodology to fit a seven-parameter Generalized Tempered Stable (GTS) distribution to financial data. The nonexistence of the mathematical expression of the GTS probability density function makes the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) inadequate for providing parameter estimations. Based on the function characteristic and the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT), We provide a comprehensive approach to circumvent the problem and yield a good parameter estimation of the GTS probability. The methodology was applied to fit two heavily tailed data (Bitcoin and Ethereum returns) and two peaked data (S&amp;P 500 and SPY ETF returns). For each index, the estimation results show that the six parameter estimations are statistically significant except for the local parameter ($\mu$). The goodness of fit was assessed through Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, and Pearson's chi-squared statistics. While the two-parameter geometric Brownian motion (GBM) hypothesis is always rejected, the Generalized Tempered Sable (GTS) distribution fits significantly with a very high P_value; and outperforms the Kobol, CGMY, and Bilateral Gamma distributions.</description>

      <title>Copula-Linked Parallel ICA: A Method for Coupling Structural and Functional MRI brain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different brain imaging modalities offer unique insights into brain function and structure. Combining them enhances our understanding of neural mechanisms. Prior multimodal studies fusing functional MRI (fMRI) and structural MRI (sMRI) have shown the benefits of this approach. Since sMRI lacks temporal data, existing fusion methods often compress fMRI temporal information into summary measures, sacrificing rich temporal dynamics. Motivated by the observation that covarying networks are identified in both sMRI and resting-state fMRI, we developed a novel fusion method, by combining deep learning frameworks, copulas and independent component analysis (ICA), named copula linked parallel ICA (CLiP-ICA). This method estimates independent sources for each modality and links the spatial sources of fMRI and sMRI using a copula-based model for more flexible integration of temporal and spatial data. We tested CLiP-ICA using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our results showed that CLiP-ICA effectively captures both strongly and weakly linked sMRI and fMRI networks, including the cerebellum, sensorimotor, visual, cognitive control, and default mode networks. It revealed more meaningful components and fewer artifacts, addressing the long-standing issue of optimal model order in ICA. CLiP-ICA also detected complex functional connectivity patterns across stages of cognitive decline, with cognitively normal subjects generally showing higher connectivity in sensorimotor and visual networks compared to patients with Alzheimer, along with patterns suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Sampling from Bayesian Neural Network Posteriors with Symmetric Minibatch Splitting Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scalable kinetic Langevin dynamics algorithm for sampling parameter spaces of big data and AI applications. Our scheme combines a symmetric forward/backward sweep over minibatches with a symmetric discretization of Langevin dynamics. For a particular Langevin splitting method (UBU), we show that the resulting Symmetric Minibatch Splitting-UBU (SMS-UBU) integrator has bias $O(h^2 d^{1/2})$ in dimension $d&gt;0$ with stepsize $h&gt;0$, despite only using one minibatch per iteration, thus providing excellent control of the sampling bias as a function of the stepsize. We apply the algorithm to explore local modes of the posterior distribution of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and evaluate the calibration performance of the posterior predictive probabilities for neural networks with convolutional neural network architectures for classification problems on three different datasets (Fashion-MNIST, Celeb-A and chest X-ray). Our results indicate that BNNs sampled with SMS-UBU can offer significantly better calibration performance compared to standard methods of training and stochastic weight averaging.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein distance in terms of the comonotonicity Copula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to write the $p$-Wasserstein metric $W_p$ with the $p$-norm, $p\in [1,\infty)$, on $\R^d$ in terms of copula. In particular for the case of one-dimensional distributions, we get that the copula employed to get the optimal coupling of the Wasserstein distances is the comotonicity copula. We obtain the equivalent result also for $d$-dimensional distributions under the sufficient and necessary condition that these have the same dependence structure of their one-dimensional marginals, i.e that the $d$-dimensional distributions share the same copula. Assuming $p\neq q$, $p,q$ $\in [1,\infty)$ and that the probability measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ are sharing the same copula, we also analyze the Wasserstein distance $W_{p,q}$ discussed in \cite{Alfonsi} and get an upper and lower bounds of $W_{p,q}$ in terms of $W_p$, written in terms of comonotonicity copula. We show that as a consequence the lower and upper bound of $W_{p,q}$ can be written in terms of generalized inverse functions.</description>

      <title>Jackson's inequality on the hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the best constant $J(n,d)$ such that Jackson's inequality \[ \inf_{\mathrm{deg}(g) \leq d} \|f - g\|_{\infty} \leq J(n,d) \, s(f), \] holds for all functions $f$ on the hypercube $\{0,1\}^n$, where $s(f)$ denotes the sensitivity of $f$. We show that the quantity $J(n, 0.499n)$ is bounded below by an absolute positive constant, independent of $n$. This complements Wagner's theorem, which establishes that $J(n,d)\leq 1 $. As a first application we show that reverse Bernstein inequality fails in the tail space $L^{1}_{\geq 0.499n}$ improving over previously known counterexamples in $L^{1}_{\geq C \log \log (n)}$. As a second application, we show that there exists a function $f : \{0,1\}^n \to [-1,1]$ whose sensitivity $s(f)$ remains constant, independent of $n$, while the approximate degree grows linearly with $n$. This result implies that the sensitivity theorem $s(f) \geq \Omega(\mathrm{deg}(f)^C)$ fails in the strongest sense for bounded real-valued functions even when $\mathrm{deg}(f)$ is relaxed to the approximate degree. We also show that in the regime $d = (1 - \delta)n$, the bound \[ J(n,d) \leq C \min\{\delta, \max\{\delta^2, n^{-2/3}\}\} \] holds. Moreover, when restricted to symmetric real-valued functions, we obtain $J_{\mathrm{symmetric}}(n,d) \leq C/d$ and the decay $1/d$ is sharp. Finally, we present results for a subspace approximation problem: we show that there exists a subspace $E$ of dimension $2^{n-1}$ such that $\inf_{g \in E} \|f - g\|_{\infty} \leq s(f)/n$ holds for all $f$.</description>

      <title>Mechanism learning: Reverse causal inference in the presence of multiple unknown confounding through front-door causal bootstrapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major limitation of machine learning (ML) prediction models is that they recover associational, rather than causal, predictive relationships between variables. In high-stakes automation applications of ML this is problematic, as the model often learns spurious, non-causal associations. This paper proposes mechanism learning, a simple method which uses front-door causal bootstrapping to deconfound observational data such that any appropriate ML model is forced to learn predictive relationships between effects and their causes (reverse causal inference), despite the potential presence of multiple unknown and unmeasured confounding. Effect variables can be very high dimensional, and the predictive relationship nonlinear, as is common in ML applications. This novel method is widely applicable, the only requirement is the existence of a mechanism variable mediating the cause (prediction target) and effect (feature data), which is independent of the (unmeasured) confounding variables. We test our method on fully synthetic, semi-synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that it can discover reliable, unbiased, causal ML predictors where by contrast, the same ML predictor trained naively using classical supervised learning on the original observational data, is heavily biased by spurious associations. We provide code to implement the results in the paper, online.</description>

      <title>Interaction Order Estimation in Tensor Curie-Weiss Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the interaction parameter $p$ of a $p$-spin Curie-Weiss model at inverse temperature $\beta$, given a single observation from this model. We show, by a contiguity argument, that joint estimation of the parameters $\beta$ and $p$ is impossible, which implies that estimation of $p$ is impossible if $\beta$ is unknown. These impossibility results are also extended to the more general $p$-spin Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi Ising model. The situation is more delicate when $\beta$ is known. In this case, we show that there exists an increasing threshold function $\beta^*(p)$, such that for all $\beta$, consistent estimation of $p$ is impossible when $\beta^*(p) &gt; \beta$, and for almost all $\beta$, consistent estimation of $p$ is possible for $\beta^*(p)&lt;\beta$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adapt Stein's method to isoperimetric and geometric inequalities. The main challenge is the treatment of boundary terms. We address this by using an elliptic PDE with an oblique boundary condition. We apply our geometric formulation of Stein's method to obtain stability of the Brock-Weinstock inequality, stability of the isoperimetric inequality under a constraint on Steklov's first non-zero eigenvalue, and stability for the combination of weighted and unweighted perimeters. All stability results are formulated with respect to the $\alpha$-Zolotarev distance, $\alpha$ $\in$ (0, 1], that we introduce to interpolate between the Fraenkel asymmetry and the Kantorovich distance.</description>

      <title>Gibbs principle with infinitely many constraints: optimality conditions and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the Gibbs conditioning principle to an abstract setting combining infinitely many linear equality constraints and non-linear inequality constraints, which need not be convex. A conditional large large deviation principle (LDP) is proved in a Wassersteintype topology, and optimality conditions are written in this abstract setting. This setting encompasses versions of the Schr{\"o}dinger bridge problem with marginal non-linear inequality constraints at every time. In the case of convex constraints, stability results for perturbations both in the constraints and the reference measure are proved. We then specify our results when the reference measure is the path-law of a continuous diffusion process, whose law is constrained at each time. We obtain a complete description of the constrained process through an atypical mean-field PDE system involving a Lagrange multiplier.</description>

      <title>Modelling the spread of two successive SIR epidemics on a configuration model network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a stochastic model for two successive SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) epidemics in the same network structured population. Individuals infected during the first epidemic might have (partial) immunity for the second one. The first epidemic is analysed through a bond percolation model, while the second epidemic is approximated by a three-type branching process in which the types of individuals depend on their position in the percolation clusters used for the first epidemic. This branching process approximation enables us to calculate, in the large population limit and conditional upon a large outbreak in the first epidemic, a threshold parameter and the probability of a large outbreak for the second epidemic. A second branching process approximation enables us to calculate the fraction of the population that are infected by such a second large outbreak.
  We illustrate our results through some specific cases which have appeared previously in the literature and show that our asymptotic results give good approximations for finite populations.</description>

Abstract: For the discrete-time or the continuous-time Markov spin models for image generation when each pixel $n=1,..,N$ can take only two values $S_n=\pm 1$, the finite-time forward propagator depends on the initial and final configurations only via their overlap. The large deviations properties with respect to the number $N$ of pixels are analyzed for the overlap and/or the magnetization during the forward noising dynamics and during the backward reconstructive dynamics for various initial conditions, namely (i) a single image (ii) a mixture of two images (iii) when the initial condition corresponds to the Curie-Weiss mean-field ferromagnetic model.</description>

      <title>A new class of splitting methods that preserve ergodicity and exponential integrability for stochastic Langevin equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new class of splitting methods to solve the stochastic Langevin equation, which can simultaneously preserve the ergodicity and exponential integrability of the original equation. The central idea is to extract a stochastic subsystem that possesses the strict dissipation from the original equation, which is inspired by the inheritance of the Lyapunov structure for obtaining the ergodicity. We prove that the exponential moment of the numerical solution is bounded, thus validating the exponential integrability of the proposed methods. Further, we show that under moderate verifiable conditions, the methods have the first-order convergence in both strong and weak senses, and we present several concrete splitting schemes based on the methods. The splitting strategy of methods can be readily extended to construct conformal symplectic methods and high-order methods that preserve both the ergodicity and the exponential integrability, as demonstrated in numerical experiments. Our numerical experiments also show that the proposed methods have good performance in the long-time simulation.</description>

      <title>Complex symmetric, self-dual, and Ginibre random matrices: Analytical results for three classes of bulk and edge statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a conjecture about the local bulk statistics of complex eigenvalues has been made based on numerics. It claims that there are only three universality classes, which have all been observed in open chaotic quantum systems. Motivated by these new insights, we compute and compare the expectation values of $k$ pairs of complex conjugate characteristic polynomials in three ensembles of Gaussian non-Hermitian random matrices representative for the three classes: the well-known complex Ginibre ensemble, complex symmetric and complex self-dual matrices. In the Cartan classification scheme of non-Hermitian random matrices they are labelled as class A, AI$^\dag$ and AII$^\dag$, respectively. Using the technique of Grassmann variables, we derive explicit expressions for a single pair of expected characteristic polynomials for finite as well as infinite matrix dimension. For the latter we consider the global limit as well as zoom into the edge and the bulk of the spectrum, providing new analytical results for classes AI$^\dag$ and AII$^\dag$. For general $k$, we derive the effective Lagrangians corresponding to the non-linear $\sigma$-models in the respective physical systems. Interestingly, they agree for all three ensembles, while the corresponding Goldstone manifolds, over which one has to perform the remaining integrations, are different and equal the three classical compact groups in the bulk. In particular, our analytical results show that these three ensembles have indeed different local bulk and edge spectral statistics, corroborating the conjecture further.</description>

      <title>Cusp Universality for Random Matrices I: Local Law and the Complex Hermitian Case</title>

      <description>arXiv:1809.03971v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For complex Wigner-type matrices, i.e. Hermitian random matrices with independent, not necessarily identically distributed entries above the diagonal, we show that at any cusp singularity of the limiting eigenvalue distribution the local eigenvalue statistics are universal and form a Pearcey process. Since the density of states typically exhibits only square root or cubic root cusp singularities, our work complements previous results on the bulk and edge universality and it thus completes the resolution of the Wigner-Dyson-Mehta universality conjecture for the last remaining universality type in the complex Hermitian class. Our analysis holds not only for exact cusps, but approximate cusps as well, where an extended Pearcey process emerges. As a main technical ingredient we prove an optimal local law at the cusp for both symmetry classes. This result is also used in the companion paper [arXiv:1811.04055] where the cusp universality for real symmetric Wigner-type matrices is proven.</description>

      <title>Dynamical entropy of probability measures on infinite product spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.01541v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this note is to introduce a notion of dynamical entropy, which we call infinite-product entropy, for probability measures on (countable) infinite cartesian product of any measurable space with itself. The idea behind the definition is that any infinite product space may be considered as a type of dynamical object. We have considered in a previous note a similar idea in topological dynamics to define a notion of dynamical entropy for arbitrary subsets of infinite products of compact topological spaces. We consider some basic properties of infinite-product entropy, e.g. shift invariance, convexity, subadditivity with respect to product of probability measures, the behavior with respect to dilation and restriction. We show that for a translation invariant probability measure the infinite-product entropy coincides with the usual entropy of a shift transformation. We consider some basic examples and computations. We also consider a variational inequality related to infinite-product entropy and topological entropy of subsets of infinite product spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.14008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Activated Random Walk (ARW) is an interacting particle system on the $d$-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$. On a finite subset $V \subset \mathbb{Z}^d$ it defines a Markov chain on $\{0,1\}^V$. We prove that when $V$ is a Euclidean ball intersected with $\mathbb{Z}^d$, the mixing time of the ARW Markov chain is at most $1+o(1)$ times the volume of the ball. The proof uses an exact sampling algorithm for the stationary distribution, a coupling with internal DLA, and an upper bound on the time when internal DLA fills the entire ball. We conjecture cutoff at time $\zeta$ times the volume of the ball, where $\zeta&lt;1$ is the limiting density of the stationary state.</description>

      <title>Convergence of random holomorphic functions with real zeros and extensions of the stochastic zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.04284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a unified framework for studying the convergence of rescaled characteristic polynomials of random matrices from various classical ensembles as well as functional convergence results for the Riemann zeta function. To this end, we consider the more general viewpoint of converging point processes (a special case of which is the sequence of converging eigenvalue point processes from random matrix ensembles), and we identify sufficient conditions under which the convergence of random point processes on the real line implies the convergence in law, for the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets, of suitable random holomorphic functions whose zeros are given by the point processes which are considered. Our results extend convergence results for rescaled characteristic polynomials obtained by various authors (in the case of the circular unitary ensemble, the limiting random analytic function is called the stochasic zeta function). We also show that for a wide class of point processes associated with these limiting random holomorphic functions (we can often interpret these points as the spectrum of some random operator), their Stieltjes transform follows for almost all points of the real line the standard Cauchy distribution, reminiscent of the results by Aizenman and Warzel (\cite{AW15}) in the case of the sine kernel point process.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear semigroups and limit theorems for convex expectations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the Chernoff approximation, we provide a general approximation result for convex monotone semigroups which are continuous w.r.t. the mixed topology on suitable spaces of continuous functions. Starting with a family $(I(t))_{t\geq 0}$ of operators, the semigroup is constructed as the limit $S(t)f:=\lim_{n\to\infty}I(\frac{t}{n})^n f$ and is uniquely determined by the time derivative $I'(0)f$ for smooth functions. We identify explicit conditions for the generating family $(I(t))_{t\geq 0}$ that are transferred to the semigroup $(S(t))_{t\geq 0}$ and can easily be verified in applications. Furthermore, there is a structural link between Chernoff type approximations for nonlinear semigroups and law of large numbers and central limit theorem type results for convex expectations. The framework also includes large deviation results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a general framework for dual representations of Laplace transforms of Markov processes. Such representations state that the Laplace transform of a finite-dimensional distribution of a Markov process can be expressed in terms of a Laplace transform involving another Markov process, but with coefficients in the Laplace transform and time indices of the process interchanged. Dual representations of Laplace transforms have been used recently to study open ASEP and to describe stationary measures of the open KPZ equation. Our framework covers both recently discovered examples in the literature and several new ones, involving general L\'evy processes and certain birth-and-death processes.</description>

Abstract: We study asymptotic behaviours of a non-linear vertex-reinforced jump process defined on an arbitrary infinite graph with bounded degree. We prove that if the reinforcement function $w$ is reciprocally integrable and non-decreasing, then the process visits only a finite number of vertices. In the case where $w$ is approximately equal to a super-linear polynomial, we show that the process eventually gets stuck on a star-shaped subgraph and there is exactly one vertex with unbounded local time.</description>

Abstract: We derive the asymptotic behavior of hitting probability at small target of size $O(\epsilon)$ for reflected Brownian motion in domains with suitable smooth boundary conditions, where the boundary of domain contains both reflecting part, absorbing part and target. In this case the domain could be localized near the target and explicit computations are possible. The asymptotic behavior is only related to $\epsilon$ up to some multiplicative constants that depends on the domain and boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Malliavin Calculus for the one-dimensional Stochastic Stefan Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional outer stochastic Stefan problem with reflection which models the short-time prediction of the price or spread of one volatile asset traded in a financial market. The problem admits maximal solutions as long as the velocity of the moving boundary stays bounded, [3,7,8]. We apply Malliavin calculus on the transformed equation and prove first that its maximal solution u has continuous paths a.s. In the case of the unreflected problem, the previous enables localization of a proper approximating sequence of the maximal solution. Then, we derive there locally the differentiability of maximal $u$ in the Malliavin sense. The novelty of this work, apart from the derivation of continuity of the paths for the maximal solution with reflection, is that for the unreflected case we introduce a localization argument on maximal solutions and define efficiently the relevant sample space. More precisely, we prove the local (in the sample space) existence of the Malliavin derivative and, under certain conditions on the noise coefficient, the absolute continuity of the law of the solution with respect to the Lebesgue measure.</description>

      <title>Local Optimality of Dictator Functions with Applications to Courtade--Kumar Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a convex function $\Phi:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$, the $\Phi$-stability of a Boolean function $f$ is $\mathbb{E}[\Phi(T_{\rho}f(\mathbf{X}))]$, where $\mathbf{X}$ is a random vector uniformly distributed on the discrete cube $\{\pm1\}^{n}$ and $T_{\rho}$ is the Bonami-Beckner operator. In this paper, we prove that dictator functions are locally optimal in maximizing the $\Phi$-stability of $f$ over all balanced Boolean functions. Combining this with our previous bound in \cite{yu2023phi}, we provide a computer-assisted proof for the Courtade--Kumar conjecture with the correlation coefficient $\rho\in[0,0.914]$. Our proofs are based on the majorization of noise operators and hypercontractivity inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two-opinion voter models on dense dynamic random graphs. Our goal is to understand and describe the occurrence of consensus versus polarisation over long periods of time. The former means that all vertices have the same opinion, the latter means that the vertices split into two communities with different opinions and few disagreeing edges. We consider three models for the joint dynamics of opinions and graphs: one with a one-way feedback and two which are co-evolutionary, i.e., with a two-way feedback. In the first model only coexistence is attainable, meaning that both opinions survive, but with the presence of many disagreeing edges. In the second model only consensus prevails, while in the third model polarisation is possible. Our main results are functional laws of large numbers for the densities of the two opinions, functional laws of large numbers for the dynamic random graphs in the space of graphons, and a characterisation of the limiting densities in terms of Beta-distributions. Our results are supported by simulations. To prove our results we develop a novel method that involves coupling the co-evolutionary process to a mimicking process with one-way feedback. We expect that this method can be extended to other dense co-evolutionary models.</description>

Abstract: We study $k$-tilings ($k$-tuples of domino tilings) of the Aztec diamond of rank $m$. We assign a weight to each $k$-tiling, depending on the number of dominos of certain types and the number of "interactions" between the tilings. Employing the colored vertex models introduced in earlier work to study supersymmetric LLT polynomials, we compute the generating polynomials of the $k$-tilings. We then prove some combinatorial results about $k$-tilings, including a bijection between $k$-tilings with no interactions and $1$-tilings, and we compute the arctic curves of the tilings for $t=0$ and $t\rightarrow\infty$. We also present some lozenge $k$-tilings of the hexagon and compute the arctic curves of the tilings for $t=0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.12585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a recent surge of interest in coupling methods for Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms: they facilitate convergence quantification and unbiased estimation, while exploiting embarrassingly parallel computing capabilities. Motivated by these, we consider the design and analysis of couplings of the random walk Metropolis algorithm which scale well with the dimension of the target measure. Methodologically, we introduce a low-rank modification of the synchronous coupling that is provably optimally contractive in standard high-dimensional asymptotic regimes. We expose a shortcoming of the reflection coupling, the state of the art at the time of writing, and we propose a modification which mitigates the issue. Our analysis bridges the gap to the optimal scaling literature and builds a framework of asymptotic optimality which may be of independent interest. We illustrate the applicability of our proposed couplings, and the potential for extending our ideas, with various numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a variance reduction approach for Markov chains based on additive control variates and the minimization of an appropriate estimate for the asymptotic variance. We focus on the particular case when control variates are represented as deep neural networks. We derive the optimal convergence rate of the asymptotic variance under various ergodicity assumptions on the underlying Markov chain. The proposed approach relies upon recent results on the stochastic errors of variance reduction algorithms and function approximation theory.</description>

      <title>Seeding with Differentially Private Network Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In public health interventions such as distributing pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention, decision makers rely on seeding algorithms to identify key individuals who can amplify the impact of their interventions. In such cases, constructing a complete sexual activity network is often infeasible due to privacy concerns. Instead, contact tracing can provide influence samples, i.e., sequences of sexual contacts without requiring complete network information. This brings two challenges: protecting individual privacy in the contact data and adapting seeding algorithms to work effectively with incomplete network information. To solve these two problems, we study privacy guarantees for influence maximization algorithms when the social network is unknown and the inputs are samples of prior influence cascades that are collected at random and need privacy protection. Building on recent results that address seeding with costly network information, our privacy-preserving algorithms introduce randomization in the collected data or the algorithm output, and can bound the privacy loss of each node (or group of nodes) in deciding to include their data in the algorithm input. We provide theoretical guarantees of seeding performance with a limited sample size subject to differential privacy budgets in both central and local privacy regimes. Simulations on synthetic random graphs and empirically grounded sexual contacts of men who have sex with men reveal the diminishing value of network information with decreasing privacy budget in both regimes and graceful decrease in performance with decreasing privacy budget in the central regime. Achieving good performance with local privacy guarantees requires relatively higher privacy budgets that confirm our theoretical expectations.</description>

      <title>Change point estimation for a stochastic heat equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a change point model based on a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) corresponding to the heat equation governed by the weighted Laplacian $\Delta_\vartheta = \nabla\vartheta\nabla$, where $\vartheta=\vartheta(x)$ is a space-dependent diffusivity. As a basic problem the domain $(0,1)$ is considered with a piecewise constant diffusivity with a jump at an unknown point $\tau$. Based on local measurements of the solution in space with resolution $\delta$ over a finite time horizon, we construct a simultaneous M-estimator for the diffusivity values and the change point. The change point estimator converges at rate $\delta$, while the diffusivity constants can be recovered with convergence rate $\delta^{3/2}$. Moreover, when the diffusivity parameters are known and the jump height vanishes with the spatial resolution tending to zero, we derive a limit theorem for the change point estimator and identify the limiting distribution. For the mathematical analysis, a precise understanding of the SPDE with discontinuous $\vartheta$, tight concentration bounds for quadratic functionals in the solution, and a generalisation of classical M-estimators are developed.</description>

      <title>Pricing and hedging for a sticky diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17011v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a financial market model featuring a risky asset whose price follows a sticky geometric Brownian motion and a riskless asset that grows with a constant interest rate $r\in \mathbb R $. We prove that this model satisfies No Arbitrage (NA) and No Free Lunch with Vanishing Risk (NFLVR) only when $r=0 $. Under this condition, we derive the corresponding arbitrage-free pricing equation, assess replicability and representation of the replication strategy. We then show that all locally bounded replicable payoffs for the standard Black--Scholes model are also replicable for the sticky model. Last, we evaluate via numerical experiments the impact of hedging in discrete time and of misrepresenting price stickiness.</description>

      <title>Dyson Equation for Correlated Linearizations and Test Error of Random Features Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops some theory of the Dyson equation for correlated linearizations and uses it to solve a problem on asymptotic deterministic equivalent for the test error in random features regression. The theory developed for the correlated Dyson equation includes existence-uniqueness, spectral support bounds, and stability properties. This theory is new for constructing deterministic equivalents for pseudo-resolvents of a class of correlated linear pencils. In the application, this theory is used to give a deterministic equivalent of the test error in random features ridge regression, in a proportional scaling regime, wherein we have conditioned on both training and test datasets.</description>

      <title>Quadratically Regularized Optimal Transport: Existence and Multiplicity of Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal transport problem with quadratic regularization is useful when sparse couplings are desired. The density of the optimal coupling is described by two functions called potentials; equivalently, potentials can be defined as a solution of the dual problem. We prove the existence of potentials for a general square-integrable cost. Potentials are not necessarily unique, a phenomenon directly related to sparsity of the optimal support. For discrete problems, we describe the family of all potentials based on the connected components of the support, for a graph-theoretic notion of connectedness. On the other hand, we show that continuous problems have unique potentials under standard regularity assumptions, regardless of sparsity. Using potentials, we prove that the optimal support is indeed sparse for small regularization parameter in a continuous setting with quadratic cost, which seems to be the first theoretical guarantee for sparsity in this context.</description>

      <title>Matrix Denoising with Doubly Heteroscedastic Noise: Fundamental Limits and Optimal Spectral Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the matrix denoising problem of estimating the singular vectors of a rank-$1$ signal corrupted by noise with both column and row correlations. Existing works are either unable to pinpoint the exact asymptotic estimation error or, when they do so, the resulting approaches (e.g., based on whitening or singular value shrinkage) remain vastly suboptimal. On top of this, most of the literature has focused on the special case of estimating the left singular vector of the signal when the noise only possesses row correlation (one-sided heteroscedasticity). In contrast, our work establishes the information-theoretic and algorithmic limits of matrix denoising with doubly heteroscedastic noise. We characterize the exact asymptotic minimum mean square error, and design a novel spectral estimator with rigorous optimality guarantees: under a technical condition, it attains positive correlation with the signals whenever information-theoretically possible and, for one-sided heteroscedasticity, it also achieves the Bayes-optimal error. Numerical experiments demonstrate the significant advantage of our theoretically principled method with the state of the art. The proofs draw connections with statistical physics and approximate message passing, departing drastically from standard random matrix theory techniques.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the design space of diffusion-based generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12839v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most existing theoretical investigations of the accuracy of diffusion models, albeit significant, assume the score function has been approximated to a certain accuracy, and then use this a priori bound to control the error of generation. This article instead provides a first quantitative understanding of the whole generation process, i.e., both training and sampling. More precisely, it conducts a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of denoising score matching under gradient descent. In addition, a refined sampling error analysis for variance exploding models is also provided. The combination of these two results yields a full error analysis, which elucidates (again, but this time theoretically) how to design the training and sampling processes for effective generation. For instance, our theory implies a preference toward noise distribution and loss weighting in training that qualitatively agree with the ones used in [Karras et al., 2022]. It also provides perspectives on the choices of time and variance schedules in sampling: when the score is well trained, the design in [Song et al., 2021] is more preferable, but when it is less trained, the design in [Karras et al., 2022] becomes more preferable.</description>

      <title>Weak error analysis for strong approximation schemes of SDEs with super-linear coefficients II: finite moments and higher-order schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a series of works on weak convergence of one-step schemes for solving stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with one-sided Lipschitz conditions. It is known that the super-linear coefficients may lead to a blowup of moments of solutions and numerical solutions and thus affect the convergence of numerical methods. Wang et al. (2023, IMA J. Numer. Anal.) have analyzed weak convergence of one-step numerical schemes when solutions to SDEs have all finite moments. Therein some modified Euler schemes have been discussed about their weak convergence orders. In this work, we explore the effects of limited orders of moments on the weak convergence of a family of explicit schemes. The schemes are based on approximations/modifications of terms in the Ito-Talyor expansion. We provide a systematic but simple way to establish weak convergence orders for these schemes. We present several numerical examples of these schemes and show their weak convergence orders.</description>

      <title>Median Based Unit Weibull (MBUW): a new unit distribution Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new 2 parameter unit Weibull distribution is defined on the unit interval (0,1). The methodology of deducing its PDF, some of its properties and related functions are discussed. The paper is supplied by many figures illustrating the new distribution and how this can make it illegible to fit a wide range of skewed data. The new distribution holds a name (Attia) as a nickname.</description>
