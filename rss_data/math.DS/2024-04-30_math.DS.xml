      <title>Stability of the regular $n$-gon rotating equilibria with logarithm interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the linear stability of regular $n$-gon rotating equilibria in the $n$-body problem with logarithm interaction. In the presence of a central mass $M$, linear stability is insured if $M$ is bounded below and above by constants depending on the number and mass of the (equal) outer $n$ bodies. Moreover, we provide explicit equations of these bounds. In the absence of a central mass we find that the regular $n$-gon is linearly stable for $n =2,3,\ldots 6$ only.</description>

      <title>Takens' Last Problem and strong pluripotency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the concept of strong pluripotency of dynamical systems for a hyperbolic invariant set, as introduced in [KNS]. To the best of our knowledge, for the whole hyperbolic invariant set, the existence of robust strongly pluripotent dynamical systems has not been proven in previous studies. In fact, there is an example of strongly pluripotent dynamical systems in [CV01], but its robustness has not been proven. On the other hand, robust strongly pluripotent dynamical systems for some proper subsets of hyperbolic sets had been found in [KS17, KNS]. In this paper, we provide a combinatorial way to recognize strongly pluripotent diffeomorphisms in a Newhouse domain and prove that they are $C^r$-robust, $2\leq r&lt; \infty$. More precisely, we prove that there is a 2-dimensional diffeomorphism with a wild Smale horseshoe which has a $C^r$ neighborhood $\mathcal{U}_0$ where all elements are strongly pluripotent for the whole Smale horseshoe. Moreover, it follows from the result that any property, such as having a non-trivial physical measure supported by the Smale horseshoe or having historic behavior, is $C^r$-persistent relative to a dense subset of $\mathcal{U}_0$.</description>

      <title>The Unique stationary boundary property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally compact group and $\mu$ an admissible probability measure on $G$. Let $(B,\nu)$ be the universal topological Poisson $\mu$-boundary of $(G,\mu)$ and $\Pi_s(G)$ the universal minimal strongly proximal $G$-flow. In this note we present an alternative proof to a recent result of Hartman and Kalantar. We show that the following conditions are equivalent: (i) the measure $\nu$ is the unique $\mu$-stationary measure on $B$, (ii) $(B,G) \cong (\Pi_s(G),G)$.</description>

      <title>Exponential synchronization of the Kuramoto model with inertia and frustration under locally coupled network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the collective synchronized behavior of the Kuramoto model with inertia and frustration effects on a connected and symmetric network. We aim to establish sufficient frameworks for achieving complete frequency synchronization, taking into account initial configuration, small inertia and frustration, and large coupling strength. More precisely, we first demonstrate that the phase diameter will be uniformly bounded by a small value after a finite time. Then we prove that the frequency diameter exhibits exponential decay to zero. Our approach relies on a careful construction of energy functionals, which effectively control the dissipation of phase and frequency diameters.</description>

      <title>Emergent dynamics of the inertial Kuramoto model with frustration on a locally coupled graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the synchronized behavior of the inertial Kuramoto oscillators with frustration effect under a symmetric and connected network. Due to the lack of second-order gradient flow structure and singularity of second-order derivative of diameter, we shift to construct convex combinations of oscillators and related new energy functions that can control the phase and frequency diameters. Under sufficient frameworks on initial data and system parameters, we derive first-order dissipative differential inequalities of constructed energy functions. This eventually gives rise to the emergence of frequency synchronization exponentially fast.</description>

      <title>A geometric approach for stability analysis of delay systems: Applications to network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the network stability or synchronization dynamics of multi-agent systems with time delays is of significant importance in numerous real-world applications. Such investigations often rely on solving the transcendental characteristic equations (TCEs) obtained from linearization of the considered systems around specific solutions. While stability results based on the TCEs with real-valued coefficients induced by symmetric networks in time-delayed models have been extensively explored in the literature, there remains a notable gap in stability analysis for the TCEs with complexvalued coefficients arising from asymmetric networked dynamics with time delays. To address this challenge comprehensively, we propose a rigorously geometric approach. By identifying and studying the stability crossing curves in the complex plane, we are able to determine the stability region of these systems. This approach is not only suitable for analyzing the stability of models with discrete time delays but also for models with various types of delays, including distributed time delays. Additionally, it can also handle random networks. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in designing delayed control strategies for car-following systems, mechanical systems, and deep brain stimulation modeling, where involved are complex-valued TCEs or/and different types of delays. All these therefore highlight the broad applicability of our approach across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Contractivity and Monotonicity for Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies relationships between monotonicity and contractivity, and applies the results to establish that many reaction networks are weakly contractive, and thus, under appropriate compactness conditions, globally convergent to equilibria. Verification of these properties is achieved through a novel algorithm that can be used to generate cones for monotone systems. The results given here allow a unified proof of global convergence for several classes of networks that had been previously studied in the literature.</description>

      <title>Assessing biological control method on the progression of anaplasmosis disease in dominant cattle species in the Matabeleland north province Zimbabwe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a compartmental model for the transmission dynamics of Anaplasmosis in resource limited farmers cattle subjected to a biological control method. The study seeks to evaluate the stability and control of cattle herds dynamics relative to finite agitation. Anaplasmosis disease pose a major threat in eradicating cattle population growth in resources limited communities. In gaining the insight of the disease, the following model analysis strategies were used in order to compute simulations, analysis of the model upon varying initial predator population and testing the effects of different predation rate on the disease dynamics. It is essential that the progression of Anaplasmosis be stable after the introduction of tick predators into cattle-tick system because that provides the usability of predation as a control measure. After analysing the effect of different prediction rates on the spread of the disease in resource limited communities the study asserted that tick predators like birds and bacteria have been neglected as contributors to natural mechanism of Anaplasmosis. Furthermore, the study brought to light that predictors have been neglected as major contributors to natural control mechanism of Anaplasmosis in Zimbabwe. Additional numerical simulations showed that predation method can be used in the eradication of Anaplasmosis disease thus improving rural livelihood. Investigation of natural tick enemies and predation behaviour can lead to better control of the Anaplasmosis disease efficiently and effectively. Finally, we recommend the necessity for resource limited farmers to capitalise on the use of biological disease control measures.</description>

      <title>Stocking and Harvesting Effects in Advection-Reaction-Diffusion Model: Exploring Decoupled Algorithms and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a time-dependent Advection Reaction Diffusion (ARD) $N$-species competition model to investigate the Stocking and Harvesting (SH) effect on population dynamics. For ongoing analysis, we explore the outcomes of a competition between two competing species in a heterogeneous environment under no-flux boundary conditions, meaning no individual can cross the boundaries. We establish results concerning the existence, uniqueness, and positivity of the solution. As a continuation, we propose, analyze, and test two novel fully discrete decoupled linearized algorithms for a nonlinearly coupled ARD $N$-species competition model with SH effort. The time-stepping algorithms are first and second order accurate in time and optimally accurate in space. Stability and optimal convergence theorems of the decoupled schemes are proved rigorously. We verify the predicted convergence rates of our analysis and the efficacy of the algorithms using numerical experiments and synthetic data for analytical test problems. We also study the effect of harvesting or stocking and diffusion parameters on the evolution of species population density numerically and observe the coexistence scenario subject to optimal stocking or harvesting.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flatness and E. Hopf's theorem for magnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the notion of magnetic curvature recently introduced by the first author, we extend E. Hopf's theorem to the setting of magnetic systems. Namely, we prove that if the magnetic flow on the s-sphere bundle is without conjugate points, then the total magnetic curvature is non-positive, and vanishes if and only if the magnetic system is magnetically flat. We then prove that magnetic flatness is a rigid condition, in the sense that it only occurs when either the magnetic form is trivial and the metric is flat, or when the magnetic system is K\"ahler, the metric has constant negative sectional holomorphic curvature, and s equals the Ma\~n\'e critical value.</description>

      <title>P53 Orchestrates Cancer Metabolism: Unveiling Strategies to Reverse the Warburg Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cancer cells exhibit significant alterations in their metabolism, characterised by a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and an increased reliance on glycolysis, even in the presence of oxygen. This metabolic shift, known as the Warburg effect, is pivotal in fuelling cancer's uncontrolled growth, invasion, and therapeutic resistance. While dysregulation of many genes contributes to this metabolic shift, the tumour suppressor gene p53 emerges as a master player. Yet, the molecular mechanisms remain elusive. This study introduces a comprehensive mathematical model, integrating essential p53 targets, offering insights into how p53 orchestrates its targets to redirect cancer metabolism towards an OXPHOS-dominant state. Simulation outcomes align closely with experimental data comparing glucose metabolism in colon cancer cells with wild-type and mutated p53. Additionally, our findings reveal the dynamic capability of elevated p53 activation to fully reverse the Warburg effect, highlighting the significance of its activity levels not just in triggering apoptosis (programmed cell death) post-chemotherapy but also in modifying the metabolic pathways implicated in treatment resistance. In scenarios of p53 mutations, our analysis suggests targeting glycolysis-instigating signalling pathways as an alternative strategy, whereas targeting solely synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 2 (SCO2) does support mitochondrial respiration but may not effectively suppress the glycolysis pathway, potentially boosting the energy production and cancer cell viability.</description>

Abstract: With the dual variational principle and the saddle point reduction we use the abstract bifurcation theory recently developed by author in previous work to prove many new bifurcation results for solutions of four types of Hamiltonian boundary value problems nonlinearly depending on parameters. The most interesting and important among them are those alternative results which can only be proved with our generalized versions of the famous Rabinowitz's alternative bifurcation theorem.</description>

      <title>Analysis of long transients and detection of early warning signals of extinction in a class of predator-prey models exhibiting bistable behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a method of analyzing long transient dynamics in a class of predator-prey models with two species of predators competing explicitly for their common prey, where the prey evolves on a faster timescale than the predators. In a parameter regime near a {\em{singular zero-Hopf bifurcation}} of the coexistence equilibrium state, we assume that the system under study exhibits bistability between a periodic attractor that bifurcates from the singular Hopf point and another attractor, which could be a periodic attractor or a point attractor, such that the invariant manifolds of the coexistence equilibrium point play central roles in organizing the dynamics. To find whether a solution that starts in a vicinity of the coexistence equilibrium approaches the periodic attractor or the other attractor, we reduce the equations to a suitable normal form, and examine the basin boundary near the singular Hopf point. A key component of our study includes an analysis of the long transient dynamics, characterized by their rapid oscillations with a slow variation in amplitude, by applying a moving average technique. We obtain a set of necessary and sufficient conditions on the initial values of a solution near the coexistence equilibrium to determine whether it lies in the basin of attraction of the periodic attractor. As a result of our analysis, we devise a method of identifying early warning signals, significantly in advance, of a future crisis that could lead to extinction of one of the predators. The analysis is applied to the predator-prey model considered in [\emph{Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems - B} 2021, 26(10), pp. 5251-5279] and we find that our theory is in good agreement with the numerical simulations carried out for this model.</description>

Abstract: The R\"ossler System is one of the best known chaotic dynamical systems, exhibiting a plethora of complex phenomena - and yet, only a few studies tackled its complexity analytically. In this paper we find sufficient conditions for the existence of chaotic dynamics for the R\"ossler System at some specific parameter values at which the flow satisfies a certain heteroclinic condition. This will allow us to prove the existence of infinitely many periodic trajectories for the flow, and study their bifurcations in the parameter space of the R\"ossler system.</description>

      <title>Slow passage through a transcritical bifurcation in piecewise linear differential systems: canard explosion and enhanced delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we analyse the phenomenon of the slow passage through a transcritical bifurcation with special emphasis in the maximal delay $z_d(\lambda,\varepsilon)$ as a function of the bifurcation parameter $\lambda$ and the singular parameter $\varepsilon$. We quantify the maximal delay by constructing a piecewise linear (PWL) transcritical minimal model and studying the dynamics near the slow-manifolds. Our findings encompass all potential maximum delay behaviours within the range of parameters, allowing us to identify: i) the trivial scenario where the maximal delay tends to zero with the singular parameter; ii) the singular scenario where $z_d(\lambda, \varepsilon)$ is not bounded, and also iii) the transitional scenario where the maximal delay tends to a positive finite value as the singular parameter goes to zero. Moreover, building upon the concepts by A. Vidal and J.P. Fran\c{c}oise (Int. J. Bifurc. Chaos Appl. 2012), we construct a PWL system combining symmetrically two transcritical minimal models in such a way it shows periodic behaviour. As the parameter $\lambda$ changes, the system presents a non-bounded canard explosion leading to an enhanced delay phenomenon at the critical value. Our understanding of the maximal delay $z_d(\lambda, \varepsilon)$ of a single normal form, allows us to determine both, the amplitude of the canard cycles and, in the enhanced delay case, the increase of the amplitude for each passage.</description>

      <title>Classification of connection graphs of global attractors for $S^1$-equivariant parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the characterization of global attractors $A_f$ for semiflows generated by scalar one-dimensional semilinear parabolic equations of the form $u_t = u_{xx} + f(u,u_x)$, defined on the circle $x\in S^1$, for a class of reversible nonlinearities. Given two reversible nonlinearities, $f_0$ and $f_1$, with the same lap signature, we prove the existence of a reversible homotopy $f_\tau, 0\le\tau\le 1$, which preserves all heteroclinic connections. Consequently, we obtain a classification of the connection graphs of global attractors in the class of reversible nonlinearities. We also describe bifurcation diagrams which reduce a global attractor $A_1$ to the trivial global attractor $A_0=\{0\}$.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of open and semi-open maps of compact Hausdorff spaces by induced maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f\colon X\rightarrow Y$ be a continuous surjection of compact Hausdorff spaces. By $$f_*\colon\mathfrak{M}(X)\rightarrow\mathfrak{M}(Y),\ \mu\mapsto \mu\circ f^{-1} \quad{\rm and}\quad 2^f\colon2^X\rightarrow2^Y,\ A\mapsto f[A]$$ we denote the induced continuous surjections on the probability measure spaces and hyperspaces, respectively. In this paper we mainly show the following facts:
  (1) If $f_*$ is semi-open, then $f$ is semi-open.
  (2) If $f$ is semi-open densely open, then $f_*$ is semi-open densely open.
  (3) $f$ is open iff $2^f$ is open.
  (4) $f$ is semi-open iff $2^f$ is semi-open.
  (5) $f$ is irreducible iff $2^f$ is irreducible.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Class Fluctuation Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.03612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Trajectory Class Fluctuation Theorem (TCFT) substantially strengthens the Second Law of Thermodynamics -- that, in point of fact, can be a rather weak bound on resource fluxes. Practically, it improves empirical estimates of free energies, a task known to be statistically challenging, and has diagnosed successful and failed information processing in experimentally-implemented Josephson-junction information engines. The development here justifies that empirical analysis, explicating its mathematical foundations.
  The TCFT reveals the thermodynamics induced by macroscopic system transformations for each measurable subset of system trajectories. In this, it directly combats the statistical challenge of extremely rare events that dominate thermodynamic calculations. And, it reveals new forms of free energy -- forms that can be solved for analytically and practically estimated. Conceptually, the TCFT unifies a host of previously-established fluctuation theorems, interpolating from Crooks' Detailed Fluctuation Theorem (single trajectories) to Jarzynski's Equality (trajectory ensembles).</description>

      <title>Multiparameter Discrete Morse Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02424v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to extend Morse-Forman theory to vector-valued functions. This is mostly motivated by the need to develop new tools and methods to compute multiparameter persistence. To generalize the theory, in addition to adapting the main definitions and results of Forman to this vectorial setting, we use concepts of combinatorial topological dynamics studied in recent years. This approach proves to be successful in the following ways. First, we establish a result which is more general than that of Forman regarding the sublevel sets of a multidimensional discrete Morse function. Second, we find a way to induce a Morse decomposition in critical components from the critical points of such a function. Finally, we deduce a set of Morse equation and inequalities specific to the multiparameter setting.</description>

      <title>Action principles for dissipative, non-holonomic Newtonian mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A methodology for deriving dual variational principles for the classical Newtonian mechanics of mass points in the presence of applied forces, interaction forces, and constraints, all with a general dependence on particle velocities and positions, is presented. Methods for incorporating constraints are critically assessed. General theory, as well as explicitly worked out variational principles for a dissipative system (due to Lorenz) and a system with anholonomic constraints (due to Pars) are demonstrated. Conditions under which a (family of) dual Hamiltonian flow(s), as well as a constant(s) of motion, may be associated with a conservative or dissipative, and possibly constrained, primal system naturally emerge in this work.</description>

      <title>Transition to anomalous dynamics in a simple random map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The famous Bernoulli shift (or dyadic transformation) is perhaps the simplest deterministic dynamical system exhibiting chaotic dynamics. It is a piecewise linear time-discrete map on the unit interval with a uniform slope larger than one, hence expanding, with a positive Lyapunov exponent and a uniform invariant density. If the slope is less than one the map becomes contracting, the Lyapunov exponent is negative, and the density trivially collapses onto a fixed point. Sampling from these two different types of maps at each time step by randomly selecting the expanding one with probability $p$, and the contracting one with probability $1-p$, gives a prototype of a random dynamical system. Here we calculate the invariant density of this simple random map, as well as its position autocorrelation function, analytically and numerically under variation of $p$. We find that the map exhibits a non-trivial transition from fully chaotic to completely regular dynamics by generating a long-time anomalous dynamics at a critical sampling probability $p_c$, defined by a zero Lyapunov exponent. This anomalous dynamics is characterised by an infinite invariant density, weak ergodicity breaking and power law correlation decay.</description>
