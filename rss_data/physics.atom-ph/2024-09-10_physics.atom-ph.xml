      <title>Multichannel, ultra-wideband Rydberg Electrometry with an Optical Frequency Comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Rydberg atoms have shown tremendous potential to serve as accurate and sensitive detectors of microwaves and millimeter waves, their response is generally limited to a single narrow frequency band around a chosen microwave transition. As a result, their potential to serve as agile and wideband electromagnetic receivers has not been fully realized. Here we demonstrate the use of a mid-infrared, frequency agile optical frequency comb as the coupling laser for three-photon Rydberg atom electrometry. This approach allows us to simultaneously prepare as many as seven individual Rydberg states, allowing for multichannel detection across a frequency range from 1 GHz to 40 GHz. The generality and flexibility of this method for wideband multiplexing is anticipated to have transformative effects in the field of Rydberg electrometry, paving the way for advanced information coding and arbitrary signal detection.</description>

      <title>The non-relativistic expansion of Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian up to $\alpha^8$ order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper calculates the relativistic corrections for the Dirac-Coulomb system through the method of non-relativistic expansion. By expanding the large and small components of the Dirac wave function and the energy eigenvalues in terms of $\alpha^2$ (where $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant), we obtain iterative equations for calculating the higher-order relativistic corrections of non-relativistic systems. For a single-electron system, the operator results of the iterative equations are consistent with those in the literature Ref[Zhou et al 2023 J. Phys. B At. Mol. Opt. Phys. {\bf 56} 045001]. Using these iterative equations, we numerically calculate the relativistic corrections up to the order of $\alpha^{20}$ for the hydrogen atom using Slater basis, which converge rapidly to the analytical results of the hydrogen atom. For the two-electron Dirac-Coulomb system, we also present iterative equations for calculating high-order energy corrections, as well as numerical energy corrections of ground state up to the order of $\alpha^8$.</description>

      <title>Precision spectroscopy on $^9$Be overcomes limitations from nuclear structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many powerful tests of the Standard Model of particle physics and searches for new physics with precision atomic spectroscopy are plagued by our lack of knowledge of nuclear properties. Ideally, such properties may be derived from precise measurements of the most sensitive and theoretically best-understood observables, often found in hydrogen-like systems. While these measurements are abundant for the electric properties of nuclei, they are scarce for the magnetic properties, and precise experimental results are limited to the lightest of nuclei. Here, we focus on $^9$Be which offers the unique possibility to utilize comparisons between different charge states available for high-precision spectroscopy in Penning traps to test theoretical calculations typically obscured by nuclear structure. In particular, we perform the first high-precision spectroscopy of the $1s$ hyperfine and Zeeman structure in hydrogen-like $^9$Be$^{3+}$. We determine its effective Zemach radius with an uncertainty of $500$ ppm, and its bare nuclear magnetic moment with an uncertainty of $0.6$ parts-per-billion (ppb) - uncertainties unmatched beyond hydrogen. Moreover, we compare to measurements conducted on the three-electron charge state $^9$Be$^{+}$, which, for the first time, enables testing the calculation of multi-electron diamagnetic shielding effects of the nuclear magnetic moment at the ppb level. In addition, we test quantum electrodynamics (QED) methods used for the calculation of the hyperfine splitting. Our results serve as a crucial benchmark essential for transferring high-precision results of nuclear magnetic properties across different electronic configurations.</description>

      <title>Quantum control of a single $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ molecular ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Science is founded on the benchmarking of theoretical models against experimental measurements, with the challenge that for all but the simplest systems, the calculations required for high precision become extremely challenging. $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ is the simplest stable molecule, and its internal structure is calculable to high precision from first principles. This allows tests of theoretical models and the determination of fundamental constants. However, studying $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ experimentally presents significant challenges. Standard control methods such as laser cooling, fluorescence detection and optical pumping are not applicable to $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ due to the very long lifetimes of its excited rotational and vibrational states. Here we solve this issue by using Quantum Logic Spectroscopy techniques to demonstrate full quantum control of a single $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ molecule by co-trapping it with an atomic 'helper' ion and performing quantum operations between the two ions. This enables us to perform pure quantum state preparation, coherent control and non-destructive readout, which we use to perform high-resolution microwave spectroscopy of $\mathrm{H}_2^+$. Our results pave the way for high precision spectroscopy of $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ in both the microwave and optical domains, while offering techniques which are transferable to other molecular ions.</description>

      <title>Modeling of a continuous superradiant laser on the sub-mHz \transclock transition in neutral strontium-88</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous superradiance using a narrow optical transition has the potential to improve the short-term stability of state-of-the-art optical clocks. Even though pulsed superradiant emission on a ${\rm mHz}$ linewidth clock transition has been shown, true continuous operation, without Fourier limitation, has turned out to be extremely challenging. The trade-off between maintaining a high atomic flux while minimizing decoherence effects presents a significant obstacle. Here, we discuss the design of a machine that could overcome this problem by combining a high-flux continuous beam of ultra cold strontium atoms with a bowtie cavity for the generation of superradiant lasing. To evaluate the feasibility of our design, we present simulation results for continuous high-efficiency cooling, loading, and pumping to the upper lasing state inside the bowtie cavity. We then present two different models for stimulating the generated superradiant field by taking into account position-dependent shifts, collisional decoherence, light shifts, and atom loss. Finally, we estimate a laser linewidth of less than $100~{\rm mHz}$, limited by atom number fluctuations, and resulting in an output power of hundreds of ${\rm fW}$</description>

      <title>Latent Space Dynamics Learning for Stiff Collisional-radiative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisional-radiative (CR) models describe the atomic processes in a plasma by tracking the population density in the ground and excited states for each charge state of the atom or ion. These models predict important plasma properties such as charge state distributions and radiative emissivity and opacity. Accurate CR modeling is essential in radiative plasma modeling for magnetic fusion, especially when significant amount of impurities are introduced into the plasmas. In radiative plasma simulations, a CR model, which is a set of high-dimensional stiff ordinary differential equations (ODE), needs to be solved on each grid point in the configuration space, which can overwhelm the plasma simulation cost. In this work, we propose a deep learning method that discovers the latent space and learns its corresponding latent dynamics, which can capture the essential physics to make accurate predictions at much lower online computational cost. To facilitate coupling of the latent space CR dynamics with the plasma simulation model in physical variables, our latent space in the autoencoder must be a grey box, consisting of a physical latent space and a data-driven or blackbox latent space. It has been demonstrated that the proposed architecture can accurately predict both the full-order CR dynamics and the critical physical quantity of interest, the so-called radiative power loss rate.</description>

      <title>Optimal Distillation of Coherent States with Phase-Insensitive Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By combining multiple copies of noisy coherent states of light (or other bosonic systems), it is possible to obtain a single mode in a state with lesser noise, a process known as distillation or purification of coherent states. We investigate the distillation of coherent states from coherent thermal states under general phase-insensitive operations, and find a distillation protocol that is optimal in the asymptotic regime, i.e., when the number of input copies is much greater than 1. Remarkably, we find that in this regime, the error -- as quantified by infidelity (one minus the fidelity) of the output state with the desired coherent state -- is proportional to the inverse of the purity of coherence of the input state, a quantity obtained from the Right-Logarithmic-Derivative (RLD) Fisher information metric, hence revealing an operational interpretation of this quantity. The heart of this protocol is a phase-insensitive channel that optimally converts an input coherent thermal state with high amplitude, into an output with significantly lower amplitude and temperature. Under this channel, the purity of coherence remains asymptotically conserved. While both the input and desired output are Gaussian states, we find that the optimal protocol cannot be a Gaussian channel. Among Gaussian phase-insensitive channels, the optimal distillation protocol is a simple linear optical scheme that can be implemented with beam splitters.</description>

      <title>Photonic bands and normal mode splitting in optical lattices interacting with cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong collective interaction of atoms with an optical cavity causes normal mode splitting of the cavity's resonances, whose width is given by the collective coupling strength. At low optical density of the atomic cloud the intensity distribution of light in the cavity is ruled by the cavity's mode function, which is solely determined by its geometry. In this regime the dynamics of the coupled atom-cavity system is conveniently described by the open Dicke model, which we apply to calculating normal mode splitting generated by periodically ordered clouds in linear and ring cavities. We also show how to use normal mode splitting as witness for Wannier-Bloch oscillations in the tight-binding limit. At high optical density the atomic distribution contributes to shaping the mode function. This regime escapes the open Dicke model, but can be treated by a transfer matrix model provided the saturation parameter is low. Applying this latter model to an atomic cloud periodically ordered into a one-dimensional lattice, we observe the formation of photonic bands gaps competing with the normal mode splitting. We discuss the limitations of both models and point out possible pathways to generalized theories.</description>

      <title>Coherent collisional decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the decoherence of a system of $N$ non-interacting heavy particles (atoms) due to coherent scattering with a background gas. We introduce a framework for computing the induced phase shift and loss of contrast for arbitrary preparations of $N$-particle quantum states. We find phase shifts that are inherently $(N\geq 2)$-body effects and may be searched for in future experiments. We analyze simple setups, including a two-mode approximation of an interferometer. We study fully entangled $N00N$ states, which resemble the correlated positions in a matter interferometer, as well as totally uncorrelated product states that are representative of a typical state in an atom interferometer. We find that the extent to which coherent enhancements increase the rate of decoherence depends on the observable of interest, state preparation, and details of the experimental design. In the context of future ultralow-recoil (e.g., light dark matter) searches with atom interferometers we conclude that: {\it i}) there exists a coherently enhanced scattering phase which can be searched for using standard (i.e., contrast/visibility and phase) interferometer observables; {\it ii}) although decoherence rates of one-body observables are {\it not} coherently enhanced, a coherently enhanced loss of contrast can still arise from dephasing; and {\it iii}) higher statistical moments (which are immediately accessible in a counting experiment) {\it are} coherently enhanced and may offer a new tool with which to probe the soft scattering of otherwise undetectable particles in the laboratory.</description>
