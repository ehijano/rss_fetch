      <title>Realization of a fast triple-magic all-optical qutrit in strontium-88</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical clock states of alkaline earth and alkaline earth-like atoms are the fundament of state-of-the-art optical atomic clocks. An important prerequisite for the operation of optical clocks are magic trapping conditions, where electronic and motional dynamics decouple. Here, we identify and experimentally demonstrate simultaneous magic trapping for two clock transitions in $^{88}$Sr, realizing so-called triple-magic conditions at a specially chosen magic angle. Under these conditions, we operate an all-optical qutrit comprising the ground state $^1S_0$, and the two metastable clock states $^3P_0$ and $^3P_2$. We demonstrate fast optical control in an atom array using two- and three-photon couplings to realize high-fidelity manipulation between all qutrit states. Furthermore, at the magic angle we measure atom-atom coherence times between the metastable states as long as 773(21) ms. Our work opens several new directions, including qutrit-based quantum metrology on optical transitions and high-fidelity and high-coherence manipulation on the $^{88}$Sr fine-structure qubit.</description>

      <title>The Rotational and Spin-Rotational Level Structure of para-H$_{2}^+$ from High-Resolution MQDT-Assisted Rydberg-State Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of the low-lying rotational levels of the X$^+$ $ ^2 \Sigma_g ^+$ ($v^+=0$) vibronic ground state of para-H$_2^+$ has been determined by combining frequency-comb calibrated continuous-wave high-resolution laser spectroscopy of $n$f Rydberg series in the range of principal quantum number $n$ between 28 and 115 and Rydberg-series extrapolation using multichannel-quantum-defect theory (MQDT). The use of accurate quantum-defect parameters obtained from new ab initio calculations enabled the experimental determination of the pure rotational term values of the $N^+= 2$, 4 and 6 rotational levels of H$_2^+$ with sub-MHz accuracy (174.236\,744\,6(77), 575.455\,632\,5(86) and 1191.385\,571(240) cm$^{-1}$, respectively), and of the corresponding spin-rotational coupling constants with an accuracy of better than 100 kHz (42.21(4), 41.26(8) and 40.04(8) MHz, respectively). These values are in agreement with the results of first-principles calculations that include high-order relativistic and quantum-electrodynamics corrections to the level energies. To reach the reported accuracy in the Rydberg series extrapolation, it was necessary to correct for artificial level shifts arising in the MQDT calculations in the vicinity of local perturbations of high-$n$ Rydberg states with a $v^+=0$ H$_2^+$ ion core caused by low-$n$ core-excited Rydberg states, and resulting from approximations in the treatment of the Rydberg-electron energy in the interacting channels.</description>

      <title>State-dependent control of the motional modes of trapped ions using an integrated optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the interaction of trapped ions with a state-dependent, high-intensity optical lattice formed above an ion trap chip using integrated photonics. We use a single ion to map the optical potential landscape over many periods of the standing-wave field. For a single ion sitting in the centre of the lattice we observe a state-dependent trap-frequency shift of $2\pi\times 3.33(4)$ kHz, corresponding to a bare optical potential of $2\pi\times 76.8(5)$ kHz for the electronic ground state. We extend this to two ions, measuring state-dependent shifts of both axial modes. Additionally, using the internal-state dependence of the interaction, we perform a direct measurement of the energy distribution of the motion of a single ion using carrier spectroscopy. Improvements to the setup would allow to increase the state-dependent curvature by more than 50 times, providing a tool which can be utilised for motional state control, and multi-ion gates using optical potentials produced in a scalable fashion.</description>

      <title>An explicit numerical scheme for Milne's phase-amplitude equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an explicit numerical method to solve Milne's phase-amplitude equations. Previously proposed methods solve directly Milne's nonlinear equation for the amplitude. For that reason, they exhibit high sensitivity to errors and are prone to instability through the growth of a spurious, rapidly varying component of the amplitude. This makes the systematic use of these methods difficult. On the contrary, the present method is based on solving a linear third-order equation which is equivalent to the nonlinear amplitude equation. This linear equation was derived by Kiyokawa, who used it to obtain analytical results on Coulomb wavefunctions [Kiyokawa, AIP Advances, 2015]. The present method uses this linear equation for numerical computation, thus resolving the problem of the growth of a rapidly varying component.</description>

      <title>Frequency locking: a distinctive feature of the coherent population trapping and the stationarity effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the case where phase modulation of the harmonic signal is used to obtain the error signal for the frequency stabilization to a reference atomic transition. High-frequency modulation, or analog of the Pound-Drever-Hall regime, is considered. We demonstrate that for coherent population trapping, the maximal error-signal slope retains at a certain level with growth in the modulation frequency, while for other types of resonances it drops steadily. The investigation of the low-frequency modulation regime reveals the stationarity effect. We show that in this case, the maximal steepness of the error signal does not depend on the modulation frequency and is reached at a fixed value of the frequency deviation.</description>

      <title>Bottom-up approach to scalable growth of molecules capable of optical cycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gas-phase molecules capable of repeatable, narrow-band spontaneous photon scattering are prized for direct laser cooling and quantum state detection. Recently, large molecules incorporating phenyl rings have been shown to exhibit similar vibrational closure to the small molecules demonstrated so far, and it is not yet known if the high vibrational-mode density of even larger species will eventually compromise optical cycling. Here, we systematically increase the size of hydrocarbon ligands attached to single alkaline-earth-phenoxides from (-H) to -C$_{14}$H$_{19}$ while measuring the vibrational branching fractions of the optical transition. We find that varying the ligand size from 1 to more than 30 atoms does not systematically reduce the cycle closure, which remains around 90%. Theoretical extensions to larger diamondoids and bulk diamond surface suggest that alkaline earth phenoxides may maintain the desirable scattering behavior as the system size grows further, with no indication of an upper limit.</description>
