      <title>Biogenic sulfur gases as biosignatures on temperate sub-Neptune waterworlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical predictions and observational data indicate a class of sub-Neptune exoplanets may have water-rich interiors covered by hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. Provided suitable climate conditions, such planets could host surface liquid oceans. Motivated by recent JWST observations of K2-18 b, we self-consistently model the photochemistry and potential detectability of biogenic sulfur gases in the atmospheres of temperate sub-Neptune waterworlds for the first time. On Earth today, organic sulfur compounds produced by marine biota are rapidly destroyed by photochemical processes before they can accumulate to significant levels. Shawn et al. (2011) suggest that detectable biogenic sulfur signatures could emerge in Archean-like atmospheres with higher biological production or low UV flux. In this study, we explore biogenic sulfur across a wide range of biological fluxes and stellar UV environments. Critically, the main photochemical sinks are absent on the nightside of tidally locked planets. To address this, we further perform experiments with a 3D GCM and a 2D photochemical model (VULCAN 2D (Tsai et al. 2024)) to simulate the global distribution of biogenic gases to investigate their terminator concentrations as seen via transmission spectroscopy. Our models indicate that biogenic sulfur gases can rise to potentially detectable levels on hydrogen-rich water worlds, but only for enhanced global biosulfur flux ($\gtrsim$20 times modern Earth's flux). We find that it is challenging to identify DMS at 3.4 $\mu m$ where it strongly overlaps with CH$_4$, whereas it is more plausible to detect DMS and companion byproducts, ethylene (C$_2$H$_4$) and ethane (C$_2$H$_6$), in the mid-infrared between 9 and 13 $\mu m$.</description>

      <title>A Surface Hydrothermal Source of Nitriles and Isonitriles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant impacts can generate transient hydrogen-rich atmospheres, reducing atmospheric carbon. The reduced carbon will form hazes that rain out onto the surface and can become incorporated into the crust. Once heated, a large fraction of the carbon would be converted into graphite. The result is that local regions of the Hadean crust were plausibly saturated with graphite. We explore the consequences of such a crust for a prebiotic surface hydrothermal vent scenario. We model a surface vent fed by nitrogen-rich volcanic gas from high-temperature magmas passing through graphite-saturated crust. We consider this occurring at pressures of 1-1000 bar and temperatures of 1500-1700 degC. The equilibrium with graphite purifies the left-over gas, resulting in substantial quantities of nitriles (0.1% HCN and 1 ppm HC3N) and isonitriles (0.01% HNC) relevant for prebiotic chemistry. We use these results to predict gas-phase concentrations of methyl isonitrile of ~ 1 ppm. Methyl isocyanide can participate in the non-enzymatic activation and ligation of the monomeric building blocks of life, and surface, or shallow, hydrothermal environments provide its only known equilibrium geochemical source.</description>

      <title>The Dissolution of Planetesimals in Electrostatic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetesimals or smaller bodies in protoplanetary disks are often considered to form as pebble piles in current planet formation models. They are supposed to be large but loose, weakly bound clusters of more robust dust aggregates. This makes them easy prey for destructive processes. In microgravity experiments, we apply strong electric fields on clusters of slightly conductive dust aggregates. We find that this generates enough tensile stress on the fragile clusters to sequentially rip off the aggregates from the cluster. These experiments imply that electric fields in protoplanetary disks can dissolve pebble pile planetesimals. This process might induce a bias for the local planetesimal reservoir in regions with strong fields. Planetesimals prevail with certain kinds of compositions where they are either good isolators or compacted bodies. The less lucky ones generate pebble clouds which might be observable as signposts of electrostatic activity in protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Reconnaissance ultracool spectra in the Euclid Deep Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Euclid will carry out a deep survey benefiting the discovery and characterisation of ultracool dwarfs (UCDs), especially in the Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs), which the telescope will scan repeatedly throughout its mission. The photometric and spectroscopic standards in the EDFs are important benchmarks, crucial for the classification and characterisation of new UCD discoveries and for the calibration of the mission itself. Aims. We aim to provide a list of photometric UCD candidates and collect near-infrared reconnaissance spectra for M, L, and T-type UCDs in the EDFs as future Euclid UCD references. Methods. In EDF North, we cross-matched public optical and infrared surveys with certain photometric criteria to select UCDs. In EDF Fornax and EDF South, we used photometrically classified samples from the literature. We also include UCDs identified by Gaia DR2. We selected 7 UCD targets with different spectral types from the lists and obtained low-resolution 0.9-2.5 {\mu}m spectra of them using GTC/EMIR and the VLT/X-shooter. We also selected a young, bright L dwarf near EDF Fornax to test the coherence of these two facilities. We included an extra T dwarf in EDF North with its published J-band spectrum. Results. We retrieved a list of 92 (49, 231) M, 33 (29, 115) L, and 1 (0, 2) T dwarf candidates in EDF North, Fornax, and South, respectively. They are provided to guide future UCD discoveries and characterisations by Euclid. In total, we collected near-infrared spectra for 9 UCDs, including 2 M types, 3 L types, and 4 T types in or close to the 3 EDFs. The Euclidised spectra show consistency in their spectral classification, which demonstrates that slitless Euclid spectroscopy will recover the spectral types with high fidelity for UCDs, both in the EDFs and in the wide survey. We also demonstrate that Euclid will be able to distinguish different age groups of UCDs.</description>

      <title>Rapid hydrofracture of icy moon shells: insights from glaciology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Europa's surface features many regions of complex topography termed 'chaos terrains'. One set of hypotheses for chaos terrain formation requires upward migration of liquid water from perched water bodies within the icy shell formed by convection and tidal heating. However, consideration of the behaviour of terrestrial ice sheets suggests the upwards movement of water from perched water bodies is uncommon. Instead, rapid downwards hydrofracture - unbounded given a sufficient supply of water - can occur in relatively low tensile stress states given a sufficiently deep initial fracture due to the negative relative buoyancy of water. I suggest that downwards, not upwards, fracture may be more reasonable for perched water bodies but show that full hydrofracture is unlikely if the perched water body is located beneath a mechanically strong icy lid. However, full hydrofracture is possible in the event of lid collapse over a perched water body and likely in the event of a meteor impact that generates sufficient meltwater and a tensile shock. This provides a possible mechanism for the transfer of biologically important nutrients to the subsurface ocean and the formation of chaos terrains.</description>
