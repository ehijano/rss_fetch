      <title>Local structure of tame symmetric algebras of period four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the structure of Gabriel quivers of tame symmetric algebras of period four. More precisely, we focus on algebras having Gabriel quiver {\it biregular}, i.e. the numbers of arrows starting and ending at any vertex are equal, and do not exceed $2$. We describe the local structure of biregular Gabriel quivers of tame symmetric algebras of period four, including certain idempotent algebras. The main result of this paper shows that, in fact, these Gabriel quivers have local structure exactly as Gabriel quivers of so called {\it weighted surface algebras}, which partially extends known characterization of algebras of generalized quaternion type.</description>

      <title>Mixed modular perverse sheaves on affine flag varieties and Koszul duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under some technical assumptions, and building on joint work with Bezrukavnikov, we prove a multiplicity formula for indecomposable tilting perverse sheaves on affine flag varieties, with coefficients in a field of characteristic $p$, in terms of $p$-Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials. Under the same assumptions, we also explain the construction of a "degrading functor" relating mixed modular perverse sheaves (as defined in joint work with Achar) on such varieties to ordinary perverse sheaves.</description>

      <title>The Cayley Transform on Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Cayley transform is a birational map between a quadratic matrix group and its Lie algebra, which was first discovered by Cayley in 1846. Because of its essential role in both pure and applied mathematics, the classical Cayley transform has been generalized from various perspectives. This paper is concerned with a representation theoretic generalization of the classical Cayley transform. The idea underlying this work is that the applicability of the classical Cayley transform heavily depends on how the Lie group is represented. The goal is to characterize irreducible representations of a Lie group, to which the classical Cayley transform is applicable. To this end, we first establish criteria of the applicability for a general Lie group. If the group is semisimple, we further obtain a geometric condition on the weight diagram of such representations. Lastly, we provide a complete classification for classical complex simple Lie groups and their compact real forms. Except for the previously known examples, spin representations of $\mathrm{Spin}(8)$ are the only ones on our list.</description>

      <title>The stable wave front set of theta representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the stable wave front set of theta representations for certain tame Brylinski-Deligne covers of a connected reductive $p$-adic group. The computation involves two main inputs. First we use a theorem of Okada, adapted to covering groups, to reduce the computation of the wave front set to computing the Kawanaka wave front set of certain representations of finite groups of Lie type. Second, to compute the Kawanaka wave front sets we use Lusztig's formula. This requires a careful analysis of the action of the pro-$p$ Iwahori-Hecke algebra on the theta representation, using the structural results about Hecke algebras developed by Gao-Gurevich-Karasiewicz and Wang.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero and let $\mathfrak{sl}_2 (K)$ be the 3-dimensional simple Lie algebra over $K$. In this paper we describe a finite basis for the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded identities of the adjoint representation of $\mathfrak{sl}_2 (K)$, or equivalently, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded identities for the pair $(M_3(K), \mathfrak{sl}_2 (K))$. We work with the canonical grading on $\mathfrak{sl}_2 (K)$ and the only nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$-grading of the associative algebra $M_3(K)$ induced by that on $\mathfrak{sl}_2(K)$.</description>

      <title>Tensor products of Leibniz bimodules and Grothendieck rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we define three different notions of tensor products for Leibniz bimodules. The ``natural" tensor product of Leibniz bimodules is not always a Leibniz bimodule. In order to fix this, we introduce the notion of a weak Leibniz bimodule and show that the ``natural" tensor product of weak bimodules is again a weak bimodule. Moreover, it turns out that weak Leibniz bimodules are modules over a cocommutative Hopf algebra canonically associated to the Leibniz algebra. Therefore, the category of all weak Leibniz bimodules is symmetric monoidal and the full subcategory of finite-dimensional weak Leibniz bimodules is rigid and pivotal. On the other hand, we introduce two truncated tensor products of Leibniz bimodules which are again Leibniz bimodules. These tensor products induce a non-associative multiplication on the Grothendieck group of the category of finite-dimensional Leibniz bimodules. In particular, we prove that in characteristic zero for a finite-dimensional solvable Leibniz algebra this Grothendieck ring is an alternative power-associative commutative Jordan ring, but for a finite-dimensional non-zero semi-simple Leibniz algebra it is neither alternative nor a Jordan ring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive formulas for the number of points on the basic stratum of certain Kottwitz varieties in terms of automorphic representations and certain explicit polynomials, for which we present efficient algorithms for computation. We obtain our results using the trace formula, base change, representations of general linear groups over p-adic fields, and a truncation of the formula of Kottwitz for the number of points on Shimura varieties over finite fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We further develop the BPS/CFT correspondence between quiver W-algebras/$qq$-characters and partition functions of gauge origami. We introduce $qq$-characters associated with multi-dimensional partitions with nontrivial boundary conditions which we call Donaldson--Thomas (DT) $qq$-characters. They are operator versions of the equivariant DT vertices of toric Calabi--Yau three and four-folds. Moreover, we revisit the construction of the D8 $qq$-characters with no boundary conditions and give a quantum algebraic derivation of the sign rules of the magnificent four partition function. We also show that under the proper sign rules, the D6 and D8 $qq$-characters with no boundary conditions all commute with each other and discuss its physical interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.02774v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to representation theory of finite groups that uses some basic algebraic geometry and allows to do all the theory without using characters. With this approach, to any finite group $G$ we associate a finite number of points and show that any field containing the coordinates of those points works fine as the ground field for the representations of $G$. We apply this point of view to the symmetric group $S_d$, finding easy equations for the different symmetries of functions in $d$ variables. As a byproduct, we give an easy proof of a recent result by Tocino that states that the hyperdeterminant of a $d$-dimensional matrix is zero for all but two types of symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We establish the analog for real homogeneous spherical varieties of the Scattering Theorem of Sakellaridis and Venkatesh (Periods and harmonic analysis on spherical varieties, Asterisque 396, (2017), Theorem 7.3.1) for p-adic wavefront spherical varieties. We use properties of the Harish-Chandra homomorphism of Knop for invariant differential operators of the variety, special coverings of the variety and spectral projections. Our main result depend on an analog of the Discrete Series Conjecture of Sakellaridis and Venkatesh (\cite{SV}, Conjecture 9.4.6). Their result quoted above depends on this Discrete series conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a covering of a quiver (with potential), we show that the associated Bridgeland stability scattering diagrams are related by a restriction operation under the assumption of admitting a nice grading. We apply this to quivers with potential associated to marked surfaces. In combination with recent results of the second and third authors, our findings imply that the bracelets basis for a once-punctured closed surface coincides with the theta basis for the associated stability scattering diagram, and these stability scattering diagrams agree with the corresponding cluster scattering diagrams of Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich except in the case of the once-punctured torus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01890v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $ k \in \mathbb{N}$ we introduce an idempotent subalgebra, the spherical partition algebra ${\mathcal{SP} }_{k}$, of the partition algebra ${\mathcal{P} }_{k}$, that we define using an embedding associated with the trivial representation of the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_k$. We determine a basis for ${\mathcal{SP} }_{k}$ and this provides a combinatorial interpretation of the dimension of $\mathcal{SP}_{k}$, involving bipartite partitions of $ k$. For $ t \in \mathbb{C} $ we consider the specialized algebra $\mathcal{SP}_{k}(t)$. For $ t = n \in \mathbb{N}$, we describe the structure of $\mathcal{SP}_{k}(n)$ by giving the permutation module decomposition of the $k$'th symmetric power of the defining module for the symmetric group algebra $ \mathbb{C} \mathfrak{S}_n $. In general, we show that $\mathcal{SP}_{k}(t)$ is quasi-hereditary over $ \mathbb{C}$ for all $ t \in \mathcal{C}$, except $ t=0$. We determine the decomposition numbers for $\mathcal{SP}_{k}(t)$ for every specialization $ t \in \mathbb{C} $ except $ t= 0 $, (which includes semisimple and non-semisimple cases). In particular we determine the structure of all indecomposable projective modules, and the indecomposable tilting modules.</description>

As an application, we establish the existence of sufficiently many continuous representations of such groupoids on finite-rank Hilbert bundles locally, and use this fact to prove a new generalization of the classical Tannaka duality theorem to groupoids in a purely topological setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider problems concerning the largest degrees of irreducible characters of symmetric groups, and the multiplicities of character degrees of symmetric groups. Using evidence from computer experiments, we posit several new conjectures or extensions of previous conjectures, and prove a number of results. One of these is that, if $n\geq 21$, then there are at least eight irreducible characters of $S_n$, all of which have the same degree, and which have irreducible restriction to $A_n$. We explore similar questions about unipotent degrees of $\GL_n(q)$. We also make some remarks about how the experiments here shed light on posited algorithms for finding the largest irreducible character degree of $S_n$.</description>

Abstract: For a reductive group $G$, we introduce a notion of singular support for cocomplete dualizable DG-categories equipped with a strong $G$-action. This is done by considering the singular support of the sheaves of matrix coefficients arising from the action. We focus particularly on dualizable $G$-categories whose singular support lies in the nilpotent cone of $\mathfrak{g}^*$ and refer to these as nilpotent $G$-categories. For such categories, we give a characterization of the singular support in terms of the vanishing of its generalized Whittaker models.
  We study parabolic induction and restriction functors of nilpotent $G$-categories and show that they interact with singular support in a desired way.
  We prove that if an orbit is maximal in the singular support of a nilpotent $G$-category $\mathcal{C}$, the Hochschild homology of the generalized Whittaker model of $\mathcal{C}$ coincides with the microstalk of the character sheaf of $\mathcal{C}$ at that orbit. This should be considered a categorified analogue of a result of Moeglin-Waldspurger that the dimension of the generalized Whittaker model of a smooth admissible representation of a reductive group over a non-Archimedean local field of characteristic zero coincides with the Fourier coefficient in the wave-front set of that orbit.
  As a consequence, we give another proof of a theorem of Bezrukavnikov-Losev, classifying finite-dimensional modules for $W$-algebras with fixed regular central character. More precisely, we realize the (rationalized) Grothendieck group of this category as a certain subrepresentation of the Springer representation. Along the way, we show that the Springer action of the Weyl group on the twisted Grothendieck--Springer sheaves is the categorical trace of the wall crossing functors, extending an observation of Zhu for integral central characters.</description>

      <title>Duality theory for Clifford tensor powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The representation theory of the Clifford group is playing an increasingly prominent role in quantum information theory, including in such diverse use cases as the construction of protocols for quantum system certification, quantum simulation, and quantum cryptography. In these applications, the tensor powers of the defining representation seem particularly important. The representation theory of these tensor powers is understood in two regimes. 1. For odd qudits in the case where the power t is not larger than the number of systems n: Here, a duality theory between the Clifford group and certain discrete orthogonal groups can be used to make fairly explicit statements about the occurring irreps (this theory is related to Howe duality and the eta-correspondence). 2. For qubits: Tensor powers up to t=4 have been analyzed on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we provide a unified framework for the duality approach that also covers qubit systems. To this end, we translate the notion of rank of symplectic representations to representations of the qubit Clifford group, and generalize the eta correspondence between symplectic and orthogonal groups to a correspondence between the Clifford and certain orthogonal-stochastic groups. As a sample application, we provide a protocol to efficiently implement the complex conjugate of a black-box Clifford unitary evolution.</description>

      <title>The Cohomological Sarnak-Xue Density Hypothesis for $SO_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the cohomological version of the Sarnak-Xue Density Hypothesis for $SO_5$ over a totally real field and for inner forms split at all finite places. The proof relies on recent lines of work in the Langlands program: (i) Arthur's Endoscopic Classification of Representations of classical groups, and (ii) the Generalized Ramanujan-Petersson Theorem, proved for cohomological self-dual cuspidal representations of general linear groups. We give applications for the growth of cohomology of arithmetic manifolds, density-Ramanujan complexes, cutoff phenomena and optimal strong approximation.</description>

      <title>Hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials of Jacobi type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the theory of hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials, we consider quasi-orthogonal polynomial families - those that are orthogonal with respect to a non-degenerate bilinear form defined by a linear functional - in which the ratio of successive coefficients is given by a rational function $f(u,s)$ which is polynomial in $u$. We call this a family of Jacobi type.
  Our main result is that, up to rescaling and renormalization, there are only five families of Jacobi type. These are the classical families of Jacobi, Laguerre and Bessel polynomials, and two more one parameter families $E_n^{(c)},F_n^{(c)}$. Each family arises as a specialization of some hypergeometric series. The last two families can also be expressed through Lommel polynomials, and they are orthogonal with respect to a positive measure on $\mathbb{R}$ for $c&gt;0$ and $c&gt;-1$ respectively.
  We also consider the more general rational families, i.e. quasi-orthogonal families in which the ratio $f(u,s)$ of successive coefficients is allowed to be rational in $u$ as well.</description>

      <title>Generic Properties of Hitchin Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a split real form of a complex simple adjoint group and let $S$ be a closed orientable surface of genus at least 2. We show that for generic $\operatorname{PSL}_{2k-1}(\mathbb{R})$-Hitchin representations $\rho$, the middle eigenvalue of $\rho(x)$ is not equal to 1 for all elements $x\in \pi_1(S)$ which are not null-homologous. Using the same technique, we prove that generic orbifold Hitchin representations are strongly dense. This extends the result of Long, Reid and Wolff for the $G=\operatorname{PSL}_n(\mathbb{R})$ case. Our theorem also shows that the split real forms of many simple adjoint Lie groups contain strongly dense orbifold fundamental groups, partially generalizing the work of Breuillard, Guralnick and Larsen.</description>

      <title>PBW-deformations of smash products involving Hopf algebra of Kac-Paljutkin type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, it is shown that all PBW-deformations of the smash product $A \# H_{2n^2}$ for the Kac-Paljutkin type Hopf algebra $H_{2n^2}$ that preserve the grading on its Koszul $H_{2n^2}$-module algebra $A$. A necessary and sufficient condition for the Koszul dual algebra $A^{!}$ to be an $H$-module algebra is provided. Then we describe all PBW-deformations of the smash product algebra $A^! \# H_{2n^2}$ for a given $H_{2n^2}$-module algebra $A$. Additionally, we introduce the braided tensor product algebra $(A \otimes^c A^{\mathrm{op}}_c) \# H_{2n^2}$ and explore all nontrivial PBW-deformations of this algebra.</description>
