      <title>Stability of sub-dimensional localization to electronic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-dimensional localization, also known as directional localization, arises when 2d electrons are subject to a periodic potential and incommensurate magnetic field which cause them to become exponentially localized along one crystal axis, while remaining extended in the orthogonal direction. We establish that sub-dimensional localization is robust to the presence of electronic interactions, which are known to generically destabilize single-particle localization. Consequently we predict that sub-dimensional localization may occur in moire materials, where it is manifest as a total absence of conductivity in the localized (transverse) direction, with finite conductivity in the extended (longitudinal) direction. We find the electrons form longitudinal charge density waves which are incommensurate with the moire potential, allowing them to slide and hence conduct in the longitudinal direction. The conductivity remains prohibited in the transverse direction due an emergent charge dipole moment conservation law.</description>

      <title>Polarization and charge-separation of moir\'e excitons in van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) bilayers exhibit periodic moir\'e potentials, which can trap excitons at certain high-symmetry sites. At small twist angles, TMD lattices undergo an atomic reconstruction, altering the moir\'e potential landscape via the formation of large domains, potentially separating the charges in-plane and leading to the formation of intralayer charge-transfer (CT) excitons. Here, we employ a microscopic, material-specific theory to investigate the intralayer charge-separation in atomically reconstructed MoSe$_2$-WSe$_2$ heterostructures. We identify three distinct and twist-angle-dependent exciton regimes including localized Wannier-like excitons, polarized excitons, and intralayer CT excitons. We calculate the moir\'e site hopping for these excitons and predict a fundamentally different twist-angle-dependence compared to regular Wannier excitons - presenting an experimentally accessible key signature for the emergence of intralayer CT excitons. Furthermore, we show that the charge separation and its impact on the hopping can be efficiently tuned via dielectric engineering.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic spin dynamics in antiferromagnets with a nonrelativistic spin splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets (AFM) with a nonrelativistic spin splitting (NSS) of electronic bands expand the range of spin-dependent phenomena and their applications. A crucial understanding for both of them pertains to the inherent spin dynamics. We demonstrate that the $d$-wave NSS gives rise to extremely anisotropic spin dynamics of carriers driven by the relaxation induced by motional narrowing. In contrast to the no relaxation of the spin polarization along the Neel vector, the dynamics of perpendicular spin components greatly varies from a long relaxation for a weak NSS to the fast-decaying oscillations for a strong NSS, a regime relevant to AFM with the $d$-wave NSS. The extreme anisotropy of the spin relaxation is transformed by the external magnetic field, which triggers the relaxation of the parallel spin component and also suppresses all the relaxation rates at larger magnitudes. The predicted spin dynamics of the $d$-wave NSS, known also from altermagnets, can be used as their experimental fingerprints and guide future applications.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Spin-Light Coupling in Proximitized Dirac Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-dimensional (2D) materials are highly susceptible to the influence of their neighbors, thereby enabling the design by proximity phenomena. We reveal a remarkable terahertz (THz) spin-light interaction in 2D Dirac materials that arises from magnetic and spin-orbital proximity effects. The dynamical realization of the spin-charge conversion, the electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR), of Dirac electrons displays distinctive THz features, upon emerging spin-pseudospin proximity terms in the Hamiltonian. To capture the effect of fast pseudospin dynamics on the electron spin, we develop a mean-field theory and complement it with a quantum-mechanical treatment. As a specific example, we investigate the THz response of a single graphene layer proximitized by a magnetic substrate. Our analysis demonstrates a strong enhancement and anomalous polarization structure of the THz-light absorption which can enable THz detection and efficient generation and control of spins in spin-based quantum devices. The identified coupled spin-pseudospin dynamics is not limited to EDSR and may influence a broad range of optical, transport, and ultrafast phenomena.</description>

      <title>Scaling Law of Quantum Confinement in Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum confinement significantly influences the excited states of sub-10 nm single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), crucial for advancements in transistor technology and the development of novel opto-electronic materials such as fluorescent ultrashort nanotubes (FUNs). However, the length dependence of this effect in ultrashort SWCNTs is not yet fully understood in the context of the SWCNT exciton states. Here, we conduct excited state calculations using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) on geometry-optimized models of ultrashort SWCNTs and FUNs, which consist of ultrashort SWCNTs with $sp^3$ defects. Our results reveal a length-dependent scaling law of the $E_{11}$ exciton energy that can be understood through a geometric, dimensional argument, and which departs from the length scaling of a 1D particle-in-a-box. We find that this scaling law applies to ultrashort (6,5) and (6,6) SWCNTs, as well as models of (6,5) FUNs. In contrast, the defect-induced $E_{sp^3}$ transition, which is redshifted from the $E_{11}$ optical gap transition, shows little dependence on the nanotube length, even in the shortest possible SWCNTs. We attribute this relative lack of length dependence to orbital localization around the quantum defect that is installed near the SWCNT edge. Our results illustrate the complex interplay of defects and quantum confinement effects in ultrashort SWCNTs and provide a foundation for further explorations of these nanoscale phenomena.</description>

      <title>Magnetization-Induced Phase Transitions on the surface of 3D Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the low-energy model, the topological field theory indicates that the surface magnetization can open a surface gap in 3D topological insulators (TIs), resulting in a half-quantized Hall conductance. Here by employing the realistic lattice model, we show the occurrence of { the surface phase transitions}, accompanied with the sharp changes of the surface Chern number from $\frac{1}{2}$ to $-\frac{3}{2}$ finally to $-\frac{1}{2}$, in 3D TIs induced by surface magnetization. These surface phase transitions lead to the sudden jumps in the magneto-electric coefficient and the quantum Hall conductance, which are experimentally observable. Furthermore, we present the phase diagram that elucidates the behavior of the 3D TI surface Chern numbers under surface magnetization for different $Z_{4}$ topological numbers. Our study highlights the presence of the new phases with broken bulk-boundary correspondence and enriches understandings of the properties of TIs.</description>

      <title>Quarter-quantized thermal Hall effect with parity anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in the proximity of s-wave superconductors, the magnetic topological surface states can transform into Majorana surface state, featuring a single gapless Majorana cone with parity anomaly when the superconducting pairing gap matches the surface magnetization gap. The emergence of $N=1/2$ Majorana chiral edge current is observed at the boundaries between the gap region and the gapless region. Additionally, in systems with a single gapless Majorana cone, a quarter-quantized thermal Hall conductance appears under the dephasing. By mapping the system to a conductor-network model, we identify the appearance of 1/4 chiral heat channels as the cause of the quarter-quantized Hall thermal conductance. We observe the stability of this quarter-quantized thermal conductance under temperature variations, serving as a distinctive feature indicating the presence of a single gapless Majorana cone in the system. Our models can be experimentally realized using magnetic topological insulators or iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Charge and spin transport through normal lead coupled to $s$-wave superconductor and a Majorana zero mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-bias charge conductance peak (ZBCCP) is a significant symbol of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). The proximity effect of s-wave superconductor is usually demanded in the fabrication of MZMs. So in transport experiments, the system is inevitably coupled to the s-wave superconductor. Here we study how the ZBCCP is affected by coupling of the s-wave superconductor. The results show that the ZBCCP could be changed into a zero-bias valley due to the coupling of s-wave superconductor, although the conductance at the zero bias still keeps a quantized value $2e^2/h$. So it does not mean no MZM exists when no ZBCCP is experimentally observed. In addition, the spin transport is investigated. Four reflection processes (the normal reflection, spin-flip reflection, normal Andreev reflection, and equal-spin Andreev reflection) usually occur. The reflection coefficients are strongly dependent on the spin direction of the incident electron, and they may be symmetrical or Fano resonance shapes. But the spin conductance always shows a zero-bias peak with the height $e/2\pi$ regardless of the direction of the spin bias and the coupling strength of the s-wave superconductor. So measuring spin transport properties could be a more reliable method to judge the existence of MZMs.</description>

      <title>Phase diagrams and edge-state transitions in graphene with spin-orbit coupling and magnetic and pseudomagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Hall (QH) effect, the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect and the quantum valley Hall (QVH) effect are three peculiar topological insulating phases in graphene. They are characterized by three different types of edge states. These three effects are caused by the external magnetic field, the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the strain-induced pseudomagnetic field, respectively. Here we theoretically study phase diagrams when these effects coexist and analyze how the edge states evolve between the three. We find the real magnetic field and the pseudomagnetic field will compete above the SOC energy gap while the QSH effect is almost unaffected within the SOC energy gap. The edge states transition from the QH effect or the QVH effect to the QSH effect directly relies on the arrangement of the zeroth Landau levels. Using edge states transitions, we raise a device similar to a spin field effect transistor (spin-FET) and also design a spintronics multiple-way switch.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transition driven by magnetic field in one-dimensional topological superconductor rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the energy spectrum and transport property of a one-dimensional Kitaev quantum ring in a threading magnetic field. It is demonstrated that the magnetic field can effectively induce topological phase transitions for the ring in the topologically nontrivial phase at the zero magnetic field. However, for the ring in the topologically trivial phase at the zero field, there is no topological phase transition, and the energy spectrum of the system is always gapped. The magnetic field can control the appearance and disappearance of Majorana zero-energy states in the Kitaev quantum ring, when one half of the ring is in the topologically nontrivial phase and the other half is in the topologically trivial phase. Furthermore, we calculate the transport properties of the ring connected by two semi-infinite leads. It is found that the resonant peaks of transmission coefficient TQT correspond to the critical points of topological phase transition. In addition, we extend our findings to a more realistic quantum ring adopting a semiconductor nanowire with high spin-orbit coupling, superconducting s-wave pairing, and Zeeman splitting, and prove that our findings are universal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the energy spectrum and energy levels of the extended Kane-Mele model with magnetic atoms on their zigzag edges. It is demonstrated that the edges of ferromagnetism or antiferromagnetism are enough to break the time-reversal symmetry and host one-dimensional gapped edge states. Thus, a second-order topological phase transition could happen, which leads to the emergence of topological in-gap zero-dimensional corner states. We also prove that the in-gap corner states are robust against corner defects and magnetic disorder. Our proposal based on the edge antiferromagnetism shows that the high-order topological states can be realized, although the net magnetization of the material is zero. In addition, we discuss the influence of spin magnetization orientation on the degeneracy and energy of in-gap corner states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the energy band structure and energy levels of a heterojunction composed of two antiferromagnetic graphene nanoflakes with opposite in-plane antiferromagnetic orderings, in which the modified Kane-Mele model is employed. Before forming an antiferromagnetic graphene heterojunction, the energy gap of helical edge states in each isolated graphene nanoflake are opened by the antiferromagnetic ordering and there is no the in-gap corner state. We find that when two opposite antiferromagnetic graphenes are coupled to form a heterojunction nanoflake, topologically protected zero-dimensional in-gap states can be induced. In addition, we demonstrate that the in-gap states locate at the end of the interface and are robust against magnetic disorder, Anderson disorder, and interfacial magnetic defects. The position and number of the in-gap interface end states in the heterojunction sample can be precise quantum controlled.</description>

      <title>N\'eel Spin-Orbit Torque in Antiferromagnetic Quantum Spin and Anomalous Hall Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interplay between magnetic ordering and topological electrons not only enables new topological phases but also underpins electrical control of magnetism. Here we extend the Kane-Mele model to include the exchange coupling to a collinear background antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, which can describe transition metal trichalcogenides. Owing to the spin-orbit coupling and staggered on-site potential, the system could exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall and quantum spin Hall effects in the absence of a net magnetization. Besides the chiral edge states, these topological phases support a staggered Edelstein effect through which an applied electric field can generate opposite non-equilibrium spins on the two AFM sublattices, realizing the N\'eel-type spin-orbit torque (NSOT). Contrary to known NSOTs in AFM metals driven by conduction currents, our NSOT arises from pure adiabatic currents devoid of Joule heating, while being a bulk effect not carried by the edge currents. By virtue of the NSOT, the electric field of a microwave can drive the AFM dynamics with a remarkably high efficiency. Compared to the ordinary AFM resonance driven by the magnetic field, the new mechanism can enhance the resonance amplitude by more than one order of magnitude and the absorption rate of the microwave power by over two orders of magnitude. Our findings unravel an incredible way to exploit AFM topological phases to achieve ultrafast magnetic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Four-terminal graphene-superconductor thermal switch controlled by the superconducting phase difference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a superconducting phase-controlled thermal switch based on a four-terminal graphene-superconductor system. By the coupling of two superconducting leads on a zigzag graphene nanoribbon, both the normal-transmission coefficient and the crossed-Andreev-reflection coefficient, which dominate the thermal conductivity of electrons in the graphene nanoribbon, can be well controlled simultaneously by the phase difference of the superconducting leads. As a result, the thermal conductivity of electrons in the graphene nanoribbon can be tuned and a thermal switching effect appears. Using the nonequilibrium Green's function method, we verify this thermal switching effect numerically. At ambient temperatures less than about one tenth of the superconducting transition temperature, the thermal switching ratio can exceed 2000. The performance of the thermal switch can be regulated by the ambient temperature, and doping or gating can slightly increase the thermal switching ratio. The use of narrower graphene nanoribbons and wider superconducting leads facilitates the obtaining of larger thermal switching ratios. This switching effect of electronic thermal conductance in graphene is expected to be experimentally realized and applied.</description>

      <title>Dissipation and dephasing in quantum Hall interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, counter-intuitive results have shown that the quantum Hall edge states with topological protection can be dissipative. In this paper, we point out that the non-equilibrium nature of edge states in quantum Hall interferometers leads to inevitable dissipation. We consider a graphene interferometer operating in the integer quantum Hall regime and simulate the inelastic scattering that causes both dissipation and dephasing in the interferometer using non-equilibrium Green's function and virtual leads. We describe the dissipation process with the numerical results of the spatial distribution of heat generation and the evolution of electron energy distribution. In addition, with the enhancement of dephasing, a competition between Aharonov-Bohm interference and topologically protected quantized Hall plateaus is observed in the oscillations and fluctuations of the Hall resistances. At a suitable dephasing strength, quantum Hall plateaus can be promoted by dephasing. Our results not only give clues for the design of dissipation-free devices but also provide a platform for studying the non-equilibrium relaxation and the dissipation mechanism of topological states.</description>

      <title>Optical pumping controls anisotropic response in semi-Dirac system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-energy Fermions in semi-Dirac systems depict linear momentum dispersion along one direction while having the features of parabolic dispersion in the other direction. Equilibrium optical responses of such highly anisotropic dispersion are manifested in direction-dependent optical conductivity tensor. Going beyond the equilibrium framework, here we probe the effects of optical pumping-led non-equilibrium carrier distribution on this system's transmission and polarization rotation. Within the equation of motion approach for a two-band density matrix, we obtain a quasi-steady state solution for a continuous wave (CW) illumination, in which the population of the two bands is characterized by non-thermal occupancy factors with a strong dependence on the amplitude, polarization, and the frequency of the pump field. We demonstrate that tuning the pump field parameters significantly modifies the optical conductivity tensor for the probe field, which can have important practical consequences such as selective transmission and tunable hyperbolicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photon-assisted tunneling of Majorana bound states in a Majorana nanowire driven by the periodic field is studied both theoretically and numerically. We find that Majorana bound states exhibit an anomalous photon-assisted tunneling signal which is different from an ordinary fermionic state : the height of photonic sidebands is related to the degree of Majorana nonlocality. Moreover, we show that the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) charge and spin components of subgap states can be well revealed by the local conductance. Our work illuminates the effect of driving field on Majorana bound states and provides a systematic scheme to directly measure BCS information of overlapping Majorana bound states</description>

      <title>Wavefront dislocations in graphene systems revealed by transport measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wavefront dislocation is an important and ubiquitous phenomenon in wave fields. It is closely related to the phase singularity in a wave function. Some recent studies have verified that the wavefront dislocations in the local density of states (LDOS) map can well manifest the intrinsic topological characteristics in graphene and some topological systems. Different from these previous schemes, we raise a transport method to measure such wavefront dislocations in monolayer and Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene. Combining analytical analysis and numerical calculation, we find phase singularities naturally appear in the transmission coefficients between different sublattices, due to the intervalley interference on the electron propagating paths. These phase singularities could contribute wavefront dislocations in the conductance map. Additionally, in bilayer graphene, the wavefront dislocations are found to remain robust even though the tip is coupled to multiple sublattices. Biased bilayer graphene is also explored. Our scheme provides a new transport routine to explore valley-related topological properties of materials.</description>

      <title>Unifying recent experiments on spin-valley locking in TMDC quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-valley or Kramers qubit promises significantly enhanced spin-valley lifetimes due to strong coupling of the electrons' spin to their momentum (valley) degrees of freedom. In transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such spin-valley locking is expected to be particularly strong owing to the significant intrinsic spin-orbit coupling strength. Very recently, a small number of experiments on TMDC quantum dots have put forth evidence for spin-valley locking for the first time at the few-electron limit. Employing quantum transport theory, here we numerically simulate their ground- and excited-state transport spectroscopy signatures in a unified theoretical framework. In doing so, we reveal the operating conditions under which spin-valley locking occurs in TMDC quantum dots, thereby weaving the connection between intrinsic material properties and the experimental data under diverse conditions. Our simulations thus provide a predictive modeling tool for TMDC quantum dots at the few-electron limit allowing us to deduce from experiments the degree of spin-valley locking based on the SOC strength, inter-valley mixing, and the spin and valley $g$-factors. Our theoretical analysis provides an important milestone towards the next challenge of experimentally confirming valley-relaxation times using single-shot projective measurements</description>

      <title>Purely electrical detection of the N\'{e}el vector of $p$-wave magnets based on linear and nonlinear conductivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $p$-wave magnet has a momentum-dependent band structure and zero-net magnetization just as in the case of an altermagnet. It will be useful for high-density and ultra-fast memory. However, it is a nontrivial problem to detect the N\'{e}el vector of a $p$-wave magnet because time-reversal symmetry is preserved, while this is not a problem in an altermagnet because the anomalous Hall conductivity may be present due to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. Here, we show that it is possible to detect the in-plane component of the N\'{e}el vector of the $p$-wave magnet by measuring the transverse and longitudinal Drude conductivity. Remarkably, this is possible without magnetization. Furthermore, it is possible to detect the $z$-component by measuring nonlinear conductivity including the nonlinear Drude conductivity and quantum-metric induced nonlinear conductivity by introducing tiny magnetization along the $z$ axis. We obtain analytic formulae for them in the first-order perturbation theory, which agree quite well with numerical results without perturbation. Our results will pave a way to spintronic memory based on $p$-wave magnets.</description>

      <title>Phonon Amplification via Magnetoelastic Klein Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials exhibit various wave-like excitations, among which phonons (lattice vibrations) and magnons (oscillations in ferromagnetic ordering) hold significant promise for future nanoscale technologies. Exploring the interaction between these excitations may pave the way for innovative devices that leverage their complementary strengths. This article presents a set-up designed to amplify an incoming phononic current, potentially enhancing the phonon lifetime. The set-up consists of a nonmagnetic and ferromagnetic insulator. The ferromagnet is polarized opposite to the external magnetic field with spin-orbit torque, which allows for negative-energy magnons. Phonons that are incoming from the nonmagnetic side will interact with the negative-energy magnons via magnetoelastic coupling. The reflected phonon will increase in amplitude as a result of energy conservation. This interaction between negative-energy magnons and phonons is an example of Klein scattering. This work opens new avenues for the development of advanced devices that capitalize on the combined properties of phonons and magnons.</description>

      <title>Self-similar plasmonic nanolenses: mesoscopic ensemble averaging and chiral light-matter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the near-field enhancement of self-similar nanolenses, made of three plasmonic nanospheres with decreasing sizes and separations, is affected by quantum corrections in the optical response of the metal, and by fabrication imperfections related to the positioning of the spheres in the nanolens. In particular, we integrate mesoscopic phenomena, such as electron spill-in and -out and surface-enabled Landau damping, via the surface response formalism, focusing particularly on the role of spill-out in alkali metals. In addition, we take realistic imperfections in the nanofabrication process into account, through numerical averaging of both far- and near-field spectra for large collections of nanolenses. Statistical analysis of hundreds of trimers shows that inevitable deviations from the perfectly aligned chain only slightly, if at all, impair the field enhancement, as long as the average misplacement is kept within 1 nm from the ideal situation. Wishing to explore whether such imperfections can be harvested for practical applications, we probe the potential for triggering chiral response. Our results verify that imperfect nanolenses can display considerable circular dichroism, while providing a means to manipulate the optical chirality density. Nonetheless, we emphasize that quantification of chiral light-matter interactions can be largely affected by mesoscopic phenomena, which cannot be ignored when near-field quantities like optical chirality density are investigated.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Order and Long-Range Interactions in Mesoscopic Ising Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the design of magnetic ordering in one-dimensional mesoscopic magnetic Ising chains by modulating long-range interactions. These interactions are affected by geometrical modifications to the chain, which adjust the energy hierarchy and the resulting magnetic ground states. Consequently, the magnetic ordering can be tuned between antiferromagnetic and dimer antiferromagnetic phases. These phases are experimentally observed in chains fabricated using both conventional electron-beam lithography and ion implantation techniques, demonstrating the feasibility of controlling magnetic properties at the mesoscale. The ability of attaining these magnetic structures by thermal annealing, underlines the potential of using such systems instead of simulated annealers in tackling combinatorial optimization tasks.</description>

      <title>Dispersions and magnetism of strain-induced pseudo Landau levels in Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastic strain can displace the massless Dirac fermions in monolayer graphene in a space-dependent fashion, similar to the effect of an external magnetic field, thus giving rise to Landau quantization. We here show that the strain-induced Landau quantization can also take place in Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene, where the low-energy excitations are massive rather than Dirac-like. The zigzag ribbon of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene realizes a two-legged Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with a domain wall, which coincides with the guiding center of the strain-induced pseudo Landau levels. We reduce the lattice model of the ribbon in the vicinity of the guiding center into an exactly solvable coupled Dirac model and analytically derive the dispersions of the strain-induced pseudo Landau levels. Remarkably, the zeroth and first pseudo Landau levels are dispersionless and sublattice-polarized. We elucidate that the interaction on these two pseudo Landau levels results in a global antiferromagnetic order. Our study extends the strain-induced Landau quantization to the massive excitations and indicates strain as a tuning knob of magnetism.</description>

      <title>Multi-probe analysis to separate edge currents from bulk currents in quantum spin Hall insulators and to analyze their temperature dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-probe transport analysis that effectively separates bulk and edge currents in large Hall bar devices with standard geometries. Applied to transport measurements on all possible four-probe configurations of six-probe Hall bar devices made of inverted three-layer InAs/GaInSb quantum wells (QWs), our analysis not only reveals the presence of dissipative edge currents in the topological gap, but also allows the temperature dependence of bulk and edge conductivity to be evaluated separately. The temperature dependence of the edge conductivity for Hall bar channels from 10 $\mu$m to 70~$\mu$m in the range of 1.5 K to 45 K is consistent with the theoretical expectation of weakly interacting helical edge electrons with backscattering due to localized magnetic moments of charge impurities. We argue that these charge impurities are naturally associated with intrinsic Ga-antisite defects, which act as double acceptors in InAs/Ga(In)Sb-based QWs.</description>

Abstract: To gain deeper insight into the complex, stable, and robust configurations of magnetic textures, topological characterisation has proven essential. In particular, while the skyrmion number is a well-established topological invariant for 2D magnetic textures, the Hopf index serves as a key topological descriptor for 3D magnetic structures. In this work, we present and compare various methods for numerically calculating the Hopf index, provide implementations, and offer a detailed analysis of their accuracy and computational efficiency. Additionally, we identify and address common pitfalls and challenges associated with the numerical computation of the Hopf index, offering insights for improving the robustness of these techniques.</description>

      <title>On resolving meso-scale calculations of pore-collapse-generated hotspots in energetic crystals for consistency with atomistic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meso-scale calculations of pore collapse and hotspot formation in energetic crystals provide closure models to macro-scale hydrocodes for predicting the shock sensitivity of energetic materials. To this end, previous works obtained atomistics-consistent material models for two common energetic crystals, HMX and RDX, such that pore collapse calculations adhered closely to molecular dynamics (MD) results on key features of energy localization, particularly the profiles of the collapsing pores, appearance of shear bands, and the transition from viscoplastic to hydrodynamic collapse. However, some important aspects such as the temperature distributions in the hotspot were not as well captured. One potential issue was noted but not resolved adequately in those works, namely the grid resolution that should be employed in the meso-scale calculations for various pore sizes and shock strengths. Conventional computational mechanics guidelines for selecting meshes as fine as possible, balancing computational effort, accuracy and grid independence, were shown not to produce physically consistent features associated with shear localization. Here, we examine the physics of pore collapse, shear band evolution and structure, and hotspot formation, for both HMX and RDX; we then evaluate under what conditions atomistics-consistent models yield physically correct (considering MD as ground truth) hotspots for a range of pore diameters, from nm to microns, and for a wide range of shock strengths. The study provides insights into the effects of pore size and shock strength on pore collapse and hotspots, identifying aspects such as size-independent behaviors, and proportion of energy contained in shear as opposed to jet impact-heated regions of the hotspot. Areas for further improvement of atomistics-consistent material models are also indicated.</description>

      <title>RingSim- An Agent-based Approach for Modelling Mesoscopic Magnetic Nanowire Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe 'RingSim', a phenomenological agent-based model that allows numerical simulation of magnetic nanowire networks with areas of hundreds of micrometers squared for durations of hundreds of seconds; a practical impossibility for general-purpose micromagnetic simulation tools. In RingSim, domain walls (DWs) are instanced as mobile agents which respond to external magnetic fields, and their stochastic interactions with pinning sites and other DWs are described via simple phenomenological rules. We first present a detailed description of the model and its algorithmic implementation for simulating the behaviours of arrays of interconnected ring-shaped nanowires, which have previously been proposed as hardware platforms for unconventional computing applications. The model is then validated against a series of experimental measurements of an array's static and dynamic responses to rotating magnetic fields. The robust agreement between the modelled and experimental data demonstrates that agent-based modelling is a powerful tool for exploring mesoscale magnetic devices, enabling time scales and device sizes that are inaccessible to more conventional magnetic simulation techniques.</description>

Abstract: Topologically protected states can be found in physical systems, that show singularities in some energy contour diagram. These singularities can be characterized by winding numbers, defined on a classification surface, which maps physical state parameters. We have found a classification surface, which applies for three-band hamiltonian systems in the same way than standard Bloch surface does for two-band ones. This generalized Bloch surface is universal in the sense that it classifies a very large class of three-band systems, which we have exhaustively studied, finding specific classification surfaces, applying for each one.</description>

      <title>Imaging the Sub-Moir\'e Potential Landscape using an Atomic Single Electron Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrons in solids owe their properties to the periodic potential landscapes they experience. The advent of moir\'e lattices has revolutionized our ability to engineer such landscapes on nanometer scales, leading to numerous groundbreaking discoveries. Despite this progress, direct imaging of these electrostatic potential landscapes remains elusive. In this work, we introduce the Atomic Single Electron Transistor (SET), a novel scanning probe utilizing a single atomic defect in a van der Waals (vdW) material, which serves as an ultrasensitive, high-resolution potential imaging sensor. Built upon the quantum twisting microscope (QTM) platform, this probe leverages the QTM's distinctive capability to form a pristine, scannable 2D interface between vdW heterostructures. Using the Atomic SET, we present the first direct images of the electrostatic potential in one of the most canonical moir\'e interfaces: graphene aligned to hexagonal boron nitride. Our results reveal that this potential exhibits an approximate C6 symmetry, has minimal dependence on the carrier density, and has a substantial magnitude of ~60 mV even in the absence of carriers. Theoretically, the observed symmetry can only be explained by a delicate interplay of physical mechanisms with competing symmetries. Intriguingly, the magnitude of the measured potential significantly exceeds theoretical predictions, suggesting that current understanding may be incomplete. With a spatial resolution of 1 nm and a sensitivity to detect the potential of even a few millionths of an electron charge, the Atomic SET opens the door for ultrasensitive imaging of charge order and thermodynamic properties for a range of quantum phenomena, including various symmetry-broken phases, quantum crystals, vortex charges, and fractionalized quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Aharonov-Bohm interferometer in inverted-band pn junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverted-band $pn$ junctions in two-dimensional materials offer a promising platform for electron optics in condensed matter, as they allow to manipulate and guide electron beams without the need for spatial confinement. In this work, we propose the realization of an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interferometer using such $pn$ junctions. We observe AB oscillations in numerically obtained conductance and analytically identify the conditions for their appearance by analyzing the scattering processes at the $pn$ interface. To support experimental implementation, we also consider junctions with a graded interface, where the potential varies smoothly between the $p$- and $n$-doped regions. Our results reveal an abrupt change in the AB-oscillation frequency, which we attribute to a distinct transition in the hybridization across the interface. We verify that our reported AB oscillations are robust to realistic disorder and temperature decoherence channels. Our study paves the way for realizing the Aharonov-Bohm effect in bulk mesoscopic systems without the need for external spatial confinement, offering new possibilities in electron optics.</description>

      <title>Magnetic exchange fields and domain wall superconductivity at an all-oxide superconductor / ferromagnet insulator interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:1804.02094v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At a superconductor-ferromagnet (S/F) interface, the F layer can introduce a magnetic exchange field within the S layer, which acts to locally spin split the superconducting density of states. The effect of magnetic exchange fields on superconductivity has been thoroughly explored at S-ferromagnet insulator (S/FI) interfaces for isotropic s-wave S and a thickness that is smaller than the superconducting coherence length. Here we report a magnetic exchange field effect at an all-oxide S/FI interface involving the anisotropic d-wave high temperature superconductor praseodymium cerium copper oxide (PCCO) and the FI praseodymium calcium manganese oxide (PCMO). The magnetic exchange field in PCCO, detected via magnetotransport measurements through the superconducting transition, is localized to the PCCO/PCMO interface with an average magnitude that depends on the presence or absence of magnetic domain walls in PCMO. The results are promising for the development of all-oxide superconducting spintronic devices involving unconventional pairing and high temperature superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity and Bloch band Berry curvature responses represent two distinct paradigms of quantum coherent phenomena. The former relies on the collective motion of a many-body state while the latter proceeds from the momentum-space winding of Bloch wavefunctions. Here we reveal a superconducting Berry curvature dipole (BCD) that arises as a collective many-body phenomena in noncentrosymmetric superconductors. Strikingly, we find the superconducting BCD is sensitive to the phase of the superconducting gap and depends on the noncentrosymmetric structure of its pairing. This unusual property enables a BCD proximity effect in hybrid quantum materials that induces nonreciprocity even in a target centrosymmetric metal. We find superconducting BCD naturally produces nonreciprocal electromagnetic responses that includes a giant second-order nonlinearity. This renders noncentrosymmetric superconductors an exciting platform for realizing pronounced nonlinearities and its BCD responses a novel diagnostic of the superconducting gap.</description>

      <title>Low-energy edge signatures of the Kitaev spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental work indicates that the Kitaev spin liquid may be realizable close to zero magnetic field in exfoliated $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ flakes, thus providing a more versatile setting for studying non-Abelian anyons. Here, we propose a robust nanoscale signature of the Kitaev spin liquid that results from its edge states and manifests in the low-energy spin dynamics. In particular, we highlight a singular peak in the dynamical spin structure factor of a zigzag edge whose energy scales linearly with only one component of the magnetic field. This sharp feature in the local spin dynamics directly reflects the bond-directional Kitaev spin interactions and, more generally, the projective symmetries of the Kitaev spin liquid. We demonstrate that our proposed signature survives in the presence of edge disorder as well as non-Kitaev interactions, and provide detailed guidelines for experimentally observing it using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy and color-center relaxometry.</description>

      <title>Entanglement generation using single-photon pulse reflection in realistic networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A general entanglement generation protocol between remote stationary qubits using single-photon reflection in a photonic network is explored theoretically. The nodes of the network consist of single qubits that are typically represented by the spin of a color center, each localized in a separate optical cavity and linked to other nodes via photonic links such as optical fibers. We derive a model applicable to a wide range of parameters and scenarios to describe the nodes and the local spin-photon interaction accounting for the pulsed (finite bandwidth) nature of flying single photons while optimizing the rate and fidelity. We investigate entanglement generation between remote qubits and tailor protocols to a variety of physical implementations with different properties. Of particular interest is the regime of weak coupling and low cooperativity between spin and cavity which is relevant in the cases of the nitrogen and silicon vacancy centers in diamond. We also take into account the variability of the properties between realistic (stationary) nodes.</description>

      <title>Spin phase regulated spin Josephson supercurrent in topological superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Without applied bias voltage, a superconducting phase difference can drive a charge Josephson supercurrent in a superconductor junction. In analogy, we here theoretically propose a spin phase that intrinsically generates spin Josephson supercurrent, and this spin Josephson effect is studied in a junction of superconducting nanowire (SNW). We show that spin-orbit coupling and magnetic field give rise to spin-triplet superconductivity in the SNW, thus allow the superfluid of both charge and spin. Next we introduce the concept of spin phase that can be generated by controls of spin current, magnetic field or electric field. By the analysis of pairing correlations and Ginzburg-Landau-type theory, it is shown that the spin phase makes spin-up and spin-down $S=1$ Cooper pairs get opposite phases and move oppositely in a Josephson junction, so that a dissipationless pure spin current is induced. We also derive the formula that the spin current is equal to the derivative of Andreev bound state to the spin phase, which is analogous to that of charge Josephson effect. At last, our calculation verifies the existence of spin supercurrent inside the superconducting gap in the topologically nontrivial phase. Our study provides a view on spin Josephson effect and indicates the potential combination of topological superconductivity and spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single crystalline materials, different from polycrystalline and twinning structures, are desired for investigating the intrinsic physical properties, as grain and twin boundaries often work as a source of artifacts. Bismuth chalcogenides, which are van der Waals materials notable as topological insulators, have attracted significant interest due to their rich physical properties. However, the formation of 60{\deg} twin domains is common in these materials. Here, we demonstrate single-domain bismuth chalcogenides. Using atomic force microscopy, we investigated the morphology of Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 grown on Al2O3. Despite lattice constants of Bi2Se3 and Al2O3 substrates being well matched with hybrid symmetry epitaxy, Bi2Se3 exhibited 60{\deg} twin boundaries across the surface. Interestingly, Bi2Te3 showed a single-domain feature across the 10 mm by 10 mm sample even with lattice mismatch. While further in-depth studies are required to understand this difference in the morphology between Bi2Se3/Al2O3 and Bi2Te3/Al2O3, we suggest that the formation of twin boundaries in bismuth chalcogenides is related to the interaction between quintuple layers across the van der Waals gap rather than strain or defects.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Non-Hermitian Skin Effects in Coupled Hermitian Chains with Cross-Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate the presence of an anomalous non-Hermitian skin effects which decay from both ends of a system consisting of two coupled Hermitian chains induced by non-reciprocal inter-chain cross-coupling. Another intriguing feature of the system is that its eigenenergy spectrum in thermodynamic limit deviates from the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ), contrary to that of conventional non-Hermitian systems. The thermodynamic-limit energy spectrum is however restored to the GBZ by the presence of even an infinitesimal amount of gain and/or loss term to the system. In this case, the system exhibits a critical phenomena similar to that of coupled non-Hermitian chains, whereby the eigenspectrum starts to approach the GBZ beyond some critical size. Furthermore, the non Hermitian skin effect becomes less pronounced as the system size exceeds this critical size. We analytically explain these peculiar features which highlight the important role of gain and loss terms as well as inter-chain coupling in tuning non-Hermitian skin modes, thus suggesting a new avenue for the modulation of the skin mode characteristics of open systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite being a pillar of quantum mechanics, little attention has been paid to the onset of Fermi's golden rule as a discrete microscopic bath of modes approaches the macroscopic thermodynamic limit and forms a continuum. Motivated by recent experiments in circuit quantum electrodynamics, we tackle this question through the lens of single-photon decay in a finite transmission line coupled to a qubit ("quantum impurity"). We consider a single-photon state, coupled via the nonlinear impurity to several baths formed by multi-photon states with different number of photons, which are inherently discrete due to the finite size of the line. We focus on the late-time dynamics of the single-photon, and uncover the conditions under which the photon's decoherence rate approaches the decay rate predicted by Fermi's golden rule. We show that it is necessary to keep a small but finite escape rate (unrelated to the impurity) for each single-photon mode to obtain a finite long-time decay rate. We analyze the contribution of the baths formed by many-body states with different number of photons, and illustrate how the decay rate induced by some bath of $n$ photon states is enhanced by the presence of other baths of $m \neq n$ photon states, highlighting the contribution of cascade photon decay processes. Our formalism could be used to analyze recent experiments in superconducting circuits.</description>

Abstract: Multi-partite entanglement is fundamental to emerging quantum technologies such as quantum networks, which ultimately require devices with strong light-matter interactions and long coherence times. Here, we introduce nanobeam photonic crystal cavities combining both extreme quality factors ($\sim10^{7}$) with sub-wavelength field confinement to reach unprecedented light-matter interactions. Operating at $780$ nm, our devices are tailored for efficient coupling and entanglement with ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms, a key ingredient in quantum networks due to their hyperfine structure. Our new designs also facilitate the precise optical trapping of atoms, and we demonstrate coherent entanglement generation between them, that is remarkably resilient to atomic displacements. These platforms can be easily scaled-up to extremely large quantum networks, for distributed quantum computing and future light-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random assemblies of magnetic nanowires represent a unique class of materials with promising applications in spintronics and information storage. These assemblies exhibit complex behavior %interactions due to the combination of magnetic dipolar interactions between the nanowires and electronic transport properties governed by tunneling barriers at magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). The intricate interplay of these phenomena makes the study of magnetic nanowire networks a rich area of research. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze the resistive behavior of random magnetic nanowire networks. By employing a combination of graph theoretical approaches and mean-field theory, we derive an effective resistance model that encapsulates the contributions of magnetic interactions between the nanowires. Our findings show the importance of considering both the magnetic and electrical properties of nanowire networks in the design and optimization of amorphous resistive devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting information from quantum many-body systems remains a key challenge in quantum technologies due to experimental limitations. In this work, we employ a single spin qubit to probe a strongly interacting system, creating an environment conducive to qubit decoherence. By focusing on the XXZ spin chain, we observe diverse dynamics in the qubit evolution, reflecting different parameters of the chain. This demonstrates that a spin qubit can probe both quantitative properties of the spin chain and qualitative characteristics, such as the bipartite entanglement entropy, phase transitions, and perturbation propagation velocity within the system. This approach reveals the power of small quantum systems to probe the properties of large, strongly correlated quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid metals (LM) are emerging plasmonic nanomaterials with transformable surface plasmon resonances (SPR) due to their liquid-like deformability. This study delves into the plasmonic properties of LM nanoparticles, with a focus on EGaIn (eutectic gallium-indium)-based materials. Leveraging Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations, we explored the localized SPR (LSPR) effects of EGaIn nanoparticles with various shapes, including nanospheres, dimers, nanorods, nanodisks, nanoellipses, nanocubes, and nanocuboids, in the broad range of ultraviolet (UV)-visible-near infrared (NIR) spectrum. EGaIn, known for its unique properties such as low toxicity, negligible vapor pressure, and excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, is appealing in broad wavelength plasmonic applications.

      <title>Probing chiral symmetry with a topological domain wall sensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral symmetry is a fundamental property with profound implications for the properties of elementary particles, that implies a spectral symmetry (i.e. E =&gt; -E ) in their dispersion relation. In condensed matter physics, chiral symmetry is frequently associated with superconductors or materials hosting Dirac fermions such as graphene or topological insulators. There, chiral symmetry is an emergent low-energy property, accompanied by an emergent spectral symmetry. While the chiral symmetry can be broken by crystal distortion or external perturbations, the spectral symmetry frequently survives. As the presence of spectral symmetry does not necessarily imply chiral symmetry, the question arises how these two properties can be experimentally differentiated. Here, we demonstrate how a system with preserved spectral symmetry can reveal underlying broken chiral symmetry using topological defects. Our study shows that these defects induce a spectral imbalance in the Landau level spectrum, providing direct evidence of symmetry alteration at topological domain walls. Using high-resolution STM/STS we demonstrate the intricate interplay between chiral and translational symmetry which is broken at step edges in topological crystalline insulator Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se. The chiral symmetry breaking leads to a shift in the guiding center coordinates of the Landau orbitals near the step edge, thus resulting in a distinct chiral flow of the spectral density of Landau levels. This study underscores the pivotal role of topological defects as sensitive probes for detecting hidden symmetries, offering profound insights into emergent phenomena with implications for fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Raman Polarization Switching in CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconducting CrSBr is a layered A-type antiferromagnet, with individual layers antiferromagnetically coupled along the stacking direction. Due to its unique orthorhombic crystal structure, CrSBr exhibits highly anisotropic mechanical and optoelectronic properties acting itself as a quasi-1D material. CrSBr demonstrates complex coupling phenomena involving phonons, excitons, magnons, and polaritons. Here we show through polarization-resolved resonant Raman scattering the intricate interaction between the vibrational and electronic properties of CrSBr. For samples spanning from few-layer to bulk thickness, we observe that the polarization of the A$_g^2$ Raman mode can be rotated by 90 degrees, shifting from alignment with the crystallographic a (intermediate magnetic) axis to the b (easy magnetic) axis, depending on the excitation energy. In contrast, the A$_g^1$ and A$_g^3$ modes consistently remain polarized along the b axis, regardless of the laser energy used. We access real and imaginary parts of the Raman tensor in our analysis, uncovering resonant electron-phonon coupling.</description>

      <title>Insulating moir\'e homobilayers lack a threefold symmetric second harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atoms within moir\'e bilayers relax in-plane to minimize elastic energy [e.g., Cazeaux et al., J. Elast. 154, 443 (2023)]; such relaxation brings their space group symmetries down to P1. Here, the ab initio second harmonic generation (SHG) of twisted and atomistically optimized hBN bilayers was determined at four twist angles ($\theta=38.21^{\circ}$, $60.00^{\circ}$, $73.17^{\circ}$, and $98.21^{\circ}$) and for three displacements $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ measured away from the ground state $AA^{\prime}$ configuration. All moir\'e bilayers have a P1 space symmetry after structural optimization. This situation is quite different to monolayers with hexagonal lattices, which retain a three-fold symmetry. We point out that the actual symmetries of the SHG reported for hBN bilayers on two experimental works do not coincide with the sixfold symmetric theoretical profiles they provide [either $\sin^2(3\phi)$ or $\cos^2(3\phi)$], and show that the intrinsic low structural symmetry of (atomically optimized) hBN bilayer moir\'es can in fact be read out from experimental SHG intensity profiles--which are tunable by $\theta$ and by the frequency of light $\omega$: The SHG is most definitely not sixfold-symmetric because moir\'es do not retain a three-fold symmetry. Furthermore, an extrinsic twofold symmetry of the SHG emission is realized by tilting the pump by an angle $\alpha$ away from the 2D material's normal, regardless of $\theta$ and $\omega$. The design of in-plane and ultrathin sources of SHG with low symmetry could be useful for the eventual creation of entanglement sources from 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast spintronics with geometric effects in non-adiabatic wave-packet dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.04805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the intriguing possibilities of steering ultrafast non-adiabatic processes through the geometric properties of bands in quantum materials by laser pulses, we extend a wave-packet transport theory, previously well-established in the adiabatic regime that intuitively captured geometric properties of bands, to the transient and non-adiabatic regime. This extension facilitates us to investigate macroscopic ways of manifesting microscopic band-geometric effects that highlight the special capability of non-adiabatic drivings not available to adiabatic drivings. These include imprinting band-geometric properties to the current rate after switching off the laser pulses and the induction of intrinsic macroscopic spin polarisation with an orientation not accessible by adiabatic processes. In particular, the microscopic geometrically-rooted intrinsic spin coherence is shown to underlie the spin-mediated parts of the macroscopic photocurrents. Through explicit calculations of an example with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, the spin-mediated part is shown to be discernible from the non-spin-mediated part in terms of the anisotropy of the photocurrents. Working principles behind the above theoretical results allegedly applicable beyond the Rashba example are distilled to inspect experimental data collected for SnSe, exhibiting considerable anisotropic effects. Consistency between theory and experiment is observed, paving the way of further exploration into the above intended direction.</description>

Abstract: Spin carriers subject to Dresselhaus [110] (D110) spin-orbit coupling (SOC) gather null spin phases in closed circuits, contrary to usual Rashba and Dresselhaus [001] SOC. We show that D110 spin phases can be activated in square circuits by introducing an in-plane Zeeman field, where localized field inhomogeneities act as effective spin-scattering centers. Our simulations show rich interference patterns in the quantum conductance, which work as maps for a geometric classification of the propagating spin states. We also find that disorder facilitates low-field implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze quantum-geometric bounds on optical weights in topological phases with pairs of bands hosting non-trivial Euler class, a multi-gap invariant characterizing non-Abelian band topology. We show how the bounds constrain the combined optical weights of the Euler bands at different dopings and further restrict the size of the adjacent band gaps. In this process, we also consider the associated interband contributions to DC conductivities in the flat-band limit. We physically validate these results by recasting the bound in terms of transition rates associated with the optical absorption of light, and demonstrate how the Euler connections and curvatures can be determined through the use of momentum and frequency-resolved optical measurements, allowing for a direct measurement of this multi-band invariant. Additionally, we prove that the bound holds beyond the degenerate limit of Euler bands, resulting in nodal topology captured by the patch Euler class. In this context, we deduce optical manifestations of Euler topology within $\vec{k} \cdot \vec{p}$ models, which include quantized optical conductivity, and third-order jerk photoconductivities. We showcase our findings with numerical validation in lattice-regularized models that benchmark effective theories for real materials and are realizable in metamaterials and optical lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that certain three-dimensional multigap topological insulators can host quantized integrated shift photoconductivities due to bulk invariants that are defined under reality conditions imposed by additional symmetries. We recast the quantization in terms of the integrated torsion tensor and the non-Abelian Berry connection constituting Chern-Simons forms. Physically, we recognize that the topological quantization emerges purely from virtual transitions contributing to the optical response. Our findings provide another quantized electromagnetic dc response due to the nontrivial band topology, beyond the quantum anomalous Hall effect of Chern insulators and quantized circular photogalvanic effect found in Weyl semimetals.</description>

Abstract: We report an efficient numerical approach to compute the different components of the orbital Hall responses in disordered topological materials from the Berry phase theory of magnetization. The theoretical framework is based on the Chebyshev expansion of Green's functions and the off-diagonal elements of the position operator for systems under arbitrary boundary conditions. The capability of this scheme is shown by computing the orbital Hall conductivity for gapped graphene and the Haldane model in the presence of nonperturbative disorder effects. This methodology enables realistic simulations of orbital Hall responses in highly complex models of disordered materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometric properties of parameter space are mostly described by Berry curvature and quantum metric, which are the imaginary and real part of quantum geometric tensor, respectively. In this work, we calculate the dressed Berry curvature and quantum metric containing eight Feynman diagrams, which are proportional to the leading-order of the concentration of impurities. For a two-band gapped graphene model, we find the disorder does not break the original symmetry but decrease (increase) the absolute value of Berry curvature and quantum metric in conduction (valence) band. We show how impurities affect the Berry curvature and quantum metric, deepening our understanding of the impurity effect on the electron transport properties in two-band gapped graphene.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, nonlinear Hall effect has attracted great attention with three different terms contributed by Drude effect, Berry curvature dipole and Berry connection polarizability. In this work, we theoretically predict an intrinsic second order spin current induced by spin-dependent Berry curvature polarizability based on time-independent perturbation theory. We show other two second order spin conductivities contributed by the group velocity and spin-dependent Berry curvature dipole.A two-dimensional Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupled system is studied as an example, and it is found that the intrinsic second order contribution plays a major role in the region of $\mu&gt;0$, while current mainly comes from the extrinsic terms when $\mu&lt;0$. Thus, the dependence of spin conductivity on chemical potential is expected to distinguish the extrinsic and intrinsic contributions experimentally.</description>

Abstract: The quantum conductance of flat (Euclidean) circuits subject to Rashba spin-orbit coupling shows a symmetric response to the inversion of the spin-orbit field in Aharonov-Casher interference patterns. Here, we show that this symmetry breaks down in curved (non-Euclidean) circuits defined on a spherical two-dimensional electron gas. We demonstrate that this is a consequence of parallel spin transport and holonomy on the surface of the sphere, and that a symmetric response can be recovered when considering the parallel transport condition as an offset. We discuss triangular circuits defined along geodesic arcs on the sphere as a case study, and generalize it to regular polygons and parallel curves of given latitude.</description>

Abstract: Exchange bias is applied ubiquitously throughout the spintronics industry for pinning magnetic moment in an orientation robust against external magnetic field disturbances. Enabling efficient manipulation of the exchange-biased pinning direction is key to add or advance device functionality. Conventional methods for achieving this reorientation commonly require long heating times and assisting magnetic fields, thus limiting speed and versatility. Here, we demonstrate a field-free $180^\circ$ reorientation of perpendicular exchange bias in a thin film system integrating Co/Gd layers with IrMn. Single femtosecond laser pulses trigger a reversal of the pinning direction, while preserving the unidirectionality required for referencing. We formulate a theoretical microscopic framework involving a wide range of timescales that accurately reproduces the experimental outcomes. The understanding of the underlying mechanisms delivers guiding principles for designing reprogrammable spintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Recent work has revealed a general procedure for incorporating disorder into the semiclassical model of carrier transport, whereby the predictions of quantum linear response theory can be recovered within a quantum kinetic approach based on a disorder-averaged density-matrix formalism. Here, we present a comprehensive generalization of this framework to the nonlinear response regime. In the presence of an electrostatic potential and random impurities, we solve the quantum Liouville equation to second order in an applied electric field and derive the carrier densities and equations of motion. In addition to the anomalous velocity arising from the Berry curvature and the Levi-Civita connection of the quantum metric tensor, a host of extrinsic velocities emerge in the equations of motion, reflecting the various possibilities for random interband walks of the carriers in this transport regime. Furthermore, several scattering and conduction channels arise, which can be classified in terms of distinct physical processes, revealing numerous unexplored mechanisms for generating nonlinear responses in disordered condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Nonconserved Density Accumulations in Orbital Hall Transport: Insights from Linear Response Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a linear response theory for stationary density accumulations in anomalous transport phenomena, such as the orbital Hall effect, where the transported density is odd under time reversal and the underlying charge is not conserved. Our framework applies to both metals and insulators, topologically trivial or nontrivial, and distinguishes between contributions from bulk and edge states, as well as undergap and dissipative currents. In time-reversal invariant systems, we prove a microscopic reciprocity theorem showing that only dissipative currents at the Fermi level contribute to density accumulation, while undergap currents do not. In contrast, in non-time-reversal invariant systems, non-dissipative density accumulations, such as magnetoelectric polarization, can appear in both the bulk and edges. Importantly, we find that the net density accumulation does not always vanish, pointing to a global non-conservation that implies the existence of a non-vanishing integrated ``net torque'' in addition to a ``distributed torque'', which has zero spatial average. We show that the distributed torque can be absorbed in the divergence of a redefined current that satisfies Onsager reciprocity, while the net torque must be explicitly accounted for. Finally, we apply our theory to two-dimensional models with edge terminations.</description>

Abstract: Harnessing high-dimensional entangled states of light presents a frontier for advancing quantum information technologies, from fundamental tests of quantum mechanics to enhanced computation and communication protocols. In this context, the spatial degree of freedom stands out as particularly suited for on-chip integration. But while traditional demonstrations produce and manipulate path-entangled states sequentially with discrete optical elements, continuously-coupled nonlinear waveguide systems offer a promising alternative where photons can be generated and interfere along the entire propagation length, unveiling novel capabilities within a reduced footprint. Here we exploit this concept to implement a compact and reconfigurable source of spatially entangled photon pairs based on parametric down-conversion in AlGaAs nonlinear waveguides arrays. We use a double-pump configuration to engineer the output quantum state and implement various types of spatial correlations, exploiting a quantum interference effect between the biphoton state generated in each pumped waveguide. This demonstration, at room temperature and telecom wavelength, illustrates the potential of continuously-coupled systems as a promising alternative to discrete multi-component quantum circuits for leveraging the high-dimensional spatial degree of freedom of photons.</description>

      <title>Observation of converse flexoelectric effect in topological semimetals</title>

Abstract: A strong coupling between electric polarization and elastic deformation in solids is an important factor in creating useful electromechanical nanodevices. Such coupling is typically allowed in insulating materials with inversion symmetry breaking as exemplified by the piezoelectric effect in ferroelectric materials. Therefore, materials with metallicity and centrosymmetry have tended to be out of scope in this perspective. Here, we report the observation of giant elastic deformation by the application of an alternating electric current in topological semimetals (V,Mo)Te2, regardless of the centrosymmetry. Considering the crystal and band structures and the asymmetric measurement configurations in addition to the absence of the electromechanical effect in a trivial semimetal TiTe2, the observed effect is discussed in terms of a Berry-phase-derived converse flexoelectric effect in metals. The observation of the flexoelectric effect in topological semimetals paves a way for a new type of nanoscale electromechanical sensors and energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Design nearly optimal quantum algorithm for linear differential equations via Lindbladians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19628</link>

Abstract: Solving linear ordinary differential equations (ODE) is one of the most promising applications for quantum computers to demonstrate exponential advantages. The challenge of designing a quantum ODE algorithm is how to embed non-unitary dynamics into intrinsically unitary quantum circuits. In this work, we propose a new quantum algorithm for ODEs by harnessing open quantum systems. Specifically, we utilize the natural non-unitary dynamics of Lindbladians with the aid of a new technique called the non-diagonal density matrix encoding to encode general linear ODEs into non-diagonal blocks of density matrices. This framework enables us to design a quantum algorithm that has both theoretical simplicity and good performance. Combined with the state-of-the-art quantum Lindbladian simulation algorithms, our algorithm, under a plausible input model, can outperform all existing quantum ODE algorithms and achieve near-optimal dependence on all parameters. We also give applications of our algorithm including the Gibbs state preparations and the partition function estimations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical activity universally bounds precision of response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20800</link>

Abstract: The exploration of far-from-equilibrium systems has been at the forefront of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, with a particular focus on understanding the fluctuations and response of thermodynamic systems to external perturbations. In this study, we introduce a universal response kinetic uncertainty relation, which provides a fundamental trade-off between the precision of response for generic observables and dynamical activity in Markovian nonequilibrium systems. We demonstrate the practical applicability and tightness of the derived bound through illustrative examples. Our results are applicable to a broad spectrum of Markov jump processes, ranging from currents to non-current variables, from steady states to time-dependent driving, from continuous time to discrete time, and including Maxwell's demon or absolute irreversibility. Our findings not only enhance the theoretical foundation of stochastic thermodynamics but also may hold potential implications for far-from-equilibrium biochemical processes.</description>
