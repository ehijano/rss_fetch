      <title>Chance Constrained PDE-Constrained Optimal Design Strategies Under High-Dimensional Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an advanced computational framework for the optimal design of thermal insulation components in buildings, utilizing silica aerogel porous materials. The framework aims to achieve superior thermal insulation while maintaining structural integrity of the component under stress concentrations. A multiphase continuum model is employed to simulate the thermomechanical behavior of the insulation system, governed by a set of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs). The design process explicitly accounts for spatially correlated uncertainties in the design parameters, particularly the spatially varying aerogel porosity, resulting in a high-dimensional, PDE-constrained optimization under uncertainty. The optimization problem is formulated using a risk-averse cost functional to balance insulation performance with uncertainty mitigation, incorporating statistical moments of the design objective. Additionally, chance constraints are imposed to limit the probability of stress exceeding critical thresholds. To address the challenges arising from high-dimensional parameters, the optimization leverages a second-order Taylor expansion of both the design objective and the chance constraint functions, combined with a low-rank approximation of the Hessian matrix for efficient evaluation of the generalized eigenvalue problem. This approach supports scalable computations, either directly or as a variance-reduction control variate for Monte Carlo estimations. Combined with a gradient-based optimization approach, we achieve a scalable solution algorithm with dimension-independent computational costs in terms of number of PDE solved. Two- and three-dimensional numerical experiments on the design of thermal breaks in buildings showcase the features of the proposed design under uncertainty framework with respect to accuracy, scalability, and computational cost.</description>

      <title>Neural networks meet hyperelasticity: A monotonic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply physics-augmented neural network (PANN) constitutive models to experimental uniaxial tensile data of rubber-like materials whose behavior depends on manufacturing parameters. For this, we conduct experimental investigations on a 3D printed digital material at different mix ratios and consider several datasets from literature, including Ecoflex at different Shore hardness and a photocured 3D printing material at different grayscale values. We introduce a parametrized hyperelastic PANN model which can represent material behavior at different manufacturing parameters. The proposed model fulfills common mechanical conditions of hyperelasticity. In addition, the hyperelastic potential of the proposed model is monotonic in isotropic isochoric strain invariants of the right Cauchy-Green tensor. In incompressible hyperelasticity, this is a relaxed version of the ellipticity (or rank-one convexity) condition. Using this relaxed ellipticity condition, the PANN model has enough flexibility to be applicable to a wide range of materials while having enough structure for a stable extrapolation outside the calibration data. The monotonic PANN yields excellent results for all materials studied and can represent a wide range of largely varying qualitative and quantitative stress behavior. Although calibrated on uniaxial tensile data only, it leads to a stable numerical behavior of 3D finite element simulations. The findings of our work suggest that monotonicity could play a key role in the formulation of very general yet robust and stable constitutive models applicable to materials with highly nonlinear and parametrized behavior.</description>

      <title>CHAT: Beyond Contrastive Graph Transformer for Link Prediction in Heterogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link prediction in heterogeneous networks is crucial for understanding the intricacies of network structures and forecasting their future developments. Traditional methodologies often face significant obstacles, including over-smoothing-wherein the excessive aggregation of node features leads to the loss of critical structural details-and a dependency on human-defined meta-paths, which necessitate extensive domain knowledge and can be inherently restrictive. These limitations hinder the effective prediction and analysis of complex heterogeneous networks. In response to these challenges, we propose the Contrastive Heterogeneous grAph Transformer (CHAT). CHAT introduces a novel sampling-based graph transformer technique that selectively retains nodes of interest, thereby obviating the need for predefined meta-paths. The method employs an innovative connection-aware transformer to encode node sequences and their interconnections with high fidelity, guided by a dual-faceted loss function specifically designed for heterogeneous network link prediction. Additionally, CHAT incorporates an ensemble link predictor that synthesizes multiple samplings to achieve enhanced prediction accuracy. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of CHAT using three distinct drug-target interaction (DTI) datasets. The empirical results underscore CHAT's superior performance, outperforming both general-task approaches and models specialized in DTI prediction. These findings substantiate the efficacy of CHAT in addressing the complex problem of link prediction in heterogeneous networks.</description>

      <title>A Coupled PFEM-DEM Model for Fluid-Granular Flows with Free-Surface Dynamics Applied to Landslides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free surface and granular fluid mechanics problems combine the challenges of fluid dynamics with aspects of granular behaviour. This type of problem is particularly relevant in contexts such as the flow of sediments in rivers, the movement of granular soils in reservoirs, or the interactions between a fluid and granular materials in industrial processes such as silos. The numerical simulation of these phenomena is challenging because the solution depends not only on the multiple phases that strongly interact with each other, but also on the need to describe the geometric evolution of the different interfaces. This paper presents an approach to the simulation of fluid-granular phenomena involving strongly deforming free surfaces. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is combined with the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) and the fluid-grain interface is treated by a two-way coupling between the two phases. The fluid-air interface is solved by a free surface model. The geometric and topological variations are therefore naturally provided by the full Lagrangian description of all phases. The approach is validated on benchmark test cases such as two-phase dam failures and then applied to a real landslide problem.</description>

      <title>SGLDBench: A Benchmark Suite for Stress-Guided Lightweight 3D Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Stress-Guided Lightweight Design Benchmark (SGLDBench), a comprehensive benchmark suite to apply and evaluate material layout strategies for generating stiff lightweight designs in 3D domains. SGLDBench provides a seamlessly integrated simulation and analysis framework, providing six reference strategies accompanied by a scalable multigrid elasticity solver to efficiently execute these strategies and validate the stiffness of their results. This facilitates systematic analysis and comparison of design strategies regarding the mechanical properties they achieve. SGLDBench enables the evaluation of diverse settings of load conditions and, through the tight integration of the solver, enables support for high-resolution designs and stiffness analysis. Moreover, SGLDBench emphasizes visual analysis to explore relations between the geometric structure of a design and the distribution of stresses, providing insights into the specific properties and behaviors of different design strategies. SGLDBenchs' specific features are highlighted in several experiments, by comparing the results of reference strategies with respect to geometric and mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Statistical Reconstruction For Anisotropic X-ray Dark-Field Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic X-ray Dark-Field Tomography (AXDT) is a novel imaging technology that enables the extraction of fiber structures on the micrometer scale, far smaller than standard X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) setups. Directional and structural information is relevant in medical diagnostics and material testing. Compared to existing solutions, AXDT could prove a viable alternative. Reconstruction methods in AXDT have so far been driven by practicality. Improved methods could make AXDT more accessible. We contribute numerically stable implementations and validation of advanced statistical reconstruction methods that incorporate the statistical noise behavior of the imaging system. We further provide a new statistical reconstruction formulation that retains the advanced noise assumptions of the imaging setup while being efficient and easy to optimize. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of the optimization behavior for all models regarding AXDT. Our experiments show that statistical reconstruction outperforms the previously used model, and particularly the noise performance is superior. While the previously proposed statistical method is effective, it is computationally expensive, and our newly proposed formulation proves highly efficient with identical performance. Our theoretical analysis opens the possibility to new and more advanced reconstruction algorithms, which in turn enable future research in AXDT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals play a pivotal role in biomedical research and clinical applications, including epilepsy diagnosis, sleep disorder analysis, and brain-computer interfaces. However, the effective analysis and interpretation of these complex signals often present significant challenges. This paper presents a novel approach that integrates computer graphics techniques with biological signal pattern recognition, specifically using Markov Transfer Fields (MTFs) for EEG time series imaging. The proposed framework (STEAM-EEG) employs the capabilities of MTFs to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of EEG signals, transforming them into visually informative images. These images are then rendered, visualised, and modelled using state-of-the-art computer graphics techniques, thereby facilitating enhanced data exploration, pattern recognition, and decision-making. The code could be accessed from GitHub.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Neural ODEs for Gene Regulatory Network Discovery under Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern high-throughput biological datasets with thousands of perturbations provide the opportunity for large-scale discovery of causal graphs that represent the regulatory interactions between genes. Numerous methods have been proposed to infer a directed acyclic graph (DAG) corresponding to the underlying gene regulatory network (GRN) that captures causal gene relationships. However, existing models have restrictive assumptions (e.g. linearity, acyclicity), limited scalability, and/or fail to address the dynamic nature of biological processes such as cellular differentiation. We propose PerturbODE, a novel framework that incorporates biologically informative neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) to model cell state trajectories under perturbations and derive the causal GRN from the neural ODE's parameters. We demonstrate PerturbODE's efficacy in trajectory prediction and GRN inference across simulated and real over-expression datasets.</description>

      <title>COph100: A comprehensive fundus image registration dataset from infants constituting the "RIDIRP" database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retinal image registration is vital for diagnostic therapeutic applications within the field of ophthalmology. Existing public datasets, focusing on adult retinal pathologies with high-quality images, have limited number of image pairs and neglect clinical challenges. To address this gap, we introduce COph100, a novel and challenging dataset known as the Comprehensive Ophthalmology Retinal Image Registration dataset for infants with a wide range of image quality issues constituting the public "RIDIRP" database. COph100 consists of 100 eyes, each with 2 to 9 examination sessions, amounting to a total of 491 image pairs carefully selected from the publicly available dataset. We manually labeled the corresponding ground truth image points and provided automatic vessel segmentation masks for each image. We have assessed COph100 in terms of image quality and registration outcomes using state-of-the-art algorithms. This resource enables a robust comparison of retinal registration methodologies and aids in the analysis of disease progression in infants, thereby deepening our understanding of pediatric ophthalmic conditions.</description>

      <title>Application of $J$-Integral to a Random Elastic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the use of the $J$-integral to compute the statistics of the energy release rate of a random elastic medium. The spatial variability of the elastic modulus is modeled as a homogeneous lognormal random field. Within the framework of Monte Carlo simulation, a modified contour integral is applied to evaluate the first and second statistical moments of the energy release rate. These results are compared with the energy release rate calculated from the potential energy function. The comparison shows that, if the random field of elastic modulus is homogeneous in space, the path independence of the classical $J$-integral remains valid for calculating the mean energy release rate. However, this path independence does not extend to the higher order statistical moments. The simulation further reveals the effect of the correlation length of the spatially varying elastic modulus on the energy release rate of the specimen.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The need for higher power density in electrical machines require better cooling strategies. Spray cooling is a very promising and relatively simple technology to apply, but involves extremely complicated physics. In this paper, a quasi-3D thermal finite-element model of a stator winding is created, by extrusion of a 2D cross-sectional finite-element model along the winding direction. The possible effects of spray cooling are simulated as a heat flux using an impedance boundary condition at the surface of the winding overhang. The results confirm the beneficial performance of spray cooling. The model indicates that spray cooling may allow a ten times larger power density than for standard air- or water-cooled machines.</description>

      <title>Navigating Chemical-Linguistic Sharing Space with Heterogeneous Molecular Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical language models (CLMs) are prominent for their effectiveness in exploring chemical space and enabling molecular engineering. However, while exploring chemical-linguistic space, CLMs suffer from the gap between natural language and molecular representations. This challenge is primarily due to the inherent modeling differences between molecules and texts: molecules operate unified modeling to learn chemical space, while natural language sequentially models the semantic space. Additionally, the limited availability of high-quality text-to-molecule datasets further exacerbates this challenge. To address the problem, we first verified the information bias in molecular representations from different perspectives. We then developed the Heterogeneous Molecular Encoding (HME) framework, a unified molecular encoder compressing the molecular features from fragment sequence, topology, and conformation with Q-learning. To better model chemical-linguistic space, we further constructed the MCMoD dataset, which contains over one million molecules with various conditions, including properties, fragments, and descriptions. Experimentally, HME promotes CLMs to achieve chemical-linguistic sharing space exploration: (1) chemical space exploration with linguistic guidance, where HME achieves significant improvements (+8.9\% FCD) for molecular design in multiple constraints, even in zero-shot scenarios; (2) linguistic space exploration with molecular guidance, where HME generates textual descriptions with high qualities (+11.6\% BLEU) for molecules. These results highlight the precision of HME in handling multi-objective and cross-domain tasks, as well as its remarkable generalization capability on unseen task combinations. HME offers a new perspective on navigating chemical-linguistic sharing space, advancing the potential of CLMs in both fundamental research and practical applications in chemistry.</description>

      <title>Efficient numerical methods for the Maxey-Riley-Gatignol equations with Basset history term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13515v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Maxey-Riley-Gatignol equations (MRGE) describe the motion of a finite-sized, spherical particle in a fluid. Because of wake effects, the force acting on a particle depends on its past trajectory. This is modelled by an integral term in the MRGE, also called Basset force, that makes its numerical solution challenging and memory intensive. A recent approach proposed by Prasath et al. exploits connections between the integral term and fractional derivatives to reformulate the MRGE as a time-dependent partial differential equation on a semi-infinite pseudo-space. They also propose a numerical algorithm based on polynomial expansions. This paper develops a numerical approach based on finite difference instead, by adopting techniques by Koleva et al. and Fazio et al. to cope with the issues of having an unbounded spatial domain. We compare convergence order and computational efficiency for particles of varying size and density of the polynomial expansion by Prasath et al., our finite difference schemes and a direct integrator for the MRGE based on multi-step methods proposed by Daitche. While all methods achieve their theoretical convergence order for neutrally buoyant particles with zero initial relative velocity, they suffer from various degrees of order reduction if the initial relative velocity is non-zero or the particle has a different density than the fluid.</description>

Abstract: Optimization modeling plays a critical role in the application of Operations Research (OR) tools to address real-world problems, yet they pose challenges and require extensive expertise from OR experts. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), new opportunities have emerged to streamline and automate such task. However, current research predominantly relies on closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4, along with extensive prompt engineering techniques. This reliance stems from the scarcity of high-quality training datasets for optimization modeling, resulting in elevated costs, prolonged processing times, and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, our work is the first to propose a viable path for training open-source LLMs that are capable of optimization modeling and developing solver codes, eventually leading to a superior ability for automating optimization modeling and solving. Particularly, we introduce OR-Instruct, a semi-automated data synthesis framework for optimization modeling that enables customizable enhancements for specific scenarios or model types. We also introduce IndustryOR, the first industrial benchmark for evaluating LLMs in solving practical OR problems. We train several 7B-scale open-source LLMs using synthesized data (dubbed ORLMs{https://github.com/Cardinal-Operations/ORLM}), which exhibit significantly enhanced optimization modeling capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance across the NL4OPT, MAMO, and IndustryOR benchmarks. Additionally, our experiments highlight the potential of scaling law and reinforcement learning to further enhance the performance of ORLMs. The workflows and human-machine interaction paradigms of ORLMs in practical industrial applications are also discussed in the paper.</description>

Abstract: Environmental pollution and fossil fuel depletion have prompted the need for renewable energy-based power generation. However, its stability is often challenged by low energy density and non-stationary conditions. Wave energy converters (WECs), in particular, need reliable real-time wave height prediction to address these issues caused by irregular wave patterns, which can lead to the inefficient and unstable operation of WECs. In this study, we propose an AI-powered reliable real-time wave height prediction model that integrates long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for temporal prediction with deep ensemble (DE) for robust uncertainty quantification (UQ), ensuring high accuracy and reliability. To further enhance the reliability, uncertainty calibration is applied, which has proven to significantly improve the quality of the quantified uncertainty. Using real operational data from an oscillating water column-wave energy converter (OWC-WEC) system in Jeju, South Korea, the model achieves notable accuracy (R2 &gt; 0.9), while increasing uncertainty quality by over 50% through simple calibration technique. Furthermore, a comprehensive parametric study is conducted to explore the effects of key model hyperparameters, offering valuable guidelines for diverse operational scenarios, characterized by differences in wavelength, amplitude, and period. These results demonstrate the model's capability to deliver reliable predictions, facilitating digital twin of the ocean.</description>
