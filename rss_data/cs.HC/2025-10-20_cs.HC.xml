      <title>LLM-based In-situ Thought Exchanges for Critical Paper Reading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical reading is a primary way through which researchers develop their critical thinking skills. While exchanging thoughts and opinions with peers can strengthen critical reading, junior researchers often lack access to peers who can offer diverse perspectives. To address this gap, we designed an in-situ thought exchange interface informed by peer feedback from a formative study (N=8) to support junior researchers' critical paper reading. We evaluated the effects of thought exchanges under three conditions (no-agent, single-agent, and multi-agent) with 46 junior researchers over two weeks. Our results showed that incorporating agent-mediated thought exchanges during paper reading significantly improved participants' critical thinking scores compared to the no-agent condition. In the single-agent condition, participants more frequently made reflective annotations on the paper content. In the multi-agent condition, participants engaged more actively with agents' responses. Our qualitative analysis further revealed that participants compared and analyzed multiple perspectives in the multi-agent condition. This work contributes to understanding in-situ AI-based support for critical paper reading through thought exchanges and offers design implications for future research.</description>

      <title>A Feasibility Study on Usability and Trust among Population Groups of a Medical Avatar Supported by Large Language Models with Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Healthcare professionals have limited time to support patients and their relatives, but their information needs are high. Therefore, the Radboud University together with the Canisius Wilhelmina Hospital hospital developed a speaking virtual hu-man avatar which, contrary to many avatars, uses a Large Language Model (LLM) enhanced with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The RAG tech-nique enables medical information supplied by the hospital to be utilized during interactions, rather than generic LLM information. Two videos were produced, one presenting a patient-avatar interaction regarding a total hip surgery, and an-other one presenting an interaction between a relative of a patient and the avatar concerning postoperative delirium. A survey was conducted among adults over 40 from the Netherlands, the UK and the USA to study the effects of gender, country and education level on usability and trust, which are important factors for avatar acceptance. Participants watched videos, imagining themselves as the pa-tient (video 1) or relative (video 2), and rated the constructs on a 7-point Likert scale (0-6). 165 persons (MeanAge=51.6, SDAge=8.9, Male=80, Female=85) completed the survey. In the patient role, participants scored the usability as M=4.61 (SD=0.97) and trust as M=3.92 (SD=1.10), all above the mean scale value. In the role as relative to the patient, participants scored usability as M=4.64 (SD=1.08) and trust as M=4.31 (SD=1.06). No effects were found of gender, country and education level.</description>

      <title>The Spark Effect: On Engineering Creative Diversity in Multi-Agent AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creative services teams increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) to accelerate ideation, yet production systems often converge on homogeneous outputs that fail to meet brand or artistic expectations. Art of X developed persona-conditioned LLM agents -- internally branded as "Sparks" and instantiated through a library of role-inspired system prompts -- to intentionally diversify agent behaviour within a multi-agent workflow. This white paper documents the problem framing, experimental design, and quantitative evidence behind the Spark agent programme. Using an LLM-as-a-judge protocol calibrated against human gold standards, we observe a mean diversity gain of +4.1 points (on a 1-10 scale) when persona-conditioned Spark agents replace a uniform system prompt, narrowing the gap to human experts to 1.0 point. We also surface evaluator bias and procedural considerations for future deployments.</description>

      <title>Sound Clouds: Exploring ambient intelligence in public spaces to elicit deep human experience of awe, wonder, and beauty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the ambient intelligence (AmI) systems we encounter in our daily lives, including security monitoring and energy-saving systems, typically serve pragmatic purposes, we wonder how we can design and implement ambient artificial intelligence experiences in public spaces that elicit deep human feelings of awe, wonder, and beauty. As a manifestation, we introduce Sound Clouds, an immersive art installation that generates live music based on participants' interaction with several human-height spheres. Our installation serves as a provocation into future ambient intelligence that provokes, not limits, the future possibilities of AmI.</description>

      <title>Extending Load Forecasting from Zonal Aggregates to Individual Nodes for Transmission System Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reliability of local power grid infrastructure is challenged by sustainable energy developments increasing electric load uncertainty. Transmission System Operators (TSOs) need load forecasts of higher spatial resolution, extending current forecasting operations from zonal aggregates to individual nodes. However, nodal loads are less accurate to forecast and require a large number of individual forecasts, which are hard to manage for the human experts assessing risks in the control room's daily operations (operator). In collaboration with a TSO, we design a multi-level system that meets the needs of operators for hourly day-ahead load forecasting. Utilizing a uniquely extensive dataset of zonal and nodal net loads, we experimentally evaluate our system components. First, we develop an interpretable and scalable forecasting model that allows for TSOs to gradually extend zonal operations to include nodal forecasts. Second, we evaluate solutions to address the heterogeneity and volatility of nodal load, subject to a trade-off. Third, our system is manageable with a fully parallelized single-model forecasting workflow. Our results show accuracy and interpretability improvements for zonal forecasts, and substantial improvements for nodal forecasts. In practice, our multi-level forecasting system allows operators to adjust forecasts with unprecedented confidence and accuracy, and to diagnose otherwise opaque errors precisely.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Quantitative Study on Explainability and Trust in AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale AI models such as GPT-4 have accelerated the deployment of artificial intelligence across critical domains including law, healthcare, and finance, raising urgent questions about trust and transparency. This study investigates the relationship between explainability and user trust in AI systems through a quantitative experimental design. Using an interactive, web-based loan approval simulation, we compare how different types of explanations, ranging from basic feature importance to interactive counterfactuals influence perceived trust. Results suggest that interactivity enhances both user engagement and confidence, and that the clarity and relevance of explanations are key determinants of trust. These findings contribute empirical evidence to the growing field of human-centered explainable AI, highlighting measurable effects of explainability design on user perception</description>

      <title>Towards Proactive Defense Against Cyber Cognitive Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber cognitive attacks leverage disruptive innovations (DIs) to exploit psychological biases and manipulate decision-making processes. Emerging technologies, such as AI-driven disinformation and synthetic media, have accelerated the scale and sophistication of these threats. Prior studies primarily categorize current cognitive attack tactics, lacking predictive mechanisms to anticipate future DIs and their malicious use in cognitive attacks. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing a novel predictive methodology for forecasting the emergence of DIs and their malicious uses in cognitive attacks. We identify trends in adversarial tactics and propose proactive defense strategies.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Engagement Effectiveness of Cyber Cognitive Attacks: A Behavioral Metric for Disinformation Campaigns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As disinformation-driven cognitive attacks become increasingly sophisticated, the ability to quantify their impact is essential for advancing cybersecurity defense strategies. This paper presents a novel framework for measuring the engagement effectiveness of cognitive attacks by introducing a weighted interaction metric that accounts for both the type and volume of user engagement relative to the number of attacker-generated transmissions. Applying this model to real-world disinformation campaigns across social media platforms, we demonstrate how the metric captures not just reach but the behavioral depth of user engagement. Our findings provide new insights into the behavioral dynamics of cognitive warfare and offer actionable tools for researchers and practitioners seeking to assess and counter the spread of malicious influence online.</description>

      <title>Free Lunch for User Experience: Crowdsourcing Agents for Scalable User Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: User studies are central to user experience research, yet recruiting participant is expensive, slow, and limited in diversity. Recent work has explored using Large Language Models as simulated users, but doubts about fidelity have hindered practical adoption. We deepen this line of research by asking whether scale itself can enable useful simulation, even if not perfectly accurate. We introduce Crowdsourcing Simulated User Agents, a method that recruits generative agents from billion-scale profile assets to act as study participants. Unlike handcrafted simulations, agents are treated as recruitable, screenable, and engageable across UX research stages. To ground this method, we demonstrate a game prototyping study with hundreds of simulated players, comparing their insights against a 10-participant local user study and a 20-participant crowdsourcing study with humans. We find a clear scaling effect: as the number of simulated user agents increases, coverage of human findings rises smoothly and plateaus around 90\%. 12.8 simulated agents are as useful as one locally recruited human, and 3.2 agents are as useful as one crowdsourced human. Results show that while individual agents are imperfect, aggregated simulations produce representative and actionable insights comparable to real users. Professional designers further rated these insights as balancing fidelity, cost, time efficiency, and usefulness. Finally, we release an agent crowdsourcing toolkit with a modular open-source pipeline and a curated pool of profiles synced from ongoing simulation research, to lower the barrier for researchers to adopt simulated participants. Together, this work contributes a validated method and reusable toolkit that expand the options for conducting scalable and practical UX studies.</description>

      <title>Situated Epistemic Infrastructures: A Diagnostic Framework for Post-Coherence Knowledge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have rendered visible the fragility of contemporary knowledge infrastructures by simulating coherence while bypassing traditional modes of citation, authority, and validation. This paper introduces the Situated Epistemic Infrastructures (SEI) framework as a diagnostic tool for analyzing how knowledge becomes authoritative across hybrid human-machine systems under post-coherence conditions. Rather than relying on stable scholarly domains or bounded communities of practice, SEI traces how credibility is mediated across institutional, computational, and temporal arrangements. Integrating insights from infrastructure studies, platform theory, and epistemology, the framework foregrounds coordination over classification, emphasizing the need for anticipatory and adaptive models of epistemic stewardship. The paper contributes to debates on AI governance, knowledge production, and the ethical design of information systems by offering a robust alternative to representationalist models of scholarly communication.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Effectiveness of Driver Training Interventions in Improving Safe Engagement with Vehicle Automation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates how targeted training interventions can improve safe driver interaction with vehicle automation (VA) systems, focusing on Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Lane Keeping Assist (LKA), both safety-critical advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Effective training reduces misuse and enhances road safety by promoting correct knowledge and application.
  A review of multiple automakers' owners' manuals revealed inconsistencies in describing ACC and LKA functions. Three training formats were compared: (1) owners' manual (OM), (2) knowledge-based (KB) with summarized operational guidelines and visual aids, and (3) skill-based hands-on practice in a driving simulator (SIM). Thirty-six participants with no prior VA experience were randomly assigned to one group. Safety-relevant outcomes - system comprehension (quiz scores) and real-world engagement (frequency and duration of activations) - were analyzed using mixed-effects and negative binomial models.
  KB training produced the greatest improvements in comprehension of system limitations, as well as safer engagement patterns. Compared with OM participants, KB participants achieved significantly higher quiz scores and engaged LKA and ACC more often (1.4 and 1.45 times, respectively); they also demonstrated greater awareness of scenarios requiring manual control, indicating reduced risk of inappropriate reliance. Older drivers exhibited longer activations overall, highlighting age-related differences in reliance and potential safety implications.
  Short, targeted training can significantly improve safe and effective VA system use, particularly for senior drivers. These results highlight training as a proactive safety intervention to reduce human-automation mismatch and enhance system reliability in real-world driving.</description>

      <title>When AI Gets Persuaded, Humans Follow: Inducing the Conformity Effect in Persuasive Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in AI have highlighted its application in captology, the field of using computers as persuasive technologies. We hypothesized that the "conformity effect," where individuals align with others' actions, also occurs with AI agents. This study verifies this hypothesis by introducing a "Persuadee Agent" that is persuaded alongside a human participant in a three-party persuasive dialogue with a Persuader Agent. We conducted a text-based dialogue experiment with human participants. We compared four conditions manipulating the Persuadee Agent's behavior (persuasion acceptance vs. non-acceptance) and the presence of an icebreaker session. Results showed that when the Persuadee Agent accepted persuasion, both perceived persuasiveness and actual attitude change significantly improved. Attitude change was greatest when an icebreaker was also used, whereas an unpersuaded AI agent suppressed attitude change. Additionally, it was confirmed that the persuasion acceptance of participants increased at the moment the Persuadee Agent was persuaded. These results suggest that appropriately designing a Persuadee Agent can improve persuasion through the conformity effect.</description>

      <title>PRAXA: A Framework for What-If Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various analytical techniques-such as scenario modeling, sensitivity analysis, perturbation-based analysis, counterfactual analysis, and parameter space analysis-are used across domains to explore hypothetical scenarios, examine input-output relationships, and identify pathways to desired results. Although termed differently, these methods share common concepts and methods, suggesting unification under what-if analysis. Yet a unified framework to define motivations, core components, and its distinct types is lacking. To address this gap, we reviewed 141 publications from leading visual analytics and HCI venues (2014-2024). Our analysis (1) outlines the motivations for what-if analysis, (2) introduces Praxa, a structured framework that identifies its fundamental components and characterizes its distinct types, and (3) highlights challenges associated with the application and implementation. Together, our findings establish a standardized vocabulary and structural understanding, enabling more consistent use across domains and communicate with greater conceptual clarity. Finally, we identify open research problems and future directions to advance what-if analysis.</description>

      <title>TapNav: Adaptive Spatiotactile Screen Readers for Tactually Guided Touchscreen Interactions for Blind and Low Vision People</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Screen readers are audio-based software that Blind and Low Vision (BLV) people use to interact with computing devices, such as tablets and smartphones. Although this technology has significantly improved the accessibility of touchscreen devices, the sequential nature of audio limits the bandwidth of information users can receive and process. We introduce TapNav, an adaptive spatiotactile screen reader prototype developed to interact with touchscreen interfaces spatially. TapNav's screen reader provides adaptive auditory feedback that, in combination with a tactile overlay, conveys spatial information and location of interface elements on-screen. We evaluated TapNav with 12 BLV users who interacted with TapNav to explore a data visualization and interact with a bank transactions application. Our qualitative findings show that touch points and spatially constrained navigation helped users anticipate outcomes for faster exploration, and offload cognitive load to touch.

      <title>State Your Intention to Steer Your Attention: An AI Assistant for Intentional Digital Living</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14513</link>

Abstract: When working on digital devices, people often face distractions that can lead to a decline in productivity and efficiency, as well as negative psychological and emotional impacts. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant that elicits a user's intention, assesses whether ongoing activities are in line with that intention, and provides gentle nudges when deviations occur. The system leverages a large language model to analyze screenshots, application titles, and URLs, issuing notifications when behavior diverges from the stated goal. Its detection accuracy is refined through initial clarification dialogues and continuous user feedback. In a three-week, within-subjects field deployment with 22 participants, we compared our assistant to both a rule-based intent reminder system and a passive baseline that only logged activity. Results indicate that our AI assistant effectively supports users in maintaining focus and aligning their digital behavior with their intentions. Our source code is publicly available at https://intentassistant.github.io</description>

      <title>Toward Safe and Human-Aligned Game Conversational Recommendation via Multi-Agent Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) have advanced with large language models, showing strong results in domains like movies. These domains typically involve fixed content and passive consumption, where user preferences can be matched by genre or theme. In contrast, games present distinct challenges: fast-evolving catalogs, interaction-driven preferences (e.g., skill level, mechanics, hardware), and increased risk of unsafe responses in open-ended conversation. We propose MATCHA, a multi-agent framework for CRS that assigns specialized agents for intent parsing, tool-augmented retrieval, multi-LLM ranking with reflection, explanation, and risk control which enabling finer personalization, long-tail coverage, and stronger safety. Evaluated on real user request dataset, MATCHA outperforms six baselines across eight metrics, improving Hit@5 by 20%, reducing popularity bias by 24%, and achieving 97.9% adversarial defense. Human and virtual-judge evaluations confirm improved explanation quality and user alignment.</description>

      <title>AppCopilot: Toward General, Accurate, Long-Horizon, and Efficient Mobile Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that should be solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1) generalization across tasks, APPs, and devices; (2) accuracy, specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3) long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency, specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose mobile agent that operates across applications. AppCopilot operationalizes this position through an end-to-end pipeline spanning data collection, training, finetuning, efficient inference, and PC/mobile application. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution layer, it enables experiential adaptation, voice interaction, function calling, cross-APP and cross-device orchestration, and comprehensive mobile APP support. The system design incorporates profiling-driven optimization for latency and memory across heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant improvements on four dimensions: stronger generalization, higher precision of on screen actions, more reliable long horizon task completion, and faster, more resource efficient runtime. By articulating a cohesive position and a reference architecture that closes the loop from data collection, training to finetuning and efficient inference, this paper offers a concrete roadmap for general purpose mobile agent and provides actionable guidance.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Mechanisms of Human Learning: Implications for Research and Practice in Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning underlies nearly all human behavior and is central to education and education reform. Although recent advances in neuroscience have revealed the fundamental structure of learning processes, these insights have yet to be integrated into research and practice. Specifically, neuroscience has found that decision-making is governed by a structured process of perception, action-selection, and execution, supported by multiple neural systems with distinct memory stores and learning mechanisms. These systems extract different types of information (categorical, predictive, structural, and sequential) challenging canonical models of memory used in learning and behavioral science research by providing a mechanistic account of how humans acquire and use knowledge. Because each system learns differently, effective teaching requires alignment with system-specific processes. We propose a unified model that integrates these neuroscientific insights, bridging basic mechanisms with outcomes in education, identity, belonging, and wellbeing. By translating first principles of neural information processing into a generalizable framework, this work advances theories of skill acquisition and transfer while establishing a foundation for interdisciplinary research to refine how learning is understood and supported across domains of human behavior.</description>
