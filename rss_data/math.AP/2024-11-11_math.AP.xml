      <title>Comparison principles for the time-fractional diffusion equations with the Robin boundary conditions. Part II: Semilinear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with analysis of the initial-boundary value problems for the semilinear time-fractional diffusion equations, while the case of the linear equations was considered in the first part of the present work. These equations contain uniformly elliptic spatial differential operators of the second order and the Caputo type fractional derivative acting in the fractional Sobolev spaces as well as a semilinear term that depends on the spatial variable, the unknown function and its gradient. The boundary conditions are formulated in form of the homogeneous Neumann or Robin conditions. For these problems, we first prove uniqueness and existence of their solutions. Under some suitable conditions, we then show the non-negativity of the solutions and derive several comparison principles. We also apply the monotonicity method by upper and lower solutions to deduce some a priori estimates for solutions to the initial-boundary value problems for the semilinear time-fractional diffusion equations. Finally, we consider some initial-boundary value problems for systems of the linear and semilinear time-fractional diffusion equations and prove non-negativity of their solutions under the suitable conditions.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness and Long-Time Dynamics of a Water-Waves Model with Time-Varying Boundary Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A higher-order nonlinear Boussinesq system with a time-dependent boundary delay is considered. Sufficient conditions are presented to ensure the well-posedness of the problem, utilizing Kato's variable norm technique and the Fixed-Point Theorem. More significantly, the energy decay for the linearized problem is demonstrated using the energy method.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and equicontinuity for mKdV in modulation spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish global well-posedness for both the defocusing and focusing complex-valued modified Korteweg--de Vries equations on the real line in modulation spaces $M_p^{s,2}(\mathbb{R})$, for all $1\leq p&lt;\infty$ and $0\leq s&lt;3/2-1/p$. We will also show that such solutions admit global-in-time bounds in these spaces and that equicontinuous sets of initial data lead to equicontinuous ensembles of orbits. Indeed, such information forms a crucial part of our well-posedness argument.</description>

      <title>Inhomogenous Navier--Stokes equations with unbounded density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current state of the art regarding the Navier--Stokes equations, the existence of unique solutions for incompressible flows in two spatial dimensions is already well-established. Recently, these results have been extended to models with variable density, maintaining positive outcomes for merely bounded densities, even in cases with large vacuum regions. However, the study of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with unbounded densities remains incomplete. Addressing this gap is the focus of the present paper.
  Our main result demonstrates the global existence of a unique solution for flows initiated by unbounded density, whose regularity/integrability is characterized within a specific subset of the Yudovich class of unbounded functions. The core of our proof lies in the application of Desjardins' inequality, combined with a blow-up criterion for ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, we derive time-weighted estimates that guarantee the existence of a $C^1$ velocity field and ensure the equivalence of Eulerian and Lagrangian formulations of the equations. Finally, by leveraging results from \cite{DanMu}, we conclude the uniqueness of the solution.</description>

      <title>Stable solutions of $U(1)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs model in $\mathbb{R}^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a positive answer to the conjecture of Liu-Ma-Wei-Wu in \cite{LMWW} that the family of entire solutions to the $U(1)$-Yang-Mills-Higgs equation constructed by the gluing method in that paper are stable. This is the first family of examples of nontrivial stable critical points to the $U(1)$-Yang-Mills-Higgs model in higher dimensional Euclidean space. Intuitively, the stability of these solutions corresponds to the fact that holomorphic curves are area-minimizing. We also show that these entire solutions are non-degenerate. Our proof is based on detailed analysis of the linearized operators around this family and the spectrum estimates of the Jacobi operator by Arezzo-Pacard \cite{ArePac}.</description>

      <title>Rigidly breaking potential flows and a countable Alexandrov theorem for polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study all the ways that a given convex body in $d$ dimensions can break into countably many pieces that move away from each other rigidly at constant velocity, with no rotation or shearing. The initial velocity field is locally constant, but may be continuous and/or fail to be integrable. For any choice of mass-velocity pairs for the pieces, such a motion can be generated by the gradient of a convex potential that is affine on each piece. We classify such potentials in terms of a countable version of a theorem of Alexandrov for convex polytopes, and prove a stability theorem. For bounded velocities, there is a bijection between the mass-velocity data and optimal transport flows (Wasserstein geodesics) that are locally incompressible.
  Given any rigidly breaking velocity field that is the gradient of a continuous potential, the convexity of the potential is established under any of several conditions, such as the velocity field being continuous, the potential being semi-convex, the mass measure generated by a convexified transport potential being absolutely continuous, or there being a finite number of pieces. Also we describe a number of curious and paradoxical examples having fractal structure.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of a class of $T_N$ configurations for a hyperbolic system with one entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Kirchheim, M\"{u}ller and \v{S}ver\'{a}k [Studying nonlinear PDE by geometry in matrix space. Geometric analysis and nonlinear partial differential equations, 2003], the authors proposed the program to use the differential inclusion approach to study entropy solutions for systems of conservation laws. In particular, they raised questions concerning the local structure of the rank-one convex hull of a set $K_a\subset\mathbb{R}^{3\times 2}$, which arises from the differential inclusion formulation of a classical $2\times 2$ system of conservation laws (the $p$-system) coupled with one entropy. Recently, this question has been studied extensively by showing that the set $K_a$ does not contain the so-called $T_N$ configurations for $N=4$ and $N=5$. In this paper, we continue this program by showing that the set $K_a$ does not contain a class of three-dimensional $T_N$ configurations, as well as two-dimensional $T_N$ configurations for general $N$.</description>

      <title>A formal gradient flow interpretation of a class of McKean-Vlasov equations using a new adaptation of the Wasserstein metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new adaptation of the Wasserstein metric over the space of probability measures is presented, the associated formal Otto calculus developed, and some transport inequalities are proven. An instance of this new metric can be viewed as a curved version of the dual space of a second-order Sobolev-like factor space; in a similar way that the linearization of the classical 2-Wasserstein metric is the dual norm of the first-order, homogeneous Sobolev space. This new metric structure permits an intuitive gradient flow interpretation of a class of nonlinear, nonlocal integro-differential evolution equations of the McKean-Vlasov type that arise at the intersection of mathematics, economics, and physics.
  Moreover, in the same way that classical $W_2$ gradient flow theory connects heat flow and the second law of thermodynamics by way of Boltzmann entropy, the generalization here gives rise to a principle of econophysics that is much of the same flavor but for the Gini coefficient of economic inequality.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the local boundary controllability for a non linear system of two degenerate parabolic equations with a control acting on only one equation. We analyze boundary null controllability properties for the linear system via the moment method by Fattorini and Russell, together with some results on biorthogonal families. Moreover, we provide an estimate on the null-control cost. This estimate let us prove a local exact boundary controllability result to zero of the nonlinear system following the iterative method from Lebeau and Robbiano as in \cite{Burgos_2020, Liu_2012}.</description>

      <title>Decay properties for massive Vlasov fields on Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain pointwise decay estimates in time for massive Vlasov fields on the exterior of Schwarzschild spacetime. We consider massive Vlasov fields supported on the closure of the largest domain of the mass-shell where timelike geodesics either cross $\mathcal{H}^+$, or escape to infinity. For this class of Vlasov fields, we prove that the components of the energy-momentum tensor decay like $v^{-\frac{1}{3}}$ in the bounded region $\{r\leq R\}$, and like $u^{-\frac{1}{3}}r^{-2}$ in the far-away region $\{r\geq R\}$, where $R&gt;2M$ is sufficiently large. Here, $(u,v)$ denotes the standard Eddington--Finkelstein double null coordinate pair.</description>

      <title>Inverse problems for stochastic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This book aims to provide a brief overview of recent advancements in the theory of inverse problems for stochastic partial differential equations. In order to keep the content concise, we will only discuss the inverse problems of two typical classes of stochastic partial differential equations: second-order stochastic parabolic equations and secondorder stochastic hyperbolic equations. The main tool for studying these inverse problem is Carleman estimate. We do not intend to pursue any general treatment of the Carleman estimates themselves and choose direct arguments based on basic stochastic calculus, rather than more general sophisticated methods.
  As this field is still developing and there are many challenging issues to be addressed, the purpose of this book is not to serve as a comprehensive summary, but rather to spark interest and encourage further exploration in this area among readers. We prefer to present results that, from our perspective, include fresh and promising ideas. In cases where a complete mathematical theory is lacking, we only provide the available results. We do not intend for the current book to be encyclopedic in any sense, and the references are limited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.13110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the real-valued modified KdV equation on the real line and the circle, in both the focusing and the defocusing case. By employing the method of commuting flows introduced by Killip and Vi\c{s}an (2019), we prove global well-posedness in $H^{s}$ for $0\leq s&lt;\tfrac{1}{2}$. On the line, we show how the arguments in the recent paper by Harrop-Griffiths, Killip, and Vi\c{s}an (2020) may be simplified in the higher regularity regime $s\geq 0$. On the circle, we provide an alternative proof of the sharp global well-posedness in $L^2$ due to Kappeler and Topalov (2005), and also extend this to the large-data focusing case.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equations as gradient flows on the space of probability measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09530v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general method to identify nonlinear Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equations (FPK equations) as gradient flows on the space of probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with a natural differential geometry. Our notion of gradient flow does not depend on any underlying metric structure such as the Wasserstein distance, but is derived from purely differential geometric considerations. We explicitly identify the associated entropy functions, which are not necessarily convex, and also the corresponding energy functionals, in particular their domains of definition. Furthermore, the latter functions are Lyapunov functions for the solutions of the FPK equations. Moreover, we show uniqueness results for such gradient flows, and we also prove that the gradient of $E$ is a gradient field on $\mathbb{R}^d$, which can be approximated by smooth gradient fields. These results cover classical and generalized porous media equations, where the latter have a generalized diffusivity function and a nonlinear transport-type first-order perturbation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the nonlocal Stefan problem, where the phase transition is described by a nonlocal diffusion as well as the change of enthalpy functions. By using a stochastic optimization approach introduced for the local case, we construct global-time weak solutions and give a probabilistic interpretation for the solutions. An important ingredient in our analysis is a probabilistic interpretation of the enthalpy and temperature variables in terms of a particle system. Our approach in particular establishes the connection between the parabolic obstacle problem and the Stefan Problem for the nonlocal diffusions. For the melting problem, we show that our solution coincides with those studied in the literature, and obtain a new exponential convergence result.</description>

      <title>The free boundary of steady axisymmetric inviscid flow with vorticity II: near the non-degenerate points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the sequel of the recent work (Du, Huang, Pu, Commun. Math. Phys, 2023, doi: 10.1007/s00220-023-04651-7) on axially symmetric gravity water waves with general vorticities, which has investigated the singular wave profile of the free boundary near the degenerate points. In this companion paper, we are interested in the regularity of the free surface of the water wave near the non-degenerate point. Precisely, we showed that the free boundary is $C^{1,\gamma}$ smooth for some $\gamma\in(0,1)$ near all non-degenerate points. The problem is intrinsically intertwined with the regularity theory of the semilinear Bernoulli-type free boundary problem. Our approach is closely related to the monotonicity formula developed by Weiss in his celebrated work (Weiss, J. Geom. Anal. 9: 317-326, 1999), and to a partial boundary Harnack inequality for the one-phase free boundary problem, which is dedicated to De Silva (De Silva, Interfaces Free Bound. 13, 223-238, 2011). Mathematically, we associate the existence of viscosity solutions with the Weiss boundary-adjusted energy. Compared to the classical approach of Caffarelli (Caffarelli, Ann. Scuola Norm. Sup. Pisa, 15, 583-602, 1988), we provide an alternative proof of the existence of viscosity solutions for a large class of semilinear free boundary problems.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and long-term behaviour for a troposphere wave propagation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a model recently derived by A. Constantin and R.S. Johnson for nonlinear wave propagation in the troposphere, particularly the 'morning glory' cloud pattern. We consider the model with natural Dirichlet boundary conditions for the vertical velocity at the top of the troposphere, and thus introduce a new pressure term. This modified system has a structural relation to the 2D primitive equations, for which global well-posedness and the existence of a global attractor are already known. We transfer these results to the modified model, giving proofs that exploit specific features and use standard methods combined with anisotropic Sobolev inequalities. Additionally, we show that the attractor exists only for specific parameter ranges, while for other parameters, we find runaway solutions with unbounded growth over time.</description>

      <title>One dimensional energy cascades in a fractional quasilinear NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of transfer of energy to high frequencies in a quasilinear Schr\"odinger equation with sublinear dispersion, on the one dimensional torus. We exhibit initial data undergoing finite but arbitrary large Sobolev norm explosion: their initial norm is arbitrary small in Sobolev spaces of high regularity, but at a later time becomes arbitrary large. We develop a novel mechanism producing instability, which is based on extracting, via paradifferential normal forms, an effective equation driving the dynamics whose leading term is a non-trivial transport operator with non-constant coefficients. We prove that such operator is responsible for energy cascades via a positive commutator estimate inspired by Mourre's commutator theory.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Gradient Flows of MMD Functionals with Distance Kernel and Cauchy Problems on Quantile Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a comprehensive description of Wasserstein gradient flows of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) functionals $\mathcal F_\nu := \text{MMD}_K^2(\cdot, \nu)$ towards given target measures $\nu$ on the real line, where we focus on the negative distance kernel $K(x,y) := -|x-y|$. In one dimension, the Wasserstein-2 space can be isometrically embedded into the cone $\mathcal C(0,1) \subset L_2(0,1)$ of quantile functions leading to a characterization of Wasserstein gradient flows via the solution of an associated Cauchy problem on $L_2(0,1)$. Based on the construction of an appropriate counterpart of $\mathcal F_\nu$ on $L_2(0,1)$ and its subdifferential, we provide a solution of the Cauchy problem. For discrete target measures $\nu$, this results in a piecewise linear solution formula. We prove invariance and smoothing properties of the flow on subsets of $\mathcal C(0,1)$. For certain $\mathcal F_\nu$-flows this implies that initial point measures instantly become absolutely continuous, and stay so over time. Finally, we illustrate the behavior of the flow by various numerical examples using an implicit Euler scheme, which is easily computable by a bisection algorithm. For continuous targets $\nu$, also the explicit Euler scheme can be employed, although with limited convergence guarantees.</description>

      <title>From orbital magnetism to bulk-edge correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.13456v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By extending the gauge covariant magnetic perturbation theory to operators defined on half-planes, we prove that for $2d$ random ergodic magnetic Schr\"odinger operators, the zero-temperature bulk-edge correspondence can be obtained from a general bulk-edge duality at positive temperature involving the bulk magnetization and the total edge current.
  Our main result is encapsulated in a formula, which states that the derivative of a large class of bulk partition functions with respect to the external constant magnetic field, equals the expectation of a corresponding edge distribution function of the velocity component which is parallel to the edge. Neither spectral gaps, nor mobility gaps, nor topological arguments are required.
  The equality between the bulk and edge indices, as stated by the conventional bulk-edge correspondence, is obtained as a corollary of our purely analytical arguments by imposing a gap condition and by taking a ``zero-temperature" limit.</description>

      <title>A nodal ghost method based on variational formulation and regular square grid for elliptic problems on arbitrary domains in two space dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the numerical solution of elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) with Dirichlet and mixed boundary conditions, specifically addressing the challenges arising from irregular domains. Both finite element method (FEM) and finite difference method (FDM), face difficulties in dealing with arbitrary domains. The paper introduces a novel nodal symmetric ghost {method based on a variational formulation}, which combines the advantages of FEM and FDM. The method employs bilinear finite elements on a structured mesh and provides a detailed implementation description. A rigorous a priori convergence rate analysis is also presented. The convergence rates are validated with many numerical experiments, in both one and two space dimensions.</description>

      <title>Radiative transport in a periodic structure with band crossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Wigner transformation and asymptotic analysis to systematically derive the semi-classical model for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in arbitrary spatial dimensions, with any periodic structure. Our particular emphasis lies in addressing the \textit{diabatic} effect, i.e., the impact of Bloch band crossings. We consider both deterministic and random scenarios. In the former case, we derive a coupled Liouville system, revealing lower-order interactions among different Bloch bands. In the latter case, a coupled system of radiative transport equations emerges, with the scattering cross-section induced by the random inhomogeneities. As a specific application, we deduce the effective dynamics of a wave packet in graphene with randomness.</description>

      <title>A numerical view on {\alpha}-dissipative solutions of the Hunter-Saxton equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new numerical method for $\alpha$-dissipative solutions of the Hunter-Saxton equation, where $\alpha$ belongs to $W^{1, \infty}(\mathbb{R}, [0, 1))$. The method combines a projection operator with a generalized method of characteristics and an iteration scheme, which is based on enforcing minimal time steps whenever breaking times cluster. Numerical examples illustrate that these minimal time steps increase the efficiency of the algorithm substantially. Moreover, convergence of the wave profile is shown in $C([0, T], L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}))$ for any finite $T \geq 0$.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Approaches to The Energy Equality in Forced Surface Quasi-Geostrophic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore probabilistic approaches to the deterministic energy equality for the forced Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) equation on a torus. First, we prove the zero-noise dynamical large deviations for a corresponding stochastic SQG equation, where the lower bound matches the upper bound on a certain closure of the weak-strong uniqueness class for the deterministic forced SQG equation. Furthermore, we show that the energy equality for the deterministic SQG equation holds on arbitrary time-reversible subsets of the domain, where we match the upper bound and the lower bound. Conversely, the violation of the deterministic energy equality breaks the lower bound of large deviations. These results extend the existing techniques in Gess, Heydecker, and the second author \cite{arXiv:2311.02223} to generalized Sobolev spaces with negative indices. Finally, we provide an analysis of the restricted quasi-potential and prove a conditional equivalence compared to the rate function of large deviations for the Gaussian distribution. This suggests a potential connection between non-Gaussian large deviations in equilibrium for the stochastic SQG equation and the open problem regarding the uniqueness of the deterministic SQG equation.</description>
