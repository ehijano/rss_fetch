      <title>Designing the system to measure the depth-dose profile of a proton beam using CsI(Tl) scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the standard CsI(Tl) scintillator was used to determine the characteristics of a proton beam. By irradiating the scintillator with a proton beam, it was able to subsequently measure the emitted light using a spectrometer. This work presents the dose response of a scintillator and its use to measure the depth-dose profile of a proton beam. The measurement of the dose response showed that the emission light of the scintillator depended on the total dose of the proton beam. For the design of the depth-dose measurement, the setup of the water phantom included a scintillator and a water tank. The depth-dose profile was determined through varying the water depth at various positions along the path of the proton beam until the end of the Bragg peak region. To compare the measured depth-dose profile, the deposited energy was simulated and fitted Birks constant for collecting quenching. Furthermore, the recommended measurement design suggested using a thin scintillator, as it resulted in a narrower shape of the depth-dose profile. Based on experiment and simulation data, a standard CsI(Tl) scintillator was promising for determining the characteristic proton beam.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Data to Quantify Urca Cooling in Accreting Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars in Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) can accrete matter onto their surface from the companion star. Transiently accreting neutron stars go through alternating phases of active accretion outbursts and quiescence. X-ray observations during the quiescence phase show a drop in X-ray luminosity with the time in quiescence. This is also inferred as the drop in surface temperature or the cooling of accreting neutron stars in quiescence. Analyzing these cooling curves reveals a great deal of information about the structure and composition of neutron stars. However, model-observation comparisons of such cooling curves are challenging - partly due to observational uncertainties, and partly due to incomplete knowledge of heating mechanisms during accretion outbursts. This situation is further exacerbated by the recent discovery of Urca cooling in the neutron star crust. These are cycles that alternate between electron-capture and beta-decay to produce a large flux of neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. These freely stream out of the star and carry energy with them, essentially cooling the neutron star crust without changing the composition. As a result, it is necessary to accurately quantify the strength of Urca cooling to constrain the heat sources in neutron star crusts and facilitate better model-observation comparisons of the cooling curves.</description>

      <title>Effects of pairing strength on the nuclear structure and double-$\beta$ decay predictions within the mapped interacting boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-energy nuclear structure and two-neutrino double-$\beta$ ($2\nu\beta\beta$) decay are studied within the interacting boson model (IBM) that is based on the nuclear energy density functional (EDF). The IBM Hamiltonian describing the initial and final even-even nuclei, and the interacting boson fermion-fermion Hamiltonian producing the intermediate states of the neighboring odd-odd nuclei, are determined by the microscopic inputs provided by the self-consistent mean-field (SCMF) calculations employing a relativistic EDF and a separable pairing force. Sensitivities of the low-lying structure and $2\nu\beta\beta$-decay properties to the pairing strength are specifically analyzed. It is shown that the SCMF calculations with the decreased and increased pairing strengths lead to the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction strengths in the IBM that are, respectively, significantly enhanced and reduced in magnitude. When the increased pairing is adopted, in particular, the energy levels of the excited $0^+$ states are lowered, and the predicted $2\nu\beta\beta$-decay nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) increase in magnitude systematically. The mapped IBM employing the increased pairing force generates effective NMEs and half-lives that are overall in a reasonable agreement with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>On the use of quantality in nuclei and many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of quantality is discussed in the case of nuclei and other many-body systems such as atomic electrons. This dimensionless quantity is known to indicate when a many-body system behaves like a crystal or a quantum liquid. Its role is further analyzed, showing the emergence of a fundamental lengthscale, the limit radius, which corresponds to the hard-core of the nucleon-nucleon interaction in the case of nucleons, and to a value close to the Bohr radius in the case of atomic electrons. The occurrence of a cluster phase in nuclei is analyzed using the quantality through its relation to the localization parameter, allowing for the identification of both the number of nucleons and the density as control parameters for the occurrence of this phase. The relation of the quantality to the magnitude of the interaction also exhibits a third dimensionless parameter, monitoring the magnitude of the spin-orbit effect in finite systems, through the realization of the pseudo-spin symmetry. The impact of quantality on the spin-orbit effect is compared in various many-body systems. The role of quantality in the relative effect of the binding energy and the shell one is also analyzed in nuclei. Finally, additional dimensionless quantities are proposed from the generalization of the quantality. Nuclei are found to be exceptional systems because all their dimensionless quantities are close to the order of unity, at variance with other many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Exclusive Meson Production as a probe to the puzzle of $\Lambda$ hyperon polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 1970s, an unexpected transverse $\Lambda$ polarization in unpolarized proton-Beryllium collisions was discovered, which initiated extensive studies on spin phenomena in high-energy physics. Over the past five decades, similar transverse $\Lambda$ polarization has been observed across various collision systems, including lepton-hadron deep inelastic scattering, hadron-hadron collisions, and electron-positron collisions. Despite numerous promising theoretical models, the fundamental mechanism underlying this polarization phenomenon remains inconclusive to this day. However, in both longitudinally and transversely polarized lepton-hadron and hadron-hadron collisions, it is found that the $\Lambda$ hyperon is not polarized with respect to the initial parton spin direction. How the $\Lambda$ hyperon acquires its spin has become one of the most crucial questions to address in order to resolve this puzzle. In this paper, I propose to use an exclusive process that can be measured at the Electron-Ion Collider, the Deep Exclusive Meson Production, to explicitly test the mechanism of $\Lambda$ polarization. The outcomes of this experimental measurement are anticipated to unveil the dominant mechanism by which $\Lambda$ obtains its spin, eliminating many of the ambiguities that have been encountered in previous studies. Finally, experimental challenges and requirements will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Novel Cross Section Ratios as Possible Signals of Saturation in UPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new cross section ratios in ultra-peripheral A$+$A and $p+$A collisions (UPCs) as a potential experimental signal of saturation physics. We consider the ratio $R_1$ of elastic vector meson photoproduction cross section to the inclusive hadron or jet photoproduction cross section. The ratio can be measured in the $\gamma +$A and $\gamma + p$ collisions taking place in the UPCs. We label the ratios $R_1 ({\rm A})$ and $R_1 (p)$, respectively. Constructing the double ratio $R_{\rm{UPC}} ({\rm A}) = R_1 ({\rm A})/R_1 (p)$, and performing a small-$x$ calculation both in the quasi-classical approximation and by including small-$x$ evolution, we observe that $R_{\rm{UPC}} ({\rm A})$ exhibits a markedly different dependence on the nuclear atomic number inside and outside the saturation region. This result indicates that $R_{\rm{UPC}} ({\rm A})$ and $R_1 ({\rm A})$ measurements in UPCs may help in the experimental searches for the evidence of saturation physics.</description>
