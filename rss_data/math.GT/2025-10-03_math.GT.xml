      <title>Explicit formulae for the Aicardi-Juyumaya bracket of tied links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double bracket $\langle \langle \cdot \rangle \rangle$ (also known as the AJ-bracket) is an invariant of framed tied links that extends the Kauffman bracket of classical links. Unlike the classical setting, little is known about the structure of AJ-states (analogous to classical Kauffman states) of a given tied link diagram, and no general state-sum formula for the AJ-bracket is currently available. In this paper we analyze the AJ-states of $2$- and $3$-tied link diagrams, and provide a complete description of their associated resolution trees leading to a computation of $\langle \langle \cdot \rangle \rangle$. As a result, we derive explicit state-sum formulas for the AJ-bracket. These are the first closed-form expressions of this kind, and they constitute a concrete step toward a combinatorial categorification of the tied Jones polynomial.</description>

      <title>Affine representations of rational and pretzel knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and study representations of rational and pretzel tangle and knot groups into the affine group $\mathrm{AGL}(1,\mathbb{C})$, via a TQFT that is valued in the category of spans of singular vector bundles over $\mathbb{C}^{\ast}$. For these families, we derive closed-form expressions for their Alexander polynomials and establish bounds on their zeros. Finally, we specialize the functor at $t=-1$ and analyze colorings of rational tangles in terms of spans of complex vector spaces.</description>

      <title>Exact integral formulas for volumes of two-bridge knot cone-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide exact integral formulas for hyperbolic and spherical volumes of cone-manifolds whose underlying space is the $3$-sphere and whose singular set belongs to three infinite families of two-bridge knots: $C(2n,2)$ (twist knots), $C(2n,3)$, and $C(2n,-2n)$ for any non-zero integer $n$. Our formulas express volumes as integrals of explicit rational functions involving Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind, with integration limits determined by roots of algebraic equations. This extends previous work where only implicit formulas requiring numerical approximation were known.</description>

      <title>Ribbon concordance and fibered predecessors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given any knot K in the 3-sphere, we prove that there are only finitely many hyperbolic fibered knots which are ribbon concordant to K. It follows that every fibered knot in the 3-sphere has only finitely many hyperbolic predecessors under ribbon concordance. Our proof combines results about maps on Floer homology induced by ribbon cobordisms with a relationship between the knot Floer homology of a fibered knot and fixed points of its monodromy. We then use the same techniques in combination with results of Cornish and Kojima-McShane to prove an inequality relating the volumes of ribbon concordant hyperbolic fibered knots.</description>

      <title>Finite isoresidual covers in strata of $k$-differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the strata of primitive $k$-differentials on the Riemann sphere whose singularities, except for two, are poles of order divisible by $k$. The map that assigns to each $k$-differential the $k$-residues at these poles is a ramified cover of its image. Generalizing results known in the case of abelian differentials, we describe the ramification locus of this cover and provide a formula, involving the $k$-factorial function, for the cardinality of each fiber. We prove this formula using intersection calculations on the multi-scale compactification of the strata of $k$-differentials. In special cases, we also give alternative proofs using flat geometry. Finally, we present an application to cone spherical metrics with dihedral monodromy.</description>

      <title>Virtual fibring of manifolds and groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topic of this survey is the phenomenon of fibring over the circle for manifolds, and its group-theoretic twin, algebraic fibring. We will discuss the state of the art, and explain briefly some of the ideas behind the more recent developments, focusing on RFRS groups and manifolds with such fundamental groups. Then we will move on to a more speculative part, where many conjectures about fibring in higher dimensions will be given. The conjectures vary in their level of plausibility, but even the boldest of them might share the fate of Thurston's Virtually Fibred Conjecture, about which Thurston famously said: ``This dubious-sounding question seems to have a definite chance for a positive answer''.</description>

      <title>On the behavior of the colored Jones polynomial of the figure-eight knot under modular transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The colored Jones polynomial $J_{K,N}$ is an important quantum knot invariant in low-dimensional topology. In his seminal paper on quantum modular forms, Zagier predicted the behavior of $J_{K,0}(e^{2 \pi i x})$ under the action of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ on $x \in \mathbb{Q}$. More precisely, Zagier made a prediction on the asymptotic value of the quotient $J_{K,0}(e^{2 \pi i \gamma(x)})/ J_{K,0}(e^{2 \pi i x})$ for fixed $\gamma \in SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$, as $x \to \infty$ along rationals with bounded denominator. In the case of the figure-eight knot $4_1$, which is the most accessible case, there is an explicit formula for $J_{4_1,0}(e^{2 \pi i x})$ as a sum of certain trigonometric products called Sudler products. By periodicity, the behavior of $J_{4_1,0}(e^{2 \pi i x})$ under the mapping $x \mapsto x+1$ is trivial. For the second generator of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$, Zagier conjectured that with respect to the mapping $x \mapsto 1/x$, the quotient $h(x) = \log ( J_{4_1,0}(e^{2 \pi i x}) / J_{4_1,0}(e^{2 \pi i /x}))$ can be extended to a function on $\mathbb{R}$ that is continuous at all irrationals. This conjecture was recently established by Aistleitner and Borda in the case of all irrationals that have an unbounded sequence of partial quotients in their continued fraction expansion. In the present paper we prove Zagier's continuity conjecture in full generality.</description>

      <title>Two second Steenrod squares for odd Khovanov homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.00389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Sarkar-Scaduto-Stoffregen constructed a stable homotopy type for odd Khovanov homology, hence obtaining an action of the Steenrod algebra on Khovanov homology with $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients. Motivated by their construction we propose a way to compute the second Steenrod square. Our construction is not unique, but we can show it to be a link invariant which gives rise to a refinement of the Rasmussen $s$-invariant with $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients. We expect it to be related to the second Steenrod square arising from the Sarkar-Scaduto-Stoffregen construction.</description>

      <title>On knots that divide ribbon knotted surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a knot to be half ribbon if it is the cross-section of a ribbon 2-knot, and observe that ribbon implies half ribbon implies slice. We introduce the half ribbon genus of a knot K, the minimum genus of a ribbon knotted surface of which K is a cross-section. We compute this genus for all prime knots up to 12 crossings, and many 13-crossing knots. The same approach yields new computations of the doubly slice genus. We also introduce the half fusion number of a knot K, that measures the complexity of ribbon 2-knots of which K is a cross-section. We show that it is bounded from below by the Levine-Tristram signatures, and differs from the standard fusion number by an arbitrarily large amount.</description>

      <title>The Brownian loop measure on Riemann surfaces and applications to length spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a simple identity relating the length spectrum of a Riemann surface to that of the same surface with an arbitrary number of additional cusps. Our proof uses the Brownian loop measure introduced by Lawler and Werner. In particular, we express the total mass of Brownian loops in a fixed free homotopy class on any Riemann surface in terms of the length of the geodesic representative for the complete constant curvature metric. This expression also allows us to write the electrical thickness of a compact set in $\mathbb C$ separating $0$ and $\infty$, or the Velling--Kirillov K\"ahler potential, in terms of the Brownian loop measure and the zeta-regularized determinant of Laplacian as a renormalization of the Brownian loop measure with respect to the length spectrum.</description>

      <title>On the Aicardi-Juyumaya bracket for tied links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a tied link $L$, the invariant $\langle\langle\cdot\rangle\rangle$ generalizes the Kauffman bracket of classical links. However, the analogues of Kauffman states and their relationship to this invariant are not immediately clear. We address this question by defining the Aicardi-Juyumaya states, and show that the contribution of each AJ-state to $\langle\langle\cdot\rangle\rangle$ does not depend on the chosen resolution tree. We also present an algorithm to compute the double bracket of a tied link diagram, and use it to find pairs of examples of (oriented) tied links sharing the same Homflypt polynomial but different tied Jones polynomial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A pair of closed, smooth $4$-manifolds $M$ and $M'$ are stably exotic if they are stably homeomorphic but not stably diffeomorphic, where stabilisation refers to connected sum with copies of $S^2 \times S^2$. Orientable stable exotica do not exist by a result of Gompf, but Kreck showed that nonorientable examples are plentiful. We investigate which values of the fundamental group $\pi$ and the first and second Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_1$ and $w_2$ admit stably exotic pairs, providing a complete description if $H_5(\pi;\mathbb{Z})=0$. In particular we produce new stable exotica, and new settings in which they do not arise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study limit sets of Teichm\"uller disks in the Thurston boundary of Teichm\"uller space of a closed surface S of genus at least 2. It is well known that almost every Teichm\"uller geodesic ray converges to a point on the boundary. We show that unlike rays, Teichm\"uller disks with smallest possible limit sets are extremely rare.</description>
