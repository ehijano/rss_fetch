      <title>Field theoretic atomistics: Learning thermodynamic and variational surrogate to density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hohenberg-Kohn (HK) theorem -- the bedrock of density functional theory (DFT) -- establishes a universal map from the external potential to the energy. It also relates the electron density and atomic forces to the variation of the energy with the external potential. But the HK map is rarely utilized in atomistics, wherein interatomic potentials are defined using the molecular or crystal structure rather than the external potential. As a break from this tradition, we present a field theoretic atomistics framework where the external potential assumes the central quantity. We machine learn the HK energy map while satisfying the thermodynamic limit. Further, we obtain both forces and electron density from the variation of the HK energy map, that are exact relations. Our models attain good accuracy across diverse benchmarks and compete with state-of-the-art machine learned interatomic potentials. Through electron density, we predict accurate dipole and quadrupole moments, otherwise nontrivial for interatomic potentials. Our formulation paves the way for a scalable electronic structure surrogate to DFT.</description>

      <title>A Molecular Density Functional Theory of aqueous electrolytic solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generalisation of molecular density functional theory to describe inhomogeneous solvent mixture, with the objective of modelling electrolytic solutions. Two electrolytic models are presented, both within the HNC approximation. The first one is a two-components mixture representing a primitive-like model of sodium chloride, where the solvent is described as a dielectric continuum. This popular model has the advantage of simplicity, as the ions densities solely depend on spatial coordinates. Additionally, we develop a realistic three-components electrolyte model, in which water solvent is described by a third density field that depends on both spatial and orientational coordinates. The proposed methodology and its tridimensional implementation (3 spatial coordinates and 3 Euler angles) are validated by comparing the solvation properties of a sodium cation with the predictions of integral equation theory solved in 1D (1 intermolecular distance and 5 Euler angles), showing near-perfect agreement. This methodology enables the study of solvation properties of solutes of arbitrary shapes in electrolytic solutions, as demonstrated with the prototypical N-methylacetamide molecule immersed in both electrolytic solution models.</description>

      <title>Experimental Realization of Thermal Reservoirs with Tunable Temperature in a Trapped-Ion Spin-Boson Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate an experimental scheme to engineer thermal baths with independently tunable temperatures and dissipation rates for the motional modes of a trapped-ion system. This approach enables robust thermal-state preparation and quantum simulations of open-system dynamics in bosonic and spin-boson models at well-controlled finite temperatures. We benchmark our protocol by experimentally realizing out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a charge-transfer model at different temperatures. We observe that, when the process occurs at a higher temperature, the transfer rate spectrum broadens, with reduced rates at small donor-acceptor energy gaps and enhanced rates at large gaps. We then employ our scheme to study local-temperature effects in a two-mode vibrationally assisted exciton transfer system, where we observe thermally activated interference pathways for excitation transfer.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Atomistic-Parametric Decoherence Model for Molecular Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state molecular qubits with open-shell ground states have great potential for addressability, scalability, and tunability, but understanding the fundamental limits of quantum coherence in these systems is challenging due to the complexity of the qubit environment. To address this, we develop a random Hamiltonian approach where the molecular $g$-tensor fluctuates due to classical lattice motion obtained from molecular dynamics simulations at constant temperature. Atomistic $g$-tensor fluctuations are used to construct Redfield quantum master equations that predict the relaxation $T_1$ and dephasing $T_2$ times of copper porphyrin qubits in a crystalline framework. Assuming one-phonon spin-lattice interaction processes, $1/T$ temperature scaling and $1/B^3$ magnetic field scaling of $T_1$ are established using atomistic bath correlation functions. Atomistic $T_1$ predictions overestimate the available experimental data by orders of magnitude. Quantitative agreement with measurements at all magnetic fields is restored by introducing a magnetic field noise model to describe lattice nuclear spins, with field-dependent noise amplitude in the range $\delta B\sim 10\,\mu{\rm T}- 1\,{\rm mT}$ for the copper porphyrin system. We show that while $T_1$ scales as $1/B$ experimentally due to a combination of spin-lattice and magnetic noise contributions, $T_2$ scales strictly as $ 1/B^2$ due to low-frequency dephasing processes associated with magnetic field noise. Our work demonstrates the potential of dynamical methods for modeling the open quantum system dynamics of molecular spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the Modern Theory of Bose-Einstein Condensation, Superfluidity, and Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modern theory of Bose-Einstein condensation, superfluidity, and superconductivity is reviewed. The thermodynamic principle for superfluid flow and the equation of motion for condensed bosons are given. Computer simulations of Lennard-Jones $^4$He give the $\lambda$-transition and the superfluid viscosity. The statistical mechanical theory of high-temperature superconductivity is presented. Critical comparison is made with older approaches, such as ground energy state condensation, irrotational superfluid flow, and the macroscopic wavefunction.</description>

      <title>SmileyLlama: Modifying Large Language Models for Directed Chemical Space Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02231v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we show that a general-purpose large language model (LLM) chatbot, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, can be transformed via supervised fine-tuning of engineered prompts into a chemical language model (CLM), SmileyLlama, for molecule generation. We benchmark SmileyLlama by comparing it to CLMs trained from scratch on large amounts of ChEMBL data for their ability to generate valid and novel drug-like molecules. We also use direct preference optimization to both improve SmileyLlama's adherence to a prompt and to generate molecules within the iMiner reinforcement learning framework to predict new drug molecules with optimized 3D conformations and high binding affinity to drug targets, illustrated with the SARS-Cov-2 Main Protease. This overall framework allows a LLM to speak directly as a CLM which can generate molecules with user-specified properties, rather than acting only as a chatbot with knowledge of chemistry or as a helpful virtual assistant. While our dataset and analyses are geared toward drug discovery, this general procedure can be extended to other chemical applications such as chemical synthesis.</description>

      <title>Can Charge Transfer Across C-H...O Hydrogen Bonds Stabilize Oil Droplets in Water?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11606v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oil-water emulsions resist aggregation due to the presence of negative charges at their surface that leads to mutual repulsion between droplets, but the molecular origin of oil charge is currently under debate. While much evidence has suggested that ionic species must accumulate at the interface, an alternative perspective attributes the negative charge on the oil droplet to charge transfer of electron density from water to oil molecules. While the charge transfer mechanism is consistent with the correct sign of oil charge, it is just as important to provide good estimates of the charge magnitude to explain emulsion stability and electrophoresis experiments. Here we show using energy decomposition analysis that the amount of net flow of charge from water to oil is negligibly small due to nearly equal forward and backward charge transfer through weak oil-water interactions, such that oil droplets would be unstable and coalesce, contrary to experiment. The lack of charge transfer also explains why vibrational sum frequency scattering reports a blue shift in the oil C-H frequency when forming emulsions with water, which arises from Pauli repulsion due to localized confinement at the interface. Finally, unlike ions, neither charge transfer nor dynamic polarization can produce a finite conductivity needed to couple to electric fields that would explain electrophoretic mobility.</description>

      <title>Improved Treatment of 1-4 interactions in Force Fields for Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional force fields commonly use a combination of bonded torsional terms and empirically scaled non-bonded interactions to capture 1-4 energies and forces of atoms separated by three bonds in a molecule. While this approach can yield accurate torsional energy barriers, it often leads to inaccurate forces and erroneous geometries, and creates an interdependence between dihedral terms and non-bonded interactions, complicating parameterization and reducing transferability. In this paper, we demonstrate that 1-4 interactions can be accurately modeled using only bonded coupling terms, eliminating the need for arbitrarily scaled non-bonded interactions altogether. Furthermore by leveraging the automated parameterization capabilities of the Q-Force toolkit, we efficiently determine the necessary coupling terms without the need for manual adjustment. Our approach is first validated on a range of small molecule systems, encompassing both flexible and rigid structures, and shows a significant improvement in force field accuracy, obtaining sub-kcal/mol mean absolute error for every molecule tested. We further extend the bonded-only model for 1-4 interactions to Amber ff14sb, CHARMM36, and OPLS-AA force fields to reproduce ab initio gas and implicit solvent $\phi,\psi$ surfaces of alanine dipeptide.</description>

      <title>Halogen-Terminated Carbon Atomic Wires by Laser Ablation in Halogenated Organic Solvents: Synthesis and Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first synthesis of halogenated organic molecules via pulsed laser ablation in liquid, specifically halopolyynes, i.e., carbon atomic wires terminated by halogen atoms, and the first Raman characterization of long halogenated wires. Using dichloromethane and a dibromomethane-containing solution, we produced a polydisperse mixtures of monohalogeanted (HC$_n$X) and dihalogenated (XC$_n$X) polyynes (X=Cl, Br; n=6-20). High-performance liquid chromatography enabled us to separate and analyze these compounds, while chemical derivatization and mass spectroscopy confirmed their molecular structures. Their formation mechanism involves carbon chain polymerization and termination by halogen atoms from atomized solvent molecules during the plasma phase. UV-Vis absorption and synchrotron-based UV Resonance Raman spectroscopy revealed that halogen terminations act as weak electron donors, slightly affecting conjugation, bond length alternation, and moderately redshifting vibronic absorption and vibrational modes. Resonance Raman spectra show selective overtone enhancement, an emerging signature behavior of carbyne-like systems. Vibrational anharmonicity measurements confirm that halopolyynes follow the universal anharmonicity law previously proposed for carbyne-like materials, solidifying their classification within this family. These findings not only expand the synthetic toolbox for carbon atomic wires but also establish halopolyynes as a versatile platform for tailoring wire terminations and developing novel materials with tunable electronic and optical properties.</description>

      <title>ReactionTeam: Teaming Experts for Divergent Thinking Beyond Typical Reaction Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reaction prediction, a critical task in synthetic chemistry, is to predict the outcome of a reaction based on given reactants. Generative models like Transformer have typically been employed to predict the reaction product. However, these likelihood-maximization models overlooked the inherent stochastic nature of chemical reactions, such as the multiple ways electrons can be redistributed among atoms during the reaction process. In scenarios where similar reactants could follow different electron redistribution patterns, these models typically predict the most common outcomes, neglecting less frequent but potentially crucial reaction patterns. These overlooked patterns, though rare, can lead to innovative methods for designing synthetic routes and significantly advance synthesis techniques. To address these limitations, we build a team of expert models to capture diverse plausible reaction outcomes for the same reactants, mimicking the divergent thinking of chemists. The proposed framework, ReactionTeam, is composed of specialized expert models, each trained to capture a distinct type of electron redistribution pattern in reaction, and a ranking expert that evaluates and orders the generated predictions. Experimental results across two widely used datasets and different data settings demonstrate that our proposed method achieves significantly better performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.</description>
