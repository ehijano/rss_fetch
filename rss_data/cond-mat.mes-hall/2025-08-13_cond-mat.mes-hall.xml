      <title>Characterizing Topological Phase Transition in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and present a concept of Topological Distance (TD), obtained from the integration of trace distance over the generalized Brillouin zone, in order to characterize the topological transitions of non-Hermitian systems. Specifically, such a quantity is used to measure the overall dissimilarity between eigen wavefunctions upon traversing all possible matter states, and confirms the phase boundaries through observing the divergences of both TD and its partial derivatives; we clarify its origin and also offer a theoretical explanation. The method is developed to characterize the non-Hermitian topology in a novel way, and shows its generality and effectiveness in 1D non-Hermitian Kitaev systems, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians under periodic or open boundary conditions, and even generalizable to higher-order topological systems, providing a novel perspective to understand topological physics.</description>

      <title>Flux Response of Rotation-Invariant Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Threading magnetic flux into topological phases can induce bound states that reveal intrinsic properties of the ground state. In a 3D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator, a quantized $\pi$ flux traps a pair of 1D helical modes, whereas a trivial insulator hosts none. In this work, we show that in the presence of even-fold rotation symmetry $C_n$, a 3D band insulator features a refined $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ classification of the flux response. Specifically, it can host two distinct types of helical flux-bound modes that are distinguished by their angular momentum. When both types of flux modes coexist, the system is not a strong topological insulator, but a $C_n$-protected topological crystalline insulator. Building on this result, we propose that flux-threaded nanowires of such topological phase provide a natural platform for realizing 1D crystalline topological superconductors with multiple $C_n$-protected Majorana modes.</description>

      <title>Proximity superconductivity in chiral kagome antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments on the chiral kagome antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Ge have provided strong evidence of proximity-induced spin-polarized superconductivity. We introduce and explore a minimal model which exhibits a rich phase diagram as a function of chemical potential and spin canting. We find a valley-singlet superconducting phase for chemical potentials and canting consistent with the experimental system. This phase transitions into a Chern insulator at larger canting and gives way to topological superconducting phases with Chern numbers ${\cal C}_{\rm BdG} = \pm 1, \pm 3$ at other chemical potentials. Our results show that proximity-induced superconductivity in kagome antiferromagnets is a promising route towards exotic superconductivity with spin-polarized Cooper pairs, with potential applications in spintronics.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit-enabled realization of arbitrary two-qubit gates on moving spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shuttling spin qubits in systems with large spin-orbit interaction (SOI) can cause errors during motion. However, in this work, we demonstrate that SOI can be harnessed to implement an arbitrary high-fidelity two-qubit (2Q) gate. We consider two spin qubits defined in a semiconductor double quantum dot that are smoothly moved toward each other by gate voltages. We show that an arbitrary high-fidelity 2Q gate can be realized by controlling the shuttling speed and waiting times, and leveraging strong intrinsic or extrinsic SOI. Crucially, performing 2Q operations during qubit transport enables a one-step realization of a wide range of 2Q gates, which often involve several steps when implemented using static dots. Our findings establish a practical route toward direct implementation of any 2Q gate via spin shuttling, significantly reducing control overhead in scalable quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Translation Groups for arbitrary Gauge Fields in Synthetic Crystals with real hopping amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cayley-crystals introduced in [F. R. Lux and E. Prodan, Annales Henri Poincar\'e 25(8), 3563 (2024)] are a class of synthetic lattices whose Hamiltonians are symmetric under the simply transitive action of a generic discrete group G. We show that these systems naturally realize the generalization of the so-called magnetic translation groups to arbitrary discrete gauge groups. The one-body dynamics mimics that of a particle carrying multiple charges, each experiencing a distinct static gauge-field configuration. The possible types of gauge fields are determined by the irreducible representations of the commutator subgroup C of G, while the Wilson-loop configurations - which need not be homogeneous - are fixed by the embedding of C in G. We analyze in depth the role of other subgroups in shaping both the lattice geometry and the dynamics. For engineering relevance, we discuss a theorem that constructs all Cayley-crystals for a given abelian gauge group, and we provide two-dimensional examples corresponding to crystals threaded by inhomogeneous magnetic fluxes. Moreover, Cayley-crystals can be realized with only real hopping amplitudes and in scalable geometries that can fit higher-than-3D dynamics, enabling experimental exploration and eventual exploitation in metamaterials, cQED, and other synthetic platforms.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field-induced chiral soliton lattice in the bulk magnetoelectric helimagnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral soliton lattices (CSLs) are anharmonic magnetic structures typically found in uniaxial chiral magnets. In this study, we report the observation of CSL in bulk Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$, a chiral insulator known for its magnetoelectric properties. Using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments, we demonstrate the formation of CSLs in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ at low temperatures, driven by the competition between cubic anisotropy and magnetic field. Our observations of higher harmonics in the SANS signal clearly indicate the anharmonic nature of the spiral. This finding underscores the complex interplay between magnetic interactions in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$, offering insights for potential applications of CSLs in electric-field controlled spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial graphene integrated with a monolayer magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imprinting magnetism into graphene makes an important step to its applications in spintronics. An actively explored approach is proximity coupling of graphene to a 2D magnet. In these endeavors, the use of epitaxial graphene may bring significant advantages due to its superiority over the exfoliated counterpart and natural integration with the substrate but the problem of attaining magnetism persists. Here, we report synthesis and analysis of a heterostructure coupling epitaxial graphene with a regular lattice of magnetic atoms formed by Eu intercalation. The magnetization measurements reveal easy-plane 2D magnetism in the material, with the transition temperature controlled by low magnetic fields. The emerging negative magnetoresistance and anomalous Hall effect point at spin polarization of the carriers in graphene. In the paramagnetic phase, the magnetoresistance in graphene exhibits critical exponential behavior of the induced magnetic state. The intercalation does not compromise the parental electronic structure - quantum oscillations in the resistivity manifest low-mass carriers in graphene. The results are set against those for an isostructural material based on intercalated nonmagnetic Sr. Overall, the study expands the family of 2D magnets and establishes a prospective material for graphene-based spintronics.</description>

      <title>Probing imbalanced Weyl nodes in two-dimensional anisotropic Weyl semimetal via optical conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of the electronic band structure and optical properties of a two-dimensional anisotropic semimetal that is described by a tilted semi-Dirac type spectrum with a pair of Weyl nodes. We observe that a tilt along the quadratic direction can give rise to an energy imbalance between these nodes, contrary to the effect of tilt along the linear direction. We investigate the optical response of such system subjected to an external AC bias, aiming to probe the energy imbalance between the nodes. We show that the anisotropic interband optical conductivity gives a clear signature of imbalanced nodes by exciting electrons at two different chemical potentials at near zero frequency indicating, and the difference between these two chemical potentials is the direct measure of the energy imbalance. Subsequently, we also investigate the intraband DC conductivity by using the semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory which reveals that contrary to the tilted Dirac materials, tilt can convert semi-Dirac material from semimetallic phase to metallic phase. Furthermore, we periodically drive the system by external time-periodic perturbation to open up topological gap at those nodes. We also show that the presence of imbalanced Weyl nodes would prevent the SD material from switching to Chern topological phase even after opening topological gaps at the nodes as the bulk remains gapless. Such state cannot be probed by the usual anomalous Hall response as it will be overshadowed by the bulk contribution. Here, we show that those gaps at different chemical potential can be probed by optical excitation.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic gate-controlled quantum interference in a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas at the (La$_{0.3}$Sr$_{0.7}$)(Al$_{0.65}$Ta$_{0.35}$)O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report quantum oscillations in magnetoresistance that are periodic in magnetic field ($B$), observed at the interface between (La$_{0.3}$Sr$_{0.7}$)(Al$_{0.65}$Ta$_{0.35}$)O$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$. Unlike Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, which appear at magnetic fields $ &gt; 7$ T and diminish quickly as the temperature rises, these $B$-periodic oscillations emerge at low fields and persist up to 10 K. Their amplitude decays exponentially with both temperature and field, specifying dephasing of quantum interference. Increasing the carrier density through electrostatic gating results in a systematic reduction in both the amplitude and frequency of the oscillations, with complete suppression beyond a certain gate voltage. We attribute these oscillations to the Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak effect, likely arising from naturally formed closed-loop paths due to the interconnected quasi-one-dimensional conduction channels along SrTiO$_3$ domain walls. The relatively long phase coherence length ($\sim$ 1.8 $\mu$m at 0.1 K), estimated from the oscillation amplitude, highlights the potential of complex oxide interfaces as a promising platform for exploring quantum interference effects and advancing device concepts in quantum technologies, such as mesoscopic interferometers and quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Automated Charge Transition Detection in Quantum Dot Charge Stability Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots require an appropriate number of electrons to function as qubits. The number of electrons is usually tuned by analyzing charge stability diagrams, in which charge transitions manifest as edges. Therefore, to fully automate qubit tuning, it is necessary to recognize these edges automatically and reliably. This paper investigates possible detection methods, describes their training with simulated data from the SimCATS framework, and performs a quantitative comparison with a future hardware implementation in mind. Furthermore, we investigated the quality of the optimized approaches on experimentally measured data from a GaAs and a SiGe qubit sample.</description>

      <title>Interlayer exciton condensates between second Landau level orbitals in double bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Coulomb-drag measurements on a heterostructure comprising two Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) sheets separated by a 2.5 nm hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) spacer in the quantum Hall (QH) regime. Using top and bottom gate control, together with an interlayer bias, we independently tune the two BLG layers into either the lowest (N = 0) or second (N = 1) Landau level (LL) orbital and probe their interlayer QH states. When both layers occupy the N = 0 orbital, we observe both interlayer exciton condensates (ECs) at integer total filling and interlayer fractional QH states, echoing the results in double monolayer graphene. In contrast to previous studies, however, when both BLG layers occupy the N = 1 orbital, we also observe quantized drag signals, signifying an interlayer exciton condensate formed between the second LLs. By tuning the layer degree of freedom, we find that this N = 1 EC state arises only when the N = 1 wavefunction in each BLG is polarized toward the hBN interface to maximize the interlayer Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>Spin ladder quantum simulators from spin-orbit-coupled quantum dot spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent Ge hole spin qubit experiments, we construct and study a two-leg spin ladder from a quantum dot array with spin-orbit couplings (SOCs), aiming to uncover the many-body phase diagrams and provide concrete guidance for the Ge hole spin qubit experiments. The spin ladder is described by an unprecedented, complex spin Hamiltonian, which contains antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), and anisotropic exchange interactions. We analyze the spin ladder Hamiltonian in two complementary situations, the strong rung coupling limit and the weak rung coupling limit. In the strong rung coupling limit, we systematically construct effective spin-1/2 chain models, connecting the well-studied one-dimensional spin models and providing a recipe for Hamiltonian engineering. It is worth emphasizing that effective DM interactions can be completely turned off while the microscopic DM interactions are generically inevitable. Moreover, the staggered DM interactions, which are not possible in the microscopic spin model, can also be realized in the effective spin-1/2 model. In the weak rung coupling limit, we employ Abelian bosonization and Luther-Emery fermionization, uncovering a multitude of phases. Several commensurate-incommensurate transitions are driven by both the longitudinal magnetic field and the DM interactions in the legs (chains). Remarkably, the low-energy phase diagrams show strong dependence in the DM interaction, providing a concrete way to identify the strength of SOC in the experiments. Our work bridges quantum many-body theory and spin qubit device physics, establishing spin ladders made of spin-orbit-coupled quantum dots as a promising platform for engineering exotic spin models, constructing quantum many-body states, and enabling programmable quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Emergence of distinct relaxation behaviour and Quantum Regression Theorem in the Ultra-strong Coupling Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of open quantum systems, we derive the dynamical equation governing two-time correlation functions in the ultra-strong coupling (USC) regime between the system and its environment. Unlike the case of the standard weak-coupling regime, in the USC case, we find distinct relaxation behavior for two-time correlators depending on the types of the operators involved in the correlation function. Interestingly, the Quantum Regression Theorem (QRT) emerges after the fastest relaxation time-scale, which is governed by the system-bath coupling strength. We exemplify our findings for the dissipative spin-boson model and further find excellent agreement with the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method.</description>

      <title>Single-gate, multipartite entanglement on a room-temperature quantum register</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is an essential aspect of quantum systems, needed to execute quantum algorithms, implement error correction, and achieve quantum-enhanced sensing. In solid-state quantum registers such nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, entangled states are typically created using sequential, pairwise gates between the central electron and individual nuclear qubits. This sequential approach is slow and suffers from crosstalk errors. Here, we demonstrate a parallelized multi-qubit entangling gate to generate a four-qubit GHZ state using a room-temperature NV center in only 14.8 $\mu$s $-$ 10 times faster than using sequences of two-qubit gates. The entangled states are verified by measuring multiple quantum coherences. Two-qubit entangling gates have an average fidelity of 0.96(1), and the four-qubit parallel gate has a fidelity of 0.92(4), whereas the sequential four-qubit gate fidelity is only 0.69(3). The approach is generalizable to other solid-state platforms, and it lays the foundation for scalable generation and control of entanglement in practical devices.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-Vacancy Emission from Nanodiamonds: Size, Depth, and Surroundings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a leading solid-state quantum emitter, offering spin-photon interfaces over a wide temperature range with applications from electromagnetic sensing to bioimaging. While NV centers in bulk diamond are well understood, embedding them in nanodiamonds (NDs) introduces complexities from size, geometry, and surface effects. NVs in NDs show altered fluorescence properties including longer lifetimes, lower quantum efficiency, and higher sensitivity to dielectric surroundings, which arise from radiative suppression, surface-induced non-radiative decay, and total internal reflection. Prior models typically addressed isolated aspects, such as dielectric contrast or surface quenching, without integrating full quantum-optical NV behavior with classical electrodynamics. We present a hybrid framework coupling rigorous electromagnetic simulations with a quantum-optical NV model including phonon sideband dynamics. NV emission is found to depend strongly on ND size, NV position, and surrounding refractive index. Our results explain observations such as shallow NVs in water-coated NDs appearing brighter than deeper ones in air and provide a unified framework for realistic emission scenarios. Unlike previous models, our approach predicts wavelength-dependent escape efficiencies and position-dependent variations. This integrated model informs the design of brighter NV-based sensors and quantum devices, advancing understanding of quantum emitter photophysics in nanoscale dielectrics.</description>

      <title>Momentum-Resolved Relaxation-Time Approach for Size-Dependent Conductivity in Anisotropic Metallic Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shrinking CMOS interconnect dimensions to the nanometer scale intensifies electron scattering at surfaces, interfaces, and grain boundaries, causing severe conductivity loss and challenging copper-based designs. Here we present a momentum-resolved relaxation time framework that integrates density functional theory with the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation to predict size-dependent resistivity in metallic thin films. Electron phonon interactions are computed from first principles, and anisotropic surface and grain boundary scattering is captured through a momentum dependent mean free path, allowing relaxation times to vary spatially and directionally without empirical fitting. Applied to isotropic (Cu, Ag, Au) and anisotropic (W, Ti$_2$GeC) metals, the model achieves excellent agreement with experiments and uncovers the critical role of crystallographic anisotropy in transport. We further identify layered MAX phase compounds as promising ultrathin interconnects. This work provides a predictive, physically rigorous, and computationally efficient route to designing high-performance conductors for next generation nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Unveiling orbital optical chirality through multipolar chiral light-matter interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral light-matter interactions have traditionally been understood in terms of electric-magnetic dipolar interference driven by light with spin angular momentum. Here, we show that optical chirality can also originate from the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, giving rise to higher-order multipolar chiral responses. Using a twisted gold nanorod dimer and tightly focused circularly polarized optical vortex beams carrying spin and orbital angular momenta of the same sign, we measure spectrally and spatially resolved chiral dichroism signals that persist even where spin optical chirality vanishes, revealing a quadrupole-mediated chiral interaction driven by OAM. The spectra reveal clear quadrupole resonances whose spectral profile is strongly modulated by the OAM sign, demonstrating an OAM-driven chiral interaction. Crucially, the signal satisfies optical reciprocity, ruling out artefacts from anisotropy or misalignment and confirming its nature as a true chiral response. Angular momentum dissipation analysis further shows that orbital contributions dominate over spin. These findings establish the existence of a distinct form of optical chirality, referred to as orbital optical chirality, which opens new avenues for probing and controlling multipolar chiral light-matter interactions beyond the dipolar paradigm.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Control of Interlayer Excitons in 3R-MoS$_{2}$ / MoSe$_{2}$ Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures, constructed by stacking two-dimensional materials, have enabled the study of interlayer coupling between different materials. One example is the formation of interlayer excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures. The integration of 2D sliding ferroelectric materials introduces new opportunities for manipulating excitonic properties in these systems. In this work, we investigate the interaction between interlayer excitons and ferroelectric domains in hBN-encapsulated 3R-MoS$_2$/MoSe$_2$ heterostructures, combining photoluminescence experiments with density functional theory and many-body calculations. Photoluminescence spectroscopy at low temperature reveals a strong redshift of the interlayer exciton energy with increasing MoS$_2$ layer thickness, attributed to band renormalization and dielectric environment changes. Additionally, local variations in photoluminescence energy correlate with local ferroelectric domain polarization, showcasing distinct domain-dependent interlayer exciton behavior. Gate voltage experiments further demonstrate tunable shifts in interlayer exciton energy, driven by switching ferroelectric domains. These results highlight the potential of interlayer excitons being controlled by local ferroelectric polarization and establish a foundation for future ferroelectric optoelectronic devices based on van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic exciton-polaritons reveal non-Hermitian topology in van der Waals materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological band theory has expanded into various domains in applied physics, offering significant potential for future technologies. Recent developments indicate that unique bulk band topology perceived for electrons can be realized in a system of light-matter quasiparticles with reduced crystal symmetry utilizing tunable light-matter interaction. In this work we realize topologically non-trivial energy band dispersion of exciton-polaritons confined in two-dimensional anisotropic materials inside an optical microcavity, and show the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) due to non-Hermitian topology arising from excitonic dipole oscillators with finite quasiparticle lifetime. Fourier-plane imaging reveals two pairs of EPs connected by bulk Fermi arcs for each of the transverse electric and magnetic polarized modes. An anisotropic Lorentz oscillator model captures the exact band dispersion observed in our experiment in two-dimensional momentum space. Our findings establish anisotropic two-dimensional materials as a platform for exploring non-Hermitian topological physics, with implications for polarization-controlled optical technologies.</description>

      <title>A unified realization of electrical quantities from the quantum International System of Units</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the revised International System of Units (SI), the ohm and the volt are realized from the von Klitzing constant and the Josephson constant, and a practical realization of the ampere is possible by applying Ohm's law directly to the quantum Hall and Josephson effects. As a result, it is possible to create an instrument capable of realizing all three primary electrical units, but the development of such a system remains challenging. Here we report a unified realization of the volt, ohm, and ampere by integrating a quantum anomalous Hall resistor (QAHR) and a programmable Josephson voltage standard (PJVS) in a single cryostat. Our system has a quantum voltage output that ranges from 0.24 mV to 6.5 mV with combined relative uncertainties down to 3 $\mu$V/V. The QAHR provides a realization of the ohm at zero magnetic field with uncertainties near 1 $\mu\Omega$/$\Omega$. We use the QAHR to convert a longitudinal current to a quantized Hall voltage and then directly compare that against the PJVS to realize the ampere. We determine currents in the range of 9.33 nA to 252 nA, and our lowest uncertainty is 4.3 $\mu$A/A at 83.9 nA. For other current values, a systematic error that ranges from -10 $\mu$A/A to -30 $\mu$A/A is present due to the imperfect isolation of the PJVS microwave bias.</description>

      <title>Quarter- and half-filled quantum Hall states and their topological orders revealed by daughter states in bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states are promising candidates for fault-tolerant quantum computing due to their underlying non-Abelian topological orders. However, the topological order of these states remains hotly debated. Here, we report transport measurements on ultra-clean bilayer graphene heterostructures, where we observed four quarter-filled states and their corresponding Levin-Halperin daughter states, constraining their topological order. Moreover, we complete the sequence of half-filled plateaus by detecting states at v=-3/2 and v=1/2 whose daughters suggest an alternating sequence of non-Abelian orders. This pattern suggests a universal origin supporting their use in identifying topological order at even-denominator fillings, though further confirmation is needed via direct measurements. The observed quarter- and half-filled states appear in N=0 and N=1 Landau levels, respectively, and thus highlight a competition between interactions favoring paired states of either four- or two-flux composite fermions. Additionally, we observe several 'next-generation' quantum Hall states that require strong interactions between composite fermions.</description>

Abstract: The LnSbTe (Ln = Lanthanides) family, like isostructural ZrSiS type compounds, has emerged as a fertile playground for exploring the interaction of electronic correlations and magnetic ordering with the nodal line band topology. Here, we report a detailed electronic band structure investigation of TbSbTe, corroborated by electrical transport, thermodynamic, and magnetic studies. Temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility and thermodynamic transport studies indicate the onset of antiferromagnetic ordering below TN = 5.1 K. The electronic band structure study, carried out with high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements aided with density functional theory based first-principles calculations reveals presence of nodal lines in the GammaX high symmetry direction, forming a diamond-shaped nodal plane around Gamma high symmetry point. A strongly photon energy dependent nodal feature located at the X point of the surface Brillouin zone, indicating an extended nodal line along X R direction, is also observed. This study elucidates the intricate interplay among symmetry-protected band characteristics, the influence of spin orbit coupling, magnetism, and topological properties.</description>

Abstract: Anyons are quasiparticles with fractional statistics, bridging between fermions and bosons. We propose an experimental setup to measure the statistical angle of topological anyons emitted from a quantum point contact (QPC) source. The setup involves an droplet along a fractional quantum Hall liquid edge, formed by defining a droplet with two negatively biased gates. In the weak tunneling regime, we calculate the charge current, showing its time evolution depends solely on the anyons' statistical properties, with temperature and scaling dimension affecting only the constant prefactor. We compute the cross-correlation between the anyon current transmitted from the source and the current after the junction, providing a direct method to detect anyon braiding statistics.</description>

Abstract: Using an S-matrix formulation we evaluate the conductance of a one dimensional free electron gas in double exchange interaction with a classical conical magnet. We find integer conductance steps depending on the energy window of the incoming electrons for conical magnets described by a fictitious magnetic field of different orientations and modulated profile. The conductance windows, that we attribute to potential or diffractive scattering, are characterised by spin selectivity depending on the fictitious magnetic field direction and chirality.</description>

      <title>Combined tight-binding and configuration interaction study of unfolded electronic structure of G-color center in Si</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have theoretically studied the G-center in bulk silicon material using the empirical tight-binding model for calculations of unfolded band structures with configuration interaction correction for the exciton at $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone. The G-center in B configuration (emissive) being a candidate structure as the telecom single- and entangled-photon source has two substitutional carbons and one interstitial atom embedded into the bulk in six equally possible configurations. Taking the advantage of the low computation effort of the tight-binding and unfolding approach, it is possible to calculate and analyze the behavior of a variety of the electronic configurations. Our tight-binding model is able to describe not only the behavior of the G-center in the silicon bulk but using the unfolding approach it can also pinpoint the contributions of different elements of the supercell on the final pseudo-band structure. Moreover, the configuration interaction correction with single-particle basis states computed by our unfolded tight-binding model predicts a very small fine-structure splitting of the ground state exciton both for bright and dark doublet in the studied system. That underscores the possibility of the silicon G-center to become a very good emitter of single and entangled photons for quantum communication and computation applications.</description>

Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by the boundary-localized eigenstates under open boundary conditions, has revealed the breakdown of Bloch band theory in non-Hermitian lattices. While one-dimensional non-Hermitian bands are well-described by the non-Bloch band theory, its extension to higher dimensions is challenged by the geometry-dependent skin effect (GDSE), where the energy spectra and the boundary localization of the eigenstates depend on the system's geometry. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a universal theoretical framework based on the strip generalized Brillouin zone (SGBZ). Our framework provides a systematic description of the GDSE, explains its origin through the competition between incompatible SGBZs, and provides for the first time a clear criterion for its emergence. We also unify our SGBZ framework with the Amoeba formulation by showing that the Amoeba spectrum is the superset of all possible SGBZ spectra, thereby clarifying its domain of validity. This work establishes a foundation for studying higher-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, paving the way for the future investigation of novel higher-dimensional non-Hermitian physics, such as hybrid skin-topological effects and non-Hermitian Chern bands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in orbitronics, the influence of disorder on the orbital Hall effect and orbital relaxation mechanisms remains poorly understood. In this work, we numerically investigate the role of disorder in orbital transport within mesoscopic devices using a real-space tight-binding model on a two-dimensional square lattice that hosts atomic orbitals capable of carrying atomic orbital angular momentum. By considering devices with varying geometries--square and rectangular--and systematically tuning disorder strength, we examine the disorder effect on orbital Hall current (OHC) generation, and orbital relaxation. Our results reveal a strong dependence of the OHC and orbital Hall angle on disorder strength. In square devices, we demonstrate that the orbital Hall response can be strongly enhanced by disorder and its dependence on the disorder strength indicates the dominance of skew-scattering mechanism in the diffusive regime. In rectangular geometries, the orbital current decays exponentially with increasing device width, from which the orbital relaxation length is extracted. These findings provide critical insights into disorder-driven orbital transport phenomena and lay the foundation for designing next-generation orbitronic devices.</description>

Abstract: The shift from two- to three-dimensional structures is not only a prominent trend in nanomagnetism but also reflects a broader movement across nanotechnology as a whole. Fields such as nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, data storage are poised to benefit from a new generation of greener, more versatile and multifunctional technologies enabled by this transition to 3D structures. While significant challenges remain, recent progress in bottom-up lithography, advanced microscopy, and computational techniques has made the future realization of these advancements increasingly feasible. Focused electron beam-induced deposition, is a cutting-edge direct-write nanofabrication technique used to manipulate matter at the nanoscale, combined with the unique magnetic properties of nanomaterials. It has gained significant attention in recent decades due to its potential applications in magnetic memories, such as racetrack memory. Consequently, substantial efforts have been directed toward developing nanofabrication techniques and characterizing magnetic nanoelements of various metal depositions. In our work, Fe-based nanostructures have been fabricated precisely using iron pentacarbonyl as a precursor. These structures include nanowires, 5-um bridges, rings, tetrapods, spirals and flower-like nanostructures. The deposition parameters, including electron beam dwell time, beam current, and precursor flux, have been further refined, have been further refined, enabling the precise fabrication of complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Classical-to-Quantum Crossover in 2D TMD Field-Effect Transistors: A First-Principles Study via Sub-10 nm Channel Scaling Beyond the Boltzmann Tyranny</title>

Abstract: Scaling field-effect transistors (FETs) into the sub-10 nm regime fundamentally alters electronic transport mechanisms, challenging the conventional design rules that have underpinned semiconductor technology for decades. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of 2D TMD nanojunctions with channel lengths from 12 down to 3 nm, using first-principles calculations that integrate the nonequilibrium Green function formalism implemented in density functional theory (NEGF-DFT) and an effective gate model. Our simulations reveal a pronounced crossover from semiclassical thermionic emission to quantum tunnelling, governed by two characteristic temperatures: $T_c$, marking the onset of thermionic-dominated transport, and $T_t$, above which the subthreshold swing saturates at the Boltzmann limit scaled by the gate-control efficiency factor. Longer channels enter the classical regime at much lower temperatures, where thermionic emission dominates, and perfect contact with S.S. approaches the Boltzmann Tyranny scaled by the gate controlling efficiency. The shortest 3 nm junction exhibits pronounced quantum tunneling up to 500 K and achieves a subthreshold swing superior to the physical limit of transistors, known as the Boltzmann Tyranny, enabled by the steep energy dependence of the transmission coefficient. This study provides a theoretical prediction of the transition from classical to quantum transport in sub-10 nm 2D TMD transistors, identifying critical temperatures that define the boundary between these regimes and offering key design insights for harnessing quantum and classical hybrid transistor technology.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot Magnetization Reversal in Ferromagnetic Spin Valves Enabled via Heat Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study laser induced ultrafast magnetization reversal in a ferromagnetic spin valve by comparing the effects of direct laser excitation and ultrashort hot electron pulses. A wedged Cu layer is deposited atop the spin valve to tune energy transmission to the magnetic stack for both optical and hot-electron excitation. We demonstrate single shot magnetization reversal of the free layer using hot electron pulses. Moreover, such reversal is achieved even with picosecond laser pulses. The influence of laser fluence, Cu thickness ($t_{\mathrm{Cu}}$), and pulse duration is investigated in detail. Our results indicate that the key factor enabling magnetization reversal is full demagnetization of the free layer, driven by a rapid rise in its electronic temperature achieved via either direct laser or hot electron excitation. This work advances the understanding of ultrafast magnetization reversal via nonlocal heat and spin transport under strongly out of equilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>Stern-Gerlach deflection of cryogenically cold polyatomic molecules in superfluid nanodroplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beam deflection is capable of providing valuable information about the magnetic moments of molecules and clusters as well as the relaxation dynamics of their spins. However, observations have been hampered by magnetic couplings to excited vibrational and rotational states of polyatomic systems, which are challenging to control, characterize, and systematize. In this work, we carried out deflection measurements on superfluid helium nanodroplets doped with high-spin FeCl2 and CoCl2 molecules and their complexes. This enabled quantitative determination of the magnetic moments of molecules and clusters at extremely low, and fully defined, temperature of all of their degrees of freedom. The spin magnetic moments become thermalized and oriented along the applied field. Dimers and trimers are found to be antiferromagnetically ordered. The issue of rates and mechanisms of molecular spin relaxation within the cryogenic helium matrix is highlighted.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependent Mechanical and Structural Properties of Uniaxially Strained Planar Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations in a planar graphene sheet, we investigate the temperature dependence of its mechanical behavior under uniaxial tensile stress applied either along the armchair or the zigzag direction. Stress-strain curves are calculated for different temperatures and the corresponding dependence of various elastic parameters, like the Young modulus, the third-order elastic modulus, the tensile strength and failure strain, is presented. Fracture stress and strain, as well as the Young modulus, decrease almost linearly with temperature. The distributions of bond lengths and bond angles at different strains and temperatures are also discussed and approximate analytical expressions are presented. The latter describe accurately the numerically obtained distributions.</description>

      <title>A spin-embedded diamond optomechanical resonator with mechanical quality factor exceeding one million</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diamond optomechanical crystal (OMC) devices with embedded color center spins are promising platforms for a broad range of applications in quantum sensing, networking, and computing applications, offering an interface between a GHz-frequency mechanical mode and both optical photons and coherent spins. A crucial but elusive step towards realizing this platform is to engineer a device with a high-quality factor mechanical mode while preserving the bulk-like coherence of embedded spins. Here we demonstrate sideband-resolved diamond OMCs with mechanical quality factors in excess of $10^6$ at cryogenic temperatures, and find coherence times up to $T_2$ = 270 $\mu$s for embedded nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. Furthermore, we measure these devices across five orders of magnitude in intracavity optical power, demonstrating robust power handling and a high optomechanical cooperativity ($C\gg1$) at cryogenic temperatures that is essential for a broad range of quantum protocols requiring strong, coherent interactions between photons and phonons. These results are enabled by a robust, high-throughput method for forming single-crystal diamond membranes in combination with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond overgrowth with nitrogen $\delta$-doping. We discuss the prospects of this platform for hybrid spin-mechanical devices in the quantum regime.</description>
