      <title>Topology reconstruction for asymmetric systems by isomorphic mapping or perturbation approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The systems without symmetries, e.g. the internal or spatial symmetry, are generally thought to be improper for topological study and no conventional integral topological invariant can be well defined. In this work, with multi-band asymmetric Rice-Mele-like systems as examples, we show that the topology of all gaps can be reconstructed by two general methods and a new integral topological invariant, i.e. the renormalized real-space winding number, can properly characterise the topology of such systems. For the first method, an isomorphic mapping relationship between a Rice-Mele-like system and its chiral counterpart is constructed, which accounts for the topology reconstruction at half-filling gaps. For the second method, the Hilbert space of asymmetric systems could be reduced into degenerate subspaces by perturbation approximation, so that the topology in subspaces accounts for the topology reconstruction at fractional-filling gaps. The perturbation-based topology exhibits extraordinary robustness since it even exists beyond the weak perturbation limit. We also show that both methods can be widely used for other asymmetric systems, e.g. the two-dimensional (2D) Rice-Mele systems and the superconductor systems. At last, for the asymmetric photonic systems, we predict different topological edge states by our topology-reconstruction theory and experimentally observe them in the laboratory, which agree with each other very well. Our findings open a door for investigating new topological phenomena in asymmetric systems by various topological reconstruction methods which should greatly expand the category of topology study.</description>

      <title>A modified interferometer to measure anyonic braiding statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing quantum Hall interferometers measure twice the braiding phase, $e^{i2\theta}$, of Abelian anyons, i.e. the phase accrued when one quasi-particle encircles another clockwise. We propose a modified Fabry-P\'{e}rot or Mach-Zehnder interferometer that can measure $e^{i\theta}$.</description>

      <title>Halperin States of Particles and Holes in Ideal Time Reversal Invariant Pairs of Chern Bands and The Fractional Quantum Spin Hall Effect in Moir\'e MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An experiment in moir\'e MoTe$_2$ bilayers reported the first observation of a topologically ordered state with zero Hall conductivity and half of the edge conductance of a standard time-reversal invariant quantum spin Hall insulator. This state is believed to emerge at total filling one of a pair of bands with Chern numbers $C=\pm1$ related by time reversal symmetry. By viewing these bands as a pair of Landau levels with opposite magnetic fields, and starting from a parent magnet with one filled band, we demonstrate that a class of Halperin states constructed by adding particles to the empty Chern band and holes to the occupied Chern band have all the properties observed in MoTe$_2$. Remarkably, these states break time-reversal symmetry but have exactly zero Hall conductivity and helical edge conductance of $e^2/2h$. These states also feature a spinless composite fermion with the same charge as the electron but split equally between both valleys. In a standard Halperin 331 state, this particle would be a neutral Bogoliubov composite fermion. However, in our context this composite fermion is charged but remains itinerant because it is split into the two valleys that effectively experience opposite magnetic fields. The existence of such charged itinerant particles is a key difference between Landau levels with opposite magnetic fields and standard multi-components Landau levels, where all the itinerant particles are charge neutral, such as the magneto-roton of the Laughlin state or the Bogoliubov composite fermion of the Moore-Read state. When the electron density changes away from the ideal filling and these itinerant charged particles are added to the parent state, the disorder potential is less efficient at localizing them as compared to standard Lanadau levels. This can explain why the state in MoTe$_2$ did not display a robust Hall plateau upon changing the electron density.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Dirac feature in the Metallated Carbyne as a Potential Platform for Exploring Widely Separated Majorana Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of next-generation quantum computing devices is hindered by the formidable challenge of detecting and manipulating Majorana Fermion in nanomaterials. In this study, we explore a new approach of detecting Majorana Fermion in a metallated carbyne nanowire array. Through comprehensive optimizations, we successfully achieved a local magnetic moment exceeding 3{\mu}B, with the average magnetic moment of the entire metallated carbyne surpassing 1{\mu}B. Surprisingly, in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, the ferromagnetic Ru metallated carbyne, when coupled with a superconducting Ru substrate, is already able to demonstrate the symmetric opening of a Dirac gap at the gamma point. We discovered that the kink structure of the metallated carbyne plays a crucial role in modulating its topological properties. Moreover, we identified the origin of magnetic hybridization which is intricately linked to the distinctive features found in one-dimensional carbon structures. Our findings not only uncover the unconventional ferromagnetism observed in metallated carbyne but also present an exciting opportunity to realize carbon-based materials capable of hosting Majorana Zero Modes (MZM). This discovery has the potential to further stabilize MZM by decoupling the orbital perturbation from the MZM itself.</description>

      <title>Photocurrent generation in solids via linearly polarized laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To add to the rapidly progressing field of ultrafast photocurrent, we propose a universal method to generate photocurrent in normal and topological materials using a pair of multicycle linearly polarized laser pulses. The interplay of the fundamental and its second harmonic pulses is studied for the generation of photocurrent in Weyl semimetals by varying the angle between the polarization direction, relative intensity, and relative phase delay. It has been found that the presence of a comparatively weaker second harmonic pulse is sufficient to generate substantial photocurrent. Moreover, significant photocurrent is generated even when polarization directions are orthogonal for certain ratios of the lasers' intensities. In addition, the photocurrent is found to be susceptible to the delay between the two pulses. We have illustrated that all our findings are extendable to non-topological and two-dimensional materials, such as graphene and molybdenum disulfide.</description>

      <title>A two-scale effective model for defect-induced localization transitions in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We illuminate the fundamental mechanism responsible for the transition between the non-Hermitian skin effect and defect-induced localization in the bulk. We study a Hamiltonian with non-reciprocal couplings that exhibits the skin effect (the localization of all eigenvectors at one edge) and add an on-site defect in the center. Using a two-scale asymptotic method, we characterize the long-scale growth and decay of the eigenvectors and derive a simple and intuitive effective model for the transition that occurs when the defect is sufficiently large that one of the modes is localized at the defect site, rather than at the edge of the system.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the dynamics of magnetization in topological insulator-ferromagnet heterostructures via spin-orbit torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling stands as a pivotal determinant in the realm of condensed matter physics. In recent, its profound influence on spin dynamics opens up a captivating arena with promising applications. Notably, the topological insulator-ferromagnet heterostructure has been recognized for inducing spin dynamics through applied current, driven by spin-orbit torque. Building upon recent observations revealing spin flip signals within this heterostructure, our study elucidates the conditions governing spin flips by studying the magnetization dynamics. We establish that the interplay between spin-anisotropy and spin-orbit torque plays a crucial role in shaping the physics of magnetization dynamics within the heterostructure. Furthermore, we categorize various modes of magnetization dynamics, constructing a comprehensive phase diagram across distinct energy scales, damping constants, and applied frequencies. This research not only offers insights into controlling spin direction but also charts a new pathway to the practical application of spin-orbit coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Acoustoelectric non-local spin wave power detector for studying magnon-phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a simple detection scheme to study spin waves excited by surface acoustic wave (SAW) in ferromagnetic thin films. Metallic antennas made of Ta and a ferromagnetic element are placed along the SAW propagation path. The SAW excites spin waves in the ferromagnetic element and induces acoustoelectric current in the antennas, which are detected as a DC voltage. The DC voltage takes an extremum at the spin wave resonance condition, which demonstrates that the antenna acts as a non-local spin wave detector. The antennas placed before and after the ferromagnetic element along the SAW propagation path can probe spin wave excitation from reflected and transmitted SAWs, respectively. Interestingly, we find characteristics of spin wave excitations that are different for the reflected and transmitted SAWs: the former excites spin waves with larger frequency with broader linewidth compared to the latter. The results show that the antennas act as a non-local spin wave power detector and can be used to map out the spin wave spectra in a unique way, providing insights into the magnon-phonon coupling in magnetic nanostructures fabricated on phononic SAW devices.</description>

      <title>Electrical readout of spins in the absence of spin blockade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In semiconductor nanostructures, spin blockade (SB) is the most scalable mechanism for electrical spin readout requiring only two bound spins for its implementation which, in conjunction with charge sensing techniques, has led to high-fidelity readout of spins in semiconductor-based quantum processors. However, various mechanisms may lift SB, such as strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or low-lying excited states, hence posing challenges to perform spin readout at scale and with high fidelity in such systems. Here, we present a method, based on the dependence of the two-spin system polarizability on energy detuning, to perform spin state readout even when SB lifting mechanisms are dominant. It leverages SB lifting as a resource to detect different spin measurement outcomes selectively and positively. We demonstrate the method using a hybrid system formed by a quantum dot (QD) and a Boron acceptor in a silicon p-type transistor and show spin selective and positive readout of different spin states under SB lifting conditions due to (i) SOC and (ii) low-lying orbital states in the QD. We further use the method to determine the detuning-dependent spin relaxation time of 0.1-8~$\mu$s. Our method should help perform high-fidelity projective spin measurements in systems subject to strong SOC and may facilitate quantum tomography and state leakage studies.</description>

      <title>Automated Tabletop Exfoliation and Identification of Monolayer Graphene Flakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of graphene, one of the most-studied materials in condensed matter physics due to its singular mechanical, optical, and electronic properties, was enabled by manual ``Scotch Tape'' exfoliation. Nearly two decades later, this method is still widely used to obtain chemically-pristine flakes of graphene and other 2D van der Waals materials. Unfortunately, the yield of large, pristine flakes with uniform thickness is inconsistent. Thus, significant time and effort are required to exfoliate and locate flakes suitable for fabricating multilayer van der Waals heterostructures. Here, we describe a relatively affordable tabletop device (the ''eXfoliator'') that can reproducibly control key parameters and largely automate the exfoliation process. In a typical exfoliation run, the eXfoliator produces 3 or more large ($\ge400\ \mu$m$^2$) high-quality monolayers, allowing new users to produce large pristine graphene monolayers at a rate comparable to manual exfoliation by an experienced user. We use an automated mapping system and computer vision algorithm to locate candidate flakes.</description>

      <title>Probing the Fermi surface with Quantum Oscillation Measurements in the Dirac semimetal TaNiTe$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a detailed investigation of the Fermi surface in the layered Dirac semimetal TaNiTe$_5$, which hosts quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) topological electronic properties. We have investigated the magnetoresistance and magnetic behaviour in high-quality TaNiTe$_5$ single crystals. Pronounced Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) and de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations are observed in magnetic fields above 3T and at temperatures of up to 22K. Five fundamental frequencies and light effective quasiparticle masses are obtained by fast Fourier transformation (FFT) and Lifshitz-Kosevich (LK) formula fits. The high resolution of the low-temperature FFT spectra allows us to investigate individual peaks in detail for the magnetic fields applied along all three crystallographic axes and in the a-c plane. The extracted values for the Berry phase of the obtained Fermi pockets approach $\pi$, demonstrating the nontrivial topological electronic properties of layered TaNiTe$_5$. The observed quantum oscillations in the magnetoresistance and magnetization data are consistent with ultra-high mobility Dirac carriers in the conduction band.</description>

      <title>Left-handedness with three zero-absorption windows tuned by the incoherent pumping field and inter-dot tunnelings in a GaAs/AlGaAs triple quantum dots system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Left-handedness with three zero-absorption windows is achieved in a triple-quantum dot (TQD) system. With the typical parameters of a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, the simultaneous negative relative electric permittivity and magnetic permeability are obtained by the adjustable incoherent pumping field and two inter-dot tunnelings. What's more, three zero-absorption windows in the left-handedness frequency bands are observed in the TQD system. The left-handedness with zero-absorption in solid state heterostructure may solve not only the challenge in the photonic resonant scheme for left-handed materials (LHMs) but also the application limitation of the negative refractive materials with large amount of absorption.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of ferroelectric behavior in few-layer materials, accompanied by the observation of antipolar domains in hexagonal boron nitride and transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e bilayers, is paving the way for revolutionary advancements in the generation and manipulation of intrinsic electric dipoles through stacking. In addition, these cutting-edge quantum materials are reshaping our comprehension of phase transitions. Within the present study, we unveil a hitherto unreported size-dependent sliding behavior that marks a significant departure from conventional ferroelectrics. We also shed light on thermally induced spontaneous hyperlubric sliding within moir\'e bilayers, which can be used as a signal to distinguish topological phase transitions from an antipolar onto a ferroelectric bilayer. Our findings also suggest that the (topological) pinning of AA nodes in antipolar moir\'e homobilayers prevents the occurrence of an antipolar-to-paraelectric transformation.</description>

      <title>Wigner-molecule supercrystal in transition-metal dichalcogenide moir\'e superlattices: Lessons from the bottom-up approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The few-body problem for $N=4$ fermionic charge carriers in a double-well moir\'{e} quantum dot (MQD), representing the first step in a bottom-up strategy to investigate formation of molecular supercrystals in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\'e superlattices with integral fillings, $\nu &gt; 1$, is solved exactly by employing large-scale exact-diagonalization via full configuration interaction (FCI) computations. A comparative analysis with the mean-field solutions of the often used spin-and-space unrestricted Hartree Fock (sS-UHF) demonstrates the limitations of the UHF method (by itself) to provide a proper description of the influence of the interdot Coulomb interaction. In particular, it is explicitly shown for $\nu=2$ that the exact charge densities (CDs) within each MQD retain the ring-like shape characteristic (for a wide range of relevant parameters) of a fully isolated MQD, as was found for sliding Wigner molecules (WMs). This deeply quantum-mechanical behavior contrasts sharply with the UHF CDs that portray solely orientationally pinned and well localized dumbbell dimers. An improved CD, which agrees with the FCI-calculated one, derived from the restoration of the sS-UHF broken parity symmetries is further introduced, suggesting a beyond-mean-field methodological roadmap for correcting the sS-UHF results. It is conjectured that the conclusions for the $\nu=2$ moir\'e TMD superlattice case extend to all cases with integral fillings that are associated with sliding WMs in isolated MQDs. The case of $\nu=3$, associated with a pinned WM in isolated MQDs, is an exception.</description>

      <title>Interfacing Quantum Spin Hall and Quantum Anomalous Hall insulators: Bi bilayer on MnBi$_2$Te$_4$-family materials</title>

Abstract: Meeting of non-trivial topology with magnetism results in novel phases of matter, such as Quantum Anomalous Hall (QAH) or axion insulator phases. Even more exotic states with high and tunable Chern numbers are expected at the contact of intrinsic magnetic topological insulators (IMTIs) and 2D topological insulators (TIs).Here we synthesize a heterostructures composed of 2D TI and 3D IMTIs, specifically of bismuth bilayer on top of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$-family of compounds and study their electronic properties by means of angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT). The epitaxial interface is characterized by hybridized Bi and IMTI electronic states. The Bi bilayer-derived states on different members of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$-family of materials are similar, except in the region of mixing with the topological surface states of the substrate. In that region, the new, substrate dependent interface Dirac state is observed. Our \emph{ab initio} calculations show rich interface phases with emergence of exchange split 1D edge states, making the Bi/IMTI heterostructures promising playground for observation of novel members in the family of quantum Hall effects.</description>

Abstract: The growth in data generation necessitates efficient data processing technologies to address the von Neumann bottleneck in conventional computer architecture. Memory-driven computing, which integrates non-volatile memory (NVM) devices in a 3D stack, is gaining attention, with CMOS back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible ferroelectric (FE) diodes being ideal due to their two-terminal design and inherently selector-free nature, facilitating high-density crossbar arrays. Here, we demonstrate BEOL-compatible, high-performance FE-diodes scaled to 5, 10, and 20 nm FE Al0.72Sc0.28N/Al0.64Sc0.36N films. Through interlayer (IL) engineering, we show substantial improvements in the ON/OFF ratios (&gt;166 times) and rectification ratios (&gt;176 times) in these scaled devices. The superlative characteristics also enables 5-bit multi-state operation with a stable retention. We also experimentally and theoretically demonstrate the counterintuitive result that the inclusion of an IL can lead to a decrease in the ferroelectric switching voltage of the device. An in-depth analysis into the device transport mechanisms is performed, and our compact model aligns seamlessly with the experimental results. Our results suggest the possibility of using scaled AlxSc1-xN FE-diodes for high performance, low-power, embedded NVM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle-hole symmetry and chiral symmetry play a pivotal role in multiple areas of physics, yet they remain un-studied in systems with nonlinear interactions that are beyond Kerr-type. Here, we establish these two non-spatial symmetries in systems with strong and general nonlinear interactions. Chiral symmetry ensures the quantization of the Berry phase of nonlinear normal modes and categorizes the topological phases of nonlinear dynamics. We show edge modes that serve as topologically protected fixed points of chiral-symmetric nonlinear dynamics. Our theoretical framework paves the way towards the topological classification of general nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in synthetic ferrimagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The antisymmetric interlayer exchange interaction, i.e., interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (IL-DMI) has attracted significant interest since this long-range chiral spin interaction provides a new dimension for controlling spin textures and dynamics. However, the role of IL-DMI in the field induced and spin-orbit torque (SOT) induced switching of synthetic ferrimagnets (SFi) has not been uncovered. Here, we exploit interlayer chiral exchange bias fields in SFi to address both the sign and magnitude of the IL-DMI. Depending on the degree of imbalance between the two magnetic moments of the SFi, the amount of asymmetry, addressed via loop shifts of the hysteresis loops under an in-plane field reveals a unidirectional and chiral nature of the IL-DMI. The devices are then tested with SOT switching experiments and the process is examined via both transient state and steady state detection. In addition to field-free SOT switching, we find that the combination of IL-DMI and SOT give rise to multi-resistance states, which provides a possible direction for the future design of neuromorphic computing devices based on SOT. This work is a step towards characterizing and understanding the IL-DMI for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>P-wave pairing near a spin-split Josephson junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity and magnetism are competing effects that can coexist in certain regimes. Their co-existence leads to unexpected new behaviors that include the onset of exotic electron pair mechanisms and topological phases. In this work, we study the properties of a Josephson junction between two spin-split superconductors. The spin-splitting in the superconductors can arise from either the coupling to a ferromagnetic material or an external magnetic field. The properties of the junction are dominated by the Andreev bound states that are also split. One of these states can cross the superconductor's Fermi level, leading to a ground state transition characterized by a suppressed supercurrent. We interpret the supercurrent blockade as coming from a dominance of p-wave pairing close to the junction, where electrons at both sides of the junction pair. To support this interpretation, we analyze the different pairing channels and show that p-wave pairing is favored in the case where the magnetization of the two superconductors is parallel and suppressed in the anti-parallel case. We also analyze the noise spectrum that shows signatures of the ground state transition in the form of an elevated zero-frequency noise.</description>

      <title>Observation of the anomalous Nernst effect in altermagnetic candidate Mn5Si3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The anomalous Nernst effect generates transverse voltage to the applied thermal gradient in magnetically ordered systems. The effect was previously considered excluded in compensated magnetic materials with collinear ordering. However, in the recently identified class of compensated magnetic materials, dubbed altermagnets, time-reversal symmetry breaking in the electronic band structure makes the presence of the anomalous Nernst effect possible despite the collinear spin arrangement. In this work, we investigate epitaxial Mn5Si3 thin films known to be an altermagnetic candidate. We show that the material manifests a sizable anomalous Nernst coefficient despite the small net magnetization of the films. The measured magnitudes of the anomalous Nernst coefficient reach a scale of microVolts per Kelvin. We support our magneto-thermoelectric measurements by density-functional theory calculations of the material's spin-split electronic structure, which allows for the finite Berry curvature in the reciprocal space. Furthermore, we present our calculations of the intrinsic Berry-curvature Nernst conductivity, which agree with our experimental observations.</description>

Abstract: The interplay between superconductivity and the Kondo effect has stimulated significant interest in condensed matter physics. They compete when their critical temperatures are close and can give rise to a quantum phase transition that can mimic Majorana zero modes. Here, we have fabricated and measured Al-InSb nanowire quantum dot-Al devices. In the Kondo regime, a supercurrent- induced zero-bias conductance peak emerges. This zero-bias peak shows an anomalous negative magnetoresistance (NMR) at weak magnetic fields. We attribute this anomalous NMR to quasi- particle trapping at vortices in the superconductor leads as a weak magnetic field is applied. The trapping effect lowers the quasiparticle-caused dissipation and thus enhances the Josephson current. This work connects the vortex physics and the supercurrent tunneling in Kondo regimes and can help further understand the physics of Josephson quantum dot system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.02917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that steady-state expectation values predicted by the universal Lindblad equation (ULE) are accurate up to bounded corrections that scale linearly with the effective system-bath coupling, $\Gamma$ (second order in the microscopic coupling). We also identify a near-identity, quasilocal "memory-dressing" transformation, used during the derivation of the ULE, whose inverse can be applied to achieve relative deviations of observables that generically scale to zero with $\Gamma$, even for nonequilibrium currents whose steady-state values themselves scale to zero with $\Gamma$. This result provides a solution to recently identified limitations on the accuracy of Lindblad equations, which highlighted a potential for significant relative errors in currents of conserved quantities. The transformation we identify allows for high-fidelity computation of currents in the weak-coupling regime, ensuring thermodynamic consistency and local conservation laws, while retaining the stability and physicality of a Lindblad-form master equation.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear and nonreciprocal transport effects in untwinned thin films of ferromagnetic Weyl metal SrRuO$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The identification of distinct charge transport features, deriving from nontrivial bulk band and surface states, has been a challenging subject in the field of topological systems. In topological Dirac and Weyl semimetals, nontrivial conical bands with Fermi-arc surface states give rise to negative longitudinal magnetoresistance due to chiral anomaly effect and unusual thickness dependent quantum oscillation from Weyl-orbit effect, which were demonstrated recently in experiments. In this work, we report the experimental observations of large nonlinear and nonreciprocal transport effects for both longitudinal and transverse channels in an untwinned Weyl metal of SrRuO$_3$ thin film grown on a SrTiO$_{3}$ substrate. From rigorous measurements with bias current applied along various directions with respect to the crystalline principal axes, the magnitude of nonlinear Hall signals from the transverse channel exhibits a simple sin$\alpha$ dependence at low temperatures, where $\alpha$ is the angle between bias current direction and orthorhombic [001]$_{\rm o}$, reaching a maximum when current is along orthorhombic [1-10]$_{\rm o}$. On the contrary, the magnitude of nonlinear and nonreciprocal signals in the longitudinal channel attains a maximum for bias current along [001]$_{\rm o}$, and it vanishes for bias current along [1-10]$_{\rm o}$. The observed $\alpha$-dependent nonlinear and nonreciprocal signals in longitudinal and transverse channels reveal a magnetic Weyl phase with an effective Berry curvature dipole along [1-10]$_{\rm o}$ from surface states, accompanied by 1D chiral edge modes along [001]$_{\rm o}$.</description>

Abstract: We study a dynamical spin response of surface Majorana modes in a topological superconductor-magnet hybrid under microwave irradiation. We find a method to toggle between dissipative and non-dissipative Majorana Ising spin dynamics by adjusting the external magnetic field angle and the microwave frequency. This reflects the topological nature of the Majorana modes, enhancing the Gilbert damping of the magnet, thereby, providing a detection method for the Majorana Ising spins. Our findings illuminate a magnetic probe for Majorana modes, paving the path to innovative spin devices.</description>

Abstract: We propose a practical implementation of a universal quantum computer that uses local fermionic modes (LFM) rather than qubits. The device layout consists of quantum dots tunnel coupled by a hybrid superconducting island and a tunable capacitive coupling between the dots. We show that coherent control of Cooper pair splitting, elastic cotunneling, and Coulomb interactions allows us to implement the universal set of quantum gates defined by Bravyi and Kitaev. Due to the similarity with charge qubits, we expect charge noise to be the main source of decoherence. For this reason, we also consider an alternative design where the quantum dots have tunable coupling to the superconductor. In this second device design, we show that there is a sweetspot for which the local fermionic modes are charge neutral, making the device insensitive to charge noise effects. Finally, we compare both designs and their experimental limitations and suggest future efforts to overcome them.</description>

      <title>Higher-order topological corner and bond-localized modes in magnonic insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a two-dimensional decorated honeycomb lattice framework to realize a second-order topological magnon insulator (SOTMI) phase featuring distinct corner-localized modes. Our study emphasizes the pivotal role of spin-magnon mapping in characterizing bosonic topological properties, which exhibit differences from their fermionic counterparts. We employ a symmetry indicator topological invariant to identify and characterize this SOTMI phase, particularly for systems respecting time-reversal and ${\sf{C}}_6$ rotational symmetry. Using a spin model defined on a honeycomb lattice geometry, we demonstrate that introducing ``\textit{kekul\'e}'' type distortions yields a topological phase. In contrast, ``\textit{anti-kekul\'e}'' distortions result in a non-topological magnonic phase. The presence of kekul\'e distortions manifests in two distinct topologically protected bosonic corner modes - an \textit{intrinsic} and a \textit{pseudo}, based on the specific edge terminations. On the other hand, anti-kekul\'e distortions give rise to \SW{\textit{Tamm/Shockley}} type bond-localized boundary modes, which are non-topological and reliant on particular edge termination. We further investigate the effects of random out-of-plane exchange anisotropy disorder on the robustness of these bosonic corner modes. The distinction between SOTMIs and their fermionic counterparts arises due to the system-specific magnonic onsite energies, a crucial feature often overlooked in prior literature. Our study unveils exciting prospects for engineering higher-order topological phases in magnon systems and enhances our understanding of their unique behavior within decorated honeycomb lattices.</description>

Abstract: To describe the polar properties of the nanosized HfxZr1-xO2-y, we evolve the "effective" Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) model based on the parametrization of the Landau expansion coefficients for the polar and antipolar orderings. We have shown that the effective LGD model can predict the influence of screening conditions and size effects on phase diagrams, polarization reversal and structural properties of the nanosized HfxZr1-xO2-y of various shape and sizes. To verify the model, we use available experimental results for HfxZr1-xO2 thin films and oxygen-deficient HfO2-y nanoparticles prepared at different annealing conditions. X-ray diffraction, which was used to determine the phase composition of the HfO2-y nanoparticles, revealed the formation of the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase in them. Micro-Raman spectroscopy was used to explore the correlation of lattice dynamics and structural changes appearing in dependence on the oxygen vacancies concentration in the HfO2-y nanoparticles. Since our approach allows to determine the conditions (shape, sizes, Zr content and/or oxygen vacancies amount) for which the nanosized HfxZr1-xO2-y are ferroelectrics or antiferroelectrics, we hope that obtained results are useful for creation of next generation of Si-compatible ferroelectric gate oxide nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>Higher vortexability: zero field realization of higher Landau levels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of moir\'{e} materials has led to experimental realizations of integer and fractional Chern insulators in small or vanishing magnetic fields. At the same time, a set of minimal conditions sufficient to guarantee a Abelian fractional state in a flat band were identified, namely "ideal" or "vortexable" quantum geometry. Such vortexable bands share essential features with the lowest Landau level, while excluding the need for more fine-tuned aspects such as flat Berry curvature. A natural and important generalization is to ask if such conditions can be extended to capture the quantum geometry of higher Landau levels, particularly the first (1LL), where non-Abelian states at $\nu = 1/2,2/5$ are known to be competitive. The possibility of realizing these states at zero magnetic field , and perhaps even more exotic ones, could become a reality if we could identify the essential structure of the 1LL in Chern bands. In this work, we introduce a precise definition of 1LL quantum geometry, along with a figure of merit that measures how closely a given band approaches the 1LL. We apply the definition to identify two models with 1LL structure -- a toy model of double bilayer twisted graphene and a more realistic model of strained Bernal graphene.</description>

      <title>Andreev reflection mediated $\Delta_T$ noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum noise has been extensively utilized to investigate various aspects of quantum transport, such as current-current correlations and wave-particle duality. A recent focus in this field is on $\Delta_T$ quantum noise, which arises because of a finite temperature difference at vanishing charge current. This paper explores the characterization of $\Delta_T$ noise auto-correlation alongside the shot noise and thermal-noise contributions in a 1D metal/insulator/superconductor junction. We consider a finite temperature gradient with zero applied bias for reservoirs at comparable temperatures. Andreev reflection enhances the $\Delta_T$ noise in a metal-insulator-superconductor junction in contrast to a metal-insulator-metal junction in the transparent limit. Unlike quantum noise for which shot-noise dominates thermal-noise at large bias voltages and finite barrier strength, $\Delta_T$ thermal-noise is always higher than $\Delta_T$ shot-noise. Thus, a general bound that is independent of barrier strength is established. This investigation sheds light on the distinct behavior of $\Delta_T$ noise, alongside the ratio of shot-noise to thermal-noise contributions, offering valuable insights into the intricate interplay between finite temperature gradient, barrier strength, and Andreev reflection.</description>

      <title>Mapping the intrinsic photocurrent streamlines through micromagnetic heterostructure devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.07902v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Like air flowing over a wing, optimizing the flow of electronic charge is essential to the operation of nanoscale devices. Unfortunately, the delicate interplay of charge, spin, and heat in complex devices has precluded detailed imaging of charge flow. Here, we report on the visualization of intrinsic charge current streamlines through yttrium iron garnet micromagnetic heterostructures. Scanning photovoltage microscopy of precisely designed devices leads to striking spatial patterns, with prominent photovoltage features emerging in corners and narrow constrictions. These patterns, which evolve continuously with rotation of an external magnetic field, enable rich spatial mapping of fluid-like flow. Taking inspiration from aerodynamic Clark Y airfoils, we engineer micromagnetic wing shaped devices, called electrofoils, which allow us to precisely contort, compress and decompress flowlines of electronic charge.120 (39) e2221815120</description>

      <title>Electrical control of spin and valley in spin-orbit coupled graphene multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrical control of magnetism has been a major techonogical pursuit of the spintronics community, owing to its far-reaching implications for data storage and transmission. Here, we propose and analyze a new mechanism for electrical switching of isospin, using chiral-stacked graphene multilayers, such as bernal bilayer graphene or rhombohedral trilayer graphene, encapsulated by transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) substrates. Leveraging the proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling from the TMD, we demonstrate electrical switching of correlation-induced spin and/or valley polarization, by reversing a perpendicular displacement field or the chemical potential. We substantiate our proposal with both analytical arguments and self-consistent Hartree-Fock numerics. Finally, we illustrate how the relative alignment of the TMDs, together with the top and bottom gate voltages, can be used to selectively switch distinct isospin flavors, putting forward correlated van der Waals heterostructures as a promising platform for spintronics and valleytronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bosonic collective modes are ubiquitous in metals, but over a wide range of energy and momenta suffer from Landau damping, decaying into the continuum of particle-hole excitations. Here we point out that interactions can suppress this decay, protecting a finite fraction of the total spectral weight associated with the collective mode, e.g. a plasmon. The underlying mechanism is level repulsion between a discrete mode and the continuum. We demonstrate the effect using a number of simplified models of strongly correlated Fermi-liquid metals, including a ``solvable" random flavor model in the large$-N$ limit. We discuss in detail the possibility of observing such an avoided decay for plasmons in (moir\'e) graphene-like systems.</description>

      <title>Room temperature magnetic phase transition in an electrically-tuned van der Waals ferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding tunable van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets that operate at above room temperature is an important research focus in physics and materials science. Most vdW magnets are only intrinsically magnetic far below room temperature and magnetism with square-shaped hysteresis at room-temperature has yet to be observed. Here, we report magnetism in a quasi-2D magnet Cr1.2Te2 observed at room temperature (290 K). This magnetism was tuned via a protonic gate with an electron doping concentration up to 3.8 * 10^21 cm^-3. We observed non-monotonic evolutions in both coercivity and anomalous Hall resistivity. Under increased electron doping, the coercivities and anomalous Hall effects (AHEs) vanished, indicating a doping-induced magnetic phase transition. This occurred up to room temperature. DFT calculations showed the formation of an antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase caused by the intercalation of protons which induced significant electron doping in the Cr1.2Te2. The tunability of the magnetic properties and phase in room temperature magnetic vdW Cr1.2Te2 is a significant step towards practical spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Giant Modulation of Refractive Index from Picoscale Atomic Displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural disorder has been shown to enhance and modulate magnetic, electrical, dipolar, electrochemical, and mechanical properties of materials. However, the possibility of obtaining novel optical and optoelectronic properties from structural disorder remains an open question. Here, we show unambiguous evidence of disorder in the form of anisotropic, picoscale atomic displacements modulating the refractive index tensor and resulting in the giant optical anisotropy observed in BaTiS$_3$, a quasi-one-dimensional hexagonal chalcogenide. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies reveal the presence of antipolar displacements of Ti atoms within adjacent TiS$_6$ chains along the c-axis, and three-fold degenerate Ti displacements in the a-b plane. $^{47/49}$Ti solid-state NMR provides additional evidence for those Ti displacements in the form of a three-horned NMR lineshape resulting from a low symmetry local environment around Ti atoms. We used scanning transmission electron microscopy to directly observe the globally disordered Ti a-b plane displacements and find them to be ordered locally over a few unit cells. First-principles calculations show that the Ti a-b plane displacements selectively reduce the refractive index along the ab-plane, while having minimal impact on the refractive index along the chain direction, thus resulting in a giant enhancement in the optical anisotropy. By showing a strong connection between structural disorder with picoscale displacements and the optical response in BaTiS$_3$, this study opens a pathway for designing optical materials with high refractive index and functionalities such as large optical anisotropy and nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Optimizing edge state transfer in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain via hybrid analog-digital strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain, which serves as a paradigmatic model for comprehending topological phases and their associated edge states, plays an essential role in advancing our understanding of quantum materials and quantum information processing and technology. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid analog-digital protocol designed for the nonadiabatic yet high-fidelity transfer of edge states in an SSH chain, featuring two sublattices, A and B. The core of our approach lies in harnessing the approximate time-dependent counterdiabatic (CD) interaction, derived from adiabatic gauge potentials. However, to enhance transfer fidelity, particularly in long-distance chains, higher-order nested commutators become crucial. To simplify the experimental implementation and navigate computational complexities, we identify the next-to-nearest-neighbor hopping terms between sublattice A sites as dominant CD driving and further optimize them by using variational quantum circuits. Through digital quantum simulation, our protocol showcases the capability to achieve rapid and robust solutions, even in the presence of disorder. This analog-digital transfer protocol, an extension of quantum control methodology, establishes a robust framework for edge-state transfer. Importantly, the optimal CD driving identified can be seamlessly implemented across various quantum registers, highlighting the versatility of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor-based superconducting qubits offer a versatile platform for studying hybrid quantum devices in circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architecture. Most of these cQED experiments utilize coplanar waveguides, where the incorporation of DC gate lines is straightforward. Here, we present a technique for probing gate-tunable hybrid devices using a three-dimensional (3D) microwave cavity. A recess is machined inside the cavity wall for the placement of devices and gate lines. We validate this design using a hybrid device based on an InAs-Al nanowire Josephson junction. The coupling between the device and the cavity is facilitated by a long superconducting strip, the antenna. The Josephson junction and the antenna together form a gatemon qubit. We further demonstrate the gate-tunable cavity shift and two-tone qubit spectroscopy. This technique could be used to probe various quantum devices and materials in a 3D cQED architecture that requires DC gate voltages.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation corrections to Lifshitz tails in disordered systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quenched disorder in semiconductors induces localized electronic states at the band edge, which manifest as an exponential tail in the density of states. For large impurity densities, this tail takes a universal Lifshitz form that is characterized by short-ranged potential fluctuations. We provide both analytical expressions and numerical values for the Lifshitz tail of a parabolic conduction band, including its exact fluctuation prefactor. Our analysis is based on a replica field integral approach, where the leading exponential scaling of the tail is determined by an instanton profile, and fluctuations around the instanton determine the subleading pre-exponential factor. This factor contains the determinant of a fluctuation operator, and we avoid a full computation of its spectrum by using a Gel'fand-Yaglom formalism, which provides a concise general derivation of fluctuation corrections in disorder problems. We provide a revised result for the disorder band tail in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Immersed boundary method for dynamic simulation of polarizable colloids of arbitrary shape in explicit ion electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a computational method for modeling electrostatic interactions of arbitrarily-shaped, polarizable objects on colloidal length scales, including colloids/nanoparticles, polymers, and surfactants, dispersed in explicit ion electrolytes and nonionic solvents. Our method computes the nonuniform polarization charge distribution induced in a colloidal particle by both externally applied electric fields and local electric fields arising from other charged objects in the dispersion. This leads to expressions for electrostatic energies, forces, and torques that enable efficient molecular dynamics and Brownian dynamics simulations of colloidal dispersions in electrolytes, which can be harnessed to accurately predict structural and transport properties. We describe an implementation in which colloidal particles are modeled as rigid composites of small spherical beads that tessellate the surface of the particle. The electrostatics calculations are accelerated using a spectrally-accurate particle-mesh-Ewald technique implemented on a graphics processing unit (GPU) and regularized such that the electrostatic calculations are well-defined even for overlapping bodies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through a series of calculations, including the induced dipole moments and forces for one, two, and lattices of spherical colloids in an electric field; the induced dipole moment and torque for anisotropic particles in an electric field; the equilibrium distribution of ions in the double layer around charged colloids; the dynamics of charged colloids; and ions in the double layer around a polarizable colloid exposed to an electric field.</description>

      <title>A lattice formulation of Weyl fermions on a single curved surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the standard lattice domain-wall fermion formulation, one needs two flat domain-walls where both of the left- and right-handed massless modes appear. In this work we investigate a single domain-wall system with a nontrivial curved background. Specifically we consider a massive fermion on a three-dimensional square lattice, whose domain-wall is a two-dimensional sphere. In the free theory, we find that a single Weyl fermion is localized at the wall and it feels gravity through the induced spin connection. With a topologically nontrivial $U(1)$ link gauge field, however, we find a zero mode with the opposite chirality localized at the center where the gauge field is singular. In the latter case, the low-energy effective theory is not chiral but vectorlike. We discuss how to circumvent this obstacle in formulating lattice chiral gauge theory in the single domain-wall fermion system.</description>
