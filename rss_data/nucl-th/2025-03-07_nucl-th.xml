      <title>The study of quantum fluctuation energies over a spatially inhomogeneous field background in a chiral soliton model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on chiral soliton models, the quantum fluctuation energies of quarks over a spatially inhomogeneous meson field background have been thoroughly studied. We have used a systematic calculation scheme initiated by Schwinger, in which the loop quantum fluctuation energies are evaluated by a nontrivial level summation over the eigenvalue spectrum of the effective Hamiltonian of the system. The effective Hamiltonian can be constructed by one loop effective action of fluctuations of quarks over a static chiral soliton field background. The corresponding Dirac equation is obtained. In a static and spatially spherical case and by the hedgehog ansatz the radial part and the angular part of the grand spin of the wave function for the Dirac equation can be separated. Due to the soliton background the eigenvalue spectrum are distorted. The scattering phase shift can be determined by solve the radial equations at different momentum. The density of states in momentum space can be derived. The effective Hamiltonian has been diagonalized in a Hilbert space where the eigenfunctions are labeled by the parity, grand spin and energy. The renormalization scheme can be carried out by a Born subtraction of the phase shift and the compensating Feynman diagram renormalization. Finally the finite quantum fluctuation energies over chiral soliton background at different parities and grand spins have been numerically evaluated, compared and discussed.</description>

      <title>Electroproduction of medium- and heavy-mass hypernuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DWIA formalism for computing the cross sections in electroproduction of hypernuclei used before for lighter (p-shell and sd-shell) systems is utilized in studying electroproduction on heavier targets such as $^{52}$Cr, and $^{208}$Pb. First, the effects from kaon distortion and kinematics are re-examined and then results for the heavy targets are discussed in view of various forms of the $\Lambda$N effective interaction, the elementary amplitude, and kinematics. Apparent sensitivity of the hypernucleus excitation spectra to various forms of the $\Lambda$N effective interaction is shown. Predictions of the excitation spectrum in electroproduction of $^{208}_{~~\Lambda}$Tl are also given in kinematics of the experiment E12-20-013 in preparation at Jefferson Lab.</description>

      <title>Charge dependent directed flow splitting from baryon inhomogeneity and electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to understand the recent experimental data from the STAR collaboration on the system size dependence of directed flow splitting between oppositely charged hadrons [arXiv:2412.18326]. Previously, we have studied the role of baryon inhomogeneity on charge dependent directed flow. We now incorporate the effects of the electromagnetic (EM) field albeit perturbatively, as implemented in Ref. [arXiv:1806.05288]. This enables us to compare the relative contributions between baryon inhomogeneity and EM field on charge dependent directed flow. Our model calculation describes the experimental data on the centrality and system size dependence of the mid-rapidity directed flow slope splitting, $\Delta dv_1/dy$, between protons and anti-protons. Our results indicate that in central collisions, where the EM field strength is negligible, the inclusion of EM field effects does not influence the splitting between protons and anti-protons. This suggests that the observed system size dependence of $\Delta dv_1/dy (p-\bar{p})$ in central collisions arises solely from enhanced baryon stopping in larger collision systems. However, in semi-central and peripheral collisions, both baryon diffusion and EM field effects contribute to the splitting. Furthermore, the centrality dependence of $\Delta dv_1/dy (p-\bar{p})$ is highly sensitive to the electrical conductivity of the medium, making it a potential probe for extracting this transport coefficient in the QCD medium through model-to-data comparisons. However, achieving this requires a precise determination of the background baseline originating from baryon diffusion. Additionally, further investigation is needed to understand $\Delta dv_1/dy$ for oppositely charged kaons and pions, particularly by incorporating the diffusion of other conserved charges.</description>

      <title>Classical periodic orbits in extended phase space for spherical harmonic oscillator with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A complete analysis of classical periodic orbits (POs) and their bifurcations was conducted in spherical harmonic oscillator system with spin-orbit coupling. The motion of the spin is explicitly considered using the spin canonical variables derived by semiclassical approximation to the spin coherent state path integral representation. In addition to the diametric and two circular PO families with frozen spin, solutions that bridge two circular POs are found in which orbital motion is coupled to spin precession. In addition, each bridge encounters a secondary bifurcation on the way from one circular PO to the other and generates a new PO, that survives at higher energies while maintaining a constant period. The generic expressions for those POs are obtained explicitly, and all the above peculiar bifurcation scenarios are described fully analytically.</description>

      <title>Constrained many-body phases in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-Higgs lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ground-state phase diagram of a one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to soft-core bosonic matter at unit filling, inspired by the Higgs sector of the standard model. Through a combination of analytical perturbative approaches, exact diagonalization, and density-matrix-renormalization-group simulations, we uncover a rich phase diagram driven by gauge-field-mediated resonant pair hopping and the confinement of single particles. The pair hopping results in a bunching state with superextensive energy and macroscopic particle number fluctuations at strong electric field strengths and weak on-site interactions. The bunching state crosses over into a pair superfluid phase as the on-site interaction increases, characterized by a finite superfluid density and powerlaw-decaying pair correlations. At large on-site interaction strengths and driven by effective interactions induced by the gauge constraint, the superfluid transitions into an incompressible pair Mott insulator phase. At weak field strengths and on-site interactions, we find a plasma-like region, where single bosons exhibit large short-range correlations and the ground state is composed almost equally of states with even and odd local boson occupation. The presence of a bunching state with large number fluctuations, which is difficult to study using classical numerics, motivates experimental realizations in hybrid boson-qubit quantum simulation platforms such as circuit QED, neutral atoms, and trapped ions. Our findings highlight the rich interplay between gauge fields and soft-core bosonic matter.</description>

      <title>Precise constraint on properties of neutron stars through new universal relations and astronomical observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In view of the great uncertainty of the equation of state (EOS) of high-density nuclear matter, establishing EOS-independent universal relations between global properties of neutron stars provides a practical way to constrain the unobservable or difficult-to-observe properties through astronomical observations. It is common to construct universal relations between EOS-dependent properties (e.g., moment of inertia, tidal deformation, etc.) or combined properties (e.g., compactness). Improving the precision of the universal relations may provide stricter constraint on the properties of neutron star. We find that in 3-dimensional space with mass and radius as the base coordinates, the points corresponding to a certain property of neutron star described by different EOSs are almost located in the same surface. Thus the universal relation between the property and the stellar mass-radius can be expressed through describing the surface.
  It is shown that the resulting universal relations have higher precisions. As an example, we construct high-precision universal relations for the moment of inertia, the $f$-mode frequency, and the dimensionless tidal deformation respect to the mass-radius. As the observational data of neutron star mass and radius from NICER grows in data and accuracy, these universal relations allow for more precise constraints on the unobservable or difficult-to-observe properties.</description>

      <title>Towards modeling the short-range interactions of hidden/open charm pentaquark molecular states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hadronic $\Sigma_c^{(*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$ and $\Sigma_c^{(*)}{D}^{(*)}$ interactions are revisited, with a focus on their short-range parts, motivated by a tension between the interpretations of $P_{c\bar{c}}(4312)$, $P_{c\bar{c}}(4440)$, and $P_{c\bar{c}}(4457)$ in effective field theory (EFT) frameworks and the one-boson-exchange (OBE) model. While the three states can be interpreted as $\Sigma_c\bar{D}^{(*)}$ molecular states within EFT frameworks, this is not feasible in the single-channel OBE model with consistent cutoff. In this work, the possibility to reconcile OBE model with EFTs by refitting the $\rho$-, $\omega$- and $\sigma$-exchange interaction is explored and ruled out. It is pointed out that the problem in OBE arises from the strong short-range spin-dependent one-pion-exchange (OPE) interaction and the fixed signs of other short-range interactions in OBE model also prevent the cancellation. To address this issue, the short-range subtraction strategies within the OBE model are revisited. Two subtraction schemes are explored: removing the delta-function from all interactions and eliminating it only from the pseudoscalar-meson-exchange component. These schemes favor different spin assignments for $P_{c\bar{c}}(4440)$ and $P_{c\bar{c}}(4457)$. Though solving the problem, there is no clear dynamical picture to support the subtraction schemes. We propose a new quark-exchange mechanism motivated by the Pauli principle. Different from the two subtraction schemes in OBE, the quark-exchange mechanism offers an explanation grounded in microscopic dynamics. It is shown that the spin-dependent quark-exchange interaction cancels those from OPE. The differences in the predictions for the spin, isospin, and open-charm partner states of the experimental $P_{c\bar{c}}$ states offer a way to distinguish between the subtracted OBE model and the OBE model with quark-exchange contributions.</description>

      <title>Analysis of flow factorization and event-plane correlations based on a maximum likelihood estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14347v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we use the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) to explore factorization and event-plane correlations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Our analyses incorporate both numerical simulations and publicly available data from the CMS Collaboration. We focus on Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV and Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV. The differential flows obtained for various centrality windows and momentum cuts are consistent with conventional methodologies such as multi-particle cumulants and event-plane methods. Leveraging these findings, we proceed to undertake further analysis of flow factorization and event-plane correlations. These quantities are relevant because of their sensitivity to initial-state fluctuations. While higher-order correlators might provide different implementations of factorization ratio, the MLE estimator is readily applied to these scenarios. Moreover, MLE's unique capabilities allow us to compute specific correlators that are typically inaccessible by other means. As an asymptotically normal and unbiased estimator, MLE provides a valuable alternative tool for flow and correlation analysis.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Learning Method to Connect Observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constructing fast and accurate surrogate models is a key ingredient for making robust predictions in many topics. We introduce a new model, the Multiparameter Eigenvalue Problem (MEP) emulator. The new method connects emulators and can make predictions directly from observables to observables. We present that the MEP emulator can be trained with data from Eigenvector Continuation (EC) and Parametric Matrix Model (PMM) emulators. A simple simulation on a one-dimensional lattice confirms the performance of the MEP emulator. Using $^{28}$O as an example, we also demonstrate that the predictive probability distribution of the target observables can be easily obtained through the new emulator.</description>

      <title>Charge-conjugation asymmetry and molecular content: the $D_{s0}^\ast(2317)^\pm$ in matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the modifications that a dense nuclear medium induces in the $D_{s0}^\ast(2317)^\pm$ and $D_{s1}(2460)^\pm$. In the vacuum, we consider them as isoscalar $D^{(*)}K$ and $\overline{D}{}^{(*)}\overline{K}$ $S$-wave bound states, which are dynamically generated from effective interactions that lead to different Weinberg compositeness scenarios. Matter effects are incorporated through the two-meson loop functions, taking into account the self energies that the $D^{(*)}$, $\overline{D}{}^{(*)}$, $K$, and $\overline{K}$ develop when embedded in a nuclear medium. Although particle-antiparticle [$D^{(\ast)}_{s0,s1}(2317,2460)^+$ versus $D^{(\ast)}_{s0,s1}(2317,2460)^-$] lineshapes are the same in vacuum, we find extremely different density patterns in matter. This charge-conjugation asymmetry mainly stems from the very different kaon and antikaon interaction with the nucleons of the dense medium. We show that the in-medium lineshapes found for these resonances strongly depend on their $D^{(*)}K$/$\overline{D}{}^{(*)}\overline{K}$ molecular content, and discuss how this novel feature can be used to better determine/constrain the inner structure of these exotic states.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Event-Shape Methods in Search for the Chiral Magnetic Effect in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon in which electric charge is separated by a strong magnetic field from local domains of chirality imbalance and parity violation in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The CME-sensitive observable, charge-dependent three-point azimuthal correlator $\Delta\gamma$, is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the particle's elliptic flow anisotropy $v_2$. Event-shape engineering (ESE) binning events in dynamical fluctuations of $v_2$ and event-shape selection (ESS) binning events in statistical fluctuations of $v_2$ are two methods to search for the CME by projecting $\Delta\gamma$ to the measured anisotropy $v_2=0$ intercept. We conduct a systematic study of these two methods using physics models as well as toy model simulations. It is observed that the ESE method fulfills the general premise of measuring the CME but is statistically hungry. It is found that the intercept from the ESS method depends on the details of the event content, such as the mixtures of background-contributing sources, because of statistical fluctuations of intertwining variables used in the method, and is thus not practically useful or clean to measure the CME.</description>
