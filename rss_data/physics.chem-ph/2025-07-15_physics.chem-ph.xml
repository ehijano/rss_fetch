      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present assembly-theory, a Rust package for computing assembly indices of covalently bonded molecular structures. This is a key complexity measure of assembly theory, a recent theoretical framework quantifying selection across diverse systems, most importantly chemistry. assembly-theory is designed for researchers and practitioners alike, providing (i) extensible, high-performance implementations of assembly index calculation algorithms, (ii) comprehensive benchmarks against which current and future algorithmic improvements can be tested, and (iii) Python bindings and RDKit-compatible data loaders to support integration with existing computational pipelines.</description>

      <title>DiffNMR: Diffusion Models for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectra Elucidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a central characterization method for molecular structure elucidation, yet interpreting NMR spectra to deduce molecular structures remains challenging due to the complexity of spectral data and the vastness of the chemical space. In this work, we introduce DiffNMR, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages a conditional discrete diffusion model for de novo molecular structure elucidation from NMR spectra. DiffNMR refines molecular graphs iteratively through a diffusion-based generative process, ensuring global consistency and mitigating error accumulation inherent in autoregressive methods. The framework integrates a two-stage pretraining strategy that aligns spectral and molecular representations via diffusion autoencoder (Diff-AE) and contrastive learning, the incorporation of retrieval initialization and similarity filtering during inference, and a specialized NMR encoder with radial basis function (RBF) encoding for chemical shifts, preserving continuity and chemical correlation. Experimental results demonstrate that DiffNMR achieves competitive performance for NMR-based structure elucidation, offering an efficient and robust solution for automated molecular analysis.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the hydrophilicity of nylon-6 fabric via hydrolysis amidation dual treatment in alkaline as a pre-treatment for membrane filtration systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, the pre-treatment for membrane filtration systems is receiving more attention that can be remove large particles and debris or enhance permeation flux. In this study, commercial nylon 6 fabric is modified via hydrolysis amidation reaction in alkaline media with NaOH and Dimethylene diamine. The increase of hydrophilicity amino groups on the surface of treated fabric which increases the hydrophilicity of the fabric. This opens up new possibilities for the treatment process in commercial membrane filtration systems. Besides, amino enriched nylon 6 fabric can capture carboxylic functionalized carbon-based nanomaterials forwards to the synthesis of thin film nanocomposite membranes based on carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Hydrogen Exchange Reaction in a Dark Cavity: A Benchmark for Bridging the Gap Between Theory and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gas-phase hydrogen exchange reaction (HER) is the most fundamental chemical process for benchmarking quantum reaction dynamics. In this Letter, we focus on controlling HER by means of strong light-matter coupling inside a resonant cavity, an approach often called polariton chemistry. In particular, we focus on the isotopic variation of HER involving collisions between molecular hydrogen H$_2$ and deuterium atom D, i.e., H$_2$+D$\to$HD+H. We find that the asymmetry introduced by the different isotopes, despite being small, enables strong cavity-induced modifications of reaction rates. Outside of the cavity the reaction is as usual D+H${_2}$$\to$DH+H. However, inside the cavity another type of reactions take place where D+H$_2$$\to$DH+H+E$_{photon}$, where E$_{photon}$=$\hbar\omega_{cav}$. Our results show that HER is an ideal platform to make a significant step toward closing the gap between theory and experiment in polariton chemistry.</description>

      <title>DLPNO-MP2 with Periodic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present domain-based local pair natural orbital M{\o}ller--Plesset second order perturbation theory (DLPNO-MP2) with Born--von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n boundary (BvK) conditions. The approach is based on well-localised Wannier functions in a LCAO formalism and extends the molecular DLPNO-MP2 implementation Tubromole program package to periodic systems. The PNOs are formed through a PAO-OSV-PNO cascade, using BvK projected atomic orbitals and orbital specific virtuals as intermediaries in an analogous manner to the molecular scheme. Our chargeless and surface-dipole corrected local density fitting approach is shown to be numerically stable and to ensure convergent lattice summations over the periodic images for the two- and three-index Coulomb integrals. Through careful benchmarking, we show that the DLPNO approximations in the BvK-DLPNO-MP2 methods are entirely consistent with those of molecular DLPNO-MP2 calculations, and with an alternative periodic approach Megacell-DLPNO-MP2, reported in Paper II of this series. Smooth convergence to the canonical correlation energy with tightening PNO threshold is observed. Reference MP2 correlation energies are provided for a set of 2D and 3D periodic systems using a triple-zeta basis and supercell sizes up to 11$\times$11 and 7$\times$7$\times$7.</description>

      <title>DLPNO-MP2 for Periodic Systems using Megacell Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a domain-based local pair natural orbital M{\o}ller--Plesset second order perturbation theory (DLPNO-MP2) for periodic systems, working within an LCAO formalism within the Tubromole program package. This approach, Megacell-DLPNO-MP2, embeds a supercell correlation treatment within a megacell and does not involve periodic image summation for the Coulomb integrals. Working in a basis of well-localised Wannier functions, periodicity is instead imposed through rigorous translational symmetry of Hamiltonian integrals and wavefunction parameters. The accuracy of the method is validated through comparison with a complementary periodic DLPNO-MP2 method that employs Born--von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n boundary conditions, described in paper I of this series. The PNO approximations are shown to be equivalent in the two approaches and entirely consistent with molecular DLPNO-MP2 calculations. The Megacell-DLPNO-MP2 method displays sub-linear scaling with respect to supercell size at the asymptotic limit and example calculations are presented with up to 15000 basis functions in the correlation treatment.</description>

      <title>Self-Powered Triboelectric Sensing System for Gait-Based Physiological and Psychological Assessment in Track and Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable sensors are critical components in smart sports systems for real-time monitoring of athletic performance, physiological conditions, and psychological states. In this work, a sodium alginate/gelatin-based triboelectric nanogenerator (SG-TENG) was developed for mechanical energy harvesting and real-time sensing in track and field applications. The SA/gelatin composite film exhibits high transparency, good flexibility, and uniform morphology, enabling stable triboelectric output. The SG-TENG delivers high electrical performance, including an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 156.6 V, short-circuit current (Isc) of 46.9 uA, and transferred charge (Qsc) of 139.6 nC, with a maximum power of 13.5 mW under optimal loading. Its output characteristics are closely related to mechanical parameters such as frequency, force, displacement, and contact area. Furthermore, the device demonstrates energy storage capability by charging capacitors under various dynamic conditions. Integrated into a running shoe, the SG-TENG enables self-powered gait monitoring and can distinguish between walking, running, and jumping. It also shows potential for inferring psychological and physiological states from gait features, offering a promising solution for battery-free, multifunctional sensing in sports performance evaluation and health monitoring.</description>

      <title>Cavity Born-Oppenheimer Coupled Cluster Theory: Towards Electron Correlation in the Vibrational Strong Light-Matter Coupling Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed derivation and discussion of cavity Born-Oppenheimer coupled cluster (CBO-CC) theory and address cavity-modified electron correlation in the vibrational strong coupling regime. Methodologically, we combine the recently proposed cavity reaction potential (CRP) approach with the Lagrangian formulation of CC theory and derive a self-consistent CRP-CC method at the singles and doubles excitations level (CRP-CCSD). The CRP-CC approach is formally similar to implicit solvation CC models and provides access to the CBO-CC electronic ground state energy minimized in cavity coordinate space on a CC level of theory. A hierarchy of linearisation schemes (lCRP-CCSD) similar to canonical CC theory systematically lifts the self-consistent nature of the CRP-CCSD approach and mitigates numerical cost by approximating electron correlation effects in energy minimization. We provide a thorough comparison of CRP-CCSD, lCRP-CCSD and CRP-Hartee-Fock methods for a cavity-modified Menshutkin reaction, pyridine$+$CH$_3$Br, and cavity-induced collective electronic effects in microsolvation energies of selected methanol-water clusters. We find lCRP-CCSD methods to provide excellent results compared to the self-consistent CRP-CCSD approach in the few-molecule limit. We furthermore observe significant differences between mean-field and correlated results in both reactive and collective scenarios. Our work emphasizes the non-trivial character of electron correlation under vibrational strong coupling and provides a starting point for further developments in ab initio vibro-polaritonic chemistry beyond the mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Behavior of Complex Aqueous Electrolytes Using Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials: The Case of Sodium Sulfate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the structure and thermodynamics of solvated ions is essential for advancing applications in electrochemistry, water treatment, and energy storage. While ab initio molecular dynamics methods are highly accurate, they are limited by short accessible time and length scales whereas classical force fields struggle with accuracy. Herein, we explore the structure and thermodynamics of complex monovalent-divalent ion pairs using Na2SO4(aq) as a case study by applying a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) trained on density functional theory (DFT) data. Our MLIP-based approach reproduces key bulk properties such as density and radial distribution functions of water. We provide the hydration structure of the sodium and sulfate ions in 0.1-2 M concentration range and the one-dimensional and two-dimensional potentials of mean force for the sodium-sulfate ion pairing at the low concentration limit (0.1 M) which are inaccessible to DFT. At low concentrations, the sulfate ion is strongly solvated, leading to the stabilization of solvent-separated ion pairs over contact ion pairs. Minimum energy pathway analysis revealed that coordinating two sodium ions with a sulfate ion is a multistep process whereby the sodium ions coordinate to the sulfate ion sequentially. We demonstrate that MLIPs allow the study of solvated ions beyond simple monovalent pairs with DFT-level accuracy in their low concentration limit (0.1 M) via statistically converged properties from ns long simulations.</description>

      <title>Accurate generation of chemical reaction transition states by conditional flow matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition state (TS) structures define the critical geometries and energy barriers underlying chemical reactivity, yet their fleeting nature renders them experimentally elusive and drives the reliance on costly, high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Here, we introduce TS-GEN, a conditional flow-matching generative model that maps samples from a simple Gaussian prior directly to transition-state saddle-point geometries in a single, deterministic pass. By embedding both reactant and product conformations as conditioning information, TS-GEN learns to transport latent noise to true TS structures via an optimal-transport path, effectively replacing the iterative optimization common in nudged-elastic band or string-method algorithms. TS-GEN delivers unprecedented accuracy, achieving a root-mean-square deviation of $0.004\ \rm{\mathring{A}}$ (vs. $0.103\ \rm{\mathring{A}}$ for prior state-of-the-art) and a mean barrier-height error of $1.019\ {\rm kcal/mol}$ (vs. $2.864\ {\rm kcal/mol}$), while requiring only $0.06\ {\rm s}$ GPU time per inference. Over 87% of generated TSs meet chemical-accuracy criteria ($&lt;1.58\ {\rm kcal/mol}$ error), substantially outpacing existing methods. TS-GEN also exhibits strong transferability to out-of-distribution reactions from a larger database. By uniting sub-angstrom precision, sub-second speed, and broad applicability, TS-GEN will be highly useful for high-throughput exploration of complex reaction networks, paving the way to the exploration of novel chemical reaction mechanisms.</description>

      <title>ToxBench: A Binding Affinity Prediction Benchmark with AB-FEP-Calculated Labels for Human Estrogen Receptor Alpha</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein-ligand binding affinity prediction is essential for drug discovery and toxicity assessment. While machine learning (ML) promises fast and accurate predictions, its progress is constrained by the availability of reliable data. In contrast, physics-based methods such as absolute binding free energy perturbation (AB-FEP) deliver high accuracy but are computationally prohibitive for high-throughput applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToxBench, the first large-scale AB-FEP dataset designed for ML development and focused on a single pharmaceutically critical target, Human Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ER$\alpha$). ToxBench contains 8,770 ER$\alpha$-ligand complex structures with binding free energies computed via AB-FEP with a subset validated against experimental affinities at 1.75 kcal/mol RMSE, along with non-overlapping ligand splits to assess model generalizability. Using ToxBench, we further benchmark state-of-the-art ML methods, and notably, our proposed DualBind model, which employs a dual-loss framework to effectively learn the binding energy function. The benchmark results demonstrate the superior performance of DualBind and the potential of ML to approximate AB-FEP at a fraction of the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Approximate quantum circuit compilation for proton-transfer kinetics on quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proton transfer reactions are fundamental to many chemical and biological systems, where quantum effects such as tunneling, delocalization, and zero-point motion play key kinetic control roles. However, classical methods capable of accurately capturing these phenomena scale prohibitively with system size. Here, we develop and demonstrate quantum computing algorithms based on the Nuclear-Electronic Orbital framework, treating the transferring proton quantum mechanically. We assess the potential of current quantum devices for simulating proton transfer kinetics with high accuracy. We first construct a deep initial ans\"atze within a truncated orbital space by employing the frozen natural orbital approximation. Then, to balance circuit depth against state fidelity, we implement an adaptive form of approximate quantum compiling. Using resulting circuits at varying compression levels transpiled for the ibm_fez device, we compute barrier heights and delocalised proton densities along the proton transfer pathway using a realistic hardware noise model. We find that, although current quantum hardware introduces significant noise relative to the demanding energy tolerances involved, our approach allows substantial circuit simplification while maintaining energy barrier estimates within 13% of the reference value. Despite present hardware limitations, these results offer a practical means of approximating key circuit segments in near-term devices and early fault-tolerant quantum computing systems.</description>

      <title>Theoretical evaluation of decay mode of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ in solid samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excitation energy of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ is extremely low at $ 8.4 \, \mathrm{eV} $; thus, this isotope exhibits changes in its decay modes depending on the chemical state, specifically the outermost electronic states. However, the reported half-lives of $ \gamma $-ray transition are not consistent among the previous experiments. In this study, we investigate the chemical states of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ by DFT calculations. Based on these results, we evaluate the relationship between the experimental half-life for each sample and the electronic state of $ \mathrm{Th} $. The calculation results indicate that ion trap method, $ \mathrm{Ca} \mathrm{F}_2 $ model and $ \mathrm{Mg} \mathrm{F}_2 $ one decay only via the $ \gamma $-ray transition, whereas $ \mathrm{Li} \mathrm{Sr} \mathrm{Al} \mathrm{F}_6 $ decay via the $ \gamma $-ray transition and has a possibility of decay via internal conversion, and electron bridge.</description>

Currently, training and sampling state-of-the-art diffusion or flow-based models for conformer generation require significant computational resources. In this work, we build upon flow-matching and propose two mechanisms for accelerating training and inference of generative models for 3D molecular conformer generation. For fast training, we introduce the SO(3)-Averaged Flow training objective, which leads to faster convergence to better generation quality compared to conditional optimal transport flow or Kabsch-aligned flow. We demonstrate that models trained using SO(3)-Averaged Flow can reach state-of-the-art conformer generation quality. For fast inference, we show that the reflow and distillation methods of flow-based models enable few-steps or even one-step molecular conformer generation with high quality. The training techniques proposed in this work show a path towards highly efficient molecular conformer generation with flow-based models.</description>

      <title>Observation of Chiral Phonons in Methylbenzylammonium Lead Iodide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An optical phonon at 2.5 meV is observed in a thin film of the chiral metal halide (R-MBA)$_2$PbI$_4$, but is absent in the racemic counterpart, as revealed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. This experimental result indicates the chiral origin of the 2.5 meV mode and supports recent theoretical predictions of chirality transfer from the organic to the inorganic layers, with implications for the spin polarization properties of hybrid metal halides and perovskites.</description>

      <title>What is the diatomic molecule with the largest dipole moment?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a machine learning model for predicting the electric dipole moment of diatomic molecules using only the atomic properties of the constituent atoms. Our model can screen the entire periodic table and identify the molecules with the largest dipole moment for applications in cold molecular sciences, or find the molecule with the largest dipole moment that contains a given atom. Similarly, our model identifies useful trends that explain the dipole moment of molecules, improving our intuition in chemical physics. Finally, we condense our model into an analytical expression to predict the dipole moment in terms of atomic properties.</description>

      <title>Master equation study of three-body recombination of nitrogen and oxygen in non-equilibrium hypersonic flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work aims to study the energy transfer and recombination processes in N$_{2}$$\left(^{1}\sum^{+}_{g}\right)$+N$\left(^{4}S_{u}\right)$ and O$_{2}$$\left(^{3}\sum^{+}_{g}\right)$+O$\left(^{3}P_{2}\right)$ chemical systems when the system is suddenly cooled in a 0-D isothermal reactor thereby inducing strong non-equilibrium. A state-to-state (StS) study of the non-equilibrium phenomenon is crucial for developing accurate and efficient reduced-order models that can accurately capture the thermophysics involved. The gas mixture, consisting primarily of atoms at a high initial temperature of 10,000 K, is suddenly plunged into a low-temperature heat bath to simulate non-equilibrium recombination conditions. The population distribution of microscopic energy levels for each system is determined by solving a system of master equations. The conventional assumption of faster equilibration of rotational mode as compared to the vibrational mode holds for $ N_2 +N$, while it is not a very strong assumption for $ O_2 +O$ as the two relaxation time scales are comparable. Effective recombination rate constants for the quasi-steady state (QSS) period are calculated using the population distribution obtained by solving the master equations. It was also observed that the relaxation time constants for heating and cooling are different, with the time constant being lower for the cooling case due to anharmonicity effects in expanding flows. An attempt has also been made to use the insights from the StS analysis to determine an accurate binning strategy for the recombination processes involved in the two chemical systems.</description>

      <title>Chemistry Beyond the Scale of Exact Diagonalization on a Quantum-Centric Supercomputer</title>

Abstract: A universal quantum computer can simulate diverse quantum systems, with electronic structure for chemistry offering challenging problems for practical use cases around the hundred-qubit mark. While current quantum processors have reached this size, deep circuits and large number of measurements lead to prohibitive runtimes for quantum computers in isolation. Here, we demonstrate the use of classical distributed computing to offload all but an intrinsically quantum component of a workflow for electronic structure simulations. Using a Heron superconducting processor and the supercomputer Fugaku, we simulate the ground-state dissociation of N$_2$ and the [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters, with circuits up to 77 qubits and 10,570 gates. The proposed algorithm processes quantum samples to produce upper bounds for the ground-state energy and sparse approximations to the ground-state wavefunctions. Our results suggest that, for current error rates, a quantum-centric supercomputing architecture can tackle challenging chemistry problems beyond sizes amenable to exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Interface Energy and Phase Transformations: A Comparative Analysis of Cahn-Hilliard and CALPHAD-based Models in Ternary Substitutional Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are various methods for modeling phase transformations in materials science, including general classes of phase-field methods and reactive diffusion methodologies, which most importantly differ in their treatment of interface energy. These methodologies appear mutually exclusive since the respective numerical schemes only allow for their primary use case. To address this issue, a novel methodology for modeling phase transformations in multi-phase, multi-component systems, with particular emphasis on applications in materials science and the study of substitutional alloys is introduced. The fundamental role of interface energy in the evolution of a material's morphology will be studied by example of binary and ternary systems. Allowing full control over the interface energy quantity enables more detailed investigations and bridges the gaps between known methods. We prove the thermodynamic consistency of the derived method and discuss several use cases, such as vacancy-mediated diffusion. Furthermore a scheme for relating Onsager and Diffusion coefficients is proposed, which allows us to study the intricate coupling that is observed in multicomponent systems. We hope to contribute to the development of new mathematical tools for modeling complex phase transformations in materials science.</description>

      <title>Laser fluence-dependent production of molecular thorium ions in different charge states for trapped-ion experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thorium ions and molecules, recognized for their distinctive nuclear and atomic attributes, are central to numerous trapped-ion experiments globally. Our study introduces an effective, compact source of thorium ions produced via laser ablation of microgram-scale, salt-based samples. We thoroughly analyze the variety of ion species and charge states generated at varying laser fluences. Utilizing 10$\mu$g of thorium fluoride crystals and laser fluences between $1.00 - 7.00$ J$\cdot$cm$^{-2}$ we produce thorium molecular ions $^{232}$ThF$_x$$^{n+}$ (with $x= 0 - 3$ and charge states up to $n = 3+$), including ThF$^{2+}$ and ThF$^{3+}$. These species are particularly relevant for spectroscopy; ThF$^{3+}$ is valuable for its stable closed-shell configuration, while ThF$^{2+}$, which is isoelectronic to RaF, offers a unique probe for studying nuclear structure and fundamental symmetries due to its simple electronic structure with a single unpaired electron. Density functional theory calculations of the distribution of positive charge in the produced molecular cations and the simplicity of this setup indicate that this method is easily transferable to other actinide systems.</description>

      <title>Reducing Self-Interaction Error in Transition-Metal Oxides with Different Exact-Exchange Fractions for Energy and Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DFT is vital for materials discovery, materials databases, chemical reaction predictions, and machine learning potentials. The widespread use of DFT in materials science aims for "chemical accuracy," but this is limited by the unknown exchange and correlation (XC) functional. A meta-GGA, the restored regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed, r$^2$SCAN XC functional, fulfils 17 exact constraints of the XC energy. r$^2$SCAN still appears inadequate at predicting material properties of strongly correlated compounds. Inaccuracies of r$^2$SCAN arise from functional and density-driven errors, linked to the self-interaction error. We introduce a new method, r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX, for simulating transition metal oxides accurately. r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX uses different fractions of exact exchange: X to set the electronic density, and Y to set the energy density functional approximation. r2SCANY@r2SCANX addresses functional-driven and density-driven inaccuracies. Using just one or two universal parameters, r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX enhances the r$^2$SCAN predictions of the properties of 18 correlated oxides, outperforming the highly parameterized DFT+$U$. The O$_2$ overbinding in r$^2$SCAN (~0.3 eV/O$_2$) reduces to just ~0.03 eV/O$_2$ with any X in r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCANX. Uncertainties for oxide oxidation energies and magnetic moments are reduced by r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN50, minimizing r$^2$SCAN density-driven errors. The computationally efficient r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN is nearly as accurate as the hybrid r$^2$SCAN10 for oxidation energies. Thus, accurate energy differences can be achieved by rate-limiting self-consistent iterations and geometry optimizations with the efficient r$^2$SCAN. Subsequently, expensive hybrid functionals can be applied in a fast-to-execute single post-self-consistent calculation, as in r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN, which is 10 to 300x faster than r$^2$SCAN10.</description>
