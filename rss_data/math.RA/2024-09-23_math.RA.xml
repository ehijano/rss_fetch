      <title>On commutators of unipotent matrices of index 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A commutator of unipotent matrices of index 2 is a matrix of the form $XYX^{-1}Y^{-1}$, where $X$ and $Y$ are unipotent matrices of index 2, that is, $X\ne I_n$, $Y\ne I_n$, and $(X-I_n)^2=(Y-I_n)^2=0_n$. If $n&gt;2$ and $\mathbb F$ is a field with $|\mathbb F|\geq 4$, then it is shown that every $n\times n$ matrix over $\mathbb F$ with determinant 1 is a product of at most four commutators of unipotent matrices of index 2. Consequently, every $n\times n$ matrix over $\mathbb F$ with determinant 1 is a product of at most eight unipotent matrices of index 2. Conditions on $\mathbb F$ are given that improve the upper bound on the commutator factors from four to three or two. The situation for $n=2$ is also considered. This study reveals a connection between factorability into commutators of unipotent matrices and properties of $\mathbb F$ such as its characteristic or its set of perfect squares.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Lie bialgebras via affinization of perm bialgebras and pre-Lie bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the operads of perm algebras and pre-Lie algebras are the Koszul dual each other and hence there is a Lie algebra structure on the tensor product of a perm algebra and a pre-Lie algebra. Conversely, we construct a special perm algebra structure and a special pre-Lie algebra structure on the vector space of Laurent polynomials such that the tensor product with a pre-Lie algebra and a perm algebra being a Lie algebra structure characterizes the pre-Lie algebra and the perm algebra respectively. This is called the affinization of a pre-Lie algebra and a perm algebra respectively. Furthermore we extend such correspondences to the context of bialgebras, that is, there is a bialgebra structure for a perm algebra or a pre-Lie algebra which could be characterized by the fact that its affinization by a quadratic pre-Lie algebra or a quadratic perm algebra respectively gives an infinite-dimensional Lie bialgebra. In the case of perm algebras, the corresponding bialgebra structure is called a perm bialgebra, which can be independently characterized by a Manin triple of perm algebras as well as a matched pair of perm algebras. The notion of the perm Yang-Baxter equation is introduced, whose symmetric solutions give rise to perm bialgebras. There is a correspondence between symmetric solutions of the perm Yang-Baxter equation in perm algebras and certain skew-symmetric solutions of the classical Yang-Baxter equation in the infinite-dimensional Lie algebras induced from the perm algebras. In the case of pre-Lie algebras, the corresponding bialgebra structure is a pre-Lie bialgebra which is well-constructed. The similar correspondences for the related structures are given.</description>

      <title>Scattering diagrams for generalized cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.02416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct scattering diagrams for Chekhov-Shapiro's generalized cluster algebras where exchange polynomials are factorized into binomials, generalizing the cluster scattering diagrams of Gross, Hacking, Keel and Kontsevich. They turn out to be natural objects arising in Fock and Goncharov's cluster duality. Analogous features and structures (such as positivity and the cluster complex structure) in the ordinary case also appear in the generalized situation. With the help of these scattering diagrams, we show that generalized cluster variables are theta functions and hence have certain positivity property with respect to the coefficients in the binomial factors.</description>

      <title>Linear complementary pairs of skew constacyclic codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear complementary pairs (LCPs) of codes have been studied since they were introduced in the context of discussing mitigation measures against possible hardware attacks to integrated circuits. Since the security parameters for LCPs of codes are defined from the (Hamming) distance and the dual distance of the codes in the pair, and the additional algebraic structure of skew constacyclic codes provides tools for studying the dual and the distance of a code, we study the properties of LCPs of skew constacyclic codes. As a result, we give a characterization for those pairs, as well as multiple results that lead to constructing pairs with designed security parameters. We extend skew BCH codes to a constacyclic context and show that an LCP of codes can be immediately constructed from a skew BCH constacyclic code. Additionally, we describe a Hamming weight-preserving automorphism group in the set of skew constacyclic codes, which can be used for constructing LCPs of codes.</description>

      <title>Filtered Boolean powers of finite simple non-abelian Mal'cev algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{A}$ be a finite simple non-abelian Mal'cev algebra (e.g. a group, loop, ring). We investigate the Boolean power $\mathbf{D}$ of $\mathbf{A}$ by the countable atomless Boolean algebra $\mathbf{B}$ filtered at some idempotents $e_1,\dots,e_n$ of $\mathbf{A}$. When $e_1,\dots,e_n$ are all idempotents of $\mathbf{A}$ we establish two concrete representations of $\mathbf{D}$: as the Fra\"iss\'e limit of the class of finite direct powers of $\mathbf{A}$, and as congruence classes of the countable free algebra in the variety generated by $\mathbf{A}$. Further, for arbitrary $e_1,\dots,e_n$, we show that $\mathbf{D}$ is $\omega$-categorical and that its automorphism group has the small index property, strong uncountable cofinality and the Bergman property. As necessary background we establish some general properties of congruences and automorphisms of filtered Boolean powers of $\mathbf{A}$ by any Boolean algebra $\mathbf{B}$, including a semidirect decomposition for their automorphism groups.</description>
