      <title>To Be a Truster or Not to Be: Evolutionary Dynamics of a Symmetric N-Player Trust Game in Well-Mixed and Networked Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trust and reciprocation of it form the foundation of economic, social and other interactions. While the Trust Game is widely used to study these concepts for interactions between two players, often alternating different roles (i.e., investor and trustee), its extensions to multi-player scenarios have been restricted to instances where players assume only one role. We propose a symmetric N-player Trust Game, in which players alternate between two roles, and the payoff of the player is defined as the average across their two roles and drives the evolutionary game dynamics. We find that prosocial strategies are harder to evolve with the present symmetric N-player Trust Game than with the Public Goods Game, which is well studied. In particular, trust fails to evolve regardless of payoff function nonlinearity in well-mixed populations in the case of the symmetric N-player trust game. In structured populations, nonlinear payoffs can have strong impacts on the evolution of trust. The same nonlinearity can yield substantially different outcomes, depending on the nature of the underlying network. Our results highlight the importance of considering both payoff structures and network topologies in understanding the emergence and maintenance of prosocial behaviours.</description>

      <title>Point process analysis of geographical diffusion of news in Argentina</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffusion of information plays a crucial role in a society, affecting its economy and the well-being of the population. Characterizing the diffusion process is challenging because it is highly non-stationary and varies with the media type. To understand the spreading of newspaper news in Argentina, we collected data from more than 27000 articles published in six main provinces during four months. We classified the articles into 20 thematic axes and obtained a set of time series that capture daily newspaper attention on different topics in different provinces. To analyze the data we use a point process approach. For each topic, $n$, and for all pairs of provinces, $i$ and $j$, we use two measures to quantify the synchronicity of the events, $Q_s(i,j)$, which quantifies the number of events that occur almost simultaneously in $i$ and $j$, and $Q_a(i,j)$, which quantifies the direction of news spreading. Our analysis unveils how fast the information diffusion process is, showing pairs of provinces with very similar and almost simultaneous temporal variations of media attention. On the other hand, we also calculate other measures computed from the raw time series, such as Granger Causality and Transfer Entropy, which do not perform well in this context because they often return opposite directions of information transfer. We interpret this as due to different factors such as the characteristics of the data, which is highly non-stationary and the features of the information diffusion process, which is very fast and probably acts at a sub-resolution time scale.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Evidence Synthesis for Modeling SARS-CoV-2 Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The acute phase of the Covid-19 pandemic has made apparent the need for decision support based upon accurate epidemic modeling. This process is substantially hampered by under-reporting of cases and related data incompleteness issues. In this article we adopt the Bayesian paradigm and synthesize publicly available data via a discrete-time stochastic epidemic modeling framework. The models allow for estimating the total number of infections while accounting for the endemic phase of the pandemic. We assess the prediction of the infection rate utilizing mobility information, notably the principal components of the mobility data. We evaluate variational Bayes in this context and find that Hamiltonian Monte Carlo offers a robust inference alternative for such models. We elaborate upon vector analysis of the epidemic dynamics, thus enriching the traditional tools used for decision making. In particular, we show how certain 2-dimensional plots on the phase plane may yield intuitive information regarding the speed and the type of transmission dynamics. We investigate the potential of a two-stage analysis as a consequence of cutting feedback, for inference on certain functionals of the model parameters. Finally, we show that a point mass on critical parameters is overly restrictive and investigate informative priors as a suitable alternative.</description>

      <title>Retrieving Top-k Hyperedge Triplets: Models and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems frequently exhibit multi-way, rather than pairwise, interactions. These group interactions cannot be faithfully modeled as collections of pairwise interactions using graphs and instead require hypergraphs. However, methods that analyze hypergraphs directly, rather than via lossy graph reductions, remain limited. Hypergraph motifs hold promise in this regard, as motif patterns serve as building blocks for larger group interactions which are inexpressible by graphs. Recent work has focused on categorizing and counting hypergraph motifs based on the existence of nodes in hyperedge intersection regions. Here, we argue that the relative sizes of hyperedge intersections within motifs contain varied and valuable information. We propose a suite of efficient algorithms for finding top-k triplets of hyperedges based on optimizing the sizes of these intersection patterns. This formulation uncovers interesting local patterns of interaction, finding hyperedge triplets that either (1) are the least similar with each other, (2) have the highest pairwise but not groupwise correlation, or (3) are the most similar with each other. We formalize this as a combinatorial optimization problem and design efficient algorithms based on filtering hyperedges. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation shows that the resulting hyperedge triplets yield insightful information on real-world hypergraphs. Our approach is also orders of magnitude faster than a naive baseline implementation.</description>

      <title>Modeling Epidemic Spread: A Gaussian Process Regression Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09384v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling epidemic spread is critical for informing policy decisions aimed at mitigation. Accordingly, in this work we present a new data-driven method based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) to model epidemic spread through the difference on the logarithmic scale of the infected cases. We bound the variance of the predictions made by GPR, which quantifies the impact of epidemic data on the proposed model. Next, we derive a high-probability error bound on the prediction error in terms of the distance between the training points and a testing point, the posterior variance, and the level of change in the spreading process, and we assess how the characteristics of the epidemic spread and infection data influence this error bound. We present examples that use GPR to model and predict epidemic spread by using real-world infection data gathered in the UK during the COVID-19 epidemic. These examples illustrate that, under typical conditions, the prediction for the next twenty days has 94.29% of the noisy data located within the 95% confidence interval, validating these predictions. We further compare the modeling and prediction results with other methods, such as polynomial regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN) regression, and neural networks, to demonstrate the benefits of leveraging GPR in disease spread modeling.</description>
