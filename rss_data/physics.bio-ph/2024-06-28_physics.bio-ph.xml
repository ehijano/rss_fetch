      <title>Measurement of dynamic nonlocal deformation using nanodiamond sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocal deformation sensing achieved by integrating atomic force microscopy indentation with nanodiamond-based orientation tracking features high precision and high spatial resolution, providing a useful technique for studying the mechanical properties of soft biological systems. However, this technique is currently limited to lifeless systems because it cannot differentiate the indentation-induced deformation from that associated with live activities or other external perturbations. Here we develop a dynamic nonlocal deformation sensing method using oscillatory nanoindentation and spectroscopic analysis to overcome this limitation. The method realizes both temporally and spatially resolved mechanical analysis, with tens of microsecond time-lag precision, nanometer vertical deformation precision, and sub-hundred nanometer lateral spatial resolution, leading to the disclosure of surface/interface effects in the mechanical response of viscoelastic materials and live cells. Neglecting surface tension would underestimate the liquid-like characteristics of the materials. This work demonstrates nanodiamond sensors as a useful tool for spatial-temporal mechanical analysis of soft, complex bio-relevant materials.</description>

      <title>The modelling of the action potentials in myelinated nerve fibres</title>

Abstract: The classical Hodgkin-Huxley model describes the propagation of an axon potential (AP) in unmyelinated axons. In many cases the axons have a myelin sheath and the experimental studies have then revealed significant changes in the velocity of APs. In this paper, a theoretical model is proposed describing the AP propagation in myelinated axons. As far as the velocity of an AP is affected, the basis of the model is taken after Lieberstein, who included the possible effect of inductance that might influence velocity, into the governing equation. The proposed model includes the structural properties of the myelin sheath: the $\mu$-factor (the ratio of the length of the myelin sheath and the Ranvier node) and g-ratio (the ratio of the inner-to-outer diameter of a myelinated axon) through parameter $\gamma$. It is demonstrated that the Lieberstein model can describe all the essential effects characteristic to the formation and propagation of an AP in an unmyelinated axon. Then a phenomenological model for a myelinated axon is described including the influence of the structural properties of the myelin sheath and the radius of an axon. The numerical simulation using the physical variables demonstrates the changes in the velocity of an AP as well as the changes in its profile. These results match well the known effects from experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Fluorescence-enhanced photodynamic assessments for human breast cancer cell characterizations</title>

Abstract: The primary and metastatic stages of BC consider different cancerous cell lines (MDAs), meaning the highest number of cells in this research (300,000) represents the metastatic stages of BC, and 50,000 represents the primary level of BC developments have been studied based on fluorescence-enhanced photodynamic characterizations. The ability to characterize the fluorescence caused by MDA with 50,000 cells compared to the dominant radiation of MDA with 300,000 cells is emphatic proof of the high potential of fluorescence technique in timely BC detections. 5-ALA induces an accumulation of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) photosensitizer through a biosynthetic pathway, leading to red radiation of fluorescence measurements. The fluorescence signal reduction due to decreased cell viability and increased MDA's cellular death rate corresponds to the changes in lipid metabolism enzymes of MDAs cultured at different doses. Furthermore, statistical concerns have been studied using PCA multivariate component analysis to differentiate MDA cells administrated by 5-ALA.</description>

      <title>Phase boundaries promote chemical reactions through localized fluxes</title>

Abstract: One of the hypothesized functions of biomolecular condensates is to act as chemical reactors, where chemical reactions can be modulated, i.e. accelerated or slowed down, while substrate molecules enter and products exit from the condensate. Likewise, the components themselves that take part in the architectural integrity of condensates might be modified by active (energy consuming, non-equilibrium) processes, e.g. by ATPase chaperones or by kinases and phosphatases. In this work, we study how the presence of spatial inhomogeneities, such as in the case of liquid-liquid phase separation, affects active chemical reactions and results in the presence of directional flows of matter, which are one of the hallmarks of non-equilibirum processes. We establish the minimal conditions for the existence of such spatial currents, and we furthermore find that these fluxes are maximal at the condensate interface. These results propose that some condensates might be most efficient as chemical factories due to their interfaces rather than their volumes, and could suggest a possible biological reason for the the observed abundance of small non-fusing condensates inside the cell, thus maximizing their surface and the associated fluxes.</description>

      <title>Emergence of metachronal waves in a chain of symmetrically beating filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that metachronal waves (MCWs) can emerge from a chain of symmetrically beating nematodes aligned at the edge of sessile droplets. Our study, employing a coupled elastohydrodynamic model of active filaments, elucidates that a misalignment caused by a tilt against the bounding wall disrupts the synchronization and generates a constant time lag between adjacent filaments, leading to MCWs. The MCWs, enhancing the fluid circulation, achieve their maximum thermodynamic efficiency over the same range of tilt angles observed in the nematode experiments.</description>

      <title>Efficient approximations of transcriptional bursting effects on the dynamics of a gene regulatory network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical models of gene regulatory networks are widely used to study cell fate changes and transcriptional regulation. When designing such models, it is important to accurately account for sources of stochasticity. However, doing so can be computationally expensive and analytically untractable, posing limits on the extent of our explorations and on parameter inference. Here, we explore this challenge using the example of a simple auto-negative feedback motif, in which we incorporate stochastic variation due to transcriptional bursting and noise from finite copy numbers. We find that transcriptional bursting may change the qualitative dynamics of the system by inducing oscillations when they would not otherwise be present, or by magnifying existing oscillations. We describe multiple levels of approximation for the model in the form of differential equations, piecewise deterministic processes, and stochastic differential equations. Importantly, we derive how the classical chemical Langevin equation can be extended to include a noise term representing transcriptional bursting. This approximation drastically decreases computation times and allows us to analytically calculate properties of the dynamics, such as their power spectrum. We explore when these approximations break down and provide recommendations for their use. Our analysis illustrates the importance of accounting for transcriptional bursting when simulating gene regulatory network dynamics and provides recommendations to do so with computationally efficient methods.</description>
