      <title>Earth's Alfv\'{e}n Wings: Unveiling Dynamic Variations of Field-line Topologies with Electron Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic cloud (MC) of the Coronal Mass Ejection on April 24, 2023, contains sub-Alfv\'{e}nic solar wind, transforming Earth's magnetosphere from conventional bow-shock magnetotail configuration to Alfv\'{e}n wings. Utilizing measurements from the Magnetosphere Multiscale (MMS) mission, we present for the first time electron distribution signatures as the spacecraft traverses through various magnetic topologies during this transformation. Specifically, we characterize electrons inside the sub-Alfv\'{e}nic MC, on the dawn-dusk wing field lines and on the closed field lines. The signatures include strahl electrons in MC regions and energetic keV electrons streaming along the dawn and dusk wing field lines. We demonstrate the distribution signatures of dual wing reconnection, defined as reconnection between dawn-dusk Alfv\'{e}n wing field lines and the IMF. These signatures include four electron populations comprised of partially-depleted MC electrons and bi-directional energetic electrons with variations in energy and pitch-angle. The distributions reveal evidence of bursty magnetic reconnection under northward IMF.</description>

      <title>Review of the August 1972 and March 1989 Space Weather Events: Can We Learn Anything New From Them?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Updated summaries of the August 1972 and March 1989 space weather events have been constructed. The features of these two events are compared to the Carrington 1859 event and a few other major space weather events. It is concluded that solar active regions release energy in a variety of forms (X-rays, EUV photons, visible light, coronal mass ejection (CME) plasmas and fields) and they in turn can produce other energetic effects (solar energetic particles (SEPs), magnetic storms) in a variety of ways. It is clear that there is no strong one-to-one relationship between these various energy sinks. The energy is often distributed differently from one space weather event to the next. Concerning SEPs accelerated at interplanetary CME (ICME) shocks, it is concluded that the Fermi mechanism associated with quasi-parallel shocks is relatively weak and that the gradient drift mechanism (electric fields) at quasi-perpendicular shocks will produce harder spectra and higher fluxes. If the 4 Augusut 1972 intrinsic magnetic cloud condition (southward interplanetary magnetic field instead of northward) and the interplanetary Sun to 1 au conditions were different, a 4 August 1972 magnetic storm and magnetospheric dawn-to-dusk electric fields substantially larger than the Carrington event would have occurred. Under these special interplanetary conditions, a Miyake et al. (2012)-like extreme SEP event may have been formed. The long duration complex 1989 storm was probably greater than the Carrington storm in the sense that the total ring current particle energy was larger.</description>

      <title>Derivation of generalized Kappa distribution from scaling properties of solar wind magnetic field fluctuations at kinetic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic scale dynamics in weakly-collisional space plasmas usually exhibits a self-similar statistics of magnetic field fluctuations which implies the existence of an invariant probability density function (master curve). We provide an analytical derivation of the master curve by assuming that perpendicular fluctuations can be modeled through a scale-dependent Langevin equation. In our model, magnetic field fluctuations are the stochastic variable and their scale-to-scale evolution is assumed to be a Langevin process. We propose a formal derivation of the master curve describing the statistics of the fluctuations at kinetic scales. Model predictions are tested on independent data samples of fast solar wind measured near the Sun by Parker Solar Probe and near the Earth by Cluster. The master curve is a generalization of the Kappa distribution with two parameters: one regulating the tails and the other one controlling the asymmetry. Model predictions match the spacecraft observations up to 5$\sigma$ and even beyond in the case of perpendicular magnetic field fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Effective dose equivalent estimation for humans on Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exposure to cosmic radiation is a major concern in space exploration. On the Martian surface, a complex radiation field is present, formed by a constant influx of galactic cosmic radiation and the secondary particles produced by their interaction with the planet's atmosphere and regolith. In this work, a Martian environment model was developed using MCNP6 following the guidelines of the 1st Mars Space Radiation Modeling Workshop. The accuracy of the model was tested by comparing particle spectra and dose rate results with other model results and measurements from the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) onboard the Curiosity rover, taken between November 15, 2015, and January 15, 2016. The ICRP's voxel-type computational phantoms were then implemented into the code. Organ dose and effective dose equivalent were assessed for the same time period. The viability of a mission on the surface of Mars for extended periods of time under the assumed conditions was here investigated.</description>

      <title>In situ observations of large amplitude Alfv\'en waves heating and accelerating the solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After leaving the Sun's corona, the solar wind continues to accelerate and cools, but more slowly than expected for a freely expanding adiabatic gas. We use in situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter spacecrafts to investigate a stream of solar wind as it traverses the inner heliosphere. The observations show heating and acceleration of the the plasma between the outer edge of the corona and near the orbit of Venus, in connection to the presence of large amplitude Alfv\'en waves. Alfv\'en waves are perturbations in the interplanetary magnetic field that transport energy. Our calculations show the damping and mechanical work performed by the Alfv\'en waves is sufficient to power the heating and acceleration of the fast solar wind in the inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>INTENTAS -- An entanglement-enhanced atomic sensor for microgravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The INTENTAS project aims to develop an atomic sensor utilizing entangled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a microgravity environment. This key achievement is necessary to advance the capability for measurements that benefit from both entanglement-enhanced sensitivities and extended interrogation times. The project addresses significant challenges related to size, weight, and power management (SWaP) specific to the experimental platform at the Einstein-Elevator in Hannover. The design ensures a low-noise environment essential for the creation and detection of entanglement. Additionally, the apparatus features an innovative approach to the all-optical creation of BECs, providing a flexible system for various configurations and meeting the requirements for rapid turnaround times. Successful demonstration of this technology in the Einstein-Elevator will pave the way for a future deployment in space, where its potential applications will unlock high-precision quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Decoding the formation of hammerhead ion populations observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In situ observations by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) have revealed new properties of the proton velocity distributions, including hammerhead features that suggest non-isotropic broadening of the beams. The present work proposes a very plausible explanation for the formation of these populations through the action of a proton firehose-like instability triggered by the proton beam. The quasi-linear (QL) theory proposed here shows that the resulting right-hand (RH) waves have two consequences on the protons: (i) reduce the relative drift between the beam and the core, but above all, (ii) induce a strong perpendicular temperature anisotropy, specific to the observed hammerhead ion strahl. Moreover, the long-run QL results suggest that these hammerhead distributions are rather transitory states, still subject to relaxation mechanisms, of which instabilities like the one discussed here are very likely involved.</description>

      <title>Italian Spring Accelerometer measurements of unexpected Non Gravitational Perturbation during BepiColombo second Venus swing-by</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Italian Spring Accelerometer (ISA) is a three axis mass-spring accelerometer, one of the payloads of the BepiColombo joint space mission between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). At launch in October 2018, BepiColombo started its seven-year cruise as a stack of three different modules, overall named Mercury Composite Spacecraft (MCS). The spacecraft will provide BepiColombo the necessary Delta V to reach Mercury with its electric thrusters and along with one, two and six gravity assists, respectively with Earth, Venus and Mercury. The accelerometer is accommodated on the Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) module and, jointly with the Ka-band Transponder (KaT) tracking data, will primarily serve the BepiColombo Radio Science Experiment (BC-RSE). During the second Venus swing-by, strong tidal effect and external perturbations was expected to act on the spacecraft and to become detectable by ISA. The swing-by had a closest approach of about 550 km and the gravity gradient expected on the IDA sensing elements was perfectly measured. Hence, in this paper, the first direct Gravity Gradient effect detection generated by an extraterrestrial body is shown. Nevertheless, around the closest approach, the measurements evidenced a spurious acceleration event lasting for several minutes. This work, exploiting information on the Attitude and Orbit Control System (AOCS) commanded torques, focuses and analyses this ISA acceleration signal, ascribing it to a net force really acting on the MCS spacecraft. Furthermore, using an estimation method, the application point of the force is confined to an area close to the MPO radiator.</description>

      <title>SIP-IFVM: An efficient time-accurate implicit MHD model of corona and CME with strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CMEs are one of the main drivers of space weather. However, robust and efficient numerical modeling of the initial stages of CME propagation and evolution process in the sub-Alfvenic corona is still lacking. Based on the highly efficient quasi-steady-state implicit MHD coronal model (Feng et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2022a), we further develop an efficient and time-accurate coronal model and employ it to simulate the CME's evolution and propagation. A pseudo-time marching method, where a pseudo time, tau, is introduced at each physical time step to update the solution by solving a steady-state problem on tau, is devised to improve the temporal accuracy. Moreover, an RBSL flux rope whose axis can be designed in an arbitrary shape is inserted into the background corona to trigger the CME event. We call it the SIP-IFVM coronal model and utilize it to simulate a CME evolution process from the solar surface to 20 Rs in the background corona of CR 2219. It can finish the CME simulation covering 6 hours of physical time by less than 0.5 hours (192 CPU cores, 1 M cells) without much loss in temporal accuracy. Besides, an ad hoc simulation with initial magnetic fields artificially increased shows that this model can effectively deal with time-dependent low-beta problems (beta&lt;0.0005). Additionally, an Orszag-Tang MHD vortex flow simulation demonstrates that the pseudo-time-marching method adopted in this coronal model is also capable of simulating small-scale unsteady-state flows. The simulation results show that this MHD coronal model is very efficient and numerically stable and is promising to timely and accurately simulate time-varying events in solar corona with low plasma beta.</description>

      <title>An efficient, time-evolving, global MHD coronal model based on COCONUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MHD coronal models are critical in the Sun-to-Earth model chain and the most complex and computationally intensive component, particularly the time-evolving coronal models, typically driven by a series of time-evolving photospheric magnetograms. There is an urgent need to develop efficient and reliable time-evolving MHD coronal models to further improve our ability to predict space weather. COCONUT is a rapidly developing MHD coronal model. Adopting the efficient implicit algorithm makes it suitable for performing computationally intensive time-evolving coronal simulations. This paper aims to extend COCONUT to an efficient time-evolving MHD coronal model. In this MHD model, as usual, an implicit temporal integration algorithm is adopted to avoid the CFL stability restriction and increase computational efficiency by large time steps. The Newton iteration method is applied within each time step to enhance the temporal accuracy. The unstructured geodesic mesh is used for flexibility in mesh division and to avoid degeneracy at the poles. Furthermore, an HLL Riemann solver with a self-adjustable dissipation term accommodates both low- and high-speed flows. A series of time-evolving photospheric magnetograms are utilized to drive the evolution of coronal structures from the solar surface to 25Rs during two Carrington rotations (CRs) around the 2019 eclipse in an inertial coordinate system. It shows that COCONUT can mimic the coronal evolution during a full CR within 9 hours (1080 CPU cores, 1.5M cells). We also compare the simulation results of time-evolving versus quasi-steady-state coronal simulations in the thermodynamic MHD model to validate the time-evolving approach. Additionally, we evaluate the effect of time steps on the simulation results to find an optimal time step that simultaneously maintains high efficiency and necessary numerical stability and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Short-Term Space Occupancy and Conjunction Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conjunction analysis (CA) for resident space objects (RSOs) is essential for preventing collisions in an increasingly crowded orbital environment and preserving the operational integrity of satellites. A first and fundamental step in the CA process is to estimate the range of altitudes that each object can occupy, throughout an operational screening time of, typically, a few days. In this paper, a method is poroposed to analytically evaluate such range of altitudes in a zonal problem model and for a time horizon of generic duration thereby generalizing the concept of space occupancy (SO) introduced in a recent work. The proposed method is exploited to construct a new conjunction filter that considerably improves the classical apogee-perigee filter routinely employed in CA. The effectiveness of the new filter is assessed in a low-Earth orbit (LEO) scenario using a high-fidelity perturbation model across a broad spectrum of orbits and conjunction geometries. Additionally, the method is applied to space traffic management providing a rapid and efficient means to examine the radial overlap of RSOs in LEO and track its progression in time.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the type-III radiation observed near the Sun</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05984v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\textit{AIMS.}$ To investigate processes associated with generation of type-III radiation.
  $\textit{METHODS.}$ Measure the amplitudes and phase velocities of Parker Solar Probe observed electric fields, magnetic fields, and plasma density fluctuations.
  $\textit{RESULTS.}$ (1) There are slow electrostatic waves near the Langmuir frequency and at as many as six harmonics, the number of which increases with the amplitude of the Langmuir wave. Their electrostatic nature is shown by measurement of the plasma density fluctuations. From these density fluctuations and the electric field magnitude, the k-value of the Langmuir wave is estimated to be 0.14 and $k \lambda_d$ = 0.4. Even with a large uncertainty in this quantity (more than a factor of two) the phase velocity of the Langmuir wave was &lt;10,000 km/sec. (2) There is an electromagnetic wave near the Langmuir frequency having a phase velocity &lt;50,000 km/sec. (3) Whether there are electromagnetic waves at the harmonics of the Langmuir frequency cannot be determined because, if they existed, their magnetic field components would be below the noise level of the measurement. (4) The rapid (less than one msec) amplitude variations typical of the Langmuir wave and its harmonics are artifacts resulting from addition of two waves, one of which has small frequency variations that arise from traveling through density irregularities. None of these results are expected in or consistent with the conventional model of the three-wave interaction of two counter-streaming Langmuir waves that coalesce to produce the type-III wave. They are consistent with a new model in which electrostatic antenna waves are produced at the harmonics by radiation of the Langmuir wave, after which at least the first harmonic wave evolved through density irregularities such that its wave number decreased and it became the type-III radiation.</description>
