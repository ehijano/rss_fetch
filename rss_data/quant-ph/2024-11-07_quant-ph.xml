      <title>Boosting thermalization of classical and quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and optimizing the relaxation dynamics of many-body systems is essential for both foundational studies in quantum thermodynamics, as well as for applications including quantum simulation and quantum computing. Efficient thermal state preparation of a given many-body Hamiltonian depends on the spectrum of Lindbladian defined via jump operators. In this work we provide a systematic framework allowing construction of an optimal Lindbladian resulting in fast thermal state preparation for a considered Hamiltonian. Importantly, the optimal Lindbladian respects the symmetries of the target equilibrium state. We demonstrate the potential of our framework and optimization with the kinetic Ising model and the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, showcasing efficient thermal state preparation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, loss, and quantumness: When balanced beam splitters are best</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crux of quantum optics is using beam splitters to generate entanglement, including in pioneering experiments conducted by Hanbury-Brown and Twiss and Hong, Ou, and Mandel. This lies at the heart of what makes boson sampling hard to emulate by classical computers and is a vital component of quantum computation with light. Yet, despite overwhelming positive evidence, the conjecture that beam splitters with equal reflection and transmission probabilities generate the most entanglement for any state interfered with the vacuum has remained unproven for almost two decades [Asb\'oth et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{94}, 173602 (2005)]. We prove this conjecture for ubiquitous entanglement monotones by uncovering monotonicity, convexity, and entropic properties of states undergoing photon loss. Because beam splitters are so fundamental, our results yield numerous corollaries for quantum optics, from inequalities for quasiprobability distributions to proofs of a recent conjecture for the evolution of a measure of quantumness through loss. One can now definitively state: the more balanced a beam splitter, the more entanglement it can generate with the vacuum.</description>

      <title>Efficient preparation of Dicke states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm utilizing mid-circuit measurement and feedback that prepares Dicke states with polylogarithmically many ancillas and polylogarithmic depth. Our algorithm uses only global mid-circuit projective measurements and adaptively-chosen global rotations. This improves over prior work that was only efficient for Dicke states of low weight, or was not efficient in both depth and width. Our algorithm can also naturally be implemented in a cavity QED context using polylogarithmic time, zero ancillas, and atom-photon coupling scaling with the square root of the system size.</description>

      <title>Towards Entropic Constraints on Quantum Speedups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some quantum algorithms have "quantum speedups": improved time complexity as compared with the best-known classical algorithms for solving the same tasks. Can we understand what fuels these speedups from an entropic perspective? Information theory gives us a multitude of metrics we might choose from to measure how fundamentally 'quantum' is the behavior of a quantum computer running an algorithm. The entanglement entropies for subsystems of a quantum state can be analyzed for subsystems of qubits in a quantum computer throughout the running of an algorithm. Here, a framework for making this entropic analysis is constructed, and performed on a selection of quantum circuits implementing known fast quantum algorithms and subroutines: Grover search, the quantum Fourier transform, and phase estimation. Our results are largely unsatisfactory: known entropy inequalities do not suffice to identify the presence or absence of quantum speedups. Although we know our algorithms must have quantum "magic", the Ingleton inequality, which holds for all entropies of subsystems of stabilizer states, is not violated in any of our examples. In some cases, however, monogamy of mutual information, which is obeyed for product states but violated for highly entangled bipartite states such as the $GHZ$ states, fails at some point in the course of our quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Mixed-State Topological Order under Coherent Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed-state phases of matter under local decoherence have recently garnered significant attention due to the ubiquitous presence of noise in current quantum processors. One of the key issues is understanding how topological quantum memory is affected by realistic coherent noises, such as random rotation noise and amplitude damping noise. In this work, we investigate the intrinsic error threshold of the two-dimensional toric code, a paradigmatic topological quantum memory, under these coherent noises by employing both analytical and numerical methods based on the doubled Hilbert space formalism. A connection between the mixed-state phase of the decohered toric code and a non-Hermitian Ashkin-Teller-type statistical mechanics model is established, and the mixed-state phase diagrams under the coherent noises are obtained. We find remarkable stability of mixed-state topological order under random rotation noise with axes near the $Y$-axis of qubits. We also identify intriguing extended critical regions at the phase boundaries, highlighting a connection with non-Hermitian physics. The upper bounds for the intrinsic error threshold are determined by these phase boundaries, beyond which quantum error correction becomes impossible.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the matching decoder for the Chamon code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different choices of quantum error-correcting codes can reduce the demands on the physical hardware needed to build a quantum computer. To achieve the full potential of a code, we must develop practical decoding algorithms that can correct errors that have occurred with high likelihood. Matching decoders are very good at correcting local errors while also demonstrating fast run times that can keep pace with physical quantum devices. We implement variations of a matching decoder for a three-dimensional, non-CSS, low-density parity check code known as the Chamon code, which has a non-trivial structure that does not lend itself readily to this type of decoding. The non-trivial structure of the syndrome of this code means that we can supplement the decoder with additional steps to improve the threshold error rate, below which the logical failure rate decreases with increasing code distance. We find that a generalized matching decoder that is augmented by a belief-propagation step prior to matching gives a threshold of 10.5% for depolarising noise.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Non-Markovian and Coherent Errors Using Quantum Process Tomography of Proxy States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting mitigating and correcting errors in quantum control is among the most pertinent contemporary problems in quantum technologies. We consider three of the most common bosonic error correction codes -- the CLY, binomial and dual rail and compare their performance under typical errors in bosonic systems. We find that the dual rail code shows the best performance. We also develop a new technique for error mitigation in quantum control. We consider a quantum system with large Hilbert space dimension, e.g., a qudit or a multi-qubit system and construct two $2- $ dimensional subspaces -- a code space, $\mathcal C = \text{span}\{|\bar{0}\rangle, |\bar{1}\rangle\}$ where the logical qubit is encoded and a ``proxy'' space $\mathcal P = \text{span}\{|\bar{0}'\rangle, |\bar{1}'\rangle\}$. While the qubit (i.e., $\mathcal C$) can be a part of a quantum circuit, the proxy (i.e., $\mathcal P$) remains idle. In the absence of errors, the quantum state of the proxy qubit does not evolve in time. If $\mathcal E$ is an error channel acting on the full system, we consider its projections on $\mathcal C$ and $\mathcal P$ represented as pauli transfer matrices $T_{\mathcal E}$ and $T'_{\mathcal E}$ respectively. Under reasonable assumptions regarding the origin of the errors, $T_{\mathcal E}$ can be inferred from $T'_{\mathcal E}$ acting on the proxy qubit and the latter can be measured without affecting the qubit. The latter can be measured while the qubit is a part of a quantum circuit because, one can perform simultaneous measurements on the logical and the proxy qubits. We use numerical data to learn an \textit{affine map} $\phi$ such that $T_{\mathcal E} \approx \phi(T'_{\mathcal E})$. We also show that the inversion of a suitable proxy space's logical pauli transfer matrix can effectively mitigate the noise on the two modes bosonic system or two qudits system.</description>

      <title>There and Back Again: Quantum Radiation from Round-trip Flying Mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erasing a black hole leaves spacetime flat, so light passing through the region before any star forms and after black hole's evaporation shows no time delay, just like a flying mirror that returns to its initial starting point. Quantum radiation from a round-trip flying mirror has not been solved despite the model's mathematical simplicity and physical clarity. Here, we solve the particle creation from worldlines that asymptotically start and stop at the same spot, resulting in interesting spectra and symmetries, including the time dependence of thermal radiance associated with Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac Bogolubov coefficients. Fourier analysis, intrinsically linked to the Bogolubov mechanism, shows that a thermal Bogolubov distribution does not describe the spin statistics of the quantum field.</description>

      <title>Gauge-Fixing Quantum Density Operators At Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide theory, algorithms, and simulations of non-equilibrium quantum systems using a one-dimensional (1D) completely-positive (CP), matrix-product (MP) density-operator ($\rho$) representation. By generalizing the matrix product state's orthogonality center, to additionally store positive classical mixture correlations, the MP$\rho$ factorization naturally emerges. In this work we analytically and numerically examine the virtual freedoms associated with the representation of quantum density operators. Using this augmented perspective, we simplify algorithms in certain limits to integrate the canonical form's master equation dynamics. This enables us to quickly evolve under the dynamics of two-body quantum channels without resorting to optimization-based methods. In addition to this technical advance, we also scale-up numerical examples and discuss implications for accurately modeling hardware architectures and predicting their performance. This includes an example of the quantum to classical transition of informationally leaky, i.e., decohering, qubits. In this setting, due to loss from environmental interactions, non-local complex coherence correlations are converted into local and incoherent classical statistical mixture correlations. Lastly, the representation of both global and local correlations is discussed. We expect this work to have applications in additional non-equilibrium settings beyond qubit engineering.</description>

      <title>Programming an Optical Lattice Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programming a quantum device describes the usage of quantum logic gates, agnostic of hardware specifics, to perform a sequence of operations with (typically) a computing or sensing task in mind. Such programs have been executed on digital quantum computers, which despite their noisy character, have shown the ability to optimize metrological functions, for example in the generation of spin squeezing and optimization of quantum Fisher information for signals manifesting as spin rotations in a quantum register. However, the qubits of these programmable quantum sensors are tightly spatially confined and therefore suboptimal for enclosing the kinds of large spacetime areas required for performing inertial sensing. In this work, we derive a set of quantum logic gates for a cold atom optical lattice interferometer that manipulates the momentum of atoms. Here, the operations are framed in terms of single qubit operations and mappings between qubit subspaces with internal levels given by the Bloch (crystal) eigenstates of the lattice. We describe how the quantum optimal control method of direct collocation is well suited for obtaining the modulation waveforms of the lattice which achieve these operations.</description>

      <title>Holographic deep thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random quantum states play a critical role in quantum information processing. While random quantum circuits typically provide pseudo-random states, deep thermalization introduces quantum measurement to generate genuinely random states. However, the requirement of large ancillae in conventional deep thermalization poses a challenge to scale up the system size. We introduce holographic deep thermalization to substantially reduce the required ancillae to a system-size independent constant. Our circuit design trades space with time, via adopting a sequential application of an scrambling-measure-reset process on a small number of ancillae. Via tuning the ancilla size and number of time steps, holographic deep thermalization allows a continuous trade-off between the total quantum circuit size and the ancilla size. In the case of finite-size systems, we further enhance the performance of holographic deep thermalization via generative quantum machine learning, which leads to constant-factor advantages in the convergence towards Haar random. The theoretical predictions are verified with IBM Quantum noisy simulations.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving quantum algorithms for linear and nonlinear Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian systems of ordinary and partial differential equations are fundamental across modern science and engineering, appearing in models that span virtually all physical scales. A critical property for the robustness and stability of computational methods in such systems is the symplectic structure, which preserves geometric properties like phase-space volume over time and energy conservation over an extended period. In this paper, we present quantum algorithms that incorporate symplectic integrators, ensuring the preservation of this key structure. We demonstrate how these algorithms maintain the symplectic properties for both linear and nonlinear Hamiltonian systems. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the computational complexity, showing that our approach offers both accuracy and improved efficiency over classical algorithms. These results highlight the potential application of quantum algorithms for solving large-scale Hamiltonian systems while preserving essential physical properties.</description>

      <title>Increasing the Hardness of Posiform Planting Using Random QUBOs for Programmable Quantum Annealer Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Posiform planting is a method for constructing QUBO problems with a single unique planted solution that can be tailored to arbitrary connectivity graphs. In this study we investigate making posiform planted QUBOs computationally harder by fusing many smaller random discrete coefficient spin-glass Ising models, whose global minimum energy is computed classically using classical binary integer programming optimization software, with posiform-planted QUBOs. The single unique ground-state solution of the resulting QUBO problem is the concatenation of (exactly one of) the ground-states of each of the smaller problems. We apply these modified posiform planted QUBOs to the task of benchmarking programmable D-Wave quantum annealers. The proposed method enables generating binary variable combinatorial optimization problems that cover the entire quantum annealing processor hardware graph, have a unique solution, are entirely hardware-graph-native, and can have tunable computational hardness. We benchmark the capabilities of three D-Wave superconducting qubit quantum annealing processors, having from 563 up to 5627 qubits, to sample the optimal unique planted solution of problems generated by our proposed method and compare them against simulated annealing and Gurobi. We find that the D-Wave QPU ground-state sampling success rate does not change with respect to the size of the random QUBOs we employ. Surprisingly, we find that some of these classes of QUBOs are solved at very high success rates at short annealing times compared to longer annealing times for the Zephyr connectivity graph QPUs.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Advantages of Quantum Imaginarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum imaginarity and quantum nonlocality capture the essence of quantumness of a physical system from different aspects. We establish a connection between the imaginarity and quantum nonlocality in any two-qubit states. Based on the imaginarity $l_1$-norm and relative entropy, we first derive complementary relations among the quantum imaginarities with respect to any set of mutually unbiased bases for arbitrary qubit states. Based on these complementary relations, we introduce the nonlocal advantage of quantum imaginarity (NAQI). We show that any two-qubit state with NAQI is quantum steerable, but not the vice-versa.

      <title>Quantum fault tolerance with constant-space and logarithmic-time overheads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a model of fault-tolerant quantum computation with quick and noiseless polyloglog-time auxiliary classical computation, we construct a fault tolerance protocol with constant-space and $\widetilde{O}(\log N)$-time overhead, where $\widetilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides sub-polylog factors. Our construction utilizes constant-rate quantum locally testable codes (qLTC), new fault-tolerant gadgets on qLTCs and qLDPC codes, and a new analysis framework. In particular, 1) we develop a new simple and self-contained construction of magic state distillation for qubits using qudit quantum Reed-Solomon codes with $(\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon})^{\gamma}$ spacetime overhead, where $\gamma \rightarrow 0$. 2) We prove that the recent family of almost-good qLTCs of Dinur-Lin-Vidick admit parallel single-shot decoders against adversarial errors of weight scaling with the code distance. 3) We develop logical state preparation and logical gate procedures with $\widetilde{O}(1)$-spacetime overhead on qLTCs. 4) To combine these ingredients, we introduce a new framework of fault tolerance analysis called the weight enumerator formalism. The framework permits easy formal composition of fault-tolerant gadgets, so we expect it to be of independent interest. Our work gives the lowest spacetime overhead to date, which, for the first time, matches that of classical fault tolerance up to sub-polylog factors. We conjecture this is optimal up to sub-polylog factors.</description>

      <title>Efficient learning of mixed-state tomography for photonic quantum walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise-enhanced applications in open quantum walk (QW) have recently seen a surge due to their ability to improve performance. However, verifying the success of open QW is challenging, as mixed-state tomography is a resource-intensive process, and implementing all required measurements is almost impossible due to various physical constraints. To address this challenge, we present a neural-network-based method for reconstructing mixed states with a high fidelity (~97.5%) while costing only 50% of the number of measurements typically required for open discrete-time QW in one dimension. Our method uses a neural density operator that models the system and environment, followed by a generalized natural gradient descent procedure that significantly speeds up the training process. Moreover, we introduce a compact interferometric measurement device, improving the scalability of our photonic QW setup that enables experimental learning of mixed states. Our results demonstrate that highly expressive neural networks can serve as powerful alternatives to traditional state tomography.</description>

      <title>Quantum LDPC Codes of Almost Linear Distance via Homological Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new constructions of quantum codes of linear or close-to-linear distance and dimension with low-weight stabilizers. Only a few constructions of such codes were previously known, and were primarily based on a specific operation from homological algebra, namely the balanced product. In contrast, our constructions are based on a more basic and widely used product, namely the homological product (i.e. the tensor product of chain complexes). Our results help address the natural question: When do homological products preserve good code distance?
  Our first main result constructs asymptotically good $[[N,\Theta(N),\Theta(N)]]$ quantum codes with small polynomial stabilizer weight from homological products of codes with a property called product-expansion. This notion was recently introduced and used to bound the distance of balanced product quantum codes; we apply it instead to homological products.
  For every $\epsilon&gt;0$, our second main result constructs close-to-linear distance $[[N,N^{1-\epsilon},N^{1-\epsilon}]]$ (subsystem) quantum LDPC codes with constant stabilizer weight from iterated homological products of a constant-sized quantum locally testable code. The key insight here is that by using subsystem codes (but still with constant-weight stabilizers), we can circumvent a particular obstruction that limited the distance of many prior product code constructions to at most $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{N})$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Programmable Reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similar to a classical processor, which is an algorithm for reading a program and executing its instructions on input data, a universal programmable quantum processor is a fixed quantum channel that reads a quantum program $\lvert\psi_{U}\rangle$ that causes the processor to approximately apply an arbitrary unitary $U$ to a quantum data register. The present work focuses on a class of simple programmable quantum processors for implementing reflection operators, i.e. $U = e^{i \pi \lvert\psi\rangle\langle\psi\rvert}$ for an arbitrary pure state $\lvert\psi\rangle$ of finite dimension $d$. Unlike quantum programs that assume query access to $U$, our program takes the form of independent copies of the state to be reflected about $\lvert\psi_U\rangle = \lvert\psi\rangle^{\otimes n}$. We then identify the worst-case optimal algorithm among all processors of the form $\text{tr}_{\text{Program}}[V (\lvert\phi\rangle\langle\phi\rvert \otimes (\lvert\psi\rangle\langle\psi\rvert)^{\otimes n}) V^\dagger]$ where the algorithm $V$ is a unitary linear combination of permutations. By generalizing these algorithms to processors for arbitrary-angle rotations, $e^{i \alpha \lvert\psi\rangle\langle\psi\rvert}$ for $\alpha \in \mathbb R$, we give a construction for a universal programmable processor with better scaling in $d$. For programming reflections, we obtain a tight analytical lower bound on the program dimension by bounding the Holevo information of an ensemble of reflections applied to an entangled probe state. The lower bound makes use of a block decomposition of the uniform ensemble of reflected states with respect to irreps of the partially transposed permutation matrix algebra, and two representation-theoretic conjectures based on extensive numerical evidence.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchy of Spectral Gap Certificates for Frustration-Free Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating spectral gaps of quantum many-body Hamiltonians is a highly challenging computational task, even under assumptions of locality and translation-invariance. Yet, the quest for rigorous gap certificates is motivated by their broad applicability, ranging from many-body physics to quantum computing and classical sampling techniques. Here we present a general method for obtaining lower bounds on the spectral gap of frustration-free quantum Hamiltonians in the thermodynamic limit. We formulate the gap certification problem as a hierarchy of optimization problems (semidefinite programs) in which the certificate -- a proof of a lower bound on the gap -- is improved with increasing levels. Our approach encompasses existing finite-size methods, such as Knabe's bound and its subsequent improvements, as those appear as particular possible solutions in our optimization, which is thus guaranteed to either match or surpass them. We demonstrate the power of the method on one-dimensional spin-chain models where we observe an improvement by several orders of magnitude over existing finite size criteria in both the accuracy of the lower bound on the gap, as well as the range of parameters in which a gap is detected.</description>

      <title>Polylog-time- and constant-space-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation with quantum low-density parity-check codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) is to reduce both space overhead -- the large number of physical qubits per logical qubit -- and time overhead -- the long physical gate sequences per logical gate. We prove that a protocol using non-vanishing-rate quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, combined with concatenated Steane codes, achieves constant space overhead and polylogarithmic time overhead, even when accounting for non-zero classical computation time. This protocol offers an improvement over existing constant-space-overhead protocols, which have polynomial time overhead using quantum LDPC codes and quasi-polylogarithmic time overhead using concatenated quantum Hamming codes. To ensure the completeness of this proof, we develop a technique called partial circuit reduction, which enables error analysis for the entire fault-tolerant circuit by examining smaller parts composed of a few gadgets. With this technique, we resolve a previously unaddressed logical gap in the existing arguments and complete the proof of the threshold theorem for the constant-space-overhead protocol with quantum LDPC codes. Our work highlights that the quantum-LDPC-code approach can realize FTQC with a negligibly small slowdown and a bounded overhead of physical qubits, similar to the code-concatenation approach, underscoring the importance of a comprehensive comparison of the future realizability of these two approaches.</description>

      <title>Suppressed Energy Relaxation in the Quantum Rabi Model at the Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a modified master equation for the quantum Rabi model in the parameter regime where quantum criticality can occur. The modified master equation can avoid some unphysical predictions, such as excitations in the system at zero temperature and emission of ground-state photons. Due to spectrum collapse, we find that there is mostly no energy relaxation in the system at the critical point. For the same reason, phase coherence rapidly reduces and vanishes at the critical point. We analyze the quantum metrological limits of the system in the presence of dephasing. These results show a strong limitation on the precision of phase-shift estimation.</description>

      <title>Complexity Theory for Quantum Promise Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing introduces many problems rooted in physics, asking to compute information from input quantum states. Determining the complexity of these problems has implications for both computer science and physics. However, as existing complexity theory primarily addresses problems with classical inputs and outputs, it lacks the framework to fully capture the complexity of quantum-input problems. This gap is relevant when studying the relationship between quantum cryptography and complexity theory, especially within Impagliazzo's five worlds framework, as characterizing the security of quantum cryptographic primitives requires complexity classes for problems involving quantum inputs. To bridge this gap, we examine the complexity theory of quantum promise problems, which determine if input quantum states have certain properties. We focus on complexity classes p/mBQP, p/mQ(C)MA, $\mathrm{p/mQSZK_{hv}}$, p/mQIP, and p/mPSPACE, where "p/mC" denotes classes with pure (p) or mixed (m) states corresponding to any classical class C. We establish structural results, including complete problems, search-to-decision reductions, and relationships between classes. Notably, our findings reveal differences from classical counterparts, such as p/mQIP $\neq$ p/mPSPACE and $\mathrm{mcoQSZK_{hv}} \neq \mathrm{mQSZK_{hv}}$. As an application, we apply this framework to cryptography, showing that breaking one-way state generators, pseudorandom states, and EFI is bounded by mQCMA or $\mathrm{mQSZK_{hv}}$. We also show that the average-case hardness of $\mathrm{pQCZK_{hv}}$ implies the existence of EFI. These results provide new insights into Impagliazzo's worlds, establishing a connection between quantum cryptography and quantum promise complexity theory. We also extend our findings to quantum property testing and unitary synthesis, highlighting further applications of this new framework.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emission in Casimir-Rabi oscillations through a weak optomechanical coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) describes the energy conversion from a mechanical motion to the electromagnetic fields. When the mechanical oscillator is in a mechanically excited state, the free evolution due to the DCE produces radiation in the vacuum, in analogy with the spontaneous emission from an excited atom. In this manuscript, we investigate such a spontaneous radiation process by employing the quantum trajectory approach. When the dissipation rate of the system is very low, there can be a reversible energy exchange between the mirror in the excited state and the vacuum field, and this reversible exchange is called vacuum Casimir-Rabi oscillations. Multiple quantum trajectory simulations of this process show that the number of trajectories responsible for the generation of radiation can reach a significant value when the mechanical dissipation rate is less than the photon dissipation rate. We also find that two-photon (two/three-phonon) bundle emission occurs in photon (phonon) emission. In comparison to pure two-photon and three-phonon free dissipation, the probability of two-photon bundle emission and two-phonon bundle emission are observed to be marginally elevated as a consequence of the presence of the DCE. This pattern may assist in developing a deeper comprehension of the physical characteristics of photon and phonon emission in the DCE.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba effect of Localization in the dissipative Mosaic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect in open quantum systems has been extensively studied, but a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon remains elusive. In this paper, we conduct an analytical investigation of the dissipative dynamics of single excitations in the Mosaic model. Surprisingly, we discover that the presence of asymptotic mobility edge, denoted as $E_c^{\infty}$, can lead to unique dissipation behavior, serving as a hallmark of quantum Mpemba effect. Specially, it is found that the energy level $E_c^{\infty}$ exhibits a global periodicity in real configuration, which acts to inhibit dissipation in the system. Conversely, when the system deviates from $E_c^{\infty}$, the quasidisorder sets in, leading to increased dissipative effects due to the broken of periodicity. Furthermore, we find that the rate of dissipation is closely linked to the localization of the initial state. As a result, the quantum Mpemba effect can be observed clearly by a measure of localization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for realizing a deterministic two-photon C-Z gate based on variants of the two-photon quantum Rabi model, which is feasible within the framework of circuit QED. We begin by utilizing the two-photon interaction to implement the nonlinear sign (NS) gate, and subsequently, we construct the C-Z gate following the KLM scheme. We consider three different regimes: the strong coupling regime, the perturbative ultrastrong coupling regime, and the large detuning regime. Our results indicate that the C-Z gate operates fast with high fidelity and is robust against decoherence, thereby offering a suitable approach for achieving deterministic two-photon quantum gates via light-matter interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presented a perturbational decomposition method for simulating quantum evolution under the one-dimensional Ising model with both longitudinal and transverse fields. By treating the transverse field terms as perturbations in the expansion, our approach is particularly effective in systems with moderate longitudinal fields and weak to moderate transverse fields relative to the coupling strength. Through systematic numerical exploration, we characterized parameter regimes and evolution time windows where the decomposition achieved measurable improvements over conventional Trotter decomposition methods. The developed perturbational approach and its characterized parameter space may provide practical guidance for choosing appropriate simulation strategies in different parameter regimes of the one-dimensional Ising model.</description>

      <title>Current Trends in Global Quantum Metrology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensors are now universally acknowledged as one of the most promising near-term quantum technologies. The traditional formulation of quantum sensing introduces a concrete bound on ultimate precision through the so-called local sensing framework, in which a significant knowledge of prior information about the unknown parameter value is implicitly assumed. Moreover, the framework provides a systematic approach for optimizing the sensing protocol. In contrast, the paradigm of global sensing aims to find a precision bound for parameter estimation in the absence of such prior information. In recent years, vigorous research has been pursued to describe the contours of global quantum estimation. Here, we review some of these emerging developments. These developments are both in the realm of finding ultimate precision bounds with respect to appropriate figures of merit in the global sensing paradigm, as well as in the search for algorithms that achieve these bounds. We categorize these developments into two largely mutually exclusive camps; one employing Bayesian updating and the other seeking to generalize the frequentist picture of local sensing towards the global paradigm. In the first approach, in order to achieve the best performance, one has to optimize the measurement settings adaptively. In the second approach, the measurement setting is fixed, however the challenge is to identify this fixed measurement optimally.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit compression using qubit logic on qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present qubit logic on qudits (QLOQ), a compression scheme in which the qubits from a hardware agnostic circuit are divided into groups of various sizes, and each group is mapped to a physical qudit for computation. QLOQ circuits have qubit-logic inputs, outputs, and gates, making them compatible with existing qubit-based algorithms and Hamiltonians. We show that arbitrary qubit-logic unitaries can in principle be implemented with significantly fewer two-level (qubit) physical entangling gates in QLOQ than in qubit encoding. We achieve this advantage in practice for two applications: variational quantum algorithms, and unitary decomposition. The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) for LiH took 5 hours using QLOQ on one of Quandela's cloud-accessible photonic quantum computers, whereas it would have taken 4.39 years in qubit encoding. We also provide a QLOQ version of the Quantum Shannon Decomposition, which not only outperforms previous qudit-based proposals, but also beats the theoretical lower bound on the CNOT cost of unitary decomposition in qubit encoding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By integrating molecular optomechanics with molecular switches, we propose a scheme for a molecular quantum heat engine that operates autonomously through hysteretic feedback without external driving or modulation. Through a comparative analysis conducted within both semiclassical and fully quantum frameworks, we reveal the influence of quantum properties embedded within the autonomous control elements on the operational efficiency and performance of this advanced molecular machine.</description>

      <title>Quantum Thermoelectric Circuits: A Universal Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a panoramic schematic of a quantum thermoelectric circuit theory in the steady state regime. We establish the foundations of the said premise by defining the analogs of Kirchhoff's laws for heat currents and temperature gradients. We further show that our approach encompasses various circuits like thermal diode, transistor, and Wheatstone bridge. Additionally, we have been able to develop a model of a quantum thermal step transformer. We also construct a novel model of a thermal adder circuit, paving the way to develop thermal integrated circuits. This sheds new light on the present architecture of quantum device engineering.</description>

      <title>Causality and Duality in Multipartite Generalized Probabilistic Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causality is one of the most fundamental notions in physics. Generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs) and the process matrix framework incorporate it in different forms. However, a direct connection between these frameworks remains unexplored. By demonstrating the duality between no-signaling principle and classical processes in tripartite classical systems, and extending some results to multipartite systems, we first establish a strong link between these two frameworks, which are two sides of the same coin. This provides an axiomatic approach to describe the measurement space within both box world and local theories. Furthermore, we describe a logically consistent 4-partite classical process acting as an extension of the quantum switch. By incorporating more than two control states, it allows both parallel and serial application of operations. We also provide a device-independent certification of its quantum variant in the form of an inequality.</description>

      <title>Controlling the degree of entanglement in downconversion by targeted birth zone activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the consequences of varying the pump beam waist that illuminates a nonlinear crystal, realizing spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). The coherence is transferred from the marginal one-photon wavefunction to the two-photon wavefunction where it manifests into entanglement in the form of spatial correlation. We interpret this as a consequence of the number of independent emitters, called the biphoton birth zones, targeted by the pump beam on the crystal. The birth zone number $N$ characterises the number of such birth zones that fit along a diameter of the region illuminated by the pump waist. To experimentally observe the duality between the one- and two-photon interference, we employ a double slit and analyse their visibilities $V_m$ and $V_\text{12}$ respectively. We demonstrate the conservation of the quantity $V_m^2+V_\text{12}^2$. Finally, we identify three regimes of entanglement of the down-converted photons based on $N$. We show that changing the pump waist lets us actively control the degree of entanglement letting us access these regimes. We provide implications of each regime, and mention experimental use cases thereof.</description>

Abstract: We study generalized monogamy and polygamy relations for concurrence of assistance and negativity of assistance using parametrized bounds in general multi-partite quantum systems. The new method overcomes the shortcomings of previous studies where a method is only good at a particular region.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the geometry of the ground-state manifold in parameter-dependent many-body systems with quantum phase transitions (QPTs) and describe finite-size precursors of the singular geometry emerging at the QPT boundary in the infinite-size limit. In particular, we elucidate the role of diabolic points in the formation of first-order QPTs, showing that these isolated geometric singularities represent seeds generating irregular behavior of geodesics in finite systems. We also demonstrate that established approximations, namely the mean field approximation in many-body systems composed of mutually interacting bosons and the two-level approximation near a diabolic point, are insufficient to provide a reliable description of geometry. The outcomes of the general analysis are tested and illustrated by a specific bosonic model from the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick family.</description>

      <title>Toward end-to-end quantum simulation for protein dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling and simulating the protein folding process overall remains a grand challenge in computational biology. We systematically investigate end-to-end quantum algorithms for simulating various protein dynamics with effects, such as mechanical forces or stochastic noises. We offer efficient quantum simulation algorithms to produce quantum encoding of the final states, history states, or density matrices of inhomogeneous or stochastic harmonic oscillator models. For the read-in setting, we design (i) efficient quantum algorithms for initial state preparation, utilizing counter-based random number generator and rejection sampling, and (ii) depth-efficient approaches for molecular structure loading. Both are particularly important in handling large protein molecules. For the read-out setting, our algorithms estimate various classical observables, such as energy, low vibration modes, density of states, correlation of displacement, and optimal control of molecular dynamics. We also show classical numerical experiments focused on estimating the density of states and applying the optimal control to facilitate conformation changes to verify our arguments on potential quantum speedups. Overall, our study demonstrates that the quantum simulation of protein dynamics can be a solid end-to-end application in the era of early or fully fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Fast pseudothermalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum resources like entanglement and magic are essential for characterizing the complexity of quantum states. However, when the number of copies of quantum states and the computational time are limited by numbers polynomial in the system size $n$, accurate estimation of the amount of these resources becomes difficult. This makes it impossible to distinguish between ensembles of states with relatively small resources and one that has nearly maximal resources. Such ensembles with small resources are referred to as "pseudo-quantum" ensembles. Recent studies have introduced an ensemble known as the random subset phase state ensemble, which is pseudo-entangled, pseudo-magical, and pseudorandom. While the current state-of-the-art implementation of this ensemble is conjectured to be realized by a circuit with $O(nt)$ depth, it is still too deep for near-term quantum devices to execute for small $t$. In addition, the strict linear dependence on $t$ has only been established as a lower bound on the circuit depth. In this work, we present significantly improved implementations that only require $\omega(\log n)\cdot O(t[\log t]^2)$ depth circuits, which almost saturates the theoretical lower bound. This is also the fastest known for generating pseudorandom states to the best of our knowledge. We believe that our findings will facilitate the implementation of pseudo-ensembles on near-term devices, allowing executions of tasks that would otherwise require ensembles with maximal quantum resources, by generating pseudo-ensembles at a super-polynomially fewer number of entangling and non-Clifford gates.</description>

      <title>Harnessing quantum back-action for time-series processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum measurements affect the state of the observed systems via back-action. While projective measurements extract maximal classical information, they drastically alter the system. In contrast, weak measurements balance information extraction with the degree of disturbance. Considering the prevalent use of projective measurements in quantum computing and communication protocols, the potential benefits of weak measurements in these fields remain largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that incorporating weak measurements into a quantum machine-learning protocol known as quantum reservoir computing provides advantages in both execution time scaling and overall performance. We analyze different measurement settings by varying the measurement strength across two benchmarking tasks. Our results reveal that carefully optimizing both the reservoir Hamiltonian parameters and the measurement strength can significantly improve the quantum reservoir computing algorithm performance. This work provides a comprehensive and practical recipe to promote the implementation of weak measurement-based protocols in quantum reservoir computing. Moreover, our findings motivate further exploration of experimental protocols that leverage the back-action effects of weak measurements.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Ground State from the Neural Tangent Kernel Perspective: The Sign Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks has recently attracted much interest as useful representations of quantum many body ground states, which might help address the infamous sign problem. Most attention was directed at their representability properties, while possible limitations on finding the desired optimal state have not been suitably explored. By leveraging well-established results applicable in the context of infinite width, specifically regarding the renowned neural tangent kernel and conjugate kernel, a comprehensive analysis of the convergence and initialization characteristics of the method is conducted. We reveal the dependence of these characteristics on the interplay among these kernels, the Hamiltonian, and the basis used for its representation. We introduce and motivate novel performance metrics and explore the condition for their optimization. By leveraging these findings, we elucidate a substantial dependence of the effectiveness of this approach on the selected basis, demonstrating that so-called stoquastic Hamiltonians are more amenable to solution through neural networks than those suffering from a sign problem.</description>

      <title>Laplace transform based quantum eigenvalue transformation via linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eigenvalue transformations, which include solving time-dependent differential equations as a special case, have a wide range of applications in scientific and engineering computation. While quantum algorithms for singular value transformations are well studied, eigenvalue transformations are distinct, especially for non-normal matrices. We propose an efficient quantum algorithm for performing a class of eigenvalue transformations that can be expressed as a certain type of matrix Laplace transformation. This allows us to significantly extend the recently developed linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS) method [An, Liu, Lin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 150603, 2023; An, Childs, Lin, arXiv:2312.03916] to represent a wider class of eigenvalue transformations, such as powers of the matrix inverse, $A^{-k}$, and the exponential of the matrix inverse, $e^{-A^{-1}}$. The latter can be interpreted as the solution of a mass-matrix differential equation of the form $A u'(t)=-u(t)$. We demonstrate that our eigenvalue transformation approach can solve this problem without explicitly inverting $A$, reducing the computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Low-depth quantum symmetrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum symmetrization is the task of transforming a non-strictly increasing list of $n$ integers into an equal superposition of all permutations of the list (or more generally, performing this operation coherently on a superposition of such lists). This task plays a key role in initial state preparation for first-quantized simulations. A weaker version of symmetrization in which the input list is \emph{strictly} increasing has been extensively studied due to its application to fermionic systems, but the general symmetrization problem with repetitions in the input list has not been solved previously. We present the first quantum algorithm for the general symmetrization problem. Our algorithm, based on (quantum) sorting networks, uses $O(\log n)$ depth and $O(n\log m)$ ancilla qubits where $m$ is the greatest possible value of the list, enabling efficient simulation of bosonic quantum systems in first quantization. Furthermore, our algorithm can prepare (superpositions of) Dicke states of any Hamming weight in $O(\log n)$ depth using $O(n\log n)$ ancilla qubits. We also propose an $O(\log^2 n)$-depth quantum algorithm to transform second-quantized states to first-quantized states. Using this algorithm, QFT-based quantum telescope arrays can image brighter photon sources, extending quantum interferometric imaging systems to a new regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control (QOC) schemes can be employed to enhance the sensitivity of quantum metrology (QM) protocols undergoing Markovian noise, which can limit their precision to a standard quantum limit (SQL)-like scaling. In this paper, we propose a QOC scheme for QM that leverages entanglement and optimized coupling interactions with an ancillary system to provide enhanced metrological performance under general Markovian dynamics. We perform a comparative analysis of our entanglement-enhanced scheme against the unentangled scheme conventionally employed in QOC-enabled QM for varying evolution times and decoherence levels, revealing that the entanglement-enhanced scheme enables significantly better noise performance, even when a noisy ancilla is employed. We further extend our investigation to time-inhomogeneous noise models, specifically focusing on a noisy frequency estimation scenario within a spin-boson bath, and evaluate the protocol's performance under completely dissipative and dephasing dynamics. Our findings indicate that, in certain situations, schemes employing coherent control of a single particle are severely limited. In such cases, employing the entanglement-enhanced scheme can provide improved performance.</description>

      <title>Generalized quantum asymptotic equipartition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a generalized quantum asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) beyond the i.i.d. framework where the random samples are drawn from two sets of quantum states. In particular, under suitable assumptions on the sets, we prove that all operationally relevant divergences converge to the quantum relative entropy between the sets. More specifically, both the smoothed min- and max-relative entropy approach the regularized relative entropy between the sets. Notably, the asymptotic limit has explicit convergence guarantees and can be efficiently estimated through convex optimization programs, despite the regularization, provided that the sets have efficient descriptions.
  We give four applications of this result: (i) The generalized AEP directly implies a new generalized quantum Stein's lemma for conducting quantum hypothesis testing between two sets of quantum states. (ii) We introduce a quantum version of adversarial hypothesis testing where the tester plays against an adversary who possesses internal quantum memory and controls the quantum device and show that the optimal error exponent is precisely characterized by a new notion of quantum channel divergence, named the minimum output channel divergence. (iii) We derive a relative entropy accumulation theorem stating that the smoothed min-relative entropy between two sequential processes of quantum channels can be lower bounded by the sum of the regularized minimum output channel divergences. (iv) We apply our generalized AEP to quantum resource theories and provide improved and efficient bounds for entanglement distillation, magic state distillation, and the entanglement cost of quantum states and channels.
  At a technical level, we establish new additivity and chain rule properties for the measured relative entropy which we expect will have more applications.</description>

      <title>A unified approach to quantum de Finetti theorems and SoS rounding via geometric quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sum-of-squares hierarchy of semidefinite programs has become a common tool for algorithm design in theoretical computer science, including problems in quantum information. In this work we study a connection between a Hermitian version of the SoS hierarchy, related to the quantum de Finetti theorem, and geometric quantization of compact K\"ahler manifolds (such as complex projective space $\mathbb{C}P^{d}$, the set of all pure states in a $(d + 1)$-dimensional Hilbert space). We show that previously known HSoS rounding algorithms can be recast as quantizing an objective function to obtain a finite-dimensional matrix, finding its top eigenvector, and then (possibly nonconstructively) rounding it by using a version of the Husimi quasiprobability distribution. Dually, we recover most known quantum de Finetti theorems by doing the same steps in the reverse order: a quantum state is first approximated by its Husimi distribution, and then quantized to obtain a separable state approximating the original one. In cases when there is a transitive group action on the manifold we give some new proofs of existing de Finetti theorems, as well as some applications including a new version of Renner's exponential de Finetti theorem proven using the Borel--Weil--Bott theorem, and hardness of approximation results and optimal degree-2 integrality gaps for the basic SDP relaxation of \textsc{Quantum Max-$d$-Cut} (for arbitrary $d$). We also describe how versions of these results can be proven when there is no transitive group action. In these cases we can deduce some error bounds for the HSoS hierarchy on complex projective varieties which are smooth.</description>

      <title>Localizing multipartite entanglement with local and global measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the task of localizing multipartite entanglement in pure quantum states onto a subsystem by measuring the remaining systems. To this end, we fix a multipartite entanglement measure and consider two quantities: the multipartite entanglement of assistance (MEA), defined as the entanglement measure averaged over the post-measurement states and maximized over arbitrary measurements; and the localizable multipartite entanglement (LME), defined in the same way but restricted to only local single-system measurements. We choose the $n$-tangle, the genuine multipartite entanglement concurrence and the concentratable entanglement (CE) as the underlying seed measure, and discuss the resulting MEA and LME quantities. First, we prove easily computable upper and lower bounds on MEA and LME and establish Lipschitz-continuity for the $n$-tangle and CE-based LME and MEA. Using these bounds we investigate the typical behavior of entanglement localization by deriving concentration inequalities for the MEA evaluated on Haar-random states and performing numerical studies for small tractable system sizes. We then turn our attention to protocols that transform graph states. We give a simple criterion based on a matrix equation to decide whether states with a specified $n$-tangle value can be obtained from a given graph state, providing no-go theorems for a broad class of such graph state transformations beyond the usual local Clifford plus local Pauli measurement framework. We generalize this analysis to weighted graph states and show that our entanglement localization framework certifies the near-optimality of recently discussed local-measurement protocols to transform uniformly weighted line graph states into GHZ states. Finally, we demonstrate how our MEA and LEA quantities can be used to detect phase transitions in transversal field Ising models.</description>

      <title>Revisiting BQP with Non-Collapsing Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of non-collapsing measurements was initiated by Aaronson, Bouland, Fitzsimons, and Lee, who showed that BQP, when equipped with the ability to perform non-collapsing measurements (denoted as PDQP), contains both BQP and SZK, yet still requires $\Omega (N^{1/4})$ queries to find an element in an unsorted list.
  By formulating an alternative equivalent model of PDQP, we prove the positive weighted adversary method, obtaining a variety of new lower bounds and establishing a trade-off between queries and non-collapsing measurements. The method allows us to examine the well-studied majority and element distinctness problems, while also tightening the bound for the search problem to $\Theta (N^{1/3})$. Additionally, we explore related settings, obtaining tight bounds in BQP with the ability to copy arbitrary states (called CBQP) and PDQP with non-adaptive queries.</description>

      <title>Local unitary equivalence of absolutely maximally entangled states constructed from orthogonal arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of multipartite entanglement is essential as it serves as a resource for various quantum information processing tasks. This study concerns a particular class of highly entangled multipartite states, the so-called absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states. These are characterized by maximal entanglement across all possible bipartitions. In particular we analyze the local unitary equivalence among AME states using invariants. One of our main findings is that the existence of special irredundant orthogonal arrays implies the existence of an infinite number of equivalence classes of AME states constructed from these. In particular, we show that there are infinitely many local unitary inequivalent three-party AME states for local dimension $d &gt; 2$ and five-party AME states for $d \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity gates in a transmon using bath engineering for passive leakage reset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leakage, the occupation of any state not used in the computation, is one of the of the most devastating errors in quantum error correction. Transmons, the most common superconducting qubits, are weakly anharmonic multilevel systems, and are thus prone to this type of error. Here we demonstrate a device which reduces the lifetimes of the leakage states in the transmon by three orders of magnitude, while protecting the qubit lifetime and the single-qubit gate fidelties. To do this we attach a qubit through an on-chip seventh-order Chebyshev filter to a cold resistor. The filter is engineered such that the leakage transitions are in its passband, while the qubit transition is in its stopband. Dissipation through the filter reduces the lifetime of the transmon's $f$ state, the lowest energy leakage state, by three orders of magnitude to 33 ns, while simultaneously keeping the qubit lifetime to greater than 100 $\mu$s. Even though the $f$ state is transiently populated during a single qubit gate, no negative effect of the filter is detected with errors per gate approaching 1e-4. Modelling the filter as coupled linear harmonic oscillators, our theoretical analysis of the device corroborate our experimental findings. This leakage reduction unit turns leakage errors into errors within the qubit subspace that are correctable with traditional quantum error correction. We demonstrate the operation of the filter as leakage reduction unit in a mock-up of a single-qubit quantum error correcting cycle, showing that the filter increases the seepage rate back to the qubit subspace.</description>

      <title>Second order cone relaxations for quantum Max Cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Max Cut (QMC), also known as the quantum anti-ferromagnetic Heisenberg model, is a QMA-complete problem relevant to quantum many-body physics and computer science. Semidefinite programming relaxations have been fruitful in designing theoretical approximation algorithms for QMC, but are computationally expensive for systems beyond tens of qubits. We give a second order cone relaxation for QMC, which optimizes over the set of mutually consistent three-qubit reduced density matrices. In combination with Pauli level-$1$ of the quantum Lasserre hierarchy, the relaxation achieves an approximation ratio of $0.526$ to the ground state energy. Our relaxation is solvable on systems with hundreds of qubits and paves the way to computationally efficient lower and upper bounds on the ground state energy of large-scale quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum metrology with a continuous-variable system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of the main pillars of quantum technologies, quantum metrology aims to improve measurement precision using techniques from quantum information. The two main strategies to achieve this are the preparation of nonclassical states and the design of optimized measurement observables. We discuss precision limits and optimal strategies in quantum metrology and sensing with a single mode of quantum continuous variables. We focus on the practically most relevant cases of estimating displacements and rotations and provide the sensitivities of the most important classes of states that includes Gaussian states and superpositions of Fock states or coherent states. Fundamental precision limits that are obtained from the quantum Fisher information are compared to the precision of a simple moment-based estimation strategy based on the data obtained from possibly sub-optimal measurement observables, including homodyne, photon number, parity and higher moments. Finally, we summarize some of the main experimental achievements and present emerging platforms for continuous-variable sensing. These results are of particular interest for experiments with quantum light, trapped ions, mechanical oscillators, and microwave resonators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the first time in history, humankind might conceivably begin to imagine itself as a multi-planetary species. This goal will entail technical innovation in a number of contexts, including that of healthcare. All life on Earth shares an evolution that is coupled to specific environmental conditions, including gravitational and magnetic fields. While the human body may be able to adjust to short term disruption of these fields during space flights, any long term settlement would have to take into consideration the effects that different fields will have on biological systems, within the space of one lifetime, but also across generations. Magnetic fields, for example, influence the growth of stem cells in regenerative processes. Circadian rhythms are profoundly influenced by magnetic fields, a fact that will likely have an effect on mental as well as physical health. Even the brain responds to small perturbations of this field. One possible mechanism for the effects of weak magnetic fields on biological systems has been suggested to be the radical pair mechanism. The radical pair mechanism originated in the context of spin chemistry to describe how magnetic fields influence the yields of chemical reactions. This mechanism was subsequently incorporated into the field of quantum biology. Quantum biology, most generally, is the study of whether non-trivial quantum effects play any meaningful role in biological systems. The radical pair mechanism has been used most consistently in this context to describe the avian compass. Recently, however, a number of studies have investigated other biological contexts in which the radical pair might play a role, from the action of anaesthetics and antidepressants, to microtubule development and the proper function of the circadian clock...

      <title>Stochastic-thermodynamics approach to the Ericsson nano engine -- Efficiency from equilibrium results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study an Ericsson cycle whose working substance is a charged (quantum) oscillator in a magnetic field that is coupled to a heat bath. The resulting quantum Langevin equations with built-in noise terms encapsulate a thermodynamic structure and allow for the computation of the efficiency of the cycle. We numerically compute the efficiency of the cycle in the quasi-static regime using the steady-state thermodynamic functions of the system. Interestingly, it is found that by increasing the system-bath coupling strength, the efficiency of the cycle can be enhanced although it falls off for larger values of the coupling strength. We also explore the behavior of the efficiency as a function of the pair of magnetic-field values between which the cycle is operated.</description>

      <title>Does connected wedge imply distillable entanglement?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ryu-Takayanagi formula predicts that two spatially separated boundary subsystems can have large mutual information if their entanglement wedge is connected in the bulk. However, the nature of this mysterious entanglement remains elusive. Here, we propose that i) there is no LO-distillable entanglement at the leading order in $1/G_{N}$ for holographic mixed states, suggesting the absence of bipartite entanglement, and ii) one-shot LOCC-distillable entanglement with holographic measurements is given by locally accessible information, which is related to the entanglement wedge cross section $E^W$ involving the (third) purifying system. In particular, we demonstrate that a connected wedge does not necessarily imply nonzero distillable entanglement with holographic measurements at the leading order. Thus, it is an example of NPT bound entanglement in one-shot holographic settings. Our proposals have parallel statements for Haar random states which may be of independent interest. We will also discuss potential physical mechanisms for subleading effects, namely i) holographic scattering, ii) traversable wormholes, and iii) Planck scale effects. Finally, we establish a holographic monogamy relation between distillable entanglement and entanglement of formation $E_F$ whose dual we propose is $E^W$.</description>

      <title>Infinitely fast critical dynamics: Teleportation through temporal rare regions in monitored quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits with a measurement rate that fluctuates in time. The spatially correlated fluctuations in the measurement rate disrupt the volume-law phase for low measurement rates; at a critical measurement rate, they give rise to an entanglement phase transition with "ultrafast" dynamics, i.e., spacetime ($x,t$) scaling $\log x \sim t^{\psi_\tau}$. The ultrafast dynamics at the critical point can be viewed as a spacetime-rotated version of an infinite-randomness critical point; despite the spatial locality of the dynamics, ultrafast information propagation is possible because of measurement-induced quantum teleportation. We identify temporal Griffiths phases on either side of this critical point. We provide a physical interpretation of these phases, and support it with extensive numerical simulations of information propagation and entanglement dynamics in stabilizer circuits.</description>

      <title>Fourier Analysis of Variational Quantum Circuits for Supervised Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: VQC can be understood through the lens of Fourier analysis. It is already well-known that the function space represented by any circuit architecture can be described through a truncated Fourier sum. We show that the spectrum available to that truncated Fourier sum is not entirely determined by the encoding gates of the circuit, since the variational part of the circuit can constrain certain coefficients to zero, effectively removing that frequency from the spectrum. To the best of our knowledge, we give the first description of the functional dependence of the Fourier coefficients on the variational parameters as trigonometric polynomials. This allows us to provide an algorithm which computes the exact spectrum of any given circuit and the corresponding Fourier coefficients. Finally, we demonstrate that by comparing the Fourier transform of the dataset to the available spectra, it is possible to predict which \gls{VQC} out of a given list of choices will be able to best fit the data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning light spots into arbitrary shapes is a fundamental challenge in holography, leading to various applications across diverse fields in science and engineering. However, as the spot interval approaches the wavelength of light, interference effects among the spots become prominent, which complicates the generation of a distortion-free alignment. Herein, we introduce a hologram design method based on the optimisation of a nonlinear cost function using a holographic phase pattern as the optimisation parameter. We confirmed a spot interval of 0.952(1) $\mu$m in a $5 \times 5$ multispot pattern on the focal plane of a high-numerical-aperture (0.75) objective by observing the near-infrared (wavelength: 820 nm) holographic output light from a spatial light modulator device, a result which overcomes the limitation of a few micrometres under similar conditions. Furthermore, the definition of the Rayleigh diffraction limit is refined by considering the separation of spots and the spot interval, thereby concluding the achievement of "super-resolution." The proposed method is expected to advance laser fabrication, scanning laser microscopy, and cold atom physics, among other fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a quantum droplet which is confined in a ring potential. We investigate the so-called "yrast" state, i.e., the lowest-energy state of the droplet assuming that it has some fixed expectation value of the angular momentum. Two are the most interesting aspects of this problem, the nonlinear term -- which is partly attractive and partly repulsive -- and the periodic boundary conditions. For some range of the parameters, the attractive, or the repulsive part of the nonlinear term dominates and one gets the expected behavior. In some intermediate regime the two nonlinear terms are of comparable size. In this case both the solution, as well as the corresponding dispersion relation show an interesting behavior. Finally, we make contact with the problem of solitary-wave excitation, since the derived solutions are travelling-wave, i.e., solitary-wave, solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ real-space variational quantum Monte Carlo methods with resonating valence bond many-body wave functions to investigate electron correlation effects in the Kagome system $Zn_xCu_{4-x}O_6$. Using three trial wave functions of the Slater-Jastrow type, where (i) only the Jastrow correlation factor is optimized and the orbitals obtained by density functional theory, (ii) both the Jastrow factor and the Slater determinant are optimized, and (iii) additionally the Slater determinant is substituted by an antisymmetrized-geminal power wave function, we analyze static and dynamic correlation energies across concentrations $x=0, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}, 1$. Our results show that the correlation energy increases with the concentration of $Zn_x$. Optimizing the Slater determinant significantly enhances the correlation energy by approximately $\sim -73(4) mHa$ per electron. Eventually, the emergence of a quantum spin liquid state driven by a long-range correlation energy is discussed.</description>

Abstract: Maxwell's demon (MD) has proven an instructive vehicle by which to explore the relationship between information theory and thermodynamics, fueling the possibility of information driven machines. A long standing debate has been the concern of entropy violation, now resolved by the introduction of a quantum MD, but this theoretical suggestion has proven experimentally challenging. Here, we use classical vectorially structured light that is non-separable in spin and orbital angular momentum to emulate a quantum MD experiment. Our classically entangled light fields have all the salient properties necessary of their quantum counterparts but without the experimental complexity of controlling quantum entangled states. We use our experiment to show that the demon's entropy increases during the process while the system's entropy decreases, so that the total entropy is conserved through an exchange of information, confirming the theoretical prediction. We show that our MD is able to extract useful work from the system in the form of orbital angular momentum, opening a path to information driven optical spanners for the mechanical rotation of objects with light. Our synthetic dimensions of angular momentum can easily be extrapolated to other degrees of freedom, for scalable and robust implementations of MDs at both the classical and quantum realms, enlightening the role of a structured light MD and its capability to control and measure information.</description>

      <title>Retentive Neural Quantum States: Efficient Ans\"atze for Ab Initio Quantum Chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural-network quantum states (NQS) has emerged as a powerful application of quantum-inspired deep learning for variational Monte Carlo methods, offering a competitive alternative to existing techniques for identifying ground states of quantum problems. A significant advancement toward improving the practical scalability of NQS has been the incorporation of autoregressive models, most recently transformers, as variational ansatze. Transformers learn sequence information with greater expressiveness than recurrent models, but at the cost of increased time complexity with respect to sequence length. We explore the use of the retentive network (RetNet), a recurrent alternative to transformers, as an ansatz for solving electronic ground state problems in $\textit{ab initio}$ quantum chemistry. Unlike transformers, RetNets overcome this time complexity bottleneck by processing data in parallel during training, and recurrently during inference. We give a simple computational cost estimate of the RetNet and directly compare it with similar estimates for transformers, establishing a clear threshold ratio of problem-to-model size past which the RetNet's time complexity outperforms that of the transformer. Though this efficiency can comes at the expense of decreased expressiveness relative to the transformer, we overcome this gap through training strategies that leverage the autoregressive structure of the model -- namely, variational neural annealing. Our findings support the RetNet as a means of improving the time complexity of NQS without sacrificing accuracy. We provide further evidence that the ablative improvements of neural annealing extend beyond the RetNet architecture, suggesting it would serve as an effective general training strategy for autoregressive NQS.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Sparse Online Learning with Truncated Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Logistic regression, the Support Vector Machine (SVM), and least squares are well-studied methods in the statistical and computer science community, with various practical applications. High-dimensional data arriving on a real-time basis makes the design of online learning algorithms that produce sparse solutions essential. The seminal work of \hyperlink{cite.langford2009sparse}{Langford, Li, and Zhang (2009)} developed a method to obtain sparsity via truncated gradient descent, showing a near-optimal online regret bound. Based on this method, we develop a quantum sparse online learning algorithm for logistic regression, the SVM, and least squares. Given efficient quantum access to the inputs, we show that a quadratic speedup in the time complexity with respect to the dimension of the problem is achievable, while maintaining a regret of $O(1/\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of collective modes in a Bose-Einstein condensate: from single to double zones of excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective modes are coherent excitations in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), and their study provides insight into the macroscopic quantum phenomena that govern these systems. Collective mode frequencies can be used to probe the properties of BECs, such as the trap geometry, the interatomic interactions, and the presence of defects; hence, it is essential to develop methods for high-resolution determination of collective mode frequencies. A standard technique consists of a single pulse of an external oscillatory field, which we denote Rabi-like due to the analogy with the field of nuclear magnetic resonances. In this work, we propose a method to achieve a better resolution than the Rabi-like protocol, which consists of two oscillating fields separated in time, which we call Ramsey-like. We focus on BECs in harmonic traps, considering mainly the quadrupole and breathing modes for different trap anisotropy values and comparing the results using single and double excitation zones. First, we employ a variational approach with a Thomas-Fermi ansatz, which gives rise to dynamical equations that are numerically solved. Then, we modeled the problem as a three-level system, offering a concise and alternative description of the same dynamics, enabling the idea of coherent control of these collective modes. Both approaches show that the Ramsey-like protocol provides a better resolution than the Rabi-like. This offers the possibility of measuring collective mode frequencies with higher precision, which is important in experiments where they are used as indirect measurements of properties that are difficult to probe.</description>

      <title>Emergent dynamical quantum phase transition in a $Z_3$ symmetric chiral clock model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quench dynamics in a $Z_3$ symmetric chiral clock model (CCM). The results reveal that chiral phases can lead to the emergence of dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT). By analyzing Lee-Yang-Fisher zeros' distribution in the complex plane, we uncover the relation between the chiral phase and the emergence of DQPT. In concrete terms, only by taking some special angles can DQPT be induced. We confirm the above relation by computing the non-analytic points in Loschmidt echo return rate function. Furthermore, through the analysis of the corresponding dynamical partition function, we reveal the mechanism of the emergent DQPT and deduce the analytical expression of dynamical partition function's zero points' coordinates. Based on the analytic expression, one can obtain all the angles that induce DQPT's emergence and predict more possible DQPT in the system.</description>

      <title>Self-congruent point in critical matrix product states: An effective field theory for finite-entanglement scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We set up an effective field theory formulation for the renormalization flow of matrix product states (MPS) with finite bond dimension, focusing on systems exhibiting finite-entanglement scaling close to a conformally invariant critical fixed point. We show that the finite MPS bond dimension $\chi$ is equivalent to introducing a perturbation by a relevant operator to the fixed-point Hamiltonian. The fingerprint of this mechanism is encoded in the $\chi$-independent universal transfer matrix's gap ratios, which are distinct from those predicted by the unperturbed Conformal Field Theory. This phenomenon defines a renormalization group self-congruent point, where the relevant coupling constant ceases to flow due to a balance of two effects; When increasing $\chi$, the infrared scale, set by the correlation length $\xi(\chi)$, increases, while the strength of the perturbation at the lattice scale decreases. The presence of a self-congruent point does not alter the validity of the finite-entanglement scaling hypothesis, since the self-congruent point is located at a finite distance from the critical fixed point, well inside the scaling regime of the CFT. We corroborate this framework with numerical evidences from the exact solution of the Ising model and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of an effective lattice model.</description>

      <title>Regularized stress tensor of vector fields in de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Stueckelberg field in de Sitter space, which is a massive vector field with the gauge fixing (GF) term $\frac{1}{2\zeta} (A^\mu\,_{;\, \mu})^2$. We obtain the vacuum stress tensor, which consists of the transverse, longitudinal, temporal, and GF parts, and each contains various UV divergences. By the minimal subtraction rule, we regularize each part of the stress tensor to its pertinent adiabatic order. The transverse stress tensor is regularized to the 0th adiabatic order, the longitudinal, temporal, and GF stress tensors are regularized to the 2nd adiabatic order. The resulting total regularized vacuum stress tensor is convergent and maximally-symmetric, has a positive energy density, and respects the covariant conservation, and thus can be identified as the cosmological constant that drives the de Sitter inflation. Under the Lorenz condition $A^\mu\,_{;\, \mu}=0$, the regularized Stueckelberg stress tensor reduces to the regularized Proca stress tensor that contains only the transverse and longitudinal modes. In the massless limit, the regularized Stueckelberg stress tensor becomes zero, and is the same as that of the Maxwell field with the GF term, and no trace anomaly exists. If the order of adiabatic regularization were lower than our prescription, some divergences would remain. If the order were higher, say, under the conventional 4th-order regularization, more terms than necessary would be subtracted off, leading to an unphysical negative energy density and the trace anomaly simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Impact of surface treatments on the transport properties of germanium 2DHGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holes in planar germanium (Ge) heterostructures show promise for quantum applications, particularly in superconducting and spin qubits, due to strong spin-orbit interaction, low effective mass, and absence of valley degeneracies. However, charge traps cause issues such as gate hysteresis and charge noise. This study examines the effect of surface treatments on the accumulation behaviour and transport properties of Ge-based two dimensional hole gases (2DHGs). Oxygen plasma treatment reduces conduction in a setting without applied top-gate voltage and improves the mobility and lowers the percolation density, while hydrofluoric acid (HF) etching provides no benefit. The results suggest that interface traps from the partially oxidised silicon (Si) cap pin the Fermi level, and that oxygen plasma reduces the trap density by fully oxidising the Si cap. Therefore, optimising surface treatments is crucial for minimising the charge traps and thereby enhancing the device performance.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Safe Hybrid Key Exchanges with KEM-Based Authentication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) between any two entities is one of the most important security protocols available for securing our digital networks and infrastructures. In PQCrypto 2023, Bruckner, Ramacher and Striecks proposed a novel hybrid AKE (HAKE) protocol, dubbed Muckle+, that is particularly useful in large quantum-safe networks consisting of a large number of nodes. Their protocol is hybrid in the sense that it allows key material from conventional and post-quantum primitives, as well as from quantum key distribution, to be incorporated into a single end-to-end shared key.
  To achieve the desired authentication properties, Muckle+ utilizes post-quantum digital signatures. However, available instantiations of such signatures schemes are not yet efficient enough compared to their post-quantum key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) counterparts, particularly in large networks with potentially several connections in a short period of time.
  To mitigate this gap, we propose Muckle# that pushes the efficiency boundaries of currently known HAKE constructions. Muckle# uses post-quantum key-encapsulating mechanisms for implicit authentication inspired by recent works done in the area of Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, particularly, in KEMTLS (CCS'20).
  We port those ideas to the HAKE framework and develop novel proof techniques on the way. Due to our novel KEM-based approach, the resulting protocol has a slightly different message flow compared to prior work that we carefully align with the HAKE framework and which makes our changes to the Muckle+ non-trivial.</description>

      <title>Energy transport in a free Euler-Bernoulli beam in terms of Schr\"odinger's wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger equation is not frequently used in the framework of the classical mechanics, though historically this equation was derived as a simplified equation, which is equivalent to the classical Germain-Lagrange dynamic plate equation. The question concerning the exact meaning of this equivalence is still discussed in modern literature. In this note, we consider the one-dimensional case, where the Germain-Lagrange equation reduces to the Euler-Bernoulli equation, which is used in the classical theory of a beam. We establish a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all solutions (i.e., wave functions ${\psi}$) of the 1D time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for a free particle with arbitrary complex initial data and the set of ordered pairs of quantities (the beam strain and the particle velocity), which characterize solutions $u$ of the beam equation with arbitrary real initial data. Thus, the dynamics of a free infinite Euler-Bernoulli beam can be described by the Schr\"odinger equation for a free particle and vice versa. Finally, we show that for two corresponding solutions $u$ and ${\psi}$ the mechanical energy density calculated for $u$ propagates in the beam exactly in the same way as the probability density calculated for ${\psi}$.</description>

      <title>Soft Reverse Reconciliation for Discrete Modulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of the information reconciliation phase is crucial for quantum key distribution (QKD). Reverse reconciliation (RR) is typically preferred over direct reconciliation (DR) because it yields higher secure key rates. However, a significant challenge in continuous-variable (CV) QKD with discrete modulations (such as QAM) is that Alice lacks soft information about the symbol decisions made by Bob. This limitation restricts error correction to hard-decoding methods, with low reconciliation efficiency. This work introduces a reverse reconciliation softening (RRS) procedure designed for CV-QKD scenarios employing discrete modulations. This procedure generates a soft metric that Bob can share with Alice over a public channel, enabling her to perform soft-decoding error correction without disclosing any information to a potential eavesdropper. After detailing the RRS procedure, we investigate how the mutual information between Alice's and Bob's variables changes when the additional metric is shared. We show numerically that RRS improves the mutual information with respect to RR with hard decoding, practically achieving the same mutual information as DR with soft decoding. Finally, we test the proposed RRS for PAM-4 signalling with a rate 1/2 binary LDPC code and bit-wise decoding through numerical simulations, obtaining more than 1dB SNR improvement compared to hard-decoding RR.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, I present a novel, purely differential geometric approach to the quantization of scalar fields, with a special focus on the familiar case of Minkowski spacetimes. This approach is based on using the natural geometric structures of polysymplectic Hamiltonian field theory to produce an analog of the Kostant-Souriau prequantization map familiar from geometric quantization. I show that while the resulting operators are quite different from those of canonical quantum field theory, the approach is nonetheless able to reproduce a few of canonical quantum field theory's most fundamental results. I finish by elaborating the current limitations of this approach and briefly discussing future prospects.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Order Interface Propagating over the Ferromagnetic Ground State in the Transverse Field Ising Chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider time evolution of order parameters and entanglement asymmetries in the ferromagnetic phase of the transverse-field Ising chain. One side of the system is prepared in a ferromagnetic ground state and the other side either in equilibrium at higher temperature or out of equilibrium. We focus on the disorder-order interface in which the order parameter attains a nonzero value, different from the ground state one. In that region, correlations follow a universal behaviour. We analytically compute the asymptotic scaling functions of the one- and two-point equal time correlations of the order parameter and provide numerical evidence that also the non-equal time correlations are universal. We analyze the R\'enyi entanglement asymmetries of subsystems and obtain a prediction that is expected to hold also in the von Neumann limit. Finally, we show that the Wigner-Yanase skew information of the order paramerter in subsystems within the interfacial region scales as their length squared. We propose a semiclassical approximation that is particularly effective close to the edge of the lightcone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing quantum circuits is critical: the number of quantum operations needs to be minimized for a successful evaluation of a circuit on a quantum processor. In this paper we unify two disparate ideas for optimizing quantum circuits, rewrite rules, which are fast standard optimizer passes, and unitary synthesis, which is slow, requiring a search through the space of circuits. We present a clean, unifying framework for thinking of rewriting and resynthesis as abstract circuit transformations. We then present a radically simple algorithm, GUOQ, for optimizing quantum circuits that exploits the synergies of rewriting and resynthesis. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates the ability of GUOQ to strongly outperform existing optimizers on a wide range of benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: We show a linear sized reduction from the Maximum Cut Problem (Max-Cut) with completeness $1 - \varepsilon$ and soundness $1 - \varepsilon^{1/2}$ to the $\gamma$-Approximate Closest Vector Problem under any finite $\ell_p$-norm including $p = 2$.
  This reduction implies two headline results: (i) We show that any sub-exponential time (classical or quantum) algorithm for the $o(\sqrt{\log n}^{\frac{1}{p}})$-Approximate Closest Vector Problem in any finite $\ell_p$-norm implies a faster than the state-of-the-art (by Arora, Barak, and Steurer [\textit{Journal of the ACM}, 2015]) sub-exponential time (classical or quantum) algorithm for Max-Cut. This fills the gap between the results by Bennett, Golovnev, and Stephens-Davidowitz [\textit{FOCS} 2017] which had an almost optimal runtime lower bound but a very small approximation factor and the results by Dinur, Kindler, Raz, and Safra [\textit{Combinatorica}, 2003] which had an almost optimal approximation factor but small runtime lower bound, albeit using a different underlying hard problem; (ii) in combination with the classical results of Aggarwal and Kumar [\textit{FOCS} 2023] and our quantization of those results, there are no fine-grained reductions from $k$-SAT to Max-Cut with one-sided error, nor are there non-adaptive fine-grained (classical or quantum) reductions with two-sided error, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses (or unless $\mathrm{NP} \subseteq \mathrm{pr} \text{-} \mathrm{QSZK}$ in the quantum case). The second result poses a significant barrier against proving the fine-grained complexity of Max-Cut using the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (or the Quantum Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis).</description>

Abstract: Designing encoding and decoding circuits to reliably send messages over many uses of a noisy channel is a central problem in communication theory. When studying the optimal transmission rates achievable with asymptotically vanishing error it is usually assumed that these circuits can be implemented using noise-free gates. While this assumption is satisfied for classical machines in many scenarios, it is not expected to be satisfied in the near term future for quantum machines where decoherence leads to faults in the quantum gates. As a result, fundamental questions regarding the practical relevance of quantum channel coding remain open. By combining techniques from fault-tolerant quantum computation with techniques from quantum communication, we initiate the study of these questions. We introduce fault-tolerant versions of quantum capacities quantifying the optimal communication rates achievable with asymptotically vanishing total error when the encoding and decoding circuits are affected by gate errors with small probability. Our main results are threshold theorems for the classical and quantum capacity: For every quantum channel $T$ and every $\epsilon&gt;0$ there exists a threshold $p(\epsilon,T)$ for the gate error probability below which rates larger than $C-\epsilon$ are fault-tolerantly achievable with vanishing overall communication error, where $C$ denotes the usual capacity. Our results are not only relevant in communication over large distances, but also on-chip, where distant parts of a quantum computer might need to communicate under higher levels of noise than affecting the local gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.07741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are few explicit examples of two player nonlocal games with a large gap between classical and quantum value. One of the reasons is that estimating the classical value is usually a hard computational task. This paper is devoted to analyzing classical values of the so-called linear games (generalization of XOR games to a larger number of outputs). We employ nontrivial results from graph theory and combine them with number theoretic results used earlier in the context of harmonic analysis to obtain a novel tool -- {\it the girth method} -- allowing to provide explicit examples of linear games with prescribed low classical value. In particular, we provide games with minimal possible classical value. We then speculate on the potential unbounded violation, by comparing the obtained classical values with a known upper bound for the quantum value. If this bound can be even asymptotically saturated, our games would have the best ratio of quantum to classical value as a function of the product of the number of inputs and outputs when compared to other explicit (i.e. non-random) constructions.</description>

      <title>Tensor Factorized Recursive Hamiltonian Downfolding To Optimize The Scaling Complexity Of The Electronic Correlations Problem on Classical and Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new variant of post-Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian downfolding-based quantum chemistry methods with optimized scaling for high-cost simulations like coupled cluster (CC), full configuration interaction (FCI), and multi-reference CI (MRCI) on classical and quantum hardware. This improves the applicability of these calculations to practical use cases. High-accuracy quantum chemistry calculations, such as CC, involve memory and time-intensive tensor operations, which are the primary bottlenecks in determining the properties of many-electron systems. The complexity of those operations scales exponentially with system size. We aim to find properties of chemical systems by optimizing this scaling through mathematical transformations on the Hamiltonian and the state space. By defining a bi-partition of the many-body Hilbert space into electron-occupied and unoccupied blocks for a given orbital, we perform a downfolding transformation that decouples the electron-occupied block from its complement. We represent high-rank electronic integrals and cluster amplitude tensors as low-rank tensor factors of a downfolding transformation, mapping the full many-body Hamiltonian into a smaller dimensional block Hamiltonian recursively. This reduces the computational complexity of solving the residual equations for Hamiltonian downfolding on CPUs from $\mathcal{O}(N^7)$ for CCSD(T) and $\mathcal{O}(N^9)$ - $\mathcal{O}(N^{10})$ for CI and MRCI to $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$. Additionally, we create a quantum circuit encoding of the tensor factors, generating circuits of $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ depth with $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ qubits. We demonstrate super-quadratic speedups of expensive quantum chemistry algorithms on both classical and quantum computers.</description>

      <title>An Updated Quantum Complementarity Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02743v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bohr's complementarity principle has long been a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, positing that, within a given experimental setup, a quantum system (or quanton) can exhibit either its wave-like character, denoted as $W$, or its particle-like character, denoted as $P$, but not both simultaneously. Modern interpretations of Bohr's complementarity principle acknowledge the coexistence of these aspects in the same experiment while introducing the constraint $W + P \le \alpha$. Notably, estimations of $W$ or $P$ frequently rely on indirect retrodiction methods, a practice that has led to the claim of the violation of Bohr's complementarity principle. By taking a different route, recent advancements demonstrate that quantum complementarity relations can be rigorously derived from the axioms of quantum mechanics. To reconcile these observations and eliminate potential paradoxes or violations, we propose an updated formulation for the quantum complementarity principle, which is stated as follows: \textit{For a given quantum state preparation $\rho_t$ at a specific instant of time $t$, the wave and particle behaviors of a quanton are constrained by a complementarity relation $\mathfrak{W}(\rho_t) + \mathfrak{P}(\rho_t) \le \alpha(d)$, which is derived directly from the axioms of quantum mechanics.}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate an efficient and continuous microwave photon to electron converter with large quantum efficiency ($83\%$) and low dark current. These unique properties are enabled by the use of a high kinetic inductance disordered superconductor, granular aluminium, to enhance light-matter interaction and the coupling of microwave photons to electron tunneling processes. As a consequence of strong coupling, we observe both linear and non-linear photon-assisted processes where 2, 3 and 4 photons are converted into a single electron at unprecedentedly low light intensities. Theoretical predictions, which require quantization of the photonic field within a quantum master equation framework, reproduce well the experimental data. This experimental advancement brings the foundation for high-efficiency detection of individual microwave photons using charge-based detection techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find that estimation of coupling strength of arbitrary-body encoding Hamiltonians provides a scaling that increases monotonically with an increase in the number of interacting particles, in the limit of large number of particles. We perform this analysis for two types of probes -- optimal symmetric product probes and optimal ones -- and find that this feature is prevalent in both the cases. Moreover, we also ask if genuine multiparty entanglement is indispensable in attaining the best metrological precision if we employ non-local terms in the Hamiltonian. We identify a dichotomy in the answer. Specifically, we find that Hamiltonians having odd-body interactions necessarily require genuine multipartite entanglement in probes to attain the best metrological precision, but the situation is opposite in the case of Hamiltonians with even-body interactions. The optimal probes corresponding to Hamiltonians that contain even-body interaction terms, may be entangled, but certainly not so in all bipartitions, and particularly, it is possible to attain optimal precision using asymmetric probes. Asymmetry, which therefore is a resource in this scenario rather than genuine multiparty entanglement, refers to the disparity between states of local parts of the global system. Thereby we find a complementarity in the requirement of asymmetry and genuine entanglement in optimal probes for estimating strength of odd- and even-body interactions respectively. Additionally, we provide an upper bound on the number of parties up to which one can always obtain an asymmetric product state that gives the best metrological precision for even-body interactions. En route, we find the quantum Fisher information in closed form for two- and three-body interactions for arbitrary number of parties. Further, we identify conditions on the Hamiltonian, for which these results hold for arbitrary local dimensions.</description>

Abstract: The quantum state discrimination problem has Alice sending a quantum state to Bob who wins if he correctly identifies the state. The pretty good measurement, also known as the square root measurement, performs pretty well at this task. We study the version of this problem where Bob tries to lose with the greatest probability possible (which is harder than it sounds). We define the pretty bad measurement which performs pretty well at this task, or in other words, pretty poorly for the original task. We show that both the pretty good measurement and the pretty bad measurement are always no worse than blind guessing at their respective tasks. As an application, we apply the pretty bad measurement to the quantum state anomaly detection problem and show how to avoid pretty bad qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms show potential in effectively operating on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. A novel variational approach to reinforcement learning has been recently proposed, incorporating linear-optical interferometers and a classical learning model known as projective simulation (PS). PS is a decision-making tool for reinforcement learning and can be classically represented as a random walk on a graph that describes the agent's memory. In its optical quantum version, this approach utilizes quantum walks of single photons on a mesh of tunable beamsplitters and phase shifters to select actions. In this work, we present the implementation of this algorithm on Ascella, a single-photon-based quantum computer from Quandela. The focus is drawn on solving a test bed task to showcase the potential of the quantum agent with respect to the classical agent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15628v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometric properties of quantum states is fully encoded by the quantum geometric tensor. The real and imaginary parts of the quantum geometric tensor are the quantum metric and Berry curvature, which characterize the distance and phase difference between two nearby quantum states in Hilbert space, respectively. For conventional Hermitian quantum systems, the quantum metric corresponds to the fidelity susceptibility and has already been used to specify quantum phase transitions from the geometric perspective. In this work, we extend this wisdom to the non-Hermitian systems for revealing non-Hermitian critical points. To be concrete, by employing numerical exact diagonalization and analytical methods, we calculate the quantum metric and corresponding order parameters in various non-Hermitian models, which include two non-Hermitian generalized Aubry-Andre models and non-Hermitian cluster and mixed-field Ising models. We demonstrate that the quantum metric of eigenstates in these non-Hermitian models exactly identifies the localization transitions, mobility edges, and many-body quantum phase transitions with gap closings, respectively. We further show that this strategy is robust against the finite-size effect and different boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>On computing quantum waves and spin from classical and relativistic action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06328v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Schroedinger equation of quantum physics can be solved using a generalized form of the classical Hamilton-Jacobi least action equation, extending a key result of Feynman applicable only to quadratic actions. The results, which extend to the relativistic setting, build on two developments.
  The first is incorporating geometric constraints directly in the classical least action problem. This leads to multi-valued least action solutions where each local action is its own set element. The multiple solutions replace in part the probabilistic setting by the non-uniqueness of solutions of the constrained problem. For instance, in the double slit experiment or for a particle in a box, spatial inequality constraints create impulsive constraint forces, which lead to multiple path solutions.
  Second, an approximate mapping $ \ \Psi \approx e^{\frac{i }{\hbar} \Phi } \ $ between action $\Phi$ and wave function $\Psi$ has been known since Dirac and even Schroedinger. We show that this mapping can be made exact by introducing a compression ratio of the proposed multi-valued action, which can in turn be interpreted as a probability density on classical trajectories of a fluid flow field. Branch points of the multi-valued least action imply a quantum wave collapse.
  These developments leave the results of associated Feynman path integrals unchanged, but the computation can be greatly simplified as only multi-valued least actions are used, avoiding time-slicing and zig-zag trajectories altogether. They also suggest a smooth transition between physics across scales, with the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism extending to general relativity, in a coordinate-invariant framework. In particular, the Klein-Gordon equation may have a natural extension to general relativity.</description>

Abstract: Strongly-driven nonlinear optical processes such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion and spontaneous four-wave mixing can produce multiphoton nonclassical beams of light which have applications in quantum information processing and sensing. In contrast to the low-gain regime, new physical effects arise in a high-gain regime due to the interactions between the nonclassical light and the strong pump driving the nonlinear process. Here, we describe and experimentally observe a gain-induced group delay between the multiphoton pulses generated in a high-gain type-II spontaneous parametric down-conversion source. Since the group delay introduces distinguishability between the generated photons, it will be important to compensate for it when designing quantum interference devices in which strong optical nonlinearities are required.</description>

Abstract: The cost and the error of the adiabatic theorem for preparing the final eigenstate are discussed in terms of path length. Previous studies in terms of the norm of the Hamiltonian and its derivatives with the spectral gap are limited in their ability to describe the cost of adiabatic state preparation for certain physically large systems. We argue that total time is not a good measure for determining the computational difficulty of adiabatic quantum computation by developing a no-go theorem. From the result of time-periodic Hamiltonian cases, we suggest that there are proxies for computational cost which typically grow as path length increases when the error is kept fixed and small and consider possible conjectures on how general the behavior is.</description>

Abstract: The Lindblad master equation (LME) describing the Markovian dynamics of the quantum open system can be understood as the evolution of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian balanced with random quantum jumps. Here we investigate the balance-breaking dynamics by partly eliminating jumps from postselection experiments. To describe this dynamics, a non-linear Lindblad master equation (NLME) is derived from quantum trajectory method. However, the NLME shows significant advantages in analytical analysis over quantum trajectory method. Using the NLME, we classify the dynamics into two classes. In the trivial class, the process of reducing jumps is completely equivalent to weakening the coupling from the environment. In contrast, the nontrivial class presents more complex dynamics. We study a prototypical model within this class and demonstrate the existence of the postselected skin effect whose steady state is characterized by the accumulation of particles on one side. The steady-state distribution can be fitted by a scale-invariant tanh function which is different from the uniform distribution of LME. Furthermore, the NLME can give a reasonable framework for studying the interplay and competition between the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and dissipative terms. We show this by capturing the characteristics of the trajectory-averaged entanglement entropy influenced by non-Hermitian skin effect and Zeno effect in the model of postselected skin effect.</description>

      <title>Phase-space negativity as a computational resource for quantum kernel methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum kernel methods are a proposal for achieving quantum computational advantage in machine learning. They are based on a hybrid classical-quantum computation where a function called the quantum kernel is estimated by a quantum device while the rest of computation is performed classically. Quantum advantages may be achieved through this method only if the quantum kernel function cannot be estimated efficiently on a classical computer. In this paper, we provide sufficient conditions for the efficient classical estimation of quantum kernel functions for bosonic systems. These conditions are based on phase-space properties of data-encoding quantum states associated with the quantum kernels: negative volume, non-classical depth, and excess range, which are shown to be three signatures of phase-space negativity. We consider quantum optical examples involving linear-optical networks with and without adaptive non-Gaussian measurements, and investigate the effects of loss on the efficiency of the classical simulation. Our results underpin the role of the negativity in phase-space quasi-probability distributions as an essential resource in quantum machine learning based on kernel methods.</description>

      <title>Information scrambling in quantum walks: Discrete-time formulation of Krylov complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study information scrambling -- a spread of initially localized quantum information into the system's many degree of freedom -- in discrete-time quantum walks. We consider out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOC) and K-complexity as a probe of information scrambling. The OTOC for local spin operators in all directions has a light-cone structure which is ``shell-like''. As the wavefront passes, the OTOC approaches to zero in the long-time limit, showing no signature of scrambling. The introduction of spatial or temporal disorder changes the shape of the light-cone akin to localization of wavefunction. We formulate the K-complexity in system with discrete-time evolution, and show that it grows linearly in discrete-time quantum walk. The presence of disorder modifies this growth to sub-linear. Our study present interesting case to explore many-body phenomenon in a discrete-time quantum walk using scrambling.</description>

      <title>Bell vs Bell: a ding-dong battle over quantum incompleteness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Does determinism (or even the incompleteness of quantum mechanics) follow from locality and perfect correlations? In a 1964 paper John Bell gave the first demonstration that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local hidden variables. Since then a vigorous debate has rung out over whether he relied on an assumption of determinism or instead, as he later claimed in a 1981 paper, derived determinism from assumptions of locality and perfect correlation. This paper aims to bring clarity to the debate via simple examples and rigorous results. It is first recalled, via quantum and classical counterexamples, that the weakest statistical form of locality consistent with Bell's 1964 paper (parameter independence) is insufficient for the derivation of determinism. Attention is then turned to critically assess Bell's appealing to the Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky (EPR) incompleteness argument to support his claim. It is shown this argument is itself incomplete, via counterexamples that expose two logical gaps. Closing these gaps via a strong "counterfactual" reality criterion enables a rigorous derivation of both determinism and parameter independence, and in this sense justifies Bell's claim. Conversely, however, it is noted that whereas the EPR argument requires a weaker "measurement choice" assumption than Bell's demonstration, it nevertheless leads to a similar incompatibility with quantum predictions rather than to quantum incompleteness.</description>

      <title>Global calibration of large-scale photonic integrated circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02207v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing maturity of photonic integrated circuit (PIC) fabrication technology enables the high integration of an increasing number of optical components onto a single chip. With the incremental circuit complexity, the calibration of active phase shifters in a large-scale PIC becomes a crucially important issue. The traditional one-by-one calibration techniques encounter significant hurdles with the propagation of calibration errors, and achieving the decoupling of all phase shifters for independent calibration is not straightforward. To address this issue, we propose a global calibration approach for large-scale PIC. Our method utilizes a custom network to simultaneously learn the nonlinear phase-current relations for all thermo-optic phase shifters on the PIC by minimizing the negative likelihood of the measurement datasets. Moreover, the reflectivities of all static beam splitter components can also be synchronizedly extracted using this calibration method. As an example, a quantum walk PIC with a circuit depth of 12 is calibrated, and a programmable discrete-time quantum walk is experimentally demonstrated. These results will greatly benefit the applications of large-scale PICs in photonic quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Spectral Density Modulation and Universal Markovian Closure of Fermionic Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combination of chain-mapping and tensor-network techniques provides a powerful tool for the numerically exact simulation of open quantum systems interacting with structured environments. However, these methods suffer from a quadratic scaling with the physical simulation time, and therefore they become challenging in the presence of multiple environments. This is particularly true when fermionic environments, well-known to be highly correlated, are considered. In this work we first illustrate how a thermo-chemical modulation of the spectral density allows replacing the original fermionic environments with equivalent, but simpler, ones. Moreover, we show how this procedure reduces the number of chains needed to model multiple environments. We then provide a derivation of the fermionic Markovian closure construction, consisting of a small collection of damped fermionic modes undergoing a Lindblad-type dynamics and mimicking a continuum of bath modes. We describe, in particular, how the use of the Markovian closure allows for a polynomial reduction of the time complexity of chain-mapping based algorithms when long-time dynamics are needed.</description>

Abstract: In previous work we have proposed a construction of quantum-like bits that could endow a large, complex classical system, for example of oscillators, with quantum-like function that is not compromised by decoherence. In the present paper we investigate further this platform of quantum-like states. Firstly, we discuss a general protocol on how to construct synchronizing networks that allow for emergent states. We then study how gates can be implemented on those states. This suggests the possibility of quantum-like computing on specially-constructed classical networks. Finally, we define a notion of measurement that allows for non-Kolmogorov interference, a feature that separates our model from a classical probabilistic system. This paper aims to explore the mathematical structure of quantum-like resources, and shows how arbitrary gates can be implemented by manipulating emergent states in those systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage via Efficient Post-processing on Qudit Shadow tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The calculation of \(\text{tr}(AB)\) is essential in fields like quantum science and artificial intelligence, but the classical computational complexity is \( O(d^2) \) when \( A \) and \( B \) are \( d \)-dimensional matrices. Moreover, storing \( A \) and \( B \) requires \( O(d^2) \) memory, which poses additional challenges for exponential high-dimensional systems. We propose a quantum approach through a qudit shadow tomography framework to exponentially reduce both the computational and storage complexity to \( O(\text{poly}(\log d)) \) for a broad class of matrices \( A \) and for bounded-norm Hermitian matrices \( B \) with known \(\text{tr}(B)\). Compared to shadow tomography via random Clifford measurements, our method reduces the computational complexity of post-processing per measurement from an exponential worst-case scenario to a constant, and it is applicable across arbitrary dimensions \( d \). This advancement opens new pathways for efficient high-dimensional data analysis and complex system modeling.</description>

Abstract: One of the greatest debates of our time is whether our macroscopic world (i) naturally emerges from quantum mechanics or (ii) requires new physics. We argue for (ii) and propose a simple gravitational self-decoherence mechanism. The purity loss for a free quantum particle is evaluated and shown to be extremely inefficient for elementary particles but very effective for those at the Planck scale. The physical picture behind it is that coherence would easily leak from heavy enough particles to (non-observable) spacetime quantum degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Faster Randomized Dynamical Decoupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a randomized dynamical decoupling (DD) protocol that can improve the performance of any given deterministic DD, by using no more than two additional pulses. Our construction is implemented by probabilistically applying sequences of pulses, which, when combined, effectively eliminate the error terms that scale linearly with the system-environment coupling strength. As a result, we show that a randomized protocol using a few pulses can outperform deterministic DD protocols that require considerably more pulses. Furthermore, we prove that the randomized protocol provides an improvement compared to deterministic DD sequences that aim to reduce the error in the system's Hilbert space, such as Uhrig DD, which had been previously regarded to be optimal. To rigorously evaluate the performance, we introduce new analytical methods suitable for analyzing higher-order DD protocols that might be of independent interest. We also present numerical simulations confirming the significant advantage of using randomized protocols compared to widely used deterministic protocols.</description>

Abstract: We present the Julia package PauliStrings ( https://github.com/nicolasloizeau/PauliStrings.jl ) for quantum many-body simulations, which performs fast operations on the Pauli group by encoding Pauli strings in binary. All of the Pauli string algebra is encoded into low-level logic operations on integers, and is made efficient by various truncation methods which allow for systematic extrapolation of the results. We illustrate the effectiveness of our package by (i) performing Heisenberg time evolution through direct numerical integration and (ii) by constructing a Liouvillian Krylov space. We benchmark the results against tensor network methods, and we find our package performs favorably. In addition, we show that this representation allows for easy encoding of any geometry. We present results for chaotic and integrable spin systems in 1D as well as some examples in 2D. Currently, the main limitations are the inefficiency of representing non-trivial pure states (or other low-rank operators), as well as the need to introduce dissipation to probe long-time dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Bayesian methods promise enhanced device performance and accelerated data collection. We demonstrate an adaptive Bayesian measurement strategy for atom number estimation in a quantum technology experiment, utilising a symmetry-informed loss function. Compared to a standard unoptimised strategy, our method yields a five-fold reduction in the fractional variance of the atom number estimate. Equivalently, it achieves the target precision with a third of the data points previously required. We provide general expressions for the optimal estimator and error for any quantity amenable to symmetry-informed strategies, facilitating the application of these strategies in quantum computing, communication, metrology, and the wider quantum technology sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical circuit systems, unlike other systems, have the potential to perform quantum information processing (QIP) at higher clock rate than conventional processing. The approach utilizing the electromagnetic field of light allows deterministic QIP by feedforward process, which counteracts the quantum randomness by performing adaptive quantum operation according to the measurement result of an entangled state. However, conventional feedforward with electronic measurement devices has limited the clock rate of the QIP down to around 100 MHz. In this paper, we demonstrate a variable squeezing gate with a clock rate of 1.3 THz by all-optical measurement-device-free feedforward. We utilize a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide as an optical parametric amplifier, which eliminates the need for electronic measuring devices and enables ultra-fast feedforward. Experimental results demonstrate that our all-optical QIP operates at a THz clock rate, representing a major step toward a true optical quantum computer which opens the curtain to a new era of ultra-fast information processing.</description>

      <title>Efficient Detection of Strong-To-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking via the R\'enyi-1 Correlator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) has recently emerged as a universal feature of quantum mixed-state phases of matter. While various information-theoretic diagnostics have been proposed to define and characterize SWSSB phases, relating these diagnostics to observables which can be efficiently and scalably probed on modern quantum devices remains challenging. Here we propose a new observable for SWSSB in mixed states, called the R\'enyi-1 correlator, which naturally suggests a potential route towards scalably detecting SWSSB phases in experiment. Specifically, if the canonical purification (CP) of a given mixed state can be reliably prepared, then SWSSB in the mixed state can be detected via ordinary two-point correlation functions in the CP state. We discuss several simple examples of CP states which can be efficiently prepared on quantum devices, and whose reduced density matrices exhibit SWSSB. The R\'enyi-1 correlator also satisfies several useful theoretical properties: it naturally inherits a stability theorem recently proven for the closely-related fidelity correlator, and it directly defines SWSSB as a particular pattern of ordinary spontaneous symmetry breaking in the CP state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation, as a general process of loading classical data to quantum device, is essential for end-to-end implementation of quantum algorithms. Yet, existing methods suffer from either high circuit depth or complicated hardware, limiting their practicality and robustness. In this work, we overcome these limitations with a bucket-brigade approach. The tree architectures of our hardware represents the simplest connectivity required for achieving sub-exponential circuit depth. Leveraging the bucket-brigade mechanism that can suppress the error propagation between different branches, our approach exhibit exponential improvement on the robustness compared to existing depth-optimal methods. More specifically, the infidelity scales as $O(\text{polylog}(N))$ with data size $N$, as oppose to $O(N)$ for conventional methods. Moreover, our approach is the first to simultaneously achieve linear Clifford$+T$ circuit depth, gate count number, and space-time allocation. These advancements offer the opportunity for processing big data in both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a quasi-ergodic steady state in a dissipative Tavis-Cummings array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an atom-photon interacting system described by Tavis Cummings Hubbard (TCH) model, we demonstrate the emergence of a quasi-steady state in a dissipative environment that exhibits intriguing ergodic behavior. The TCH model undergoes a dissipative transition from normal to superradiant phase hosting a gapped Higgs and gapless Goldstone modes. However, in a large region of the phase diagram, the instability of the Goldstone mode leads to the disappearance of the stable superradiant phase. In this regime, the decorrelator dynamics reveals light cone spreading of the perturbations and positive Lyapunov exponent, indicating enhanced fluctuations. Remarkably, a quasi-steady state emerges under quench dynamics in this unstable regime; in this state, a class of collective quantities such as site averaged photon number and atomic excitations approach a steady value, in spite of large temporal fluctuations in corresponding microscopic variables. This quasi-steady state describes an incoherent fluid of photons with significant phase fluctuation. The phase space dynamics reveals a fascinating ergodic behavior in presence of dissipation, leading to the characterization of the dynamical variables into two distinct classes. The first class includes site-averaged photon numbers and atomic excitations; these exhibit a stationary distribution regardless of the initial condition indicating ergodic behavior. The second class of variables, particularly those related to phase in contrast, retain information about the initial conditions, resulting in a violation of ergodicity for finite size system. Additionally, the dynamical variables of the ergodic class exhibit fascinating collective scarring phenomenon as the peak of their distribution is attracted towards the unstable steady state, analogous to the single particle quantum scar. We discuss the relevance of our findings in the current experiments.</description>

      <title>Emerging topological characterization in non-equilibrium states of quenched Kitaev chains</title>

Abstract: Topological characteristics of quantum systems are typically determined by the closing of a gap, while the dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) during quantum real-time evolution has emerged as a nonequilibrium analog to the quantum phase transition (QPT). In this paper, we illustrate that the system dynamics can be elucidated by considering the precession of a collection of free-pseudo spins under a magnetic field based on the exact results of extended Kitaev chains. The topology of the driven Hamiltonian is determined by the average winding number of the nonequilibrium state. Furthermore, we establish that the singularity of the DQPT arises from two perpendicular pseudo-spin vectors associated with the pre- and post-quenched Hamiltonians. Moreover, we investigate the distinct behaviors of the dynamic pairing order parameter in both topological and non-topological regions. These findings offer valuable insights into the non-equilibrium behavior of topological superconductors, contributing to the understanding of the resilience of topological properties in driven quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gate-defined quantum dots are a promising candidate system for realizing scalable, coupled qubit systems and serving as a fundamental building block for quantum computers. However, present-day quantum dot devices suffer from imperfections that must be accounted for, which hinders the characterization, tuning, and operation process. Moreover, with an increasing number of quantum dot qubits, the relevant parameter space grows sufficiently to make heuristic control infeasible. Thus, it is imperative that reliable and scalable autonomous tuning approaches are developed. This meeting report outlines current challenges in automating quantum dot device tuning and operation with a particular focus on datasets, benchmarking, and standardization. We also present insights and ideas put forward by the quantum dot community on how to overcome them. We aim to provide guidance and inspiration to researchers invested in automation efforts.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio variational wave functions for the time-dependent many-electron Schr\"odinger equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the real-time evolution of many-electron quantum systems is essential for studying dynamical properties in condensed matter, quantum chemistry, and complex materials, yet it poses a significant theoretical and computational challenge. Our work introduces a variational approach for fermionic time-dependent wave functions, surpassing mean-field approximations by accurately capturing many-body correlations. Therefore, we employ time-dependent Jastrow factors and backflow transformations, which are enhanced through neural networks parameterizations. To compute the optimal time-dependent parameters, we utilize the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo technique and a new method based on Taylor-root expansions of the propagator, enhancing the accuracy of our simulations. The approach is demonstrated in three distinct systems. In all cases, we show clear signatures of many-body correlations in the dynamics. The results showcase the ability of our variational approach to accurately capture the time evolution, providing insight into the quantum dynamics of interacting electronic systems, beyond the capabilities of mean-field.</description>

      <title>A Tensor Product Space for Studying the Interaction of Bipartite States of Light with Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pairs of entangled photons are important for applications in quantum nanophotonics, where their theoretical description must accommodate their bipartite character. Such character is shared at the other end of the intensity range by, for example, the two degenerate instances of the pump field involved in second-harmonic generation. The description and numerical simulation of the interaction of nanophotonic structures with bipartite states of light is challenging regardless of their intensity, and has important technological applications. To address such a challenge, we develop here a theoretical and computational framework for studying the interaction of material structures with bipartite states of light. The theory of the framework rests on the symmetrized tensor product space of two copies of an electromagnetic Hilbert space. For the computational side, the convenient T-matrix method is extended to the tensor product space. When the response of the object to one part of the state is independent of the other part, the T-matrix for bipartite states is a simple function of the typical T-matrix of the single Hilbert space. Such separable material response is relevant, for example, in the interaction of entangled biphoton states with nanostructures. Non-separable operators are identified as the adequate objects to fully integrate non-linear effects such as sum frequency generation or parametric down-conversion. As an example of application, we derive selection rules for second-order non-linear processes in objects with rotational and/or mirror symmetries, and verify them numerically in two different MoS$_2$ clusters.</description>

      <title>Feedback Intensity Equalization Algorithm for Multi-Spots Holographic Tweezer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thanks to the high degree of adjustability, holographic tweezer array has been proved to be the best choice to create arbitrary geometries atomic array. In holographic tweezer array experiment, optical tweezer generated by spatial light modulator (SLM) usually is used as static tweezer array. Due to the alternating current(AC) stark shifts effect, intensity difference of traps will cause different light shift. So, the optimization of intensity equalization is very important in many-body system consist of single atoms. Here we report a work on studying of intensity equalization algorithm. Through this algorithm, the uniformity of tweezer can exceed 96% when the number of tweezer size is bigger than 1000. Our analysis shows that further uniformity requires further optimization of optical system. The realization of the intensity equalization algorithm is of great significance to the many-body experiments based on single atom array.</description>

      <title>Phonon-Induced Exchange Gate Infidelities in Semiconducting Si-SiGe Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-spin exchange interactions between semiconductor spin qubits allow for fast single and two-qubit gates. During exchange, coupling of the qubits to a surrounding phonon bath may cause errors in the resulting gate. Here, the fidelities of exchange operations with semiconductor double quantum dot spin qubits in a Si-SiGe heterostructure coupled to a finite temperature phonon bath are considered. By employing a master equation approach, the isolated effect of each spin-phonon coupling term may be resolved, as well as leakage errors of encoded qubit operations. As the temperature is increased, a crossover is observed from where the primary source of error is due to a phonon induced perturbation of the two electron spin states, to one where the phonon induced coupling to an excited orbital state becomes the dominant error. Additionally, it is shown that a simple trade-off in pulse shape and length can improve robustness to spin-phonon induced errors during gate operations by up to an order of magnitude. Our results suggest that for elevated temperatures within 200-300 mK, exchange gate operations are not currently limited by bulk phonons. This is consistent with recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Corner Charge Fluctuations and Many-Body Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many-body systems with U(1) global symmetry, the charge fluctuations in a subregion reveal important insights into entanglement and other global properties. For subregions with sharp corners, bipartite fluctuations have been predicted to exhibit a universal shape dependence on the corner angle in certain quantum phases and transitions, characterized by a "universal angle function" and a "universal coefficient." However, we demonstrate that this simple formula is insufficient for charge insulators, including composite fermi liquids. In these systems, the corner contribution may depend on the corner angle, subregion orientation, and other microscopic details. We provide an infinite series representation of the corner term, introducing orientation-resolved universal angle functions with their non-universal coefficients. In the small-angle limit or under orientation averaging, the remaining terms' coefficients are fully determined by the many-body quantum metric, which, while not universal, adheres to both a universal topological lower bound and an energetic upper bound. We also clarify the conditions for bound saturation in (anisotropic) Landau levels, leveraging the generalized Kohn theorem and holomorphic properties of many-body wavefunctions. We find that a broad class of fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions, including unprojected parton states and composite-fermion Fermi sea wavefunctions, saturates the bounds.</description>

      <title>Fermionic logarithmic negativity in the Krawtchouk chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement of non-complementary regions is investigated in an inhomogeneous free-fermion chain through the lens of the fermionic logarithmic negativity. Focus is on the Krawtchouk chain, whose relation to the eponymous orthogonal polynomials allows for exact diagonalization and analytical calculations of certain correlation functions. For adjacent regions, the negativity scaling corresponds to that of a conformal field theory with central charge $c=1$, in agreement with previous studies on bipartite entanglement in the Krawtchouk chain. For disjoint regions, we focus on the skeletal regime where each region reduces to a single site. This regime is sufficient to extract the leading behaviour at large distances. In the bulk, the negativity decays as $d^{-4 \Delta_f}$ with $\Delta_f=1/2$, where $d$ is the separation between the regions. This is in agreement with the homogeneous result of free Dirac fermions in one dimension. Surprisingly, when one site is close to the boundary, this exponent changes and depends on the parity of the boundary site $m=0,1,2,\dots$, with $\Delta_f^{\textrm{even}}=3/8$ and $\Delta_f^{\textrm{odd}}=5/8$. The results are supported by numerics and analytical calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21850v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If a neutrino or antineutrino produced in the decay of an unstable particle is not entangled to its accompanying particles, its mass is necessarily correlated with its momentum. In this note, I illustrate this entanglement would destroy the quantum coherence between the neutrino's mass eigenstates in both the momentum and position representations, which was overlooked by other authors in previous investigations of entanglement and coherence associated with neutrino oscillations.</description>
