      <title>Bounds on Velocity-Dependent Dark Matter-Baryon Scattering from Large-Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore interacting dark matter (DM) models that allow DM and baryons to scatter off of each other with a cross section that scales with relative particle velocity. Using the effective field theory of large-scale structure, we perform the first analysis of BOSS full-shape galaxy clustering data for velocity-dependent DM-baryon interactions. We determine that while the addition of BOSS full-shape data visibly modifies the shape of the posterior distribution, it does not significantly alter the 95% confidence level intervals for the interaction cross section obtained from an analysis of the cosmic microwave (CMB) anisotropy from Planck measurements alone. Moreover, in agreement with previous findings, we note that the DM-baryon interacting model presents a good fit to both large-scale structure (LSS) data and CMB data and alleviates the $S_8$ tension between the two data sets. After combining LSS and CMB data with weak lensing data from the Dark Energy Survey, we find a $\gtrsim2\sigma$ preference for non-zero interactions between DM and baryons in a velocity-independent model. We also explore a scenario where only a fraction of DM undergoes scattering with baryons; we find a similar $\gtrsim2\sigma$ preference for the presence of interactions. Our results suggest that a suppression of the linear matter power spectrum at small scales may be needed to resolve certain discrepancies between LSS and CMB data that are found in the cold DM (CDM) scenario.</description>

      <title>An Alcock-Paczynski Test on Reionization Bubbles for Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an Alcock-Paczy\'nski (AP) test to constrain cosmology using HII bubbles during the Epoch of Reionization. Similarly to cosmic voids, a stack of HII bubbles is spherically symmetric because ionizing fronts propagate isotropically on average (even if individual bubbles may not be spherical), making them standard spheres to be used in an AP test. Upcoming 21-cm observations, from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) for instance, will contain tomographic information about HII regions during reionization. However, extracting the bubbles from this signal is made difficult because of instrumental noise and foreground systematics. Here, we use a neural network to reconstruct neutral-fraction boxes from the noisy 21-cm signal, from which we extract bubbles using a watershed algorithm. We then run the purely geometrical AP test on these stacks, showing that a SKA-like experiment will be able to constrain the product of the angular-diameter distance $D_{\text{A}}$ and Hubble parameter $H$ at reionization redshifts with $\sim 2\%$ precision, robustly to astrophysical and cosmological uncertainties within the models tested here. This AP test, whether performed on 21-cm observations or other large surveys of ionized bubbles, will allow us to fill the knowledge gap about the expansion rate of our Universe at reionization redshifts.</description>

      <title>Tomographic halo model of the unWISE-Blue galaxies using cross-correlations with BOSS CMASS galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The halo model offers a framework for investigating galaxy clustering, and for understanding the growth of galaxies and the distribution of galaxies of different types. Here, we use the halo model to study the small-scale clustering and halo occupation distribution (HOD) of the unWISE-Blue galaxy sample, an infrared-selected sample of $\sim$100 million galaxies across the entire extragalactic sky at $z\sim 0.5$ $-$ similar redshifts to the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) CMASS sample. Although the photometric unWISE galaxies cannot be easily split in redshift, we use their cross-correlation with the BOSS CMASS sample to tomographically probe the HOD of the unWISE galaxies at $0.45 &lt; z &lt; 0.75$. To do so, we develop a new method for applying the halo model to cross-correlations between a photometric sample and a spectroscopic sample in narrow redshift bins, incorporating halo exclusion, post-Limber corrections, and redshift-space distortions. We reveal strong evolution in the CMASS HOD, and modest evolution in the unWISE-Blue HOD. For unWISE-Blue, we find that the average bias and mean halo mass drop from $b = 1.6$ and $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{h}}/M_{\odot}) \sim 13.4$ at $z \sim 0.5$ to $b = 1.4$ and $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{h}}/M_{\odot}) \sim 13.1$ at $z \sim 0.7$, and that the satellite fraction drops modestly from $\sim$20% to $\sim$10% in the same range. These results are useful for creating mock samples of the unWISE-Blue galaxies. Furthermore, the techniques developed to obtain these results are applicable to other tomographic cross-correlations between photometric samples and narrowly-binned spectroscopic samples, such as clustering redshifts.</description>

      <title>The connection between high-redshift galaxies and Lyman ${\alpha}$ transmission in the Sherwood-Relics simulations of patchy reionisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has suggested that, during reionisation, spatial variations in the ionising radiation field should produce enhanced Ly ${\alpha}$ forest transmission at distances of tens of comoving Mpc from high-redshift galaxies. We demonstrate that the Sherwood-Relics suite of hybrid radiation-hydrodynamical simulations are qualitatively consistent with this interpretation. The shape of the galaxy--Ly ${\alpha}$ transmission cross-correlation is sensitive to both the mass of the haloes hosting the galaxies and the volume averaged fraction of neutral hydrogen in the IGM, $\bar{x}_{\rm HI}$. The reported excess Ly ${\alpha}$ forest transmission on scales r ~ 10 cMpc at $\langle z \rangle \approx 5.2$ -- as measured using C IV absorbers as proxies for high-redshift galaxies -- is quantitatively reproduced by Sherwood-Relics at z = 6 if we assume the galaxies that produce ionising photons are hosted in haloes with mass $M_{\rm h}\geq 10^{10}~h^{-1}\,{\rm M}_\odot$. However, this redshift mismatch is equivalent to requiring $\bar{x}_{\rm HI}\sim 0.1$ at $z\simeq 5.2$, which is inconsistent with the observed Ly ${\alpha}$ forest effective optical depth distribution. We speculate this tension may be partly resolved if the minimum C IV absorber host halo mass at z &gt; 5 is larger than $M_{\rm h}=10^{10}~h^{-1}\,{\rm M}_\odot$. After reionisation completes, relic IGM temperature fluctuations will continue to influence the shape of the cross-correlation on scales of a few comoving Mpc at $4 \leq z \leq 5$. Constraining the redshift evolution of the cross-correlation over this period may therefore provide further insight into the timing of reionisation.</description>

      <title>How probable is the Lyman-$\alpha$ damping wing in the spectrum of the redshift z = 5.9896 quasar ULAS J0148+0600?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shape of the Ly-$\alpha$ transmission in the near zone of the redshift $z=5.9896$ quasar ULAS J0148$+$0600 (hereafter J0148) is consistent with a damping wing arising from an extended neutral hydrogen island in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM). Here we use simulations of late-ending reionisation from Sherwood-Relics to assess the expected incidence of quasars with Ly-$\alpha$ and Ly-$\beta$ absorption similar to the observed J0148 spectrum. We find a late end to reionisation at $z=5.3$ is a necessary requirement for reproducing a Ly-$\alpha$ damping wing consistent with J0148. This occurs in $\sim3$ per cent of our simulated spectra for an IGM neutral fraction $\langle x_{\rm HI}\rangle=0.14$ at $z=6$. However, using standard assumptions for the ionising photon output of J0148, the a priori probability of drawing a simulated quasar spectrum with a Ly-$\alpha$ damping wing profile and Ly-$\alpha$ near zone size that simultaneously match J0148 is very low, $p&lt;10^{-3}$. We speculate this is because the ionising emission from J0148 is variable on timescales $t&lt;10^{5}\rm\,yr$, or alternatively that the Ly-$\alpha$ transmission in the J0148 near zone is impacted by the transverse proximity effect from nearby star-forming galaxies or undetected quasars. We also predict the IGM temperature should be $T\sim 4\times 10^{4}\rm\,K$ within a few proper Mpc of the Ly-$\alpha$ near zone edge due to recent HI and HeII photo-heating. Evidence for enhanced thermal broadening in the Ly-$\alpha$ absorption near the damping wing edge would provide further evidence that the final stages of reionisation are occurring at $z&lt;6$.</description>

      <title>Fast Sampling of Cosmological Initial Conditions with Gaussian Neural Posterior Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge of the primordial matter density field from which the large-scale structure of the Universe emerged over cosmic time is of fundamental importance for cosmology. However, reconstructing these cosmological initial conditions from late-time observations is a notoriously difficult task, which requires advanced cosmological simulators and sophisticated statistical methods to explore a multi-million-dimensional parameter space. We show how simulation-based inference (SBI) can be used to tackle this problem and to obtain data-constrained realisations of the primordial dark matter density field in a simulation-efficient way with general non-differentiable simulators. Our method is applicable to full high-resolution dark matter $N$-body simulations and is based on modelling the posterior distribution of the constrained initial conditions to be Gaussian with a diagonal covariance matrix in Fourier space. As a result, we can generate thousands of posterior samples within seconds on a single GPU, orders of magnitude faster than existing methods, paving the way for sequential SBI for cosmological fields. Furthermore, we perform an analytical fit of the estimated dependence of the covariance on the wavenumber, effectively transforming any point-estimator of initial conditions into a fast sampler. We test the validity of our obtained samples by comparing them to the true values with summary statistics and performing a Bayesian consistency test.</description>

      <title>The cosmic optical background intensity from decaying sterile neutrinos via magnetic dipole moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NASA's New Horizon observations yielded the most accurate measurement of the cosmic optical background (COB) intensity. The reported COB flux is $16.37\pm 1.47$ $\mathrm{nW/m^2/sr}$ at a pivot wavelength $ \lambda_{piv} = 0.608~ \mu\mathrm{m}$ observed in the range $( 0.4 ~ \mu\mathrm{m} \lesssim \lambda \lesssim 0.9 \, \mu\mathrm{m})$. After subtracting the measured intensity from the deep Hubble space telescope count, an anomalous excess flux $8.06 \pm 1.92~\mathrm{nW/m^2/sr}$ has been found. This observation could hint toward decaying dark matter producing photons. In this work, we have considered sterile neutrinos of the keV scale as well as the eV scale decaying via sterile-to-sterile transition magnetic dipole moment and active-to-sterile transition magnetic dipole moment, respectively, to explain anomalous flux. The sterile neutrinos with a mass of $\mathcal{O}(\rm keV)$ with transition magnetic moment in the range $3\times 10^{-14}\,\mu_{B} - 10^{-13}\,\mu_{B}$, and mass of $\mathcal{O}(\rm eV)$ with transition magnetic moment in the range $3.33\times 10^{-13}\,\mu_{B} - 10^{-12}\,\mu_{B}$ can successfully account for the observed anomalous intensity.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Ultra-light Axion Dark Matter through Galaxy Cluster Number Counts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-light axions are hypothetical scalar particles that influence the evolution of large-scale structures of the Universe. Depending on their mass, they can potentially be part of the dark matter component of the Universe, as candidates commonly referred to as fuzzy dark matter. While strong constraints have been established for pure fuzzy dark matter models, the more general scenario where ultra-light axions constitute only a fraction of the dark matter has been limited to a few observational probes. In this work, we use the galaxy cluster number counts obtained from the first All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) of the SRG/eROSITA mission together with gravitational weak lensing data from the Dark Energy Survey, the Kilo-Degree Survey, and the Hyper Suprime-Cam, to constrain the fraction of ultra-light axions in the mass range $10^{-32}$ eV to $10^{-24}$ eV. We put upper bounds on the ultra-light axion relic density in independent logarithmic axion mass bins by performing a full cosmological parameter inference. We find an exclusion region in the intermediate ultra-light axion mass regime with the tightest bounds reported so far in the mass bins around $m_\mathrm{a}=10^{-27}$ eV with $\Omega_\mathrm{a} &lt; 0.0036$ and $m_\mathrm{a}=10^{-26}$ eV with $\Omega_\mathrm{a} &lt; 0.0084$, both at 95% confidence level. When combining with CMB probes, these bounds are tightened to $\Omega_\mathrm{a} &lt; 0.0030$ in the $m_\mathrm{a}=10^{27}$ eV mass bin and $\Omega_\mathrm{a} &lt; 0.0058$ in the $m_\mathrm{a}=10^{-26}$ eV mass bin, both at 95% confidence level. This is the first time that constraints on ultra-light axions have been obtained using the growth of structure measured by galaxy cluster number counts. These results pave the way for large surveys, which can be utilized to obtain tight constraints on the mass and relic density of ultra-light axions with better theoretical modeling of the abundance of halos.</description>

      <title>Interacting dark energy constraints from the full-shape analyses of BOSS DR12 and DES Year 3 measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark Scattering (DS) is an interacting dark energy model characterised by pure momentum exchange between dark energy and dark matter. It is phenomenologically interesting because it is unconstrained by CMB data and can alleviate the $S_8$ tension. We derive constraints on cosmological and DS parameters using three two-point correlation functions (3$\times$2pt) from the Dark Energy Survey third year data release (DES Y3). We then add information from the multipoles of the galaxy power spectrum combined with Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements using the twelfth data release of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS DR12) and external BAO measurements. We compare results from the direct combination of the probes with the joint posterior distribution calculated with a normalising flow approach. Additionally, we run a CMB analysis with the Planck Public Release 4 (PR4) for comparison of the cosmological constraints. Overall, we find that the combination of probes allows minimising the projection effects and improves constraints without the need to include CMB information. It brings the marginalised posterior maxima closer to the corresponding best-fit values and weakens the sensitivity to the priors of the spectroscopic modelling nuisance parameters. These findings are highly relevant in light of forthcoming data of surveys like DESI, Euclid, and Rubin.</description>

      <title>DESI Strong Lens Foundry I: HST Observations and Modeling with GIGA-Lens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03455v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Strong Lens Foundry. We discovered $\sim 3500$ new strong gravitational lens candidates in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys using residual neural networks (ResNet). We observed a subset (51) of our candidates using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). All of them were confirmed to be strong lenses. We also briefly describe spectroscopic follow-up observations by DESI and Keck NIRES programs. From this very rich dataset, a number of studies will be carried out, including evaluating the quality of the ResNet search candidates and lens modeling. In this paper, we present our initial effort in these directions. In particular, as a demonstration, we present the lens model for DESI-165.4754-06.0423, with imaging data from HST, and lens and source redshifts from DESI and Keck NIRES, respectively. In this effort, we have applied a \emph{fully} forward-modeling Bayesian approach (GIGA-Lens), using \emph{multiple} GPUs, for the first time in both regards, to a strong lens with HST data, or any high resolution imaging.</description>

      <title>Clustering of the extreme: A theoretical description of weak lensing critical points power spectra in the mildly nonlinear regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03457v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cosmic web analysis, complementary to traditional cosmological probes, the extrema (e.g. peaks and voids) two-point correlation functions (2PCFs) are of particular interest for the study of both astrophysical phenomena and cosmological structure formation. However most previous studies constructed those statistics via N-body simulations without a robust theoretical derivation from first principles. A strong motivation exists for analytically describing the 2PCFs of these local extrema, taking into account the nonlinear gravitational evolution in the late Universe. In this paper, we derive analytical formulae for the power spectra and 2PCFs of 2D critical points, including peaks (maxima), voids (minima) and saddle points, in mildly non-Gaussian weak gravitational lensing fields. We apply a perturbative bias expansion to model the clustering of 2D critical points. We successfully derive the power spectrum of weak lensing critical points up to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in gravitational perturbation theory, where trispectrum configurations of the weak lensing field have to be included. We numerically evaluate those power spectra up to the next-to-leading order (NLO), which correspond to the inclusion of bispectrum configurations, and transform them to the corresponding 2PCFs. An exact Monte Carlo (MC) integration is performed assuming a Gaussian distributed density field to validate our theoretical predictions. Overall, we find similar properties in 2D compared to the clustering of 3D critical points previously measured from N-body simulations. Contrary to standard lensing power spectra analysis, we find distinct BAO features in the lensing peak 2PCFs due to the gradient and curvature constraints, and we quantify that non-Gaussianity makes for ~10% of the signal at quasi-linear scales which could be important for current stage-IV surveys.</description>

      <title>Charged particle geodesics and closed timelike curves in an electromagnetic universe</title>

Abstract: The spinning electromagnetic universe, known also as the Rotating Bertotti-Robinson(RBR) spacetime is considered as a model to represent our cosmos. The model derives from different physical considerations, such as colliding waves, throat region, and near horizon geometry of the Kerr-Newman black hole. Our interest is whether such a singularity-free spinning cosmology gives rise to a natural direction of flow, a 'chirality' for charged particles. Homochiral structures are known to be crucial for biology to start. Our concern here is cosmology rather than biology, but as in biology, the stable structures in cosmology may also rely on homochiral elements. We show the occurrence of closed timelike curves a 'la' G{\"o}del. Such curves, however, seem possible only at localized cell structures, not at large scales, but according to our prescription of near horizon geometry, they arise in the vicinity of any charged, spinning black hole.</description>

      <title>Running Love Numbers and the Effective Field Theory of Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive states produce higher derivative corrections to Einstein gravity in the infrared, which are encoded into operators of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of gravity. These EFT operators modify the geometry and affect the tidal properties of black holes, either neutral or charged. A thorough analysis of the perturbative tidal deformation problem leads us to introduce a tidal Green function, which we use to derive two universal formulae that efficiently provide the constant and running Love numbers induced by the EFT. We apply these formulae to determine the tidal response of EFT-corrected non-spinning black holes induced by vector and tensor fields, reproducing existing results where available and deriving new ones. We find that neutral black hole Love numbers run classically for $l\geq 3$ while charged ones run for $l\geq2$. Insights from the Frobenius method and from EFT principles confirm that the Love number renormalization flow is a well-defined physical effect. We find that extremal black holes can have Love numbers much larger than neutral ones, up to ${\cal O}(1)$ within the EFT validity regime, and that the EFT cutoff corresponds to the exponential suppression of the Schwinger effect. We discuss the possibility of probing an Abelian dark sector through gravitational waves, considering a scenario in which dark-charged extremal black holes exist in the present-day Universe.</description>

      <title>Structure formation in the local Universe and the cosmological constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure formation in the local Universe is considered within the weak-field modification of General Relativity involving the cosmological constant. This approach enables to describe the dynamics of groups and clusters of galaxies, to explain the discrepancy in the observational properties of the local (late) and the global (early) Universe, i.e. the Hubble tension as a result of two flows, local and global ones, with non-equal Hubble parameters. The kinetic analysis with the modified gravitational potential involving the cosmological constant is shown to predict semi-periodical structure of filaments in the local universe. In the local scale this complements the Zeldovich pancake theory of evolution of the primordial density perturbations and of structure formation in the cosmological scale. The role of the cosmological constant is outlined in rescaling of the physical constants from one aeon to another within the Conformal Cyclic Cosmology.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of liquid xenon in the context of light dark matter direct detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a description of the electronic structure of xenon within the density-functional theory formalism with the goal of accurately modeling dark matter-induced ionisation in liquid xenon detectors. We compare the calculated electronic structures of the atomic, liquid and crystalline solid phases, and find that the electronic charge density and its derivatives in momentum space are similar in the atom and the liquid, consistent with the weak interatomic van der Waals bonding. The only notable difference is a band broadening of the highest occupied $5p$ levels, reflected in the densities of states of the condensed phases, as a result of the inter-atomic interactions. We therefore use the calculated density of states of the liquid phase, combined with the standard literature approach for the isolated atom, to recompute ionisation rates and exclusion limit curves for the XENON10 and XENON1T experiments. We find that the broadening of the 5$p$ levels induced by the liquid phase is relevant only at low dark matter masses, where it increases the ionisation rate relative to that of the isolated atom. For most of the probable mass range the energies of the discrete 4$d$ and 5$s$ levels have the strongest effect on the rate. Our findings suggest a simple scheme for calculating dark matter-electron scattering rates in liquid noble gas detectors, using the calculated values for the atom weighted by the density of states of the condensed phase.</description>

      <title>Exploring Hubble Tension Alleviation through Neutrino-Coupled Perturbed $f(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work examines the Hubble constant (\(H_0\)) tension within the frameworks of perturbed \(f(R)\) gravity and perturbed \(f(R)\) gravity coupled with neutrinos, using lastest observational data. The datasets incorporate the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Cosmic Chronometers (CC), lensing, and Pantheon supernovae. We compare the ability of these models to bridge the discrepancy between Planck 2018 (\(H_0 = 67.4 \pm 0.5 \ \text{km/s/Mpc}\)) and the local R22 measurement (\(H_0 = 73.5 \pm 1.04 \ \text{km/s/Mpc}\)). In perturbed \(f(R)\) gravity, the derived \(H_0\) values align closely with Planck, leaving a substantial tension with R22. The inclusion of neutrino interactions introduces additional parameters that shift \(H_0\) toward higher values, reducing the tension with local measurements. Notably, the coupled model achieves a smaller residual tension compared to the standalone perturbed \(f(R)\) model, indicating that neutrino physics plays a significant role in modifying the late-time expansion dynamics. While both models provide insights into addressing the Hubble tension, the coupled \(f(R)\) gravity with neutrinos offers a more consistent alignment across the datasets.</description>

      <title>Percolation of Domain Walls in the Two-Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain walls formed during a phase transition in a simple field theory model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in a periodic box have been demonstrated to annihilate as fast as causality allows and their area density scales $\propto t^{-1}$. We have performed numerical simulations of the dynamics of domain walls in the Two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) where the potential has $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in two spatial dimensions. We observed significant differences with the standard case. Although the extreme long-time limit is the same for the $\approx 10^{5}$ sets of random initial configurations analysed, the percolation process is much slower due to the formation of long-lived loops. We suggest that this is due to the build up of superconducting currents on the walls which could lead ultimately to stationary configurations known as Kinky Vortons. We discuss the relevance of these findings for the production of Vortons in three spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Improving the Determination of Supernova Cosmological Redshifts by Using Galaxy Groups</title>

Abstract: At the low-redshift end ($z&lt;0.05$) of the Hubble diagram with Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), the contribution to Hubble residual scatter from peculiar velocities is of similar size to that due to the limitations of the standardization of the SN Ia light curves. A way to improve the redshift measurement of the SN host galaxy is to utilize the average redshift of the galaxy group, effectively averaging over small-scale/intracluster peculiar velocities. One limiting factor is the fraction of SN host galaxies in galaxy groups, previously found to be 30% using (relatively incomplete) magnitude-limited galaxy catalogs. Here, we do the first analysis of N-body simulations to predict this fraction, finding $\sim$73% should have associated groups and group averaging should improve redshift precision by $\sim$135 km s$^{-1}$ ($\sim$0.04 mag at $z=0.025$). Furthermore, using spectroscopic data from the Anglo-Australian Telescope, we present results from the first pilot program to evaluate whether or not 23 previously unassociated SN Ia hosts belong in groups. We find that 91% of these candidates can be associated with groups, consistent with predictions from simulations given the sample size. Combining with previously assigned SN host galaxies in Pantheon+, we demonstrate improvement in Hubble residual scatter equivalent to 145 km s$^{-1}$, also consistent with simulations. For new and upcoming low-$z$ samples from, for example, ZTF and LSST, a separate follow-up program identifying galaxy groups of SN hosts is a highly cost-effective way to enhance their constraining power.</description>

      <title>Scant evidence for thawing quintessence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New constraints on the expansion rate of the Universe seem to favor evolving dark energy in the form of thawing quintessence models, i.e., models for which a canonical, minimally coupled scalar field has, at late times, begun to evolve away from potential energy domination. We scrutinize the evidence for thawing quintessence by exploring what it predicts for the equation of state. We show that, in terms of the usual Chevalier-Polarski-Linder parameters, ($w_0$, $w_a$), thawing quintessence is, in fact, only marginally consistent with a compilation of the current data. Despite this, we embrace the possibility that thawing quintessence is dark energy and find constraints on the microphysics of this scenario. We do so in terms of the effective mass $m^2$ and energy scale $V_0$ of the scalar field potential. We are particularly careful to enforce un-informative, flat priors on these parameters so as to minimize their effect on the final posteriors. While the current data favors a large and negative value of $m^2$, when we compare these models to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model we find that there is scant evidence for thawing quintessence.</description>

      <title>Testing the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power spectrum of a halo model using hydrodynamical simulations</title>

Abstract: Statistical properties of LSS serve as powerful tools to constrain the cosmological properties of our Universe. Tracing the gas pressure, the tSZ effect is a biased probe of mass distribution and can be used to test the physics of feedback or cosmological models. Therefore, it is crucial to develop robust modeling of hot gas pressure for applications to tSZ surveys. Since gas collapses into bound structures, it is expected that most of the tSZ signal is within halos produced by cosmic accretion shocks. Hence, simple empirical halo models can be used to predict the tSZ power spectra. In this study, we employed the HMx halo model to compare the tSZ power spectra with those of several hydrodynamical simulations: the Horizon suite and the Magneticum simulation. We examined various contributions to the tSZ power spectrum across different redshifts, including the one- and two-halo term decomposition, the amount of bound gas, the importance of different masses and the electron pressure profiles. Our comparison of the tSZ power spectrum reveals discrepancies that increase with redshift. We find a 20% to 50% difference between the measured and predicted tSZ angular power spectrum over the multipole range $\ell=10^3-10^4$. Our analysis reveals that these differences are driven by the excess of power in the predicted two-halo term at low k and in the one-halo term at high k. At higher redshifts (z~3), simulations indicate that more power comes from outside the virial radius than from inside suggesting a limitation in the applicability of the halo model. We observe differences in the pressure profiles, despite the fair level of agreement on the tSZ power spectrum at low redshift with the default calibration of the halo model. In conclusion, our study suggests that the properties of the halo model need to be carefully controlled against real or mock data to be proven useful for cosmological purposes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Forecasts Constrained by JWST AGN Observations for Early Massive Black Hole Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive black holes (BHs) grow by gas accretion and mergers, observable through electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) emission. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has detected faint active galactic nuclei (AGNs), revealing an abundant population of accreting BHs with masses of $M_\bullet\sim 10^{6-8}~M_\odot$. This mass range overlaps with the detection scopes of space-based GW interferometers and approaches the upper bounds of the predicted mass of seed BHs. We model BH mass assembly in light of the new JWST findings to investigate their formation channels and predict merger events. Two types of seed BHs are considered: heavy seeds ($M_\bullet\sim 10^{2-5}~M_\odot$) formed in rare and overdense cosmic regions, and light seeds ($M_\bullet\sim 10^{1-3}~M_\odot$) formed as stellar remnants in less massive dark-matter halos. The BHs grow through episodic accretion and merger events, which we model by fitting the AGN luminosity function to observational data including JWST-identified AGNs at $z\sim 5$. We find that heavy seeds alone struggle to explain quasars and faint JWST-selected AGNs simultaneously, requiring the more abundant light seeds. The observed merger rate of BHs from heavy seeds alone is limited to $\lesssim 10^{-1}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ for major mergers at $z\geq5$. However, the presence of light seeds increases the major merger rate by several orders of magnitude, which peaks at a total BH mass of $M_\bullet\simeq 2\times 10^3~M_\odot$ over $5&lt;z&lt;10$ at a rate of $\sim 30~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. These events are detectable by future GW observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Precise sky localization and distance measurement of those GW events, with solid angle and luminosity distance uncertainties $\Delta\Omega\Delta\log D_L\lesssim 10^{-4}~\rm deg^2$, will enable EM identification of mergers at $z\geq5$ and multi-messenger follow-up observations.</description>

Abstract: In tomographic cosmic-shear observations, the BNT (Bernardeau, Nishimichi, Taruya) transform, Bernardeau et al. (2014), allows to build weak lensing transformed maps for which the contribution from low redshift lenses is nulled. As this transformation depends specifically on the expansion rate of the Universe but is independent of the matter distribution properties, it can be leveraged to extract information from large-scale structure probes at arbitrary non-linear scales, providing constraints on cosmological background evolution. We demonstrate this by proposing a specific null test for stage IV weak lensing projects. Using a Fisher matrix analysis and parameter sampling, we show that this approach can substantially enhance constraints on the dark energy equation of state. Notably, we find that shape noise currently limits this method's effectiveness making significant improvement possible in future designs. A detailed analysis of our null test in the context of the Euclid mission is presented in a companion paper Touzeau et al. (2025).</description>

Abstract: We study the fundamentals of quantum field theory on a rigid de Sitter space. We show that the perturbative expansion of late-time correlation functions to all orders can be equivalently generated by a non-unitary Lagrangian on a Euclidean AdS geometry. This finding simplifies dramatically perturbative computations, as well as allows us to establish basic properties of these correlators, which comprise a Euclidean CFT. We use this to infer the analytic structure of the spectral density that captures the conformal partial wave expansion of a late-time four-point function, to derive an OPE expansion, and to constrain the operator spectrum. Generically, dimensions and OPE coefficients do not obey the usual CFT notion of unitarity. Instead, unitarity of the de Sitter theory manifests itself as the positivity of the spectral density. This statement does not rely on the use of Euclidean AdS Lagrangians and holds non-perturbatively. We illustrate and check these properties by explicit calculations in a scalar theory by computing first tree-level, and then full one-loop-resummed exchange diagrams. An exchanged particle appears as a resonant feature in the spectral density which can be potentially useful in experimental searches.</description>

Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy has been developed significantly. In particular, infrared photons can be measured with high spectral and angular resolution in state-of-art spectrographs. They are sensitive to monochromatic photons due to the decay and annihilation of particles beyond the Standard Model, such as dark matter (DM), while insensitive to background photons that form a continuous spectrum. In this paper, we study the indirect detection of the DM decaying into infrared light using infrared spectrographs. In particular, we show that serious thermal and astrophysical noises can be overcome. As concrete examples, the Warm INfrared Echelle spectrograph to Realize Extreme Dispersion and sensitivity (WINERED) installed at the Magellan Clay 6.5m telescope and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) at the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are discussed. We show that a few hours of measurements of a faint dwarf spheroidal galaxy with WINERED (NIRSpec-like spectrograph) in the Magellan telescope (JWST) can probe an axion-like particle DM in the mass range $m_\phi=1.8 - 2.7\,$eV ($0.5-4\,$eV) with a photon coupling $g_{\phi\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim 10^{-11}{\rm GeV}^{-1}$. Complemental approaches, taking advantage of the high resolutions, such as the measurement of the Doppler shift of the signal photon lines and the possible search of the DM decay around the Milky Way galaxy center with Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS) at 8.2m Subaru telescope, are also presented.</description>

      <title>Soft Metric Fluctuations During Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conservation of the long wavelength fluctuations of the metric plays a vital role in cosmology as the link between quantum fluctuations during inflation and late time observations. This is a well-known property of the classical evolution equations, but demonstrating that it is robust to quantum correction involves a number of technical arguments. In this paper, we will use effective field theory (EFT) techniques to demonstrate the all orders conservation of the super-horizon scalar and tensor fluctuations of the metric during inflation. We show how to construct an EFT for these soft modes, in analogy with Soft de Sitter Effective Theory. We pay particular attention to how the breaking of time-diffeomorphisms by the inflationary background introduces new time scales that alter the structure of the EFT. In this description, the all orders conservation of the metric fluctuations is a direct consequence of symmetries and power counting that cannot be altered by loop corrections. We further show that this holds when the inflaton (or metric fluctuations) is coupled to additional heavy fields, as in quasi-single field inflation. We match this behavior to several calculations in the ultraviolet (UV) theory and show how the Mellin representation enables a more transparent connection between the UV and the EFT descriptions.</description>

      <title>Probing the axion-photon coupling with space-based gravitational waves detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple modification of space-based gravitational wave (GW) detector optical benches which would enable the measurement of vacuum birefringence of light induced by axion dark matterthrough its coupling to electromagnetism. Specifically, we propose to change a half-wave plate by a circular polarizer. While marginally affecting the sensitivity to GW by a factor $\sqrt{2}$, we show that such an adjustment would make future detectors such as LISA, TianQin, Taiji and Big-Bang Observer the most sensitive experiments at low axion masses</description>

      <title>A Bound on Light Dark Photon Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a bound on dark photon dark matter scenarios where the dark photon mass is generated through the Higgs mechanism, based on the requirement that symmetry breaking must occur sufficiently early in the universe. We emphasize that dark photon production occurs successfully when the dark Higgs field remains in the symmetric phase due to non-thermal trapping effects. For renormalizable Higgs potentials, our bound reads $$\frac{m_{\gamma'}}{q_H e_H}\;\gg \;60\,{\rm eV}\left(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\right)^{1/4}$$ where $m_{\gamma'}$ is the dark photon mass, $e_H$ is the gauge coupling, $q_H$ is the charge of the dark Higgs boson, and $\lambda$ is the Higgs quartic coupling}. This constraint holds independently of any complications arising from the Schwinger effect and vortex formation in the Higgsed phase. For more general Higgs potentials such as the Coleman-Weinberg type potential, our bound yields different forms. We argue that late-time symmetry breaking of the dark U(1) symmetry satisfying our bound has only a mild impact on both the abundance and momentum distribution of dark photon dark matter, and therefore does not pose any serious problem for the dark photon dark matter scenario.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Rapidly Rotating Stars with Chemically Homogeneous Evolution in the First Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed an unexpectedly high abundance of UV luminous galaxies at redshifts $z\gtrsim 10$, challenging `standard' galaxy formation models. This study investigates the role of rapidly rotating (massive) stars undergoing chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) in reconciling this potential tension. These stars are more compact, hotter, and exhibit enhanced UV emission. We find that the rest-frame UV luminosity of star-forming galaxies can be significantly enhanced by a factor of $\sim 3-6$ when CHE stars above a minimum initial mass of $m_{\star,\min}^{\rm CHE}\sim 2-10\ \rm M_\odot$ account for more than half of the total stellar mass following a Salpeter initial mass function. As a result, the UV luminosity functions observed at $z\sim 12-16$ can be reproduced with less extreme values of star formation efficiency and UV luminosity stochastic variability. Our results highlight the potential of CHE in explaining the UV-bright galaxy populations detected by JWST and call for future work to explore the broader astrophysical implications of CHE and its associated phenomena in the early universe, such as gamma-ray bursts, compact object binaries, and metal enrichment.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Torsion, Extrinsic Torsion, and the Hubble Parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the intrinsic and extrinsic torsions (defined by analogy with the intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures) of the spatial sections of torsional spacetimes. We consider two possibilities. First, that the intrinsic torsion might prove to be directly observable. Second, that it is not observable, having been ``inflated away'' in the early Universe. We argue that, even in this second case, the extrinsic torsion may grow during the inflationary era and be non-negligible at reheating and thereafter. Even if the spatial intrinsic curvature and torsion are too small to be detected directly, then, the extrinsic torsion might not be. We point out that, if its presence is not recognised, the extrinsic torsion could lead to anomalies in the theoretical estimate of the Hubble parameter -- $\,$ a result with obvious potential applications. We stress that extrinsic torsion is by far the most natural way to produce such anomalies, simply because it mixes naturally with the Hubble parameter; that is, the second fundamental form of a spacelike section depends on a sum of two terms, one determined by the Hubble parameter, the other by the extrinsic torsion.</description>

      <title>PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 I: X-ray exploration of a low-mass cluster with exceptionally-distant radio relics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relics are diffuse, highly-polarized radio sources that trace merger-driven shocks at the periphery of merging galaxy clusters. The LOFAR survey recently discovered a rare example of double relics in the low-mass cluster PSZ2 G181.06+48.47. Through a detailed exploration of new Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, we reveal that PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 has a lower mass ($M_{500,X}=2.32^{+0.29}_{-0.25}\times10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$) than previously thought. Despite its cool global temperature of $kT_{500}=3.62^{+0.15}_{-0.07}$ keV, PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 is one of the most disturbed clusters in the Planck sample, with a complex morphological and thermodynamic structure. We discover a set of three discontinuities within &lt;500 kpc of the cluster center, and, from a surface brightness analysis, place $5\sigma$ upper limits of $M_{NE}&lt;1.43$ and $M_{SW}&lt;1.57$ for any shock associated with the relic locations. We also revise established scaling relations for double radio-relics by adding 12 new systems not included in previous work. The PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 relics have the widest separation (scaled for $r_{500}$) of all known double-relic systems. The exceptional distance from the cluster center ($&gt;r_{200}$), indicates the relics may be associated with shocks in the ``run-away" phase. We propose that this late-stage, post-apocenter merger is captured as the two subclusters with a mass ratio of 1.2-1.4 fall back into each other. The outer relic shocks were likely produced at the first core passage, while the inner discontinuities are associated with the second infall.</description>

      <title>Significant increase in sensitive volume of a gravitational wave search upon including higher harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most gravitational wave searches to date have included only the quadrupole mode in their search templates. Here, we demonstrate that incorporating higher harmonics improves the search sensitive volume for detecting binary black hole mergers, challenging the conclusion of previous studies. Using the $\tt{IAS-HM}$ detection pipeline, and the simulated (injection) signals from the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) collaboration, we quantify the improvement in sensitivity due to the inclusion of higher harmonics. This improvement is significant for systems with higher mass ratios and larger total masses, with gains in sensitivity even exceeding $100\%$ at certain high masses. We also show that, due to using a marginalized detection statistic, the $\tt{IAS-HM}$ pipeline performs roughly as well as its quadrupole-mode-only counterpart even for equal mass-ratio mergers, and its sensitive volume is either better than or comparable to that of the individual LVK pipelines.</description>
