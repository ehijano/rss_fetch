      <title>Revealed Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People are influenced by their peers when making decisions. In this paper, we study the linear-in-means model which is the standard empirical model of peer effects. As data on the underlying social network is often difficult to come by, we focus on data that only captures an agent's choices. Under exogenous agent participation variation, we study two questions. We first develop a revealed preference style test for the linear-in-means model. We then study the identification properties of the linear-in-means model. With sufficient participation variation, we show how an analyst is able to recover the underlying network structure and social influence parameters from choice data. Our identification result holds when we allow the social network to vary across contexts. To recover predictive power, we consider a refinement which allows us to extrapolate the underlying network structure across groups and provide a test of this version of the model.</description>

      <title>Paired Course and Dorm Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serial dictatorship is efficient for any given one-sided matching problem, but may not be if there are multiple markets under consideration. One environment where this phenomenon is welfare-relevant is in course and dorm allocation at universities, where serial dictatorship is often used interdependently in each market. This paper introduces and considers paired serial dictatorship, an adaptation of serial dictatorship for problems where two goods are allocated simultaneously. Paired serial dictatorship allows students to first report relative preferences between courses and dorms, which then influence their priority in either market. I find that paired serial dictatorship induces screening along relative preferences and is generally welfare-improving compared to running random serial dictatorship independently for courses and dorms.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Platform-Assisted Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today, many auctions are carried out with the help of intermediary platforms like Google and eBay. We refer to such auctions as platform-assisted auctions.Traditionally, the auction theory literature mainly focuses on designing auctions that incentivize the buyers to bid truthfully,assuming that the platform always faithfully implements the auction. In practice, however, the platforms have been found to manipulate the auctions to earn more profit, resulting in high-profile anti-trust lawsuits. We propose a new model for studying platform-assisted auctions in the permissionless setting. We explore whether it is possible to design a dream auction in thisnew model, such that honest behavior is the utility-maximizing strategy for each individual buyer, the platform, the seller, as well as platform-seller or platform-buyer coalitions.Through a collection of feasibility and infeasibility results,we carefully characterize the mathematical landscape of platform-assisted auctions. We show how cryptography can lend to the design of an efficient platform-assisted auction with dream properties. Although a line of works have also used MPC or the blockchain to remove the reliance on a trusted auctioneer, our work is distinct in nature in several dimensions.First, we initiate a systematic exploration of the game theoretic implications when the service providers are strategic and can collude with sellers or buyers. Second, we observe that the full simulation paradigm is too stringent and leads to high asymptotical costs. Specifically, because every player has a different private outcomein an auction protocol, running any generic MPC protocol among the players would incur at least $n^2$ total cost. We propose a new notion of simulation calledutility-dominated emulation.Under this new notion, we showhow to design efficient auction protocols with quasilinear efficiency.</description>

      <title>Chasing Contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a dynamic research contest, namely chasing contest, in which two asymmetric contestants exert costly effort to accomplish two breakthroughs. The contestants are asymmetric in that one of them is present-biased and has already achieved one breakthrough (the leader), whereas the other is time-consistent and needs to achieve two breakthroughs to win (the chaser). The principal can choose between two disclosure policies: immediately announcing the chaser's first breakthrough (public chasing contest) or announcing only the final result (hidden chasing contest). We characterize the unique x-start and y-stop equilibrium under both disclosure policies, in which the leader starts working from an instant x to the end while the chaser stops exerting effort by the instant y. In addition, the chaser will never stop earlier in the hidden chasing contest, whereas a late deadline extends the leader's effort in the public contest.</description>
