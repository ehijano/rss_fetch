      <title>Game-Theoretic Gradient Control for Robust Neural Network Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) are vulnerable to input noise, reducing prediction performance. Existing regularization methods like dropout often alter network architecture or overlook neuron interactions. This study aims to enhance FFNN noise robustness by modifying backpropagation, interpreted as a multi-agent game, and exploring controlled target variable noising. Our "gradient dropout" selectively nullifies hidden layer neuron gradients with probability 1 - p during backpropagation, while keeping forward passes active. This is framed within compositional game theory. Additionally, target variables were perturbed with white noise or stable distributions. Experiments on ten diverse tabular datasets show varying impacts: improvement or diminishing of robustness and accuracy, depending on dataset and hyperparameters. Notably, on regression tasks, gradient dropout (p = 0.9) combined with stable distribution target noising significantly increased input noise robustness, evidenced by flatter MSE curves and more stable SMAPE values. These results highlight the method's potential, underscore the critical role of adaptive parameter tuning, and open new avenues for analyzing neural networks as complex adaptive systems exhibiting emergent behavior within a game-theoretic framework.</description>

      <title>Concept Probing: Where to Find Human-Defined Concepts (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concept probing has recently gained popularity as a way for humans to peek into what is encoded within artificial neural networks. In concept probing, additional classifiers are trained to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined concepts of interest. However, the performance of these probes is highly dependent on the internal representations they probe from, making identifying the appropriate layer to probe an essential task. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically identify which layer's representations in a neural network model should be considered when probing for a given human-defined concept of interest, based on how informative and regular the representations are with respect to the concept. We validate our findings through an exhaustive empirical analysis over different neural network models and datasets.</description>

      <title>A Neuroscience-Inspired Dual-Process Model of Compositional Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systematic compositional generalization - constructing and understanding novel combinations of known building blocks - remains a core challenge for AI systems. Human cognition achieves this flexibility via the interplay of the hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC): the hippocampus rapidly encodes episodes, and the prefrontal cortex consolidates them into reusable schemas for reasoning. Drawing on these insights, we present MIRAGE (Meta-Inference with Rules and Abstractions from Generalized Experience), a framework that achieves systematic generalization on compositional tasks. MIRAGE has two interacting modules mirroring the brain's deliberative HPC-PFC loop and intuitive neocortical pattern recognition. (1) The meta-trained Transformer Neural Decomposer, paralleling neocortical "System 1" computation, is trained on a task-agnostic stream of randomly sampled compositional grammars and applies one decomposition step per pass, with successive passes iteratively refining the sequence representation. (2) The Schema Engine, analogous to the HPC-PFC "System 2" loop, dynamically extracts, ranks, and applies reusable schemas, storing variable bindings in episodic memory and expanding them when needed. By explicitly equipping the Transformer component of MIRAGE with actively managed schematic structures, our model performs systematic compositional operations through explicit schema application and transformation, relying solely on frozen weights when solving entirely novel tasks. This approach demonstrates systematic compositional generalization on the SCAN benchmark, achieving &gt; 99% accuracy on all task splits with only 1.19M parameters in the transformer module. Ablation studies confirm that MIRAGE's systematicity critically depends on the quality of extracted schemas and the model's iterative refinement process.</description>

      <title>PBiLoss: Popularity-Aware Regularization to Improve Fairness in Graph-Based Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems, especially those based on graph neural networks (GNNs), have achieved remarkable success in capturing user-item interaction patterns. However, they remain susceptible to popularity bias--the tendency to over-recommend popular items--resulting in reduced content diversity and compromised fairness. In this paper, we propose PBiLoss, a novel regularization-based loss function designed to counteract popularity bias in graph-based recommender models explicitly. PBiLoss augments traditional training objectives by penalizing the model's inclination toward popular items, thereby encouraging the recommendation of less popular but potentially more personalized content. We introduce two sampling strategies: Popular Positive (PopPos) and Popular Negative (PopNeg), which respectively modulate the contribution of the positive and negative popular items during training. We further explore two methods to distinguish popular items: one based on a fixed popularity threshold and another without any threshold, making the approach flexible and adaptive. Our proposed method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art graph-based frameworks such as LightGCN and its variants. Comprehensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that PBiLoss significantly improves fairness, as demonstrated by reductions in the Popularity-Rank Correlation for Users (PRU) and Popularity-Rank Correlation for Items (PRI), while maintaining or even enhancing standard recommendation accuracy and ranking metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness of directly embedding fairness objectives into the optimization process, providing a practical and scalable solution for balancing accuracy and equitable content exposure in modern recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Generalization of Spiking Neural Networks Through Temporal Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention due to their event-driven and low-power characteristics, making them particularly effective for processing event-based neuromorphic data. Recent studies have shown that directly trained SNNs suffer from severe overfitting issues due to the limited scale of neuromorphic datasets and the gradient mismatching problem, which fundamentally constrain their generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a temporal regularization training (TRT) method by introducing a time-dependent regularization mechanism to enforce stronger constraints on early timesteps. We compare the performance of TRT with other state-of-the-art methods performance on datasets including CIFAR10/100, ImageNet100, DVS-CIFAR10, and N-Caltech101. To validate the effectiveness of TRT, we conducted ablation studies and analyses including loss landscape visualization and learning curve analysis, demonstrating that TRT can effectively mitigate overfitting and flatten the training loss landscape, thereby enhancing generalizability. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical interpretation of TRT's temporal regularization mechanism based on the results of Fisher information analysis. We analyze the temporal information dynamics inside SNNs by tracking Fisher information during the TRT training process, revealing the Temporal Information Concentration (TIC) phenomenon, where Fisher information progressively concentrates in early timesteps. The time-decaying regularization mechanism implemented in TRT effectively guides the network to learn robust features in early timesteps with rich information, thereby leading to significant improvements in model generalization.

      <title>LeanKAN: A Parameter-Lean Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Layer with Improved Memory Efficiency and Convergence Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) is a promising alternative to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for data-driven modeling. While original KAN layers were only capable of representing the addition operator, the recently-proposed MultKAN layer combines addition and multiplication subnodes in an effort to improve representation performance. Here, we find that MultKAN layers suffer from a few key drawbacks including limited applicability in output layers, bulky parameterizations with extraneous activations, and the inclusion of complex hyperparameters. To address these issues, we propose LeanKANs, a direct and modular replacement for MultKAN and traditional AddKAN layers. LeanKANs address these three drawbacks of MultKAN through general applicability as output layers, significantly reduced parameter counts for a given network structure, and a smaller set of hyperparameters. As a one-to-one layer replacement for standard AddKAN and MultKAN layers, LeanKAN is able to provide these benefits to traditional KAN learning problems as well as augmented KAN structures in which it serves as the backbone, such as KAN Ordinary Differential Equations (KAN-ODEs) or Deep Operator KANs (DeepOKAN). We demonstrate LeanKAN's simplicity and efficiency in a series of demonstrations carried out across a standard KAN toy problem as well as ordinary and partial differential equations learned via KAN-ODEs, where we find that its sparser parameterization and compact structure serve to increase its expressivity and learning capability, leading it to outperform similar and even much larger MultKANs in various tasks.</description>

      <title>Plan for Speed: Dilated Scheduling for Masked Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) promise fast, non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers, which pick tokens to unmask based on model confidence, ignore interactions when unmasking multiple positions in parallel and effectively reduce to slow, autoregressive behavior. We propose the Dilated Unmasking Scheduler (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that partitions sequence positions into non-adjacent dilated groups and unmasked them in parallel so as to minimize an upper bound on joint entropy gain at each denoising step. By explicitly trading off the number of network calls against generation quality, DUS recovers most of the performance lost under traditional parallel unmasking strategies. Across math (GSM8K, MATH500), code (HumanEval, MBPP) and general-knowledge benchmarks (BBH, MMLU-Pro), DUS outperforms confidence-based planners, without modifying the underlying denoiser, and reveals the true speed-quality frontier of MDLMs.</description>
