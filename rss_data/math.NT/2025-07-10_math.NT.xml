      <title>On exotic matrix exponential sums and Bessel-Speh functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the notions of non-abelian exotic Gauss sums and of exotic matrix Kloosterman sums, the latter one generalizing the notions of Katz's exotic Kloosterman sums and of twisted matrix Kloosterman sums. Using Kondo's Gauss sum and results about Shintani lifts, we reduce non-abelian exotic Gauss sums to products of classical (exotic) Gauss sums. Using Macdonald's characteristic maps, we generalize our previous result and show that exotic matrix Kloosterman sums can be expressed as products of modified Hall-Littlewood polynomials evaluated at roots of the characteristic polynomial corresponding to the Frobenius action on Katz's exotic Kloosterman sheaf. Using the Ginzburg-Kaplan gamma factors that we previously defined with Carmon, we establish a relation between special values of Bessel functions attached to Speh representations and exotic matrix Kloosterman sums. Using this relation, we prove various identities.</description>

      <title>Quadratic units and cubic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Eisenstein discriminants, which are squarefree integers $d \equiv 5 \pmod{8}$ such that the fundamental unit $\varepsilon_d$ of the real quadratic field $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ satisfies $\varepsilon_d \equiv 1 \pmod{2\mathcal{O}_K}$. These discriminants are related to a classical question of Eisenstein and have connections to the class groups of orders in quadratic fields as well as to real cubic fields. We present numerical computations of Eisenstein discriminants up to $10^{11}$, suggesting that their counting function up to $x$ is approximated by $\pi_{\mathcal{E}}(x) \approx \frac{1}{3\pi^2}x - 0.024x^{5/6}$. This supports a conjecture of Stevenhagen while revealing a surprising secondary term, which is similar to (but subtly different from) the secondary term in the counting function of real cubic fields.
  We include technical details of our computation method, which uses a modified infrastructure approach implemented on GPUs.</description>

      <title>Approximation by uniformly distributed sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider approximation properties of real points by uniformly distributed sequences. Under some assumptions on the approximation functions, we prove a Khintchine-type $0$-$1$ dichotomy law. We establish a new connection between uniform distribution and the ubiquity property. Namely, we show that a bound on the discrepancy of the sequence implies the ubiquity property, which helps to obtain divergence results. We further obtain Hausdorff dimension results for weighted sets. The key tools in proving these results are the weighted ubiquitous systems and weighted mass transference principle introduced recently by Kleinbock \&amp; Wang, and Wang \&amp; Wu respectively.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous nonvanishing of Dirichlet $L$-functions in Galois orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, we prove that given any two distinct imprimitive Dirichlet characters $\eta_1, \eta_2$ modulo $q=p^k$, a positive proportion of characters $\chi$ modulo $q$ in a fixed Galois orbit of primitive characters satisfies the nonvanishing property that $L(1/2,\chi \eta_1) L(1/2,\chi \eta_2) \neq 0$, as $k \to \infty$ (with $p$ fixed). Previously, only a positive proportion of nonvanishing result was available in Galois orbits (as opposed to simultaneously nonvanishing), due to work of Khan, Mili\'cevi\'c and Ngo. The main ingredients are obtaining a sharp upper bound on the mollified fourth moment over the Galois orbit using an Euler product mollifier, and obtaining a lower bound for the mollified second moment, which relies on using results from Diophantine approximation (such as the $p$-adic Roth theorem). We also unconditionally compute the second moments for $L$--functions associated to primitive Dirichlet characters in full orbits and thinner orbits.</description>

      <title>The $3$-sparsity of $X^n-1$ over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $q$ be a prime power and $\mathbb{F}_q$ the finite field with $q$ elements. For a positive integer $n$, the binomial $f_n(X):= X^n-1\in\mathbb{F}_q[X]$ is called $3$-sparse over $\mathbb{F}_q$ if each irreducible factor of $f_n(X)$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ is either a binomial or a trinomial. In 2021, Oliveira and Reis characterized all positive integers $n$ for which $f_n(X)$ is $3$-sparse over $\mathbb{F}_q$ when $q = 2$ and $q = 4$, and posed the open problem of whether, for any given $q$, there are only finitely many primes $p$ such that $f_p(X)$ is $3$-sparse over $\mathbb{F}_q$. In this paper, we prove that for any given odd prime power $q$, any prime $p$ for which $f_p(X)$ is $3$-sparse over $\mathbb{F}_q$ must divides $q^2-1$, thus resolving the problem of Oliveira and Reis for odd characteristic. Furthermore, we extend the results of Oliveira and Reis by determining all such integers $n$ for $q = 3$ and $q = 9$. More precisely, for any positive integer $n$ not divisible by $3$, we establish that: (i) $f_n(X)$ is $3$-sparse over $\mathbb{F}_3$ if and only if $n = 2^k$ for some nonnegative integer $k$; and (ii) $f_n(X)$ is $3$-sparse over $\mathbb{F}_9$ if and only if $n = 2^{k_1}5^{k_2}$ for some nonnegative integers $k_1$ and $k_2$.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach to Calculating Sylvester Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the Frobenius coin problem, given two relatively prime positive integers $a$ and $b$, the set of nonrepresentable numbers consists of positive integers that cannot be expressed as nonnegative integer combination of $a$ and $b$. This work provides a formula for calculating the power sums of all nonrepresentable numbers, also known as the Sylvester sums. Although alternative formulas exist in the literature, our approach is based on an elementary observation. We consider the set of natural numbers from $1$ to $ab - 1$ and compute their total sum in two distinct ways, which leads naturally to the desired Sylvester sums. This method connects an analytic identity with a combinatorial viewpoint, giving a new way to understand these classical quantities. Furthermore, in this paper, we establish a criterion using the division algorithm to determine whether a given positive integer is nonrepresentable.</description>

      <title>Counting isomorphism classes of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the precise number of isomorphism classes of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ with $\text{char}(\mathbb{F}_q) = 3,2$. The key idea is to obtain the exact unweighted number of rational points on the classifying stacks $\mathcal{B} Q_{12}$, $\mathcal{B} Q_{24}$ and $\mathcal{B} Z$, where $Q_{12}$ and $Q_{24}$ denote the dicyclic groups of orders 12 and 24, respectively, and $Z$ denotes the non-reduced group scheme of order 2. This computation, inspired by the classical work of [de Jong] and performed via motivic height zeta functions of height moduli spaces constructed in [Bejleri-Park-Satriano], establishes a complete determination of the total number of isomorphism classes of rational points on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1,1}$ over any rational function field $k(t)$ with perfect residue field $\text{char}(k) \ge 0$.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Walsh Spectrum of Power Residue S-Boxes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a prime field with $q \geq 3$, and let $d, m \geq 1$ be integers such that $\gcd \left( d, q \right) = 1$ and $m \mid (q - 1)$. In this paper we bound the absolute values of the Walsh spectrum of S-Boxes $S (x) = x^d \cdot T \left( x^\frac{q - 1}{m} \right)$, where $T$ is a function with $T (x) \neq 0$ if $x \neq 0$. Such S-Boxes have been proposed for the Zero-Knowledge-friendly hash functions Grendel and Polocolo. In particular, we prove the conjectured correlation of the Polocolo S-Box.</description>

      <title>Pair Correlation Conjecture for the zeros of the Riemann zeta-function II: The Alternative Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an earlier paper, we proved that Montgomery's Pair Correlation Conjecture (PCC) for zeros of the Riemann zeta-function can be used to prove without the assumption of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) that asymptotically 100% of the zeros are both simple and on the critical line. This is based on a method of Gallagher and Mueller from 1978. We formulate an appropriate form of the Alternative Hypothesis (AH), which determines a different PCC, and, using the same method as above, prove that asymptotically, 100% of the zeros are both simple and on the critical line. As in our previous paper, we do not assume RH.</description>

      <title>Kummers, spinors, and heights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f(x) = x^{2g+1} + c_1 x^{2g} + \dots + c_{2g+1} \in k[x]$ be a polynomial of nonzero discriminant, and let $J$ denote the Jacobian of the odd hyperelliptic curve $C : y^2 = f(x)$. We show that the morphism $J \to \mathbb{P}^{2^g-1}$ associated to the linear system $|2 \Theta|$ may be described explicitly, for any $g \geq 1$, using the theory of pure spinors.
  We apply this theory to study the heights of rational points in $J(k)$, when $k$ is a number field. As a particular consequence, we show that $100\%$ of monic, degree $2g+1$ polynomials $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ of nonzero discriminant $\Delta(f)$ have the property that, for any non-trivial point $P \in J(\mathbb{Q})$, the canonical height of $P$ satisfies $ \widehat{h}_\Theta(P) \geq \left(\frac{3g-1}{4g(2g+1)} - \epsilon\right) \log | \Delta(f) |$. This is a `density 1' form of the Lang--Silverman conjecture.</description>

      <title>Effective open image theorem and a Linnik type problem for elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an effective open image theorem for families of elliptic curves and products of elliptic curves ordered by conductor. Unconditionally, we prove that for $100\%$ of pairs of elliptic curves, the largest prime $\ell$, for which the associated mod $\ell$ Galois representation fails to be surjective, is small. Additionally, for semistable families, our bound on $\ell$ is comparable to the result obtained under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. We reduce the problem to a Linnik type problem for modular forms and apply the zero density estimates. This method, together with an analysis of the local Galois representations of elliptic curves, allows us to show similar results for single elliptic curves.</description>

      <title>On the cubic Shimura lift to $PGL(3)$: Hecke correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish a new Fundamental Lemma for Hecke correspondences. Let $F$ be a local field containing the cube roots of unity. We exhibit an algebra isomorphism of the spherical Hecke algebra of $PGL_3(F)$ and the spherical Hecke algebra of anti-genuine functions on the cubic cover $G'$ of $SL_3(F)$. Then we show that there is a matching (up to a specific transfer factor) of distributions on the two groups for all functions that correspond under this isomorphism. On $PGL_3(F)$ the distributions are relative distributions attached to a period involving the minimal representation on $SO_8$, while on $G'$ they are metaplectic Kuznetsov distributions. This Fundamental Lemma is a key step towards establishing a relative trace formula that would give a new global Shimura lift from genuine automorphic representations on the triple cover of $SL_3$ to automorphic representations on $PGL_3$, and also characterize the image of the lift by means of a period. It extends the matching for the unit elements of the Hecke algebras established by the authors in prior work.</description>

      <title>Integer Factorization: Another perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integer factorization is a fundamental problem in algorithmic number theory and computer science. It is considered as a one way or trapdoor function in the (RSA) cryptosystem. To date, from elementary trial division to sophisticated methods like the General Number Field Sieve, no known algorithm can break the problem in polynomial time, while its proved that Shor's algorithm could on a quantum computer. In this paper, we recall some factorization algorithms and then approach the problem under different angles. Firstly, we take the problem from the ring $\displaystyle\left(\mathbb{Z}, \text{+}, \cdot\right)$ to the Lebesgue space $\mathcal{L}^{1}\left(X\right)$ where $X$ can be $\mathbb{Q}$ or any given interval setting. From this first perspective, integer factorization becomes equivalent to finding the perimeter of a rectangle whose area is known. In this case, it is equivalent to either finding bounds of integrals or finding primitives for some given bounds. Secondly, we take the problem from the ring $\displaystyle\left(\mathbb{Z}, \text{+}, \cdot\right) $ to the ring of matrices $\left( M_{2}\text{(}\mathbb{Z}\text{)}, \ \text{+} \ \cdot\right)$ and show that this problem is equivalent to matrix decomposition, and therefore present some possible computing algorithms, particularly using Gr\"obner basis and through matrix diagonalization. Finally, we address the problem depending on algebraic forms of factors and show that this problem is equivalent to finding small roots of a bivariate polynomial through coppersmith's method.
  The aim of this study is to propose innovative methodological approaches to reformulate this problem, thereby offering new perspectives.</description>

      <title>Numbers with three close factorizations and central lattice points on hyperbolas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue the study of three close factorizations of an integer and correct a mistake of a previous result. This turns out to be related to lattice points close to the center point $(\sqrt{N}, \sqrt{N})$ of the hyperbola $x y = N$. We establish optimal lower bounds for $L^1$-distance between these lattice points and the center. We also give some good examples based on polynomials and Pell equations more systematically.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we relate the MacDonald index of a 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT with the Hilbert series of the arc space of the Zhu algebra of the corresponding Schur VOA. Using this, we conjecture a simple formula for the MacDonald index of $(A_1,D_{2n+1})$ Argyres-Douglas theory. We perform checks of the formula against the known Schur limits and RG flows.

      <title>On orbit sets generated by semigroups of one-dimensional affine functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The one-dimensional orbit set $\langle F : s \rangle$ is formed by the images of a number $s$ under the action of a semigroup generated by the integer affine functions $f_i=a_i x+b_i$ taken from the set $F=\{f_1,\ldots,f_n\}$. P.Erd\"os established an upper bound $O(x^{\sigma+\epsilon})$ for the growth function $|\langle F : s \rangle\cap[0,x]|$, where $1/a_1^{\sigma}+1/a_2^{\sigma}+\ldots + 1/a_n^{\sigma}=1$ and $\varepsilon&gt;0$, which was extended to orbit multisets and real affine functions by J$.$Lagarias. We complement this by a lower bound $\Omega(x^{\sigma})$ for the multiset size $|\langle F : s \rangle^\#\cap[0,x]|$.
  P.Erd\"os and R$.$Graham asked whether an orbit set $\langle F : s \rangle$ has positive density when $F$ is a basis of a free semigroup and $1/a_1+1/a_2+\ldots + 1/a_n=1$. Under these two conditions we establish a sublinear lower bound $|\langle F : s \rangle \cap [0,x]|=\Omega(x/\log^{\frac{n-1}2} x)$. We also show that if $F$ gives a partition of integers, i.e. when $f_1(\mathbb Z) \sqcup \ldots \sqcup f_n(\mathbb Z)=\mathbb Z$, this bound can be strengthened to $\Omega(x)$, so the set $\langle F : s \rangle$ has positive density.</description>

      <title>Cluster algebraic interpretation of generalized Markov numbers and their matrixizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov numbers, i.e. positive integers appearing in solutions to $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz$, can be viewed as specializations of cluster variables. The second author and Matsushita gave a generalization of the Markov equation, $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k_1yz + k_2xz + k_3xy = (3+k_1+k_2+k_3)xyz$, whose solutions can be viewed as specializations of cluster variables in generalized cluster algebras. We give two families of matrices in $SL(2,\mathbb{Z}[x_1^\pm,x_2^\pm,x_3^\pm])$ associated to these cluster structures. These matrix formulas relate to previous matrices appearing in the context of Markov numbers, including Cohn matrices and generalized Cohn matrices given by the second author, Maruyama, and Sato, as well as matrices appearing in the context of cluster algebras, including matrix formulas given by Kanatarc{\i} O\u{g}uz and Y{\i}ld{\i}r{\i}m. We provide a classification of the two families of matrices and exhibit an explicit family of each. The latter is done by realizing cluster variables in generalized Markov cluster algebras as weight-generating functions of order ideals in certain fence posets which are related to Christoffel words. An interesting observation is that these functions resemble Caldero-Chapoton functions for string modules, and a byproduct of our proofs is a new skein-like formula for such functions.</description>

Abstract: Vl{\u a}du{\c t} characterized in 1999 the set of finite fields $k$ such that all elliptic curves defined over $k$ have a cyclic group of rational points.

      <title>On Shilov boundaries, Rees valuations and integral extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore an analogy between, on one hand, the notions of integral closure of ideals and Rees valuations in commutative algebra and, on the other hand, the notions of spectral seminorm and Shilov boundary in nonarchimedean geometry. For any Tate ring $\mathcal{A}$ with a Noetherian ring of definition $\mathcal{A}_{0}$ and pseudo-uniformizer $\varpi\in\mathcal{A}_{0}$, we prove that the Shilov boundary for $\mathcal{A}$ naturally coincides with the set of Rees valuation rings of the principal ideal $(\varpi)_{\mathcal{A}_{0}}$ of $\mathcal{A}_{0}$.
  Furthermore, we characterize the Shilov boundary for a wide class of Tate rings by means of minimal open prime ideals in the subring of power-bounded elements. For affinoid algebras, in the sense of Tate, whose underlying rings are integral domains, this recovers a well-known result of Berkovich. Moreover, under some mild assumptions, we prove stability of our characterization of the Shilov boundary under (completed) integral extensions. In particular, for every mixed-characteristic Noetherian domain $R$, we obtain a description of the Shilov boundary for the Tate ring $\widehat{R^{+}}[p^{-1}]$, where $\widehat{R^{+}}$ is the $p$-adic completion of the absolute integral closure of the domain $R$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A/K$ be an absolutely simple abelian surface defined over a number field $K$. We give unconditional upper bounds for the number of prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}$ of $K$ with norm up to $x$ such that $A$ has supersingular reduction at $\mathfrak{p}$. These bounds are obtained in three distinct settings, depending on the endomorphism algebra of $A$, namely, the case of trivial endomorphisms, real multiplication (RM), and quaternion multiplication (QM). In the RM case and when $K=\mathbb{Q}$, our results further implies an unconditional upper bound on the distribution of Frobenius traces of $A$. Furthermore, in the RM setting, we study the distribution of the middle coefficients of Frobenius polynomials of $A$ at primes where the reduction of $A$ splits.</description>

Abstract: For a prime $\mathfrak{p} \subseteq \mathbb{F}_{q}[T]$ and a positive integer $r$, we consider the generalised Jacobian $J_{0}(\mathfrak{n})_{\mathbf{m}}$ of the Drinfeld modular curve $X_{0}(\mathfrak{n})$ of level $\mathfrak{n}=\mathfrak{p}^r$, with respect to the modulus~$\mathbf{m}$ consisting of all cusps on the modular curve. We show that the $\ell$-primary part of the group $J_{0}(\mathfrak{n})_{\mathbf{m}}(\mathbb{F}_{q}(T))_{\rm{tor}}[\ell^{\infty}]$ is trivial for all primes $\ell$ not dividing $q(q^{2}-1)$. Our results establish a function field analogue to those of Yamazaki--Yang for the classical case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Viewing Eratosthenes sieve as a discrete dynamic system, we show that every admissible instance of every admissible constellation of gaps arises and persists in Eratosthenes sieve. For an admissible constellation of length J, we show that its population across stages of the sieve is consistent with the Hardy and Littlewood estimates from 1923. This work strongly connects Eratosthenes sieve to the k-tuple conjecture, and it provides a compact notation, primorial coordinates, for tracking the locations of admissible instances for a constellation.</description>

      <title>Pair Correlation Conjecture for the Zeros of the Riemann Zeta-function I: Simple and Critical Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Montgomery in 1973 introduced the Pair Correlation Conjecture (PCC) for zeros of the Riemann zeta-function. He also conjectured that asymptotically 100% of the zeros are simple. His reasoning to support these two conjectures used the Riemann Hypothesis (RH). Building on Montgomery's approach, Gallagher and Mueller proved in 1978 that PCC under RH implies that 100% of the zeros are simple. Actually, the method of Gallagher and Mueller does not depend on RH, and thus Montgomery's second simplicity conjecture follows unconditionally from his PCC conjecture. We clarify this result by explicitly not assuming RH and considering PCC as a conjecture only concerning the vertical distribution of zeros. We then show that, for the first time, PCC can also be used to obtain information on the horizontal distribution of zeros. Using Gallagher and Mueller's method and a new idea concerning symmetric diagonal zeros, we use PCC to prove that asymptotically 100% of the zeros are not only simple but also on the critical line.</description>

      <title>Casimir Energy and Modularity in Higher-dimensional Conformal Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14866v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important problem in Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is to understand the structures of observables on spacetime manifolds of nontrivial topology. Such observables arise naturally when studying physical systems at finite temperature and/or finite volume and encode subtle properties of the underlying microscopic theory that are often obscure on the flat spacetime. Locality of the QFT implies that these observables can be constructed from more basic building blocks by cutting-and-gluing along a spatial slice, where a crucial ingredient is the Hilbert space on the spatial manifold. In Conformal Field Theory (CFT), thanks to the operator-state correspondence, we have a non-perturbative understanding of the Hilbert space on a spatial sphere. However it remains a challenge to consider more general spatial manifolds. Here we study CFTs in spacetime dimensions $d&gt;2$ on the spatial manifold $T^2\times \mathbb{R}^{d-3}$ which is one of the simplest manifolds beyond the spherical topology. We focus on the ground state in this Hilbert space and analyze universal properties of the ground state energy, also commonly known as the Casimir energy, which is a nontrivial function of the complex structure moduli $\tau$ of the torus. The Casimir energy is subject to constraints from modular invariance on the torus which we spell out using $PSL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ spectral theory. Moreover we derive a simple universal formula for the Casimir energy in the thin torus limit using the effective field theory (EFT) from Kaluza-Klein reduction of the CFT, with exponentially small corrections from worldline instantons. We illustrate our formula with explicit examples from well-known CFTs including the critical $O(N)$ model in $d=3$ and holographic CFTs in $d\geq 3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the action of the infinite Frobenius on the de Rham fundamental groups of affine curves defined over $\bfR$. As an application, we compute extension classes of real mixed Hodge structures associated with the motivic fundamental groups of affine curves. In the case of modular curves, we relate our computation to special values of Rankin-Selberg L-functions, and show that the associated extensions of mixed Hodge structures are non-split. We compute local zeta integrals both at good primes and, in certain cases, at bad primes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected semisimple simply connected Lie group with a compact Cartan subgroup and let $\Gamma$ be a uniform lattice in $G$. Let $\widehat{G}_d$ denote the set of equivalence classes of unitary discrete series representations of $G$. We prove that for any finite subset of $\widehat{G}_d$ satisfying a certain condition, the associated finite set of discrete series multiplicities in $L^2(\Gamma \backslash G)$ determines all discrete series multiplicities in $L^2(\Gamma \backslash G)$. This allows us to obtain a refinement of the strong multiplicity one result for discrete series representations. As an application, we deduce that for two given levels, the equality of the dimensions of the spaces of cusp forms over a suitable finite set of weights implies the equality of the dimensions of the spaces of cusp forms for all weights.</description>
