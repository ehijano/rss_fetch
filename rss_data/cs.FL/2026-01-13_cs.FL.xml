      <title>Neuro-Symbolic Compliance: Integrating LLMs and SMT Solvers for Automated Financial Legal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial regulations are increasingly complex, hindering automated compliance-especially the maintenance of logical consistency with minimal human oversight. We introduce a Neuro-Symbolic Compliance Framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers to enable formal verifiability and optimization-based compliance correction. The LLM interprets statutes and enforcement cases to generate SMT constraints, while the solver enforces consistency and computes the minimal factual modification required to restore legality when penalties arise. Unlike transparency-oriented methods, our approach emphasizes logic-driven optimization, delivering verifiable, legally consistent reasoning rather than post-hoc explanation. Evaluated on 87 enforcement cases from Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), the system attains 86.2% correctness in SMT code generation, improves reasoning efficiency by over 100x, and consistently corrects violations-establishing a preliminary foundation for optimization-based compliance applications.</description>

      <title>Normal Forms for Elements of ${}^*$-Continuous Kleene Algebras Representing the Context-Free Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17295v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the tensor product $K \mathop{\otimes_{\cal R}} C_2'$ of any ${}^*$-continuous Kleene algebra $K$ with the polycyclic ${}^*$-continuous Kleene algebra $C_2'$ over two bracket pairs there is a copy of the fixed-point closure of $K$: the centralizer of $C_2'$ in $K \mathop{\otimes_{\cal R}} C_2'$. Using an automata-theoretic representation of elements of $K\mathop{\otimes_{\cal R}} C_2'$ \`a la Kleene, with the aid of normal form theorems that restrict the occurrences of brackets on paths through the automata, we develop a foundation for a calculus of context-free expressions without variable binders. We also give some results on the bra-ket ${}^*$-continuous Kleene algebra $C_2$, motivate the ``completeness equation'' that distinguishes $C_2$ from $C_2'$, and show that $C_2'$ already validates a relativized form of this equation.</description>

      <title>Pumping-Like Results for Copyless Cost Register Automata and Polynomially Ambiguous Weighted Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider two rich subclasses of weighted automata over fields: polynomially ambiguous weighted automata and copyless cost register automata. Primarily we are interested in understanding their expressiveness power. Over the field of rationals and $1$-letter alphabets, it is known that the two classes coincide; they are equivalent to linear recurrence sequences (LRS) whose exponential bases are roots of rationals. We develop a tool we call Pumping Sequence Families, which, by exploiting the simple single-letter behaviour of the models, yields two pumping-like results over arbitrary fields with unrestricted alphabets, one for each class. As a corollary of these results, we present examples proving that the two classes become incomparable over the field of rationals with unrestricted alphabets. We complement the results by analysing the zeroness and equivalence problems. For weighted automata (even unrestricted) these problems are well understood: there are polynomial time, and even NC$^2$ algorithms. For copyless cost register automata we show that the two problems are \textsc{PSpace}-complete, where the difficulty is to show the lower bound.</description>

      <title>Deciding Serializability in Network Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the SER modeling language for automatically verifying serializability of concurrent programs, i.e., whether every concurrent execution of the program is equivalent to some serial execution. SER programs are suitably restricted to make this problem decidable, while still allowing for an unbounded number of concurrent threads of execution, each potentially running for an unbounded number of steps. Building on prior theoretical results, we give the first automated end-to-end decision procedure that either proves serializability by producing a checkable certificate, or refutes it by producing a counterexample trace. We also present a network-system abstraction to which SER programs compile. Our decision procedure then reduces serializability in this setting to a Petri net reachability query. Furthermore, in order to scale, we curtail the search space via multiple optimizations, including Petri net slicing, semilinear-set compression, and Presburger-formula manipulation. We extensively evaluate our framework and show that, despite the theoretical hardness of the problem, it can successfully handle various models of real-world programs, including stateful firewalls, BGP routers, and more.</description>
