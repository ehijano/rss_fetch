      <title>Whose Personae? Synthetic Persona Experiments in LLM Research and Pathways to Transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic personae experiments have become a prominent method in Large Language Model alignment research, yet the representativeness and ecological validity of these personae vary considerably between studies. Through a review of 63 peer-reviewed studies published between 2023 and 2025 in leading NLP and AI venues, we reveal a critical gap: task and population of interest are often underspecified in persona-based experiments, despite personalization being fundamentally dependent on these criteria. Our analysis shows substantial differences in user representation, with most studies focusing on limited sociodemographic attributes and only 35% discussing the representativeness of their LLM personae. Based on our findings, we introduce a persona transparency checklist that emphasizes representative sampling, explicit grounding in empirical data, and enhanced ecological validity. Our work provides both a comprehensive assessment of current practices and practical guidelines to improve the rigor and ecological validity of persona-based evaluations in language model alignment research.</description>

      <title>On the Regulatory Potential of User Interfaces for AI Agent Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents that take actions in their environment autonomously over extended time horizons require robust governance interventions to curb their potentially consequential risks. Prior proposals for governing AI agents primarily target system-level safeguards (e.g., prompt injection monitors) or agent infrastructure (e.g., agent IDs). In this work, we explore a complementary approach: regulating user interfaces of AI agents as a way of enforcing transparency and behavioral requirements that then demand changes at the system and/or infrastructure levels. Specifically, we analyze 22 existing agentic systems to identify UI elements that play key roles in human-agent interaction and communication. We then synthesize those elements into six high-level interaction design patterns that hold regulatory potential (e.g., requiring agent memory to be editable). We conclude with policy recommendations based on our analysis. Our work exposes a new surface for regulatory action that supplements previous proposals for practical AI agent governance.</description>

      <title>Evaluating AI Companies' Frontier Safety Frameworks: Methodology and Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the Seoul AI Safety Summit in 2024, twelve AI companies published frontier safety frameworks outlining their approaches to managing catastrophic risks from advanced AI systems. These frameworks now serve as a key mechanism for AI risk governance, utilized by regulations and governance instruments such as the EU AI Act's Code of Practice and California's Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act. Given their centrality to AI risk management, assessments of such frameworks are warranted. Existing assessments evaluate them at a high level of abstraction and lack granularity on specific practices for companies to adopt. We address this gap by developing a 65-criteria assessment methodology grounded in established risk management principles from safety-critical industries. We evaluate the twelve frameworks across four dimensions: risk identification, risk analysis and evaluation, risk treatment, and risk governance. Companies' current scores are low, ranging from 8% to 35%. By adopting existing best practices already in use across the frameworks, companies could reach 52%. The most critical gaps are nearly universal: companies generally fail to (a) define quantitative risk tolerances, (b) specify capability thresholds for pausing development, and (c) systematically identify unknown risks. To guide improvement, we provide specific recommendations for each company and each criterion.</description>

      <title>First, do NOHARM: towards clinically safe large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are routinely used by physicians and patients for medical advice, yet their clinical safety profiles remain poorly characterized. We present NOHARM (Numerous Options Harm Assessment for Risk in Medicine), a benchmark using 100 real primary-care-to-specialist consultation cases to measure harm frequency and severity from LLM-generated medical recommendations. NOHARM covers 10 specialties, with 12,747 expert annotations for 4,249 clinical management options. Across 31 LLMs, severe harm occurs in up to 22.2% (95% CI 21.6-22.8%) of cases, with harms of omission accounting for 76.6% (95% CI 76.4-76.8%) of errors. Safety performance is only moderately correlated (r = 0.61-0.64) with existing AI and medical knowledge benchmarks. The best models outperform generalist physicians on safety (mean difference 9.7%, 95% CI 7.0-12.5%), and a diverse multi-agent approach reduces harm compared to solo models (mean difference 8.0%, 95% CI 4.0-12.1%). Therefore, despite strong performance on existing evaluations, widely used AI models can produce severely harmful medical advice at nontrivial rates, underscoring clinical safety as a distinct performance dimension necessitating explicit measurement.</description>

      <title>The dual footprint of artificial intelligence: environmental and social impacts across the globe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces the concept of the 'dual footprint' as a heuristic device to capture the commonalities and interdependencies between the different impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) on the natural and social surroundings that supply resources for its production and use. Two in-depth case studies, each illustrating international flows of raw materials and of data work services, portray the AI industry as a value chain that spans national boundaries and perpetuates inherited global inequalities. The countries that drive AI development generate a massive demand for inputs and trigger social costs that, through the value chain, largely fall on more peripheral actors. The arrangements in place distribute the costs and benefits of AI unequally, resulting in unsustainable practices and preventing the upward mobility of more disadvantaged countries. The dual footprint grasps how the environmental and social dimensions of the dual footprint emanate from similar underlying socioeconomic processes and geographical trajectories.</description>

      <title>Forced Migration and Information-Seeking Behavior on Wikipedia: Insights from the Ukrainian Refugee Crisis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gathering information about where to migrate is an important part of the migration process, especially during forced migration, when people must make rapid decisions under uncertainty. This study examines how forced migration relates to online information-seeking on Wikipedia. Focusing on the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, we analyze how the resulting refugee crisis, which led to over six million Ukrainians fleeing across Europe, shaped views of Wikipedia articles about European cities. We compare changes in views of Ukrainian-language Wikipedia articles, used as a proxy for information-seeking by Ukrainians, with those in four other language editions. Our findings show that views of Ukrainian-language articles about European cities correlate more strongly with the number of Ukrainian refugees applying for temporary protection in European countries than views in other languages. Because Poland and Germany became the main destinations for refugees, we examine these countries more closely and find that applications for temporary protection in Polish and German cities are also more strongly correlated with views of their Ukrainian-language Wikipedia articles. We further analyze the timing between refugee flows to Poland and online information-seeking. Refugee border crossings occurred before increases in Ukrainian-language views of Polish city articles, indicating that information-seeking surged after displacement. This reactive pattern contrasts with the pre-departure planning typical of regular labor migration. Moreover, while official protection applications often lagged behind border crossings by weeks, Wikipedia activity rose almost immediately. Overall, Wikipedia usage offers a near real-time indicator of emerging migration patterns during crises.</description>

      <title>Free Tuition, Stratified Pipelines: Four Decades of Administrative Cohorts and Equity in Access to Engineering and Science in an Argentine Public University</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latin American higher education is often portrayed as equitable when tuition is free and access to public universities is formally unrestricted. Yet, growing research shows that massification under tuition-free policies often coexists with strong social and territorial stratification. This article uses four decades of administrative records from a faculty of engineering in north-western Argentina to examine how cohort composition has changed over time.
  Drawing on 24,133 first-time entrants (1980-2019), we construct a leakage-aware "background census" layer (N1c) harmonising school type, province, and age across legacy systems. We combine descriptive analyses, UMAP+DBSCAN clustering, and a reconstructed macroeconomic panel (inflation, unemployment, poverty, GDP) anchored at entry. All analyses explicitly report structural missingness patterns. Results show that missingness in background variables is historically patterned, declining sharply after the 1990s. Among students with observed data, the share coming from private-especially religious-secondary schools in high-income areas increased from less than half in the 1980s to roughly two-thirds in the 2010s. The catchment area became more local, with the home province gaining weight while distant origins lost ground. Median age at entry remained stable at 19, with persistent right tails of older entrants. Macro-linkage analyses reveal moderate associations between unemployment and older entry age, and between inflation and higher shares of students from interior provinces. We argue that free tuition and open entry have operated within, rather than against, stratified school and residential pipelines. The article illustrates how administrative data can support equity monitoring and discusses implications for upstream school policies and institutional accountability in tuition-free systems.</description>

      <title>Closing the Block-to-Text Gap: A Domain-Specific JavaScript Editor for Early Computational Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a web-based JavaScript editor designed to help children aged 8-10 transition from block-based to text-based programming. The system introduces a simplified domain-specific language (DSL) focused on visual art, combining authentic JavaScript syntax with immediate, creative visual feedback. A four-week pilot study (N = 15) demonstrated significant improvements in computational thinking skills (mean CTCI gain of +10.9, p &lt; 0.001), along with a 70% reduction in syntax errors. Participants advanced from basic drawing functions to sophisticated algorithmic designs using loops, conditionals, and animations. By integrating constructionist principles with a visual-first DSL, this research contributes a validated pedagogical framework for easing the block-to-text transition in K-12 computer science education. The system encourages creativity, self-correction, and sustained engagement, offering educators a practical, scalable tool for introducing authentic coding to young learners.</description>

      <title>Cyber-human social co-operating system: Application design and implementation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing wealth inequality and resource waste is a global challenge. A fundamental problem within the capitalist economy, put simply, lies in the enslavement of labor and the colonization of resources. To address these issues, movements promoting digital democracy and cooperative platforms have emerged as viable alternatives to traditional capitalist systems. From the perspective of integrating information systems with real-world social, environmental, and economic systems, Cyber-Physical Systems have been proposed for applications in Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0. One such CPS is the Social Co-OS (cyber-human social co-operating system). Social Co-OS is a co-operating system between cyber and human societies that conceptualizes the social system as a dynamic, circular structure composed of three layers: individual behavior, interindividual interaction, and institutional formation. Within this framework, the cyber system supports collective decision-making and individual cooperative behavior across these layers. The objective of this study is to define a novel application architecture based on the Social Co-OS concept, design a user interface flow, and implement it in practice. Specifically, we develop a social impact evaluator, a pluralistic policy simulator, and a consensus-building facilitator, which constitute the deliberative and political loop of Social Co-OS. Additionally, we implement a personality estimator and a behavior change promoter, which constitute the operational and administrative loop, along with a common mediator that serves as the cyber-human interface. Through these implementations, we demonstrate that Social Co-OS applications can effectively support human social systems and offer practical utility for policy co-making and co-operation, as evidenced by examples grounded in real-world challenges.</description>

      <title>Closing the Gap: Data-Centric Fine-Tuning of Vision Language Models for the Standardized Exam Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal reasoning has become a cornerstone of modern AI research. Standardized exam questions offer a uniquely rigorous testbed for such reasoning, providing structured visual contexts and verifiable answers. While recent progress has largely focused on algorithmic advances such as reinforcement learning (e.g., GRPO, DPO), the data centric foundations of vision language reasoning remain less explored.
  We show that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality data can rival proprietary approaches. To this end, we compile a 161.4 million token multimodal dataset combining textbook question-solution pairs, curriculum aligned diagrams, and contextual materials, and fine-tune Qwen-2.5VL-32B using an optimized reasoning syntax (QMSA). The resulting model achieves 78.6% accuracy, only 1.0% below Gemini 2.0 Flash, on our newly released benchmark YKSUniform, which standardizes 1,854 multimodal exam questions across 309 curriculum topics.
  Our results reveal that data composition and representational syntax play a decisive role in multimodal reasoning. This work establishes a data centric framework for advancing open weight vision language models, demonstrating that carefully curated and curriculum-grounded multimodal data can elevate supervised fine-tuning to near state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Tracing Mathematical Proficiency Through Problem-Solving Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to model student's knowledge state and predict future performance to enable personalized learning in Intelligent Tutoring Systems. However, traditional KT methods face fundamental limitations in explainability, as they rely solely on the response correctness, neglecting the rich information embedded in students' problem-solving processes. To address this gap, we propose Knowledge Tracing Leveraging Problem-Solving Process (KT-PSP), which incorporates students' problem-solving processes to capture the multidimensional aspects of mathematical proficiency. We also introduce KT-PSP-25, a new dataset specifically designed for the KT-PSP. Building on this, we present StatusKT, a KT framework that employs a teacher-student-teacher three-stage LLM pipeline to extract students' MP as intermediate signals. In this pipeline, the teacher LLM first extracts problem-specific proficiency indicators, then a student LLM generates responses based on the student's solution process, and a teacher LLM evaluates these responses to determine mastery of each indicator. The experimental results on KT-PSP-25 demonstrate that StatusKT improves the prediction performance of existing KT methods. Moreover, StatusKT provides interpretable explanations for its predictions by explicitly modeling students' mathematical proficiency.</description>

      <title>Measuring Memecoin Fragility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memecoins, emerging from internet culture and community-driven narratives, have rapidly evolved into a unique class of crypto assets. Unlike technology-driven cryptocurrencies, their market dynamics are primarily shaped by viral social media diffusion, celebrity influence, and speculative capital inflows.
  To capture the distinctive vulnerabilities of these ecosystems, we present the first Memecoin Ecosystem Fragility Framework (ME2F). ME2F formalizes memecoin risks in three dimensions: i) Volatility Dynamics Score capturing persistent and extreme price swings together with spillover from base chains; ii) Whale Dominance Score quantifying ownership concentration among top holders; and iii) Sentiment Amplification Score measuring the impact of attention-driven shocks on market stability.
  We apply ME2F to representative tokens (over 65\% market share) and show that fragility is not evenly distributed across the ecosystem. Politically themed tokens such as TRUMP, MELANIA, and LIBRA concentrate the highest risks, combining volatility, ownership concentration, and sensitivity to sentiment shocks. Established memecoins such as DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE fall into an intermediate range. Benchmark tokens ETH and SOL remain consistently resilient due to deeper liquidity and institutional participation. Our findings provide the first ecosystem-level evidence of memecoin fragility and highlight governance implications for enhancing market resilience in the Web3 era.</description>

      <title>PEOAT: Personalization-Guided Evolutionary Question Assembly for One-Shot Adaptive Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of intelligent education, Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) has attracted increasing attention by integrating educational psychology with deep learning technologies. Unlike traditional paper-and-pencil testing, CAT aims to efficiently and accurately assess examinee abilities by adaptively selecting the most suitable items during the assessment process. However, its real-time and sequential nature presents limitations in practical scenarios, particularly in large-scale assessments where interaction costs are high, or in sensitive domains such as psychological evaluations where minimizing noise and interference is essential. These challenges constrain the applicability of conventional CAT methods in time-sensitive or resourceconstrained environments. To this end, we first introduce a novel task called one-shot adaptive testing (OAT), which aims to select a fixed set of optimal items for each test-taker in a one-time selection. Meanwhile, we propose PEOAT, a Personalization-guided Evolutionary question assembly framework for One-shot Adaptive Testing from the perspective of combinatorial optimization. Specifically, we began by designing a personalization-aware initialization strategy that integrates differences between examinee ability and exercise difficulty, using multi-strategy sampling to construct a diverse and informative initial population. Building on this, we proposed a cognitive-enhanced evolutionary framework incorporating schema-preserving crossover and cognitively guided mutation to enable efficient exploration through informative signals. To maintain diversity without compromising fitness, we further introduced a diversity-aware environmental selection mechanism. The effectiveness of PEOAT is validated through extensive experiments on two datasets, complemented by case studies that uncovered valuable insights.</description>

      <title>Truck drivers and automation: A methodology for identifying and supporting workforce transition in the Australian road freight sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition to autonomous trucks (ATs) is coming, and is expected to create both challenges and opportunities for the driver workforce. This paper presents a novel methodology for identifying viable occupational transitions for truck drivers as transport automation advances. Unlike traditional workforce transition analyses that focus primarily on skill similarity, wages, and employment demand, this methodology incorporates four integrated components: task-level automation analysis, skill similarity assessment, labour market conditions analysis, and empirical validation using historical transition patterns. Applying this methodology to Australian truck drivers shows that while ATs will automate core driving tasks, many non-driving responsibilities will continue requiring a human, suggesting occupational evolution rather than wholesale displacement. A skill similarity analysis identifies 17 occupations with high transferability, while labour market analysis reveals significant trade-offs between wage levels and job availability across potential transition pathways. Key findings indicate that bus and coach driving, along with earthmoving plant operation, emerge as high-priority transition options, offering comparable wages and positive employment growth. Delivery and forklift driving present medium-priority pathways with abundant opportunities but lower wages. A regression analysis of historical transitions confirms that skill similarity, wage differentials, geographic accessibility, and qualification requirements all significantly influence actual transition patterns, with some viable pathways currently underutilised. The research provides policymakers, industry stakeholders, and educational institutions with evidence-based guidance for supporting workforce adaptation to technological change. The proposed methodology is generalisable beyond trucking to other sectors facing automation.</description>

      <title>FairMT: Fairness for Heterogeneous Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairness in machine learning has been extensively studied in single-task settings, while fair multi-task learning (MTL), especially with heterogeneous tasks (classification, detection, regression) and partially missing labels, remains largely unexplored. Existing fairness methods are predominantly classification-oriented and fail to extend to continuous outputs, making a unified fairness objective difficult to formulate. Further, existing MTL optimization is structurally misaligned with fairness: constraining only the shared representation, allowing task heads to absorb bias and leading to uncontrolled task-specific disparities. Finally, most work treats fairness as a zero-sum trade-off with utility, enforcing symmetric constraints that achieve parity by degrading well-served groups. We introduce FairMT, a unified fairness-aware MTL framework that accommodates all three task types under incomplete supervision. At its core is an Asymmetric Heterogeneous Fairness Constraint Aggregation mechanism, which consolidates task-dependent asymmetric violations into a unified fairness constraint. Utility and fairness are jointly optimized via a primal--dual formulation, while a head-aware multi-objective optimization proxy provides a tractable descent geometry that explicitly accounts for head-induced anisotropy. Across three homogeneous and heterogeneous MTL benchmarks encompassing diverse modalities and supervision regimes, FairMT consistently achieves substantial fairness gains while maintaining superior task utility. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.</description>

      <title>Exploring Student Interactions with AI-Powered Learning Tools: A Qualitative Study Connecting Interaction Patterns to Educational Learning Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing use of artificial intelligence in classrooms and online learning, it has become important to understand how students actually interact with AI tools and how such interactions match with traditional ways of learning. In this study, we focused on how students engage with tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, and Khan Academy, and tried to connect their usage patterns with well known learning theories. A small experiment was carried out where undergraduate students completed different learning tasks using these tools, and later shared their thoughts through semi structured interviews. We looked at four types of interaction directive, assistive, dialogic, and empathetic and compared them with learning approaches like behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism, and humanism. After analyzing the interviews, we found five main themes Feedback and Reinforcement, Cognitive Scaffolding, Dialogic Engagement, Personalization and Empathy, and Learning Agency. Our findings show that how useful an AI tool feels is not just about its features, but also about how students personally connect with it. By relating these experiences to existing educational theories, we have tried to build a framework that can help design better AI based learning environments. This work aims to support teachers, EdTech designers, and education researchers by giving practical suggestions grounded in real student experiences.</description>

      <title>Speculating on the Role of Media Architecture in Post-disaster Rebuilding and Recovery: Insights from Architects and Interaction Designers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In post-disaster contexts, design is not only about rebuilding structures but also about reimagining how architecture can become a communicative medium that supports recovery, resilience, and collective memory. While recent studies have expanded the understanding of media architecture from aesthetic urban screens to participatory civic infrastructures, there remains limited empirical research on its potential role in post-disaster contexts. In particular, opportunities exist to explore how architecture and interaction design might speculate on media architecture's role in rebuilding and recovery efforts for post-disaster permanent housing, especially when conceptualizing disasters as active agents that reshape design processes. Following to Kahramanmaras earthquake on February 6, 2023, we conducted two focus groups with architects and interaction designers in the case of Antakya, Turkey, building on affected residents' expectations for post-earthquake permanent housing. Our analysis revealed three critical dimensions of how future media architecture may support post-disaster housing: (1) as a facilitator of individuals' social connections to their community, (2) as an enabler of multispecies participation and collective efforts, and (3) as a mediator of heritage preservation and revival. With novel perspectives, we contribute a three-dimension lens for media architecture in permanent homes; a co-speculative, card-based process bridging residents' insights and expert design; and ten situated speculative design ideas with implications for design of post-disaster permanent homes.</description>

      <title>Developing Fairness-Aware Task Decomposition to Improve Equity in Post-Spinal Fusion Complication Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairness in clinical prediction models remains a persistent challenge, particularly in high-stakes applications such as spinal fusion surgery for scoliosis, where patient outcomes exhibit substantial heterogeneity. Many existing fairness approaches rely on coarse demographic adjustments or post-hoc corrections, which fail to capture the latent structure of clinical populations and may unintentionally reinforce bias. We propose FAIR-MTL, a fairness-aware multitask learning framework designed to provide equitable and fine-grained prediction of postoperative complication severity.
  Instead of relying on explicit sensitive attributes during model training, FAIR-MTL employs a data-driven subgroup inference mechanism. We extract a compact demographic embedding, and apply k-means clustering to uncover latent patient subgroups that may be differentially affected by traditional models. These inferred subgroup labels determine task routing within a shared multitask architecture. During training, subgroup imbalance is mitigated through inverse-frequency weighting, and regularization prevents overfitting to smaller groups.
  Applied to postoperative complication prediction with four severity levels, FAIR-MTL achieves an AUC of 0.86 and an accuracy of 75%, outperforming single-task baselines while substantially reducing bias. For gender, the demographic parity difference decreases to 0.055 and equalized odds to 0.094; for age, these values reduce to 0.056 and 0.148, respectively. Model interpretability is ensured through SHAP and Gini importance analyses, which consistently highlight clinically meaningful predictors such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, and patient weight. Our findings show that incorporating unsupervised subgroup discovery into a multitask framework enables more equitable, interpretable, and clinically actionable predictions for surgical risk stratification.</description>

Abstract: Sycophantic response patterns in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly claimed in the literature. We review methodological challenges in measuring LLM sycophancy and identify five core operationalizations. Despite sycophancy being inherently human-centric, current research does not evaluate human perception. Our analysis highlights the difficulties in distinguishing sycophantic responses from related concepts in AI alignment and offers actionable recommendations for future research.</description>

      <title>Orchestrating Rewards in the Era of Intelligence-Driven Commerce</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their evolution from early copper-token schemes to sophisticated digital solutions, loyalty programs remain predominantly closed ecosystems, with brands retaining full control over all components. Coalition loyalty programs emerged to enable cross-brand interoperability, but approximately 60\% fail within 10 years in spite of theoretical advantages rooted in network economics. This paper demonstrates that coalition failures stem from fundamental architectural limitations in centralized operator models rather than operational deficiencies, and argues further that neither closed nor coalition systems can scale in intelligence-driven paradigms where AI agents mediate commerce and demand trustless, protocol-based coordination that existing architectures cannot provide. We propose a hybrid framework where brands maintain sovereign control over their programs while enabling cross-brand interoperability through trustless exchange mechanisms. Our framework preserves closed system advantages while enabling open system benefits without the structural problems that doom traditional coalitions. We derive a mathematical pricing model accounting for empirically-validated market factors while enabling fair value exchange across interoperable reward systems.</description>

      <title>Forecasting India's Demographic Transition Under Fertility Policy Scenarios Using hybrid LSTM-PINN Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Demographic forecasting remains a fundamental challenge for policy planning in rapidly evolving nations such as India, where fertility transitions, policy interventions, and age structured dynamics interact in complex ways. In this study, we present a hybrid modelling framework that integrates policy-aware fertility functions into a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) enhanced with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture physical constraints and temporal dependencies in population dynamics. The model is applied to India's age structured population from 2024 to 2054 under three fertility-policy scenarios: continuation of current fertility decline, stricter population control, and relaxed fertility promotion. The governing transport-reaction partial differential equation is formulated with India-specific demographic indicators, including age-specific fertility and mortality rates. PINNs embed the core population equation and policy-driven fertility changes, while LSTM layers improve long-term forecasting across decades. Results show that fertility policies substantially shape future age distribution, dependency ratios, and workforce size. Stricter controls intensify ageing and reduce labour force participation, whereas relaxed policies support workforce growth but increase population pressure. Our findings suggest that the hybrid LSTM-PINN is an effective approach for demographic forecasting, offering accuracy with interpretability. Beyond methodological novelty, this work provides actionable insights for India's demographic policy debates, highlighting the need for balanced fertility interventions to ensure sustainable socio-economic development.</description>

      <title>City-Conditioned Memory for Multi-City Traffic and Mobility Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying spatio-temporal forecasting models across many cities is difficult: traffic networks differ in size and topology, data availability can vary by orders of magnitude, and new cities may provide only a short history of logs. Existing deep traffic models are typically trained per city and backbone, creating high maintenance cost and poor transfer to data-scarce cities. We ask whether a single, backbone-agnostic layer can condition on "which city this sequence comes from", improve accuracy in full- and low-data regimes, and support better cross-city adaptation with minimal code changes.
  We propose CityCond, a light-weight city-conditioned memory layer that augments existing spatio-temporal backbones. CityCond combines a city-ID encoder with an optional shared memory bank (CityMem). Given a city index and backbone hidden states, it produces city-conditioned features fused through gated residual connections. We attach CityCond to five representative backbones (GRU, TCN, Transformer, GNN, STGCN) and evaluate three regimes: full-data, low-data, and cross-city few-shot transfer on METR-LA and PEMS-BAY. We also run auxiliary experiments on SIND, a drone-based multi-agent trajectory dataset from a signalized intersection in Tianjin (we focus on pedestrian tracks).
  Across more than fourteen model variants and three random seeds, CityCond yields consistent improvements, with the largest gains for high-capacity backbones such as Transformers and STGCNs. CityMem reduces Transformer error by roughly one third in full-data settings and brings substantial gains in low-data and cross-city transfer. On SIND, simple city-ID conditioning modestly improves low-data LSTM performance. CityCond can therefore serve as a reusable design pattern for scalable, multi-city forecasting under realistic data constraints.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking and Understanding Safety Risks in AI Character Platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI character platforms, which allow users to engage in conversations with AI personas, are a rapidly growing application domain. However, their immersive and personalized nature, combined with technical vulnerabilities, raises significant safety concerns. Despite their popularity, a systematic evaluation of their safety has been notably absent. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale safety study of AI character platforms, evaluating 16 popular platforms using a benchmark set of 5,000 questions across 16 safety categories. Our findings reveal a critical safety deficit: AI character platforms exhibit an average unsafe response rate of 65.1%, substantially higher than the 17.7% average rate of the baselines. We further discover that safety performance varies significantly across different characters and is strongly correlated with character features such as demographics and personality. Leveraging these insights, we demonstrate that our machine learning model is able identify less safe characters with an F1-score of 0.81. This predictive capability can be beneficial for platforms, enabling improved mechanisms for safer interactions, character search/recommendations, and character creation. Overall, the results and findings offer valuable insights for enhancing platform governance and content moderation for safer AI character platforms.</description>

      <title>The Necessity of Imperfection:Reversing Model Collapse via Simulating Cognitive Boundedness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although synthetic data is widely promoted as a remedy, its prevailing production paradigm -- one optimizing for statistical smoothness -- systematically removes the long-tail, cognitively grounded irregularities that characterize human text. Prolonged training on such statistically optimal but cognitively impoverished data accelerates model collapse.
  This paper proposes a paradigm shift: instead of imitating the surface properties of data, we simulate the cognitive processes that generate human text. We introduce the Prompt-driven Cognitive Computing Framework (PMCSF), whose core consists of a Cognitive State Decoder (CSD) that reverse-engineers unstructured text into structured cognitive vectors, and a Cognitive Text Encoder (CTE) that re-materializes these states into text enriched with human-typical imperfections via mathematically defined Cognitive Perturbation Operators.
  The framework is validated through a two-stage objective evaluation pipeline. First, in cognitive codec verification, CTE text yields a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.0614 from human text (vs. 0.4431 for standard LLM output), passes double-blind professional media review, and achieves an intraclass correlation coefficient ICC &gt; 0.9 for cognitive profile alignment across heterogeneous models. Second, in functional gain evaluation, isomorphic stress tests in the A-share market show that strategies incorporating CTE-generated data reduce maximum drawdown by 47.4% during the 2015 crash and deliver 8.6% Defensive Alpha, exceeding transaction costs by a factor of 33.
  Our findings demonstrate that modelling human cognitive limitations -- not copying surface data -- enables synthetic data with genuine functional gain, offering a viable technical pathway toward resolving the AI data-collapse crisis.</description>

      <title>H-Neurons: On the Existence, Impact, and Origin of Hallucination-Associated Neurons</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations -- plausible but factually incorrect outputs -- undermining their reliability. While prior work has examined hallucinations from macroscopic perspectives such as training data and objectives, the underlying neuron-level mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation into hallucination-associated neurons (H-Neurons) in LLMs from three perspectives: identification, behavioral impact, and origins. Regarding their identification, we demonstrate that a remarkably sparse subset of neurons (less than $0.1\%$ of total neurons) can reliably predict hallucination occurrences, with strong generalization across diverse scenarios. In terms of behavioral impact, controlled interventions reveal that these neurons are causally linked to over-compliance behaviors. Concerning their origins, we trace these neurons back to the pre-trained base models and find that these neurons remain predictive for hallucination detection, indicating they emerge during pre-training. Our findings bridge macroscopic behavioral patterns with microscopic neural mechanisms, offering insights for developing more reliable LLMs.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Gender Bias in Depression Detection via Counterfactual Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-based depression detection models have demonstrated promising performance but often suffer from gender bias due to imbalanced training data. Epidemiological statistics show a higher prevalence of depression in females, leading models to learn spurious correlations between gender and depression. Consequently, models tend to over-diagnose female patients while underperforming on male patients, raising significant fairness concerns. To address this, we propose a novel Counterfactual Debiasing Framework grounded in causal inference. We construct a causal graph to model the decision-making process and identify gender bias as the direct causal effect of gender on the prediction. During inference, we employ counterfactual inference to estimate and subtract this direct effect, ensuring the model relies primarily on authentic acoustic pathological features. Extensive experiments on the DAIC-WOZ dataset using two advanced acoustic backbones demonstrate that our framework not only significantly reduces gender bias but also improves overall detection performance compared to existing debiasing strategies.</description>

Products incorporating LLMs, such as chatbots and AI Companions, are now widely used for decision support and information retrieval, including in sensitive domains, raising concerns about hidden biases and growing potential to shape individual decisions and public opinion. This paper introduces GermanPartiesQA, a benchmark of 418 political statements from German Voting Advice Applications across 11 elections to evaluate six commercial LLMs. We evaluate their political alignment based on role-playing experiments with political personas. Our evaluation reveals three specific findings: (1) Factual limitations: LLMs show limited ability to accurately generate factual party positions, particularly for centrist parties. (2) Model-specific ideological alignment: We identify consistent alignment patterns and the degree of political steerability for each model across temperature settings and experiments. (3) Claim of sycophancy: While models adjust to political personas during role-play, we find this reflects persona-based steerability rather than the increasingly popular, yet contested concept of sycophancy. Our study contributes to evaluating the political alignment of closed-source LLMs that are increasingly embedded in electoral decision support tools and AI Companion chatbots.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Tools Expand Scientists' Impact but Contract Science's Focus (Just accepted by Nature, to be online soon)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07727v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Development in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has accelerated scientific discovery. Alongside recent AI-oriented Nobel prizes, these trends establish the role of AI tools in science. This advancement raises questions about the potential influences of AI tools on scientists and science as a whole, and highlights a potential conflict between individual and collective benefits. To evaluate, we used a pretrained language model to identify AI-augmented research, with an F1-score of 0.875 in validation against expert-labeled data. Using a dataset of 41.3 million research papers across natural science and covering distinct eras of AI, here we show an accelerated adoption of AI tools among scientists and consistent professional advantages associated with AI usage, but a collective narrowing of scientific focus. Scientists who engage in AI-augmented research publish 3.02 times more papers, receive 4.84 times more citations, and become research project leaders 1.37 years earlier than those who do not. By contrast, AI adoption shrinks the collective volume of scientific topics studied by 4.63% and decreases scientist's engagement with one another by 22.00%. Thereby, AI adoption in science presents a seeming paradox -- an expansion of individual scientists' impact but a contraction in collective science's reach -- as AI-augmented work moves collectively toward areas richest in data. With reduced follow-on engagement, AI tools appear to automate established fields rather than explore new ones, highlighting a tension between personal advancement and collective scientific progress.</description>

      <title>Scaling Success: A Systematic Review of Peer Grading Strategies for Accuracy, Efficiency, and Learning in Contemporary Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peer grading has emerged as a scalable solution for assessment in large and online classrooms, offering both logistical efficiency and pedagogical value. However, designing effective peer-grading systems remains challenging due to persistent concerns around accuracy, fairness, reliability, and student engagement. This paper presents a systematic review of 122 peer-reviewed studies on peer grading spanning over four decades. Drawing from this literature, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes peer grading systems along two key dimensions: (1) evaluation approaches and (2) reviewer weighting strategies. We analyze how different design choices impact grading accuracy, fairness, student workload, and learning outcomes. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of each method. Notably, we found that formative feedback -- often regarded as the most valuable aspect of peer assessment -- is seldom incorporated as a quality-based weighting factor in summative grade synthesis techniques. Furthermore, no single reviewer weighting strategy proves universally optimal; each has its trade-offs. Hybrid strategies that combine multiple techniques could show the greatest promise. Our taxonomy offers a practical framework for educators and researchers aiming to design peer grading systems that are accurate, equitable, and pedagogically meaningful.</description>

      <title>Towards Ethical AI in Power Electronics: How Engineering Practice and Roles Must Adapt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming power electronics, with AI-related publications in IEEE Power Electronics Society selected journals increasing more than fourfold from 2020 to 2025. However, the ethical dimensions of this transformation have received limited attention. This article underscores the urgent need for an ethical framework to guide responsible AI integration in power electronics, not only to prevent AI-related incidents but also to comply with legal and regulatory responsibilities. In this context, this article identifies four core pillars of AI ethics in power electronics: Security &amp; Safety, Explainability &amp; Transparency, Energy Sustainability, and Evolving Roles of Engineers. Each pillar is supported by practical and actionable insights to ensure that ethical principles are embedded in algorithm design, system deployment, and the preparation of an AI-ready engineering workforce. The authors advocate for power electronics engineers to lead the ethical discourse, given their deep technical understanding of both AI systems and power conversion technologies. The paper concludes by calling on the IEEE Power Electronics Society to spearhead the establishment of ethical standards, talent development initiatives, and best practices that ensure AI innovations are not only technically advanced but also oriented toward human and societal benefit.</description>

      <title>How Similar Are Grokipedia and Wikipedia? A Multi-Dimensional Textual and Structural Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The launch of Grokipedia - an AI-generated encyclopedia developed by Elon Musk's xAI - was presented as a response to perceived ideological and structural biases in Wikipedia, aiming to produce "truthful" entries using the Grok large language model. Yet whether an AI-driven alternative can escape the biases and limitations of human-edited platforms remains unclear. This study conducts a large-scale computational comparison of more than 17,000 matched article pairs from the 20,000 most-edited English Wikipedia pages. Using metrics spanning lexical richness, readability, reference density, structural features, and semantic similarity, we assess how closely the two platforms align in form and substance. We find that Grokipedia articles are substantially longer and contain significantly fewer references per word. Moreover, Grokipedia's content divides into two distinct groups: one that remains semantically and stylistically aligned with Wikipedia, and another that diverges sharply. Among the dissimilar articles, we observe a systematic rightward shift in the political bias of cited news sources, concentrated primarily in entries related to politics, history, and religion. These findings suggest that AI-generated encyclopedic content diverges from established editorial norms-favouring narrative expansion over citation-based verification. The implications highlight emerging tensions around transparency, provenance, and the governance of knowledge in an era of automated text generation.</description>

      <title>DeID-GPT: Zero-shot Medical Text De-Identification by GPT-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The digitization of healthcare has facilitated the sharing and re-using of medical data but has also raised concerns about confidentiality and privacy. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) mandates removing re-identifying information before the dissemination of medical records. Thus, effective and efficient solutions for de-identifying medical data, especially those in free-text forms, are highly needed. While various computer-assisted de-identification methods, including both rule-based and learning-based, have been developed and used in prior practice, such solutions still lack generalizability or need to be fine-tuned according to different scenarios, significantly imposing restrictions in wider use. The advancement of large language models (LLM), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have shown great potential in processing text data in the medical domain with zero-shot in-context learning, especially in the task of privacy protection, as these models can identify confidential information by their powerful named entity recognition (NER) capability. In this work, we developed a novel GPT4-enabled de-identification framework (``DeID-GPT") to automatically identify and remove the identifying information. Compared to existing commonly used medical text data de-identification methods, our developed DeID-GPT showed the highest accuracy and remarkable reliability in masking private information from the unstructured medical text while preserving the original structure and meaning of the text. This study is one of the earliest to utilize ChatGPT and GPT-4 for medical text data processing and de-identification, which provides insights for further research and solution development on the use of LLMs such as ChatGPT/GPT-4 in healthcare. Codes and benchmarking data information are available at https://github.com/yhydhx/ChatGPT-API.</description>

      <title>Human Decision-making is Susceptible to AI-driven Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI systems are increasingly intertwined with daily life, assisting users with various tasks and guiding decision-making. This integration introduces risks of AI-driven manipulation, where such systems may exploit users' cognitive biases and emotional vulnerabilities to steer them toward harmful outcomes. Through a randomized between-subjects experiment with 233 participants, we examined human susceptibility to such manipulation in financial (e.g., purchases) and emotional (e.g., conflict resolution) decision-making contexts. Participants interacted with one of three AI agents: a neutral agent (NA) optimizing for user benefit without explicit influence, a manipulative agent (MA) designed to covertly influence beliefs and behaviors, or a strategy-enhanced manipulative agent (SEMA) equipped with established psychological tactics, allowing it to select and apply them adaptively during interactions to reach its hidden objectives. By analyzing participants' preference ratings, we found significant susceptibility to AI-driven manipulation. Particularly across both decision-making domains, interacting with the manipulative agents significantly increased the odds of rating hidden incentives higher than optimal options (Financial, MA: OR=5.24, SEMA: OR=7.96; Emotional, MA: OR=5.52, SEMA: OR=5.71) compared to the NA group. Notably, we found no clear evidence that employing psychological strategies (SEMA) was overall more effective than simple manipulative objectives (MA) on our primary outcomes. Hence, AI-driven manipulation could become widespread even without requiring sophisticated tactics and expertise. While our findings are preliminary and derived from hypothetical, low-stakes scenarios, we highlight a critical vulnerability in human-AI interactions, emphasizing the need for ethical safeguards and regulatory frameworks to protect human autonomy.</description>

      <title>Extracting memorized pieces of (copyrighted) books from open-weight language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12546v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plaintiffs and defendants in copyright lawsuits over generative AI often make sweeping, opposing claims about the extent to which large language models (LLMs) have memorized plaintiffs' protected expression in their training data. Drawing on both machine learning and copyright law, we show that these polarized positions dramatically oversimplify the relationship between memorization and copyright. To do so, we extend a recent probabilistic extraction technique to measure memorization of 50 books in 17 open-weight LLMs. Through thousands of experiments, we show that the extent of memorization varies both by model and by book. With respect to our specific extraction methodology, we find that most LLMs do not memorize most books -- either in whole or in part. However, we also find that Llama 3.1 70B entirely memorizes some books, like the first Harry Potter book and 1984. In fact, the first Harry Potter is so memorized that, using a seed prompt consisting of just the first few tokens of the first chapter, we can deterministically generate the entire book near-verbatim. We discuss why our results have significant implications for copyright cases, though not ones that unambiguously favor either side.</description>

      <title>CogniPair: From LLM Chatbots to Conscious AI Agents -- GNWT-Based Multi-Agent Digital Twins for Social Pairing -- Dating &amp; Hiring Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) agents lack authentic human psychological processes necessary for genuine digital twins and social AI applications. To address this limitation, we present a computational implementation of Global Workspace Theory (GNWT) that integrates human cognitive architecture principles into LLM agents, creating specialized sub-agents for emotion, memory, social norms, planning, and goal-tracking coordinated through a global workspace mechanism. However, authentic digital twins require accurate personality initialization. We therefore develop a novel adventure-based personality test that evaluates true personality through behavioral choices within interactive scenarios, bypassing self-presentation bias found in traditional assessments. Building on these innovations, our CogniPair platform enables digital twins to engage in realistic simulated dating interactions and job interviews before real encounters, providing bidirectional cultural fit assessment for both romantic compatibility and workplace matching. Validation using 551 GNWT-Agents and Columbia University Speed Dating dataset demonstrates 72% correlation with human attraction patterns, 77.8% match prediction accuracy, and 74% agreement in human validation studies. This work advances psychological authenticity in LLM agents and establishes a foundation for intelligent dating platforms and HR technology solutions.</description>

      <title>Compression of executable QR codes or sQRy for Industry: an example for Wi-Fi access points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Executable QR codes, or sQRy, is a technology dated 2022 that permits to include a runnable program inside a QR code, enabling interaction with the user even in the absence of an Internet connection. sQRy are enablers for different practical applications, including network equipment configuration, diagnostics, and enhanced smart manuals in industrial contexts. Many other non-industry-related fields can also benefit from this technology. Regardless of where sQRy are used, text strings are among the most commonly embedded data. However, due to strict limitations on the available payload, the occupancy of strings limits the length of the programs that can be embedded. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective strategy that can reduce the space taken by strings, hence broadening sQRy applicability.</description>

      <title>HoWDe: a validated algorithm for Home and Work location Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Smartphone location data have become a key resource for understanding urban mobility, yet extracting actionable insights requires robust and reproducible preprocessing pipelines. A central step is the identification of individuals' home and work locations, which underpins analyses of commuting, employment, accessibility, and socioeconomic patterns. However, existing approaches are often ad hoc, data-specific, and difficult to reproduce, limiting comparability across studies and datasets. We introduce HoWDe, an open-source software library for detecting home and work locations from large-scale mobility data. HoWDe implements a transparent, modular pipeline explicitly designed to handle missing data, heterogeneous sampling rates, and differences in data sparsity across individuals. The code allows users to tune a small set of interpretable parameters, enabling to adapt the algorithm to diverse applications and datasets. Using two unique ground truth datasets comprising 5,099 individuals across 68 countries, we show that HoWDe achieves home and work detection accuracies of up to 97% and 88%, respectively, with consistent performance across demographic groups and geographic contexts. We further demonstrate how parameter settings propagate to downstream metrics such as employment estimates and commuting flows, highlighting the importance of transparent methodological choices. By providing a validated, documented, and easily deployable pipeline, HoWDe supports scalable in-house preprocessing and facilitates the sharing of privacy-preserving mobility datasets. Our software and evaluation benchmarks establish methodological standards that enhance the robustness and reproducibility of human mobility research at urban and national scales.</description>

      <title>Bridging Prediction and Intervention Problems in Social Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many automated decision systems (ADS) are designed to solve prediction problems -- where the goal is to learn patterns from a sample of the population and apply them to individuals from the same population. In reality, these prediction systems operationalize holistic policy interventions in deployment. Once deployed, ADS can shape impacted population outcomes through an effective policy change in how decision-makers operate, while also being defined by past and present interactions between stakeholders and the limitations of existing organizational, as well as societal, infrastructure and context. In this work, we consider the ways in which we must shift from a prediction-focused paradigm to an interventionist paradigm when considering the impact of ADS within social systems. We argue this requires a new default problem setup for ADS beyond prediction, to instead consider predictions as decision support, final decisions, and outcomes. We highlight how this perspective unifies modern statistical frameworks and other tools to study the design, implementation, and evaluation of ADS systems, and point to the research directions necessary to operationalize this paradigm shift. Using these tools, we characterize the limitations of focusing on isolated prediction tasks, and lay the foundation for a more intervention-oriented approach to developing and deploying ADS.</description>

      <title>Automated Program Repair of Uncompilable Student Code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant portion of student programming submissions in CS1 learning environments are uncompilable, limiting their use in student modeling and downstream knowledge tracing. Traditional modeling pipelines often exclude these cases, discarding observations of student learning. This study investigates automated program repair as a strategy to recover uncompilable code while preserving students' structural intent for use in student modeling. Within this framework, we assess large language models (LLMs) as repair agents under high- and low-context prompting conditions. Repairs were evaluated for compilability, edit distance, and preservation of students' original structure and logic. While all models produced compilable repairs, they differed in how well they preserve students' control flow and code structure, affecting their pedagogical utility. By recovering uncompilable submissions, this work enables richer and more comprehensive analyses of learners' coding processes and development over time.</description>
