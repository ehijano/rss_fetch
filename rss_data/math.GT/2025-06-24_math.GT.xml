      <title>The tangle-valued 1-cocycle for knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper contains the strongest and at the same time most calculable knot invariant ever.
  Let $\Theta$ be the topological moduli space of all ordered oriented tangles in 3-space. We construct a non-trivial combinatorial 1-cocycle $\mathbb{L}$ for $\Theta$ that takes its values in $H_0(\Theta;\mathbb{Z})$. The 1-cocycle $\mathbb{L}$ has a very nice property, called the {\em scan-property}: if we slide a tangle $T$ over or under a given crossing $c$ of a fixed tangle $T'$, then the value of $\mathbb{L}$ on this arc $scan(T)$ in $\Theta$ is already an isotopy invariant of $T$.
  In particular, let $D$ be a framed long knot diagram. We take the product with a fixed long knot diagram $K$ and we consider the 2-cable, with a fixed crossing $c$ in $2K$. $\mathbb{L}(scan(2D))$ gives an element in $H_0(\Theta)$. To this element we associate the {\em set of Alexander vectors}, consisting of the corresponding integer multiples of the one-variable Alexander polynomials of (the standard closures) of all sub-tangles of each of the tangles. We can vary the knots $(K,c)$ and moreover we can iterate our construction by starting now again the $scan$ with the tangles in $\mathbb{L}(scan(2D))$ and so on. The result is the infinite {\em Alexander tree}, which is an isotopy invariant of the knot represented by $D$.
  {\em As an example we show with just one edge of the Alexander tree that the knot $8_{17}$ is not invertible!} This makes the Alexander tree a very promising candidate for a complete and "locally" calculable knot invariant, because the tangles in $\mathbb{L}(scan(2D))$ can be drawn with linear complexity and their Alexander polynomials can be calculated with quartic complexity with respect to the number of crossings of $D$.</description>

      <title>Classical invariants of spiral knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Torus knots are an important family of knots about which much is understood; invariants of torus knots often exhibit nice formulas, making them convenient and fundamental building blocks for examples in knot theory. Spiral knots, defined and first studied by Brothers et al., are a braid-theoretic generalization of torus knots, but comparatively not much is known about this broader family of knots. We give a general recursive formula for the Alexander polynomials of spiral knots, and from this we derive several properties of spiral knots, including a simple genus formula. Additionally, we investigate the consequences these results have on classification questions.</description>

      <title>On sections of maps from 4-manifolds to the 2-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note exhibits singular fibrations over the 2-sphere whose regular fibers are connected surfaces of arbitrarily high genus, but which admit no sections. These include achiral Lefschetz fibrations, as well as generic maps for which some disks cannot lift to sections -- in fact, neither hemisphere lifts.</description>

      <title>Subgraph Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18838v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $r \geq 3$, we prove that there exists $\lambda &gt;0$ depending only on $r$ so that if $G$ is a metric graph of rank $r$ with metric entropy $1$, then there exists a proper subgraph $H$ of $G$ with metric entropy at least $\lambda$. This answers a question of the second two authors together with Rieck. We interpret this as a graph theoretic version of the Bers Lemma from hyperbolic geometry, and explain some connections to the pressure metric on the Culler-Vogtmann Outer Space.</description>

      <title>Floer homotopy theory for monotone Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We circumvent one of the roadblocks in associating Floer homotopy types to monotone Lagrangians, namely the curvature phenomena occurring in high dimensions. Given $N \ge 3$ and $R$ a connective $\mathbb E_1$-ring spectrum, there is a notion of an $N$-truncated, $R$-oriented flow category, to which we associate a module prospectrum over the Postnikov truncation $\tau_{\le N - 3}R$. This endows ordinary Floer cohomology with an action of the Steenrod algebra over $\tau_{\le N-3}R$, and also induces certain generalized cohomology theories. We give sufficient conditions for a closed embedded monotone Lagrangian to admit such well-defined invariants for $N = N_\mu$ the minimal Maslov number, and $R = MU$ complex bordism. Finally, we formulate Oh-Pozniak type spectral sequences for these invariants, and show that in the case of $\mathbb{RP}^n \subset \mathbb{CP}^n$ they provide further restrictions on the topology of clean intersections with a Hamiltonian isotopy, not detected by ordinary Floer (co)homology.</description>

      <title>Moment-like maps and real algebraic functions with prescribed preimages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a problem on singularity theory of differentiable (smooth) or real algebraic maps which is different from knowing existence and has been difficult: constructing explcit real algebraic functions.
  We discuss construction of real algebraic functions with exactly one singular value, the singular points being of definite type, and prescribed preimages of single points. We discuss generalizations of the canonical projection of the unit sphere around the pole and the Morse-Bott functions around the boundaries of the images with preimages diffeomorphic to the torus.
  This has been discussed in the differentiable (smooth) category since the pioneering study of Sharko in 2006, followed by Masumoto-Saeki, Michalak and so on: the author has first considered the cases respecting the topologies of the preimages of the points where these studies had not done this essentially. Related real algebraic studies have been started by the author essentially in 2020's and the studies are developing, mainly due to the author.</description>

      <title>A matrix criterion and algorithmic approach for the Peterson hit problem: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Peterson hit problem in algebraic topology is to explicitly determine the dimension of the quotient space $Q\mathcal P_k = \mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathcal A}\mathcal P_k$ in positive degrees, where $\mathcal{P}_k$ denotes the polynomial algebra in $k$ variables over the field $\mathbb{F}_2$, considered as an unstable module over the Steenrod algebra $\mathcal{A}$. Current approaches to this problem still rely heavily on manual computations, which are highly prone to errors due to the intricate nature of the underlying calculations. To date, no efficient algorithm implemented in any computer algebra system has been made publicly available to tackle this problem in a systematic manner.
  Motivated by the above, in this work, which is considered as Part I of our project, we first establish a criterion based entirely on linear algebra for determining whether a given homogeneous polynomial is "hit". Accordingly, we describe the dimensions of the hit spaces. This leads to a practical and reliable computational method for determining the dimension of $Q\mathcal{P}_k$ for arbitrary $k$ and any positive degrees, with the support of a computer algebra system. We then give a concrete implementation of the obtained results as novel algorithms in \textsc{SageMath}. As an application, our algorithm demonstrates that the manually computed result presented in the recent work of Sum and Tai [12] for the dimension of $Q\mathcal{P}_5$ in degree $2^{6}$ is not correct. Furthermore, our algorithm determines that $\dim(Q\mathcal{P}_5)_{2^{7}} = 1985,$ which falls within the range $1984 \leq \dim(Q\mathcal{P}_5)_{2^{7}} \leq 1990$ as estimated in [12].</description>

      <title>The infinite dimensional geometry of conjugation invariant generating sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a number of examples of groups together with an infinite conjugation invariant generating set, including: the free group with the generating set of all separable elements; surface groups with the generating set of all non-filling curves; mapping class groups and outer automorphism groups of free groups with the generating sets of all reducible elements; and groups with suitable actions on Gromov hyperbolic spaces with a generating set of elliptic elements. In these Cayley graphs we show that there are quasi-isometrically embedded copies of $\mathbb{Z}^m$ for all $m \geq 1$. A corollary is that these Cayley graphs have infinite asymptotic dimension.
  By additionally building a new subsurface projection analogue for the free splitting graph, valued in the above Cayley graph of the free group, we are able to recover Sabalka-Savchuk's result that the edge-splitting graph of the free group has quasi-isometrically embedded copies of $\mathbb{Z}^m$ for all $m \geq 1$.
  Our analysis for Cayley graphs builds on a construction of Brandenbursky-Gal-K\c{e}dra-Marcinkowski using quasi-morphisms.
  We observe in particular that the Cayley graph of a closed surface group with the generating set of all simple closed curves is not hyperbolic, answering a question of Margalit-Putman.</description>

Abstract: We undertake to determine the homotopy type of gyrations of sphere products and of connected sums, thereby generalising results known in earlier literature as ''Fico's Lemmata'' which underpin gyrations in their original formulation from geometric topology. We provide applications arising from recasting these results into the modern homotopy theoretic setting.</description>

      <title>Trace-free characters and abelian knot contact homology I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00851</link>
      <description>arXiv:1708.00851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research investigates the mechanism underlying Ng's conjecture on the relationship between degree 0 abelian knot contact homology and the character variety of the 2-fold branched cover of the 3-sphere along a knot. The key idea involves analyzing trace-free characters of knot groups, which form the cross-section of $\SL_2(\C)$-character variety of a knot group cut by the hyperplane defined by the trace-free condition on meridians. This cross-section is referred to as the trace-free slice of the character variety (or simply the trace-free slice of a knot). We present a set of equations derived from a knot diagram whose common solutions coincide with the trace-free slice. This formulation describes the structure of the trace-free slice as a 2-fold branched cover over a closed algebraic set, referred to as the fundamental variety, and provides a powerful framework for analyzing the relationship stated in Ng's conjecture. Utilizing this framework, we introduce the notion of ghost characters of a knot. Consequently, using ghost characters, we show that Ng's conjecture holds for a knot $K$ if and only if $K$ admits no ghost characters.</description>

      <title>The ghost character of the (4,5)-torus knot and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:1708.01511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the (4,5)-torus knot $T_{4,5}$ admits exactly one ghost character. We then show that this ghost character provides the following two important results. (1) It is known that for any knot $K$ every (meridionally) trace-free $\SL_2(\C)$-representation of the knot group $G(K)$ yields an $\SL_2(\C)$-representation of the fundamental group $\pi_1(\Sigma_2K)$ of the 2-fold branched cover $\Sigma_2K$ of the 3-sphere along $K$. This correspondence often but not always provides all $\SL_2(\C)$-representations of $\pi_1(\Sigma_2K)$. We show by using the ghost character that $T_{4,5}$ is the simplest torus knot such that $\pi_1(\Sigma_2T_{4,5})$ admits an $\SL_2(\C)$-representation which cannot be realized by any trace-free $\SL_2(\C)$-representations. (2) We show that $T_{4,5}$ is the simplest torus knot that provides a counterexample to Ng's conjecture, concerned with a polynomial map $h^*$ between the character variety $X(\Sigma_2K)$ of $\pi_1(\Sigma_2K)$ and the fundamental variety $F_2(K)$. More precisely, the map $h^*$ is surjective but not injective, and hence not an isomorphism for $T_{4,5}$.</description>

Abstract: We show that in a prime, closed, oriented 3-manifold M, equivalent knots are isotopic if and only if the orientation preserving mapping class group is trivial. In the case of irreducible, closed, oriented $3$-manifolds we show the more general fact that every orientation preserving homeomorphism which preserves free homotopy classes of loops is isotopic to the identity. In the case of $S^1\times S^2$, we give infinitely many examples of knots whose isotopy classes are changed by the Gluck twist.</description>

      <title>Boundary slopes (nearly) bound exceptional slopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a hyperbolic knot in $S^3$, Dehn surgery along slope $r \in \Q \cup \{\frac10\}$ is {\em exceptional} if it results in a non-hyperbolic manifold. We say meridional surgery, $r = \frac10$, is {\em trivial} as it recovers the manifold $S^3$. We provide evidence in support of two conjectures. The first (inspired by a question of Professor Motegi) states that there are boundary slopes $b_1 &lt; b_2$ such that all non-trivial exceptional surgeries occur, as rational numbers, in the interval $[b_1,b_2]$. We say a boundary slope is {\em NIT} if it is non-integral or toroidal. Second, when there are non-trivial exceptional surgeries, we conjecture there are NIT boundary slopes $b_1 \leq b_2$ so that the exceptional surgeries lie in $[\floor{b_1},\ceil{b_2}]$. Moreover, if $\ceil{b_1} \leq \floor{b_2}$, the integers in the interval $[ \ceil{b_1}, \floor{b_2} ]$ are all exceptional surgeries.</description>

      <title>How many crossing changes or Delta-moves does it take to get to a homotopy trivial link?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The homotopy trivializing number, \(n_h(L)\), and the Delta homotopy trivializing number, \(n_\Delta(L)\), are invariants of the link homotopy class of \(L\) which count how many crossing changes or Delta moves are needed to reduce that link to a homotopy trivial link. In 2022, Davis, Orson, and Park proved that the homotopy trivializing number of \(L\) is bounded above by the sum of the absolute values of the pairwise linking numbers and some quantity \(C_n\) which depends only on \(n\), the number of components. In this paper we improve on this result by using the classification of link homotopy due to Habegger-Lin to give a quadratic upper bound on \(C_n\). We employ ideas from extremal graph theory to demonstrate that this bound is close to sharp, by exhibiting links with vanishing pairwise linking numbers and whose homotopy trivializing numbers grows quadratically. In the process, we determine the homotopy trivializing number of every 4-component link. We also prove a cubic upper bound on the difference between the Delta homotopy trivializing number of \(L\) and the sum of the absolute values of the triple linking numbers of \(L\).</description>

Abstract: The universal invariant with respect to a given ribbon Hopf algebra is a tangle invariant that dominates all the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants built from the representation theory of the algebra. We construct a canonical strict monoidal functor that encodes the universal invariant of upwards tangles and refines the Kerler-Kauffman-Radford functorial invariant. Moreover, this functor preserves the braiding, twist and the open trace, the latter being a mild modification of Joyal-Street-Verity's notion of trace in a balanced category. We construct this functor using the more flexible XC-algebras, a class which contains both ribbon Hopf algebras and endomorphism algebras of representation of these.</description>

      <title>A short proof of the generalized Conway--Gordon--Sachs theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The famous Conway--Gordon--Sachs theorem for the complete graph on six vertices was extended to the general complete graph on $n$ vertices by Kazakov--Korablev as a congruence modulo $2$, and its integral lift was given by Morishita--Nikkuni. However, the proof is complicated and long. In this paper, we provide a shorter proof of the generalized Conway--Gordon--Sachs theorem over integers.</description>

      <title>Curvature, macroscopic dimensions, and symmetric products of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01779v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the curvature and symplectic asphericity properties of symmetric products of surfaces. We show that these spaces can be used to answer nuanced questions arising in the study of closed Riemannian manifolds with positive scalar curvature. For example, we prove that symmetric products of surfaces sharply distinguish between two distinct notions of macroscopic dimension introduced by Gromov and the second-named author. As a natural generalization of this circle of ideas, we address the Gromov--Lawson and Gromov conjectures in the Kaehler projective setting and draw new connections between the theories of the minimal model, positivity in algebraic geometry, and macroscopic dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Plain Sphere Number of a Link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a link in $S^3$. We consider the class of meridional presentations for $\pi_1(S^3\backslash L)$ in which the relations are witnessed by embedded two-spheres which can be represented simultaneously in a fixed diagram of $L$, analogously to decomposition spheres studied by Cromwell, Menasco and others. Wirtinger relations are witnessed by such spheres and the Wirtinger presentation is a special case of the ones we study. We prove that the smallest number of generators of $\pi_1(S^3\backslash L)$ over all such presentations equals the bridge number of $L$.</description>

Abstract: Based on the analogies of arithmetic topology, we show a topological analogue of Hilbert's Satz 90 for idele groups and utilize our previously established Hasse norm principle to present a proof of an Iyanaga--Tamagawa type genus formula for finite abelian branched covers over integral homology 3-spheres in a very parallel manner to the case of number theory.</description>

      <title>Bordered contact invariants and half Giroux torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there exist infinitely many closed contact 3-manifolds containing half Giroux torsion along a separating torus whose contact invariants do not vanish. This provides counterexamples to Ghiggini's conjecture and suggests that separating half Giroux torsion may not obstruct symplectic fillability. The main tools are the bordered contact invariants recently developed by the authors and the innermost contact structures on knot complements. We also show that there exists a closed contact 3-manifold containing convex torsion along a separating torus with non-vanishing contact invariant, which implies that $2\pi$ is the minimal amount of twisting necessary to ensure vanishing of the contact invariant.</description>

      <title>Combination theorems in convex projective geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a general combination theorem for discrete subgroups of $\mathrm{PGL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ preserving properly convex open subsets in the projective space $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, in the spirit of Klein and Maskit. We use it in particular to prove that a free product of two $(\mathbb{Z}$-)linear groups is again ($\mathbb{Z}$-)linear, and to construct Zariski-dense discrete subgroups of $\mathrm{PGL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ which are not lattices but contain a lattice of a smaller higher-rank simple Lie group. We also establish a version of our combination theorem for discrete groups that are convex cocompact in $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ in the sense of arXiv:1704.08711. In particular, we prove that a free product of two convex cocompact groups is convex cocompact, which implies that the free product of two Anosov groups is Anosov. We also prove a virtual amalgamation theorem over convex cocompact subgroups generalizing work of Baker-Cooper.</description>

      <title>On the Hausdorff dimension and attracting laminations for fully irreducible automorphisms of free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a classic theorem of Birman and Series about the set of complete simple geodesics on a hyperbolic surface, we study the Hausdorff dimension of the set of endpoints in $\partial F_r$ of some abstract algebraic laminations associated with free group automorphisms.
  For an exponentially growing outer automorphism $\phi\in Out(F_r)$ we show that the set of endpoints $\mathcal E_{L}\subseteq \partial F_r$ of any of the \emph{attracting laminations} $L$ of $\phi$ has Hausdorff dimension $0$ for any tree $T\in cv_r$ and any visual metric on the boundary $\partial T=\partial F_r$. If $\phi\in Out(F_r)$ is an atoroidal and fully irreducible, we deduce the same conclusion for the set of endpoints of the ending lamination $\Lambda_\phi$ of $\phi$ that gets collapsed by the Cannon-Thurston map $\partial F_r\to \partial G_\phi$ for the associated free-by-cyclic group $G_\phi=F_r\rtimes_\phi\mathbb Z$.</description>

      <title>Horocycles in hyperbolic 3-manifolds with round Sierpi\'nski limit sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let M be a geometrically finite hyperbolic 3-manifold whose limit set is a round Sierpi\'nski gasket, i.e. M is geometrically finite and acylindrical with a compact, totally geodesic convex core boundary. In this paper, we classify orbit closures of the 1-dimensional horocycle flow on the frame bundle of M. As a result, the closure of a horocycle in M is a properly immersed submanifold. This extends the work of McMullen-Mohammadi-Oh where M is further assumed to be convex cocompact.</description>

      <title>On braided Hopf structures on exterior algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the exterior algebra of a vector space $V$ of dimension greater than one admits a one-parameter family of braided Hopf algebra structures, arising from its identification with a Nichols algebra. We explicitly compute the structure constants with respect to a natural set-theoretic basis.
  A one-parameter family of diagonal automorphisms exists, which we use to construct solutions to the (constant) Yang--Baxter equation. These solutions are conjectured to give rise to the two-variable Links--Gould polynomial invariants associated with the super-quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(N|1))$, where $N = \dim(V)$. We support this conjecture through computations for small values of $N$.</description>
