      <title>Tidal phenomena in the Galactic Center: The Curious Case of X7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several enigmatic dusty sources have been detected in the central parsec of the Galactic Center. Among them is X7, located at only $\sim$0.02 pc from the central super-massive black hole, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Recent observations have shown that it is becoming elongated due to the tidal forces of Sgr A*. X7 is expected to be fully disrupted during its pericenter passage around 2035 which might impact the accretion rate of Sgr A*. However, its origin and nature are still unknown. We investigated the tidal interaction of X7 with Sgr A* in order to constrain its origin. We tested the hypothesis that X7 was produced by one of the observed stars with constrained dynamical properties in the vicinity of Sgr A*. We employed a set of test-particle simulations to reproduce the observed structure and dynamics of X7. The initial conditions of the models were obtained by extrapolating the observationally constrained orbits of X7 and the known stars into the past, making it possible to find the time and source of origin by minimizing the three-dimensional separation and velocity difference between them. Our results show that ejecta from the star S33/S0-30, launched in $\sim$1950, can to a large extent, replicate the observed dynamics and structure of X7, provided that it is initially elongated with a velocity gradient across it, and with an initial maximum speed of $\sim$600~km~s$^{-1}$. Our results show that a grazing collision between the star S33/S0-30 and a field object such as a stellar mass black hole or a Jupiter-mass object is a viable scenario to explain the origin of X7. Nevertheless, such encounters are rare based on the observed stellar dynamics within the central parsec.</description>

      <title>Enhancing SED-Based Astrometric, Photometric, and Kinematic Studies of SAI 72 and SAI 75 Using Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the open clusters SAI 72 and SAI 75 using Gaia DR3 data, employing the Automated Stellar Cluster Analysis (ASteCA) tool to determine their structural and fundamental properties, including center coordinates, size, age, distance, mass, luminosity, and kinematics. Based on membership probabilities (P &gt;= 50%), we identified 112 and 115 stars as probable members of SAI 72 and SAI 75, respectively. Radial density profile (RDP) analysis yielded cluster radii of 2.35 arcmin for SAI 72 and 2.19 arcmin for SAI 75. The spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting was performed to refine metallicity, distance, and color excess parameters, ensuring consistency within 1 sigma of isochrone-based estimates. Isochrone fitting of the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) suggests ages of 316 Myr and 302 Myr, with corresponding distances of 3160 +/- 80 pc and 3200 +/- 200 pc. We derived their Galactic positions, projected distances (X_sun, Y_sun), and vertical displacements (Z_sun). Mass function analysis estimates cluster masses of 612 +/- 174 solar masses for SAI 72 and 465 +/- 90 solar masses for SAI 75. Kinematic studies indicate that both clusters have reached dynamical equilibrium. The AD diagram method provided convergent point coordinates of (A, D)_o = (97.016 +/- 0.09, 4.573 +/- 0.05) for SAI 72 and (99.677 +/- 0.10, 1.243 +/- 0.09) for SAI 75. Orbital analysis confirms that both clusters follow nearly circular trajectories with low eccentricities and minor variations in apogalactic and perigalactic distances. Furthermore, we determine that SAI 72 and SAI 75 originated beyond the solar circle at R_Birth = 10.825 +/- 0.068 kpc and R_Birth = 9.583 +/- 0.231 kpc, respectively. Their maximum heights above the Galactic plane, Z_max, are 109 +/- 9 pc for SAI 72 and 232 +/- 24 pc for SAI 75, reinforcing their classification as part of the young stellar disc population.</description>

      <title>No evidence for excess AGN activity in recently quenched massive galaxies at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of AGN activity within recently quenched massive galaxies at cosmic noon ($z\sim 2$), using deep Chandra X-ray observations of the Ultra-Deep Survey (UDS) field. Our sample includes over 4000 massive galaxies ($M_\ast &gt; 10^{10.5}$ M$_{\odot}$) in the redshift range $1 &lt; z &lt; 3$, including more than 200 transitionary post-starburst (PSB) systems. We find that X-ray emitting AGN are detected in $6.2 \pm 1.5$ per cent of massive PSBs at these redshifts, a detection rate that lies between those of star-forming and passive galaxies ($8.2 \pm 0.5$ per cent and $5.7 \pm 0.8$ per cent, respectively). A stacking analysis shows that the average X-ray luminosity for PSBs is comparable to older passive galaxies, but a factor of $2.6 \pm 0.3$ below star-forming galaxies of similar redshift and stellar mass. The average X-ray luminosity in all populations appears to trace the star-formation rate, with PSBs showing low levels of AGN activity consistent with their reduced levels of star formation. We conclude that, on average, we see no evidence for excess AGN activity in the post-starburst phase. However, the low levels of AGN activity can be reconciled with the high-velocity outflows observed in many PSBs, assuming the rare X-ray detections represent short-lived bursts of black hole activity, visible $\sim$5 per cent of the time. Thus, X-ray AGN may help to maintain quiescence in massive galaxies at cosmic noon, but the evidence for a direct link to the primary quenching event remains elusive.</description>

      <title>An In-depth Analysis of Photometric and Kinematic Characteristics of SAI 16, SAI 81 and SAI 86 Open Clusters Utilizing Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study comprehensively analyzes three open star clusters: SAI 16, SAI 81, and SAI 86 using Gaia DR3 data. Based on the ASteCA code, we determined the most probable star candidates (P &gt;= 50%) and estimated the number of star members of each cluster as 125, 158, and 138, respectively. We estimated the internal structural parameters by fitting the King model to the observed RDPs, including the core, limited, and tidal radii. The isochrone fitting to the color-magnitude diagram provided log(age) values of 9.13 +/- 0.04, 8.10 +/- 0.04, and 8.65 +/- 0.04 and distances of 3790 +/- 94 pc, 3900 +/- 200 pc, and 3120 +/- 30 pc for SAI 16, SAI 81, and SAI 86, respectively. We also calculated their projected distances from the Galactic plane (X_sun, Y_sun) as well as their vertical distances (Z_sun), Galactocentric distances (R_gc), and total masses (M_C) in solar units, which are about 142 +/- 12, 302 +/- 17, and 192 +/- 14 for SAI 16, SAI 81, and SAI 86, respectively. Examining the dynamical relaxation state indicates that all three clusters are dynamically relaxed. By undertaking a kinematic analysis of the cluster data, the space velocity was determined. We calculated the coordinates of the apex point (A_o, D_o) using the AD diagram method along with the derivation of the solar motion parameters (S_sun, l_A, b_A). Through our detailed dynamic orbit analysis, we determined that the three SAI clusters belong to the young stellar disc, confirming their membership within this component of the Galactic structure.</description>

      <title>The (Limited) Effect of Viscosity in Multiphase Turbulent Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiphase gas can be found in many astrophysical environments, such as galactic outflows, stellar wind bubbles, and the circumgalactic medium, where the interplay between turbulence, cooling, and viscosity can significantly influence gas dynamics and star formation processes. We investigate the role of viscosity in modulating turbulence and radiative cooling in turbulent radiative mixing layers (TRMLs). In particular, we aim to determine how different amounts of viscosity affect the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), turbulence evolution, and the efficiency of gas mixing and cooling. Using idealized 2D numerical setups, we compute the critical viscosity required to suppress the KHI in shear flows characterized by different density contrasts and Mach numbers. These results are then used in a 3D shear layer setup to explore the impact of viscosity on cooling efficiency and turbulence across different cooling regimes. We find that the critical viscosity follows the expected dependence on overdensity and Mach number. Our viscous TRMLs simulations show different behaviors in the weak and strong cooling regimes. In the weak cooling regime, viscosity has a strong impact, resulting in laminar flows and breaking previously established inviscid relations between cooling and turbulence (albeit leaving the total luminosity unaffected). However, in the strong cooling regime, when cooling timescales are shorter than viscous timescales, key scaling relations in TRMLs remain largely intact. In this regime -- which must hold for gas to remain multiphase -- radiative losses dominate, and the system effectively behaves as non-viscous regardless of the actual level of viscosity. Our findings have direct implications for both the interpretation of observational diagnostics and the development of subgrid models in large-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Big, Dusty Galaxies in Blue Jay: Insights into the Relationship Between Morphology and Dust Attenuation at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dust attenuation of galaxies is highly diverse and closely linked to stellar population properties and the star dust geometry, yet its relationship to galaxy morphology remains poorly understood. We present a study of 141 galaxies ($9&lt;\log(\rm M_{\star}/\rm M_{\odot})&lt;11.5$) at $1.7&lt;z&lt;3.5$ from the Blue Jay survey combining deep JWST/NIRCam imaging and $R\sim1000$ JWST/NIRSpec spectra. Using \texttt{Prospector} to perform a joint analysis of these data with non-parametric star-formation histories and a two-component dust model with flexible attenuation laws, we constrain stellar and nebular properties. We find that the shape and strength of the attenuation law vary systematically with optical dust attenuation ($A_V$), stellar mass, and star formation rate (SFR). $A_V$ correlates strongly with stellar mass for starbursts, star-forming galaxies and quiescent galaxies. The inclusion of morphological information tightens these correlations: attenuation correlates more strongly with stellar mass and SFR surface densities than with the global quantities. The Balmer decrement-derived nebular attenuation for 67 of these galaxies shows consistent trends with the stellar continuum attenuation. We detect a wavelength-dependent size gradient: massive galaxies ($\rm M_{\star}\gtrsim 10^{10}~M_{\odot}$) appear $\sim30\%$ larger in the rest-optical than in the rest-NIR, driven by central dust attenuation that flattens optical light profiles. Lower-mass systems exhibit more diverse size ratios, consistent with either inside-out growth or central starbursts. These results demonstrate that dust attenuation significantly alters observed galaxy structure and highlight the necessity of flexible attenuation models for accurate physical and morphological inference at cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>The Pristine Dwarf-Galaxy survey -- VI. A VLT/FLAMES spectroscopic study of the dwarf galaxy Bo\"otes II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Milky Way has a large population of dwarf galaxy satellites. Their properties are sensitive to both cosmology and the physical processes underlying galaxy formation, but these properties are still not properly characterized for the entire satellite population. We aim to provide the most accurate systemic dynamical and metallicity properties of the dwarf galaxy Bo\"otes II (Boo II). We use a new spectroscopic sample of 39 stars in the field of Boo II with data from the Fiber Large Array Multi Element Spectrograph (FLAMES) mounted on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The target selection is based on a combination of broadband photometry, proper motions from Gaia, and the metallicity-sensitive narrow-band photometry from the Pristine survey that is ideal for removing obvious Milky Way contaminants. We found 9 new members, including 5 also in the recent work of Bruce et al. (2023), and the farthest member to date (5.7 half-light radii from Boo II centroid), extending the spectroscopic spatial coverage of this system. Our metallicity measurements based on the Calcium triplet lines leads to the detection of the two first extremely metal-poor stars (EMPS, [Fe/H] &lt; -3.0) in Boo II. Combining this new dataset with literature data refines Boo II's velocity dispersion (5.6km/s), systemic velocity(-126.8 km/s) and shows that it does not show any sign of a significant velocity gradient. We are thus able to confirm the kinematic and metallicity properties of the satellite as well as identify new members for future high-resolution analyses.</description>

      <title>ALMA reveals bright circumgalactic emission and a biconical outflow in z~6.4 quasar PSOJ183+05</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding gas flows between galaxies and their surrounding circum-galactic medium (CGM) is crucial to unveil the mechanisms regulating galaxy evolution, especially in the early Universe. However, observations of the CGM around massive galaxies at z&gt;6 remain limited, particularly in the cold gas phase. In this work, we present multi-configuration ALMA observations of [CII]$\lambda158,\mu$m and millimetre continuum emission in the z~6.4 quasar PSOJ183+05, to trace the cold CGM and investigate the presence of outflows. We find clumpy [CII] emission, tracing gas up to a ~6 kpc radius, consistent with the interface region between the interstellar medium (ISM) and CGM. The [CII] kinematics shows a rotating disk and a high-velocity, biconical outflow extending up to 5 kpc. The inferred mass outflow rate is ~930 MSun/yr, among the highest at z&gt;6, and comparable to the star-formation rate. These findings suggest that quasar-driven outflows can rapidly transfer energy and momentum to the CGM, without immediately quenching star formation in the host galaxy ISM. This supports a delayed feedback scenario, in which outflows reshape CGM conditions and regulate future gas accretion over longer timescales. Combining high-resolution and sensitive ALMA data with observations from JWST and MUSE will be crucial to map the CGM across its different phases and build a comprehensive picture of the baryon cycle in the first massive galaxies.</description>

      <title>Rendezvous in CAVITY: Kinematics and gas properties of an isolated dwarf-dwarf merging pair in a cosmic void region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers are pivotal events in the evolutionary history of galaxies, with their impact believed to be particularly significant in dwarf galaxies. We report the serendipitous identification of an isolated merging dwarf system with a total stellar mass of M$_{\rm \star}$$\sim$10$^{9.7}$M$_{\rm \odot}$, located in the centre of a cosmic void. This system is one of the rare examples, and possibly the first, of merging dwarf galaxy pairs studied within the central region of a cosmic void. Using CAVITY PPAK-IFU data combined with deep optical broadband imaging from the Isaac Newton Telescope, we analysed the kinematics and ionized gas properties of each dwarf galaxy in the system by employing a full spectral fitting technique. The orientation of this merging pair relative to the line of sight allowed us to determine the dynamical mass of each component, showing that both had similar dynamical masses within galactocentric distances of up to 2.9 kpc. While the gas-phase metallicity of both components is consistent with that of star-forming dwarf galaxies, the star formation rates observed in both components exceed those typically reported for equally massive star-forming dwarf galaxies. This indicates that the merger has presumably contributed to enhancing star formation. Furthermore, we found no significant difference in the optical g-r colour of this merging pair compared to other merging dwarf pairs across different environments. While most merging events occur in group-like environments with high galaxy density and the tidal influence of a host halo, and isolated mergers typically involve galaxies with significant mass differences, the identified merging pair does not follow these patterns. We speculate that the global dynamics of the void or past three-body encounters involving components of this pair and a nearby dwarf galaxy might have triggered this merging event.</description>

      <title>Traversing the Star-Forming Main Sequence with Molecular Gas Stacks of z~1.6 Cluster Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cluster environment has been shown to affect the molecular gas content of cluster members, yet a complete understanding of this often subtle effect has been hindered due to a lack of detections over the full parameter space of galaxy star formation rates and stellar masses. Here we stack CO(2-1) spectra of z~1.6 cluster galaxies to explore the average molecular gas fractions of galaxies both at lower mass (log(M/solar mass)~9.6) and further below the Star Forming Main Sequence (SFMS; DeltaMS~ -0.9) than other literature studies; this translates to a 3sigma gas mass limit of ~7x10^9 solar masses for stacked galaxies below the SFMS. We divide our sample of 54 z~1.6 cluster galaxies, derived from the Spitzer Adaptation of the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey, into 9 groupings, for which we recover detections in 8. The average gas content of the full cluster galaxy population is similar to coeval field galaxies matched in stellar mass and star formation rate. However, when further split by CO-undetected and CO-detected, we find that galaxies below the SFMS have statistically different gas fractions from the field scaling relations, spanning deficiencies to enhancements from 2sigma below to 3sigma above the expected field gas fractions, respectively. These differences between z=1.6 cluster and field galaxies below the SFMS are likely due to environmental processes, though further investigation of spatially-resolved properties and more robust field scaling relation calibration in this parameter space are required.</description>

      <title>A positive correlation between broad HI Ly$\alpha$ absorptions and local overdensities of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large fraction of the baryon budget at $z&lt;1$ resides in large-scale filaments in the form of diffuse intergalactic gas, and numerous studies have reported a significant correlation between the strength of the absorptions produced by this gas in the spectra of bright background sources, and impact parameter to cosmic filaments intersected by these sightlines. However, a similar relation is harder to determine for the warm-hot phase of the intergalactic gas, since its higher Doppler parameter and significantly lower neutral gas fraction makes this gas difficult to detect in absorption. We use a sample of 13 broad Ly$\alpha$ absorbers (BLAs) detected in the HST/COS spectrum of a single QSO ($z\sim0.27$), whose sightline intersects several inter-cluster axes, to study the relation between BLAs and the large-scale structure of the Universe. Given their Doppler parameters of $b&gt;40$ km s$^{-1}$, BLAs are good tracers of warm-hot intergalactic gas. We use VLT/MUSE and VLT/VIMOS data to infer local overdensities of galaxies at the redshifts of the BLAs, and to assess the potential association of the BLAs with nearby galaxies. We find that out of the 13 BLAs in our sample, four are associated with a strong overdensity of galaxies, and four with tentative overdensities. The remaining five are located at redshifts where we do not identify any excess of galaxies. We find that these overdensities of galaxies at the redshift of BLAs are local, and they vanish when larger cosmic volumes are considered, in terms of a larger velocity offset to the BLA or larger impact parameter to the QSO sightline. Finally, we find a positive correlation between the total hydrogen column densities inferred from the BLAs, and the relative excess of galaxies at the same redshifts, consistent with the picture where warm-hot gas resides deep within the gravitational potential well of cosmic filaments.</description>

      <title>Generating Dark Matter Subhalo Populations Using Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for probing the nature of dark matter, as lensing signals are sensitive to the dark matter substructure within the lensing galaxy. We present a comparative analysis of strong gravitational lensing signatures generated by dark matter subhalo populations using two different approaches. The first approach models subhalos using an empirical model, while the second employs the Galacticus semi-analytic model of subhalo evolution. To date, only empirical approaches have been practical in the analysis of lensing systems, as incorporating fully physical models was computationally infeasible. To circumvent this, we utilize a generative machine learning algorithm, known as a normalizing flow, to learn and reproduce the subhalo populations generated by Galacticus. We demonstrate that the normalizing flow algorithm accurately reproduces the Galacticus subhalo distribution while significantly reducing computation time compared to direct simulation. Moreover, we find that subhalo populations from Galacticus produce comparable results to the empirical model in replicating observed lensing signals under the fiducial dark matter model. This work highlights the potential of machine learning techniques in accelerating astrophysical simulations and improving model comparisons of dark matter properties.</description>

      <title>A characteristic optical variability time scale in jetted active galactic nuclei: a large gamma-ray emission sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variability mechanisms from jetted AGNs are still under debate. Here the damped random walk (DRW) model, implemented through Gaussian Processe (GPs), is used to fit the $ZTF$ long-term optical light curves of 1684 $\gamma$-ray emission jetted AGNs. This analysis yields one of the largest samples with characteristic optical variability timescales for jetted AGNs. A single DRW model from GPs can fit the optical light curve of most jetted AGNs well/potentially well, while there are still some jetted AGNs whose light curve can not be fitted well by a single DRW model. After the jet power, proxied by gamma-ray luminosity, is introduced as a new parameter, new relationships among intrinsic variability time scales, black hole mass and jet power are discovered for efficient accretion AGNs ($\tau^{\rm in} \propto M_{\rm BH}^{0.29^{+0.06}_{-0.06}}P_{\rm jet}^{-0.3^{+0.03}_{-0.03}}$ with scatter of approximately 0.09~dex) and for inefficient accretion AGNs ($\tau^{\rm in} \propto M_{\rm BH}^{0.06^{+0.07}_{-0.07}}P_{\rm jet}^{0.37^{+0.11}_{-0.11}}$ with scatter of approximately 0.14~dex), respectively. Our results support that the optical variability of jetted AGNs with efficient accretion may originate within the standard accretion disk at UV emitting radii similar to non-jetted AGNs, and is directly related to the acceleration of shock in the jet and then enhanced through the beaming effect in beamed AGNs. For the jetted AGNs with inefficient accretion, the intrinsic timescale is consistent with the escape timescale of electrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of large-scale structure, galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) can be probed by upcoming Line Intensity Mapping (LIM) experiments, which sample in redshift and direction without needing to resolve individual galaxies. We predict the intensity and sources of hydrogen H$\alpha$ emission, dominated by radiative recombination following ionization by UV from the same massive stars that caused reionization, down to redshift 4.6, using the largest fully-coupled, radiation-hydro simulation of galaxy formation and reionization to date, Cosmic Dawn (CoDa) III. We compute the mean intensity and Voxel Intensity Distribution (VID) vs. redshift, including the relative contributions of galaxies and IGM. This will provide mock data to guide and interpret LIM experiments such as NASA's SPHEREx and proposed Cosmic Dawn Intensity Mapper (CDIM).</description>

      <title>Density Profiles of TNG300 Voids across Cosmic Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present radial density profiles, as traced by luminous galaxies and dark matter particles, for voids in eleven snapshots of the \texttt{TNG300} simulation. The snapshots span 11.65~Gyr of cosmic time, corresponding to the redshift range $0 \le z \le 3$. Using the comoving galaxy fields, voids were identified via a well-tested, watershed transformation-based algorithm. Voids were defined to be underdense regions that are unlikely to have arisen from Poisson noise, resulting in the selection of $\sim100-200$ of the largest underdense regions in each snapshot. At all redshifts, the radial density profiles as traced by both the galaxies and the dark matter resemble inverse top-hat functions. However, details of the functions (particularly the underdensities of the innermost regions and the overdensities of the ridges) evolve considerably more for the dark matter density profiles than for the galaxy density profiles. At all redshifts, a linear relationship between the galaxy and dark matter density profiles exists, and the slope of the relationship is similar to the bias estimates for \texttt{TNG300} snapshots. Lastly, we identify distinct environments in which voids can exist, defining ``void-in-void" and ``void-in-cloud" populations (i.e., voids that reside in larger underdense or overdense regions, respectively) and we investigate ways in which the relative densities of dark matter and galaxies in the interiors and ridges of these structures vary as a function of void environment.</description>

      <title>A Massive Gas Outflow Outside the Line-of-Sight: Imaging Polarimetry of the Blue Excess Hot Dust Obscured Galaxy W0204-0506</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Aims) Hot Dust Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs) are a population of hyper-luminous, heavily obscured quasars. Although nuclear obscurations close to Compton-thick are typical, a fraction show blue UV spectral energy distributions consistent with unobscured quasar activity, albeit two orders of magnitude fainter than expected from their mid-IR luminosity. The origin of the UV emission in these Blue excess Hot DOGs (BHDs) has been linked to scattered light from the central engine. Here we study the properties of the UV emission in the BHD WISE J020446.13-050640.8 (W0204-0506). (Methods) We use imaging polarization observations in the $R_{\rm Special}$ band obtained with the FORS2 instrument at VLT. We compare these data with radiative transfer simulations to constrain the characteristics of the scattering material. (Results) We find a spatially integrated polarization fraction of $24.7\pm 0.7$%, confirming the scattered-light nature of the UV emission of W0204-0506. The source is spatially resolved in the observations and we find a gradient in polarization fraction and angle that is aligned with the extended morphology of the source found in HST/WFC3 imaging. A dusty, conical polar outflow starting at the AGN sublimation radius with a half-opening angle $\lesssim 50~\rm deg$ viewed at an inclination $\gtrsim 45~\rm deg$ can reproduce the observed polarization fraction if the dust is graphite-rich. We find that the gas mass and outflow velocity are consistent with the range of values found for [OIII] outflows through spectroscopy in other Hot DOGs, though it is unclear whether the outflow is energetic enough to affect the long-term evolution of the host galaxy. Our study highlights the unique potential for polarization imaging to study dusty quasar outflows, providing complementary constraints to those obtained through traditional spectroscopic studies.</description>

      <title>Infrared and X-ray emission of a supernova remnant in a clumpy medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The infrared (IR) to X-ray luminosity ratio (IRX) is an indicator of the role of the dust plays in cooling of hot gas in supernova remnants (SNR). Using the 3D dynamics of gas and interstellar polydisperse dust grains we analyze the evolution of SNR in the inhomogeneous medium. We obtain spatial distributions of the surface brigthness both of the X-ray emission from hot gas inside SNR and the IR emission from the SNR swept-up shell, as well as, the average gas temperature in the SNR, $T_X$. We find that the IRX changes significantly (by a factor of $\sim 3-30$) as a function of impact distance within the SNR and its age. In a low inhomogeneous medium the IRX drops rapidly during the SNR evolution. On the other hand, if large inhomogeneities are present in the medium, the IRX is maintained at higher levels during the late SNR evolution at radiative phase due to replenishment of dust in the hot gas by incompletely destroyed fragments behind the shock front. We show that the onset of the radiative phase determines the evolution of the $T_X - {\rm IRX}$ diagram. We illustrate that decreasing gas metallicity or density leads to high values of temperature and IRX ratio. We discuss how our results can be applied to the observational data to analyse the SNR older than 10 kyr (i.e. when the mass of the swept-up dust in the shell is expected to exceed that produced in the SNR) in the Galaxy and Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <title>Are Kronberger 80 and/or Kronberger 82 regions PeVatron candidates for LHAASO J2108+5157?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy gamma rays have been detected in the region of LHAASO~J2108+5157 by the Fermi--LAT, HAWC and LHAASO-KM2A observatories. Cygnus~OB2 in Cygnus--X has been confirmed as the first strong stellar cluster PeVatron in our Galaxy. Thus, the star--forming regions Kronberger~80 and Kronberger~82, located in the field of LHAASO~J2108+5157, are analyzed to evaluate their stellar population and potential as associated PeVatron candidates. A distance of 10~kpc is adopted for Kronberger~80, while $\sim$1.6~kpc is estimated for Kronberger~82. Based on stellar densities, we report that their cluster radii are 2.5$\arcmin$ and 2.0$\arcmin$, while IR photometry reveals poor stellar content in massive O-type stars in both cases. From optical data, the estimation of cluster ages are 5--12.6~Myr and $\lesssim$ 5~Myr, respectively. We conclude that, in contrast to the stellar content of Cygnus~OB2, it is unlikely that Kronberger~80 and Kronberger~82 are PeVatrons associated with LHAASO~J2108+5157. The presence of a PeVatron in this region remains a mystery, but we confirm that the two Kronberger regions are star--forming regions undergoing formation rather than evolution.</description>

Abstract: Using $10,\!080^3$ grid simulations, we analyze scale-dependent alignment in driven, compressible, no net-flux magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The plasma self-organizes into localized, strongly aligned regions. Alignment spans all primitive variables and their curls. Contrary to incompressible theory, velocity-magnetic alignment scales as $\theta(\lambda) \sim \lambda^{1/8}$, where $\lambda$ is the scale, suggesting a distinct three-dimensional eddy anisotropy and a much higher critical transition scale toward a reconnection-mediated cascade.</description>

      <title>Diffuse X-ray emission in M51: a hierarchical Bayesian spatially-resolved spectral analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray observations can be used to effectively probe the galactic ecosystem, particularly its hot and energetic components. However, existing X-ray studies of nearby star-forming galaxies are limited by insufficient data statistics and a lack of suitable spectral modeling to account for X-ray emission and absorption geometry. We present results from an X-ray spectral study of M51 using 1.3-Ms Chandra data, the most extensive for such a galaxy. This allows the extraction of diffuse X-ray emission spectra from spiral arm phase-dependent regions using a logarithmic spiral coordinate system. A hierarchical Bayesian approach analyzes these spectra, testing models from simple 1-T hot plasma to those including distributed hot plasma and X-ray-absorbing cool gas. We recommend a model fitting the spectra well, featuring a galactic corona with a lognormal temperature distribution and a disk with mixed X-ray emissions and absorption. In this model, only half of the coronal emission is subject to internal absorption. The best-fit absorbing gas column density is roughly twice that inferred from optical extinction of stellar light. The temperature distribution shows a mean temperature of $\sim 0.1$ keV and an average one-dex dispersion that is enhanced on the spiral arms. The corona's radiative cooling might balance the mechanical energy input from stellar feedback. These results highlight the effectiveness of X-ray mapping of the corona and cool gas in spiral galaxies.</description>

      <title>3D Maser polarization simulation for J=1-0 SiO masers in the circumstellar envelope of an AGB star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SiO masers from AGB stars exhibit variability in intensity and polarization during a pulsation period. This variability is explained by radiative transfer and magnetic properties of the molecule. To investigate this phenomenon, a 3D maser simulation is employed to study the SiO masers based on Zeeman splitting. We demonstrate that the magnetic field direction affects maser polarization within small tubular domains with isotropic pumping, and yields results that are similar to those obtained from 1D modelling. This work also studies larger clouds with different shapes. We use finite-element domains with internal node distributions to represent the maser-supporting clouds. We calculate solutions for the population inversions in all transitions and at every node. These solutions show that saturation begins near the middle of a domain, moving towards the edges and particularly the ends of long axes, as saturation progresses, influencing polarization. When the observer's view of the domain changes, the plane of linear polarization responds to the projected shape and the projected magnetic field axis. The angle between the observer's line of sight and the magnetic field may cause jumps in the plane of polarization. Therefore, we can conclude that polarization is influenced by both the cloud's major axis orientation and magnetic field direction. We have investigated the possibility of explaining observed polarization plane rotations, apparently within a single cloud, by the mechanism of line-of-sight overlap of two magnetized maser clouds.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray neutrons in magnetized astrophysical structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays are often modeled as charged particles. This allows their non-ballistic propagation in magnetized structures to be captured. In certain situations, a neutral cosmic ray component can arise. For example, cosmic ray neutrons are produced in considerable numbers through hadronic pp and p$\gamma$ interactions. At ultrahigh energies, the decay timescales of these neutrons is dilated, allowing them to traverse distances on the scale of galactic and cosmological structures. Unlike charged cosmic rays, neutrons are not deflected by magnetic fields. They propagate ballistically at the speed of light in straight lines. The presence of a neutral baryonic cosmic ray component formed in galaxies, clusters and cosmological filaments can facilitate the escape and leakage of cosmic rays from magnetic structures that would otherwise confine them. We show that, by allowing confinement breaking, the formation of cosmic-ray neutrons by high-energy hadronic interactions in large scale astrophysical structures can modify the exchange of ultra high-energy particles across magnetic interfaces between galaxies, clusters, cosmological filaments and voids.</description>

      <title>Modeling Tidal Disruptions with Dynamical Tides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when stars pass close enough to supermassive black holes to be torn apart by tidal forces. Traditionally, these events are studied with computationally intensive hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we present a fast, physically motivated two-stage model for TDEs. In the first stage, we model the star's tidal deformation using linear stellar perturbation theory, treating the star as a collection of driven harmonic oscillators. When the tidal energy exceeds a fraction $\gamma$ of the star's gravitational binding energy (with $\gamma \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$), we transition to the second stage, where we model the disrupted material as free particles. The parameter $\gamma$ is determined with a one-time calibration to hydrodynamical simulations. This method enables fast computation of the energy distribution $\mathrm{d}M/\mathrm{d}E$ and fallback rate $\mathrm{d}M/\mathrm{d}T$, while offering physical insight into the disruption process. We apply our model to MESA-generated profiles of middle-age main-sequence stars. Our code is available on GitHub.</description>

Abstract: Jets and disc winds play an important role in the evolution of protoplanetary discs and the formation of planetary systems. However, there is still a lack of observational data regarding the presence and parameters of outflows, especially for close young binaries. In this study, we aim to find the HH flow near the young sub-arcsecond binary DF Tau and explore its morphology. Narrow-band H$\alpha$ and H$_2$ 2.12 $\mu$m imaging and spectroscopic observations of DF Tau and its vicinity were performed. We have discovered several emission nebulae near the binary, which likely result from the interaction of gas outflow from the binary components with the surrounding medium. The outflow appears to occur both in the form of jets, generating numerous Herbig-Haro objects (HH 1266 flow), and as a weakly collimated wind responsible for the formation of the ring-like nebula around the binary and the rim of the cometary globule. We have found that the angle between the jet and the counter-jet is $168^\circ$ and discuss the complex morphology of the HH flow.</description>

      <title>How to make CLEAN variants faster? Using clustered components informed by the autocorrelation function</title>

Abstract: Deconvolution, imaging and calibration of data from radio interferometers is a challenging computational (inverse) problem. The upcoming generation of radio telescopes poses significant challenges to existing, and well proven data reduction pipelines due to the large data sizes expected from these experiments, and the high resolution and dynamic range. In this manuscript, we deal with the deconvolution problem. A variety of multiscalar variants to the classical CLEAN algorithm (the de-facto standard) have been proposed in the past, often outperforming CLEAN at the cost of significantly increasing numerical resources. In this work, we aim to combine some of these ideas for a new algorithm, Autocorr-CLEAN, to accelerate the deconvolution and prepare the data reduction pipelines for the data sizes expected by the upcoming generation of instruments. To this end, we propose to use a cluster of CLEAN components fitted to the autocorrelation function of the residual in a subminor loop, to derive continuously changing, and potentially non-radially symmetric, basis functions for CLEANing the residual. Autocorr-CLEAN allows for the superior reconstruction fidelity achieved by modern multiscalar approaches, and their superior convergence speed. It achieves this without utilizing any substep of super-linear complexity in the minor loops, keeping the single minor loop and subminor loop iterations at an execution time comparable to CLEAN. Combining these advantages, Autocorr-CLEAN is found to be up to a magnitude faster than the classical CLEAN procedure. Autocorr-CLEAN fits well in the algorithmic framework common for radio interferometry, making it relatively straightforward to include in future data reduction pipelines. With its accelerated convergence speed, and smaller residual, Autocorr-CLEAN may be an important asset for the data analysis in the future.</description>

Abstract: In spherical symmetry, the gravitational potential is uniquely determined by the rotational velocity profile. Numerous galaxies exhibit a universal velocity profile from which a universal gravitational profile is inferred. When treating dark matter as either an ideal gas, a Fermi gas, or a Bose gas, only the latter can produce a gravitational profile consistent with observations, along with a temperature profile that decreases outward. This requires the mass of the boson to be below a certain threshold of $43\mbox{ eV}/c^2$. Additionally, ensuring that the speed of sound is less than the speed of light yields a lower bound on the boson's mass.</description>

      <title>The Abundance and Properties of Barred Galaxies out to $z \sim$ 4 Using $\textit{JWST}$ CEERS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first estimate of the observed fraction and properties of bars out to $ z\sim4$ using $\textit{JWST}$ CEERS NIRCam images. We analyze 1770 galaxies with $M_\star &gt; 10^{10} M_\odot$ at $0.5 \leq z \leq 4$ and identify barred galaxies from 839 moderately inclined disk galaxies via ellipse fits and visual classification of both F200W and F444W images. Our results apply mainly to bars with projected semi-major axis $a_{\rm bar}$ $&gt; 1.5 $ kpc ($\sim$ 2 $\times$ PSF in F200W images) that can be robustly traced by ellipse fits. For such bars, the observed bar fraction at $z\sim$ 2-4 is low ($\lesssim 10\%$), and they appear to be emerging at least as early as $z\sim 4$. Our observed bar fraction is consistent with the bar fraction predicted by TNG50 simulations for large bars with $a_{\rm bar}$ $&gt; 1.5$ kpc at $z \sim$ 0.5-4 and with the bar fraction from Auriga simulations out to $z \sim$ 1.5. However, TNG50 simulations predict a large population of smaller bars that our data cannot robustly detect. If such bars exist, the true bar fraction at $z \sim$ 2-4 may be significantly higher than our results. At $z \ge 1.5$, many barred galaxies show nearby neighbors, suggesting bars may be tidally triggered. From $z \sim$ 4-0.5, the observed bar fraction, average projected bar length, and projected bar strength rise. Our results highlight the early emergence and evolution of barred galaxies and the rising importance of bar-driven secular evolution from $z \sim$4 to today.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way and M31 Orbital History: Did the Local Group evolve in isolation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use new measurements of the M31 proper motion to examine the Milky Way (MW) - M31 orbit and angular momentum. For Local Group (LG) mass consistent with measured values, and assuming the system evolves in isolation, we show a wide range of orbits is possible. We compare to a sample of LG-like systems in the Illustris simulation and find that $\sim 13\%$ of these pairs have undergone a pericentric passage. Using the simulated sample, we examine how accurately an isolated, two-body model describes the MW-M31 orbit, and show that $\sim 10\%$ of the analogues in the simulation are well-modeled by such an orbit. Systems that evolve in isolation by this definition are found to have a lower rate of major mergers and, in particular, have no major mergers since $z \approx 0.3$. For all systems, we find an increase in the orbital angular momentum, which is fairly independent of the merger rate and is possibly explained by the influence of tidal torques on the LG. Given the likely quiet recent major merger history of the MW, it is plausible that the isolated two-body model appropriately describes the orbit, though recent evidence for a major merger in M31 may complicate this interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of morphological classification of galaxies from the Galaxy Zoo DECaLS dataset using classical machine learning techniques. Our approach employs a dimensionality reduction method followed by a classical classifier to categorize galaxies based on shape (cigar/in-between/round; edge-on/face-on) and texture (smooth/featured). We evaluate various dimensionality reduction methods, including Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), Isomap, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), t-SNE, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Our results demonstrate that most classical classifiers achieve their highest performance when combined with LLE, attaining accuracy comparable to that of simple neural networks. Moreover, in the case of shape classification, the three-dimensional representation remains interpretable, in contrast to the commonly observed loss of interpretability following nonlinear transformations. Additionally, we explore dimensionality reduction followed by k-means clustering to assess whether the data exhibits a natural tendency toward a specific number of clusters. We evaluate clustering performance using silhouette, elbow, Dunn, and Davies-Bouldin scores. While the Davies-Bouldin score indicates a slight preference for four clusters (closely aligning with classifications made by human astronomers) the other metrics do not support a distinct clustering structure.</description>

      <title>On the origin of compressive turbulence in protoclumps in high redshift disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The giant, star forming clumps in gas-rich, high redshift disks are commonly assumed to form due to gravitational instabilities, in which protoclumps have a Toomre-$Q$ parameter less than unity. However, some cosmological simulations show that clumps can form in regions where $Q\gg1$. In these simulations, there is an excess of compressive modes of turbulence that lead to gravitational collapse of regions that were not supposed to gravitationally collapse, according to linear theory. In contrast, sites of clump formation in isolated simulations do not show this excess, hinting that the origin may be external. We explore two external mechanisms that can induce compressive modes of disk turbulence in protoclumps, namely, compressive tides exerted by the cosmological environment and the direct driving by inflowing streams. We correlate the local strength of compressive tides and the amount of fresh stream material with protoclump regions in zoom-in cosmological simulations. The local strength of compressive tides is derived from the tidal tensor. The local strength of incoming streams is derived from the fractional presence of the stream compared to the average. We find that the tidal field in protoclumps tends to be over-compressive while random patches in the disk show diverging tides. In particular, in $25\%$ of the protoclumps, the tidal field is fully compressive, while no random patch resides in regions of fully compressive tides. In addition, protoclumps tend to reside in regions where the fraction of incoming stream mass is 2-10 times larger than the average at the same galactocentric radius. Both compressive tides and inflowing streams are correlated with the protoclumps and can thus serve as the drivers of excessive compressive turbulence that can initiate clump formation. This constitutes a new, non-linear mode of violent disk instabilities in high-$z$ galaxies.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory Line-Driven Winds: The Role of Atmospheric Stratification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-dependent numerical studies of line-driven winds using the Sobolev approximation have a history spanning over three decades. In many of these studies, the wind solutions display notorious oscillations. Two clues suggest the oscillations originate at the wind base: (i) simulations reach a steady state without oscillations when the base density is sufficiently low and (ii) the oscillation dominant frequency is comparable to the Lamb cut-off frequency, {\omega}c, of acoustic waves propagating in a stratified hydrostatic atmosphere. Recently, Dannen et al. observed another clue: when the line force significantly weakens due to ionization, the winds become increasingly sensitive to the self-excited oscillations. Here, we present a set of simulations and perturbation analyses that further elucidate the source and characteristics of oscillations. We found that the line force adds wave energy and amplifies perturbations with frequencies near {\omega}c. This selective amplification results from the coupling between the natural tendency of velocity perturbations to grow in a stratified atmosphere and from the line force dependence on the velocity gradient, per the Castor-Abbott-Klein line-driven wind theory. We also found that the variability stems from self-excitation that occurs in the exponential atmosphere due to the non-linearity introduced by the absolute value of the velocity gradient in the line force prescription. We conclude that self-consistently calculating ionization is insufficient for modeling the dynamics in the subsonic atmosphere. Instead, future wind or unified models should relax the Sobolev approximation, or model the radiative transfer to properly capture the resulting radiation-induced instabilities and dynamics at the wind base.</description>

      <title>Discovering Strong Gravitational Lenses in the Dark Energy Survey with Interactive Machine Learning and Crowd-sourced Inspection with Space Warps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a search for strong gravitational lenses in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 6 imaging data. We implement a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) for our machine learning (ML) architecture and adopt Interactive Machine Learning to construct a training sample with multiple classes to address common types of false positives. Our ML model reduces 236 million DES cutout images to 22,564 targets of interest, including around 85% of previously reported galaxy-galaxy lens candidates discovered in DES. These targets were visually inspected by citizen scientists, who ruled out approximately 90% as false positives. Of the remaining 2,618 candidates, 149 were expert-classified as 'definite' lenses and 516 as 'probable' lenses, with 147 of these candidates being newly identified. Additionally, we trained a second ViT to find double-source plane lens systems, finding at least one double-source system. Our main ViT excels at identifying galaxy-galaxy lenses, consistently assigning high scores to candidates with high confidence. The top 800 ViT-scored images include around 100 of our `definite' lens candidates. This selection is an order of magnitude higher in purity than previous convolutional neural network-based lens searches and demonstrates the feasibility of applying our methodology for discovering large samples of lenses in future surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of high redshift galaxy formation has been revolutionised by JWST, which is yielding unprecedented insights on galaxy assembly at early times. Our key aim is to study the physical mechanisms that can explain the unexpected abundance of bright galaxies at $z \geq 11$, as well as their metal enrichment and spectral properties. We also use recent data to determine the key sources of reionisation. To do so, we implement cold gas fractions and star formation efficiencies derived from the SPHINX20 high-resolution radiation-hydrodynamics simulation into DELPHI, a semi-analytic model that tracks the assembly of dark matter halos and their baryonic components from $z \sim 4.5-40$. In addition, we explore two different methodologies to boost galaxy luminosities at $z \geq 11$: a stellar initial mass function (IMF) that becomes increasingly top-heavy with decreasing metallicity and increasing redshift (eIMF model), and star formation efficiencies that increase with increasing redshift (eSFE model). Our key findings are: (i) both the eIMF and eSFE models can explain the abundance of bright galaxies at $z \geq 11$; (ii) dust attenuation plays an important role for the bright-end of the UV LF at $z \leq 11$; (iii) the mass-metallicity relation is in place as early as $z \sim 17$ in all models although its slope is model-dependent; (iv) within the spread of both models and observations, all of our models are in good agreement with current estimates of $\beta$ slopes at $z \sim 5-17$ and Balmer break strengths at $z \sim 6-10$; (v) in the eIMF model, galaxies at $z\geq12$ or with $\rm{M_{UV}}\geq-18$ show values of $\xi_{\rm{ion}} \sim 10^{25.55}~{\rm [Hz~erg^{-1}]}$, twice larger than in other models; (vi) star formation in galaxies below $10^{9}\rm{M_{\odot}}$ is the key driver of reionisation, providing the bulk ($\sim 85\%$) of ionising photons down to its midpoint at $z \sim 7$.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Particle Flux in a Dynamically Self-consistent Milky Way Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend a recently developed dynamically self-consistent model of the Milky Way constrained by observations from the Gaia observatory to include a radially anisotropic component in the dark matter (DM) halo, which represents the debris from the accreted Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) galaxy. In the new model, which we call a self-consistent Anisotropic Halo Model or scAHM, we derive distribution functions for DM velocity in heliocentric and geocentric reference frames. We compare them with the velocity distributions in the standard halo model (SHM) and another anisotropic model (SHM++). We compute predicted scattering rates in direct-detection experiments, for different target nuclei and DM particle masses. Seasonal dependencies of scattering rates are analyzed, revealing small but interesting variations in detection rates for different target nuclei and DM masses. Our findings show that the velocity distribution of the anisotropic GSE component significantly deviates from Gaussian, showing a modest impact on the detection rates. The peculiar kinematic signature of the radially anisotropic component would be most clearly observable by direction-sensitive detectors.</description>

      <title>Pixel-level modelling of group-scale strong lens CASSOWARY 19</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first high-precision model for the group-scale strong lensing system CASSOWARY 19 (CSWA19), utilising images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Sixteen member galaxies identified via the red-sequence method, and the main halo, all modelled as the dual Pseudo Isothermal Elliptical profile (dPIE), are incorporated into a parametric lens model alongside an external shear field. To model the system, we adopt the PyAutoLens software package, employing a progressive search chain strategy for realizing the transition of source model from multiple S\'ersic profiles to a brightness-adaptive pixelization, which uses 1000 pixels in the source plane to reconstruct the background source corresponding to 177,144 image pixels in the image plane. Our results indicate that the total mass within the Einstein radius is $M_{\theta_\mathrm{E}}$ $\approx 1.41\times10^{13}$M$_{\odot}$ and the average slope of the total mass density $\rho (r)\propto r^{-\gamma}$ is $\tilde{\gamma}=1.33$ within the effective radius. This slope is shallower than those measured in galaxies and groups but is closer to those of galaxy clusters. In addition, our approach successfully resolves the two merging galaxies in the background source and yields a total magnification of $\mu=103.18^{+0.23}_{-0.19}$, which is significantly higher than the outcomes from previous studies of CSWA19. In summary, our research demonstrates the effectiveness of the brightness-adaptive pixelization source reconstruction technique for modelling group-scale strong lensing systems.

      <title>Ultra-diffuse galaxies in the EAGLE simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the highest-resolution EAGLE simulation, Recal-L025N0752, to study the properties and formation of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). We identify 181 UDGs and find their properties closely match observations. The total masses of EAGLE UDGs range from ${\sim}5\times 10^{8}~M_{\odot}$ to ${\sim}2\times 10^{11}~M_{\odot}$, indicating that they are dwarf galaxies rather than failed $L_\star$ galaxies. EAGLE UDGs are not a distinct population, but rather a subset of dwarf galaxies, as their properties generally form a continuous distribution with those of normal dwarf galaxies. Unlike the situations in previous studies, the extended sizes of field UDGs in EAGLE are not driven by high halos spin or by supernova-induced stellar expansion, but instead largely arise from high spins in their star-forming gas and thus the newly formed stars at large radii. This might be attributed to galactic fountains, by which star-forming gas are launched to large halo-centric distances and acquire additional angular momentum through interactions with the circumgalactic medium. For satellite UDGs, ${\sim} 60 \%$ of them were already UDGs before falling into the host galaxy, while the remaining ${\sim} 40\%$ were normal galaxies prior to infall and subsequently transformed into UDGs due to tidal effects after infall.</description>

      <title>Searching for Compact Obscured Nuclei in Compton Thick AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact Obscured Nuclei (CONs) are heavily obscured infrared cores that have been found in local (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs). They show bright emission from vibrationally excited rotational transitions of HCN, known as HCN-vib, and are thought to harbor Compton Thick (CT, $N_{\text{H}} \geq 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) active galactic nuclei (AGN) or extreme compact starbursts. We explore the potential evolutionary link between CONs and CT AGN by searching for CONs in hard X-ray-confirmed CT AGN from the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS). Here, we present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 6 observations that targeted HCN-vib emission in four hard X-ray-confirmed CT AGN. We analyze these objects together with literature HCN-vib measurements of five additional hard X-ray-confirmed CT AGN from the GOALS sample. We do not detect any CONs in this combined sample of nine CT AGN. We then explore a proposed evolutionary sequence in which CONs evolve into X-ray-detectable CT AGN once outflows and feedback reduce the column densities of the enshrouding gas. We find, however, no evidence of well-developed dense molecular outflows in the observed CT AGN. While this could suggest that CT AGN are not universally linked to CONs, it could also be explained by a short duty cycle for molecular outflows.</description>

      <title>A Triple Scenario for the Formation of Wide Black Hole Binaries Such As Gaia BH1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, several non-interacting black hole-stellar binaries have been identified in Gaia data. For example, Gaia BH1, where a Sun-like star is in a moderate eccentricity (e=0.44), 185-day orbit around a black hole. This orbit is difficult to explain through binary evolution. The present-day separation suggests the progenitor system would have undergone an episode of common envelope evolution, but a common envelope should shrink the period below the observed one. Since the majority of massive stars form in higher multiplicity systems, a triple evolution scenario is more likely for the progenitors of BH binaries. Here we show that such systems can indeed be more easily explained via evolution in hierarchical triple systems. von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations or instabilities can delay the onset of the common envelope phase in the inner binary of the triple, so that the black hole progenitor and low-mass star are more widely separated when it begins, leading to the formation of wider binaries. There are also systems with similar periods but larger eccentricities, where the BH progenitor is a merger product of the inner binary in the triple. Such mergers lead to a more top-heavy black hole mass function.</description>

      <title>The Legacy of Henrietta Leavitt: A Re-analysis of the First Cepheid Period-Luminosity Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Henrietta Swan Leavitt's discovery of the relationship between the period and luminosity (hereafter the Leavitt Law) of 25 variable stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, published in 1912, revolutionized cosmology. These variables, eventually identified as Cepheids, became the first known "standard candles" for measuring extragalactic distances and remain the gold standard for this task today. Leavitt measured light curves, periods, and minimum and maximum magnitudes from painstaking visual inspection of photographic plates. Her work paved the way for the first precise series of distance measurements that helped set the scale of the Universe, and later the discovery of its expansion by Edwin Hubble in 1929. Here, we re-analyze Leavitt's first Period-Luminosity relation using observations of the same set of stars but with modern data and methods of Cepheid analysis. Using only data from Leavitt's notebooks, we assess the quality of her light curves, measured periods, and the slope and scatter of her Period-Luminosity relations. We show that modern data and methods, for the same objects, reduce the scatter of the Period-Luminosity relation by a factor of two. We also find a bias brightward at the short period end, due to the non-linearity of the plates and environmental crowding. Overall, Leavitt's results are in excellent agreement with contemporary measurements, reinforcing the value of Cepheids in cosmology today, a testament to the enduring quality of her work.</description>
