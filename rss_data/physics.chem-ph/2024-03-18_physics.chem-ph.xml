      <title>A Size-Consistent Multi-State Mapping Approach to Surface Hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a multi-state generalisation of the recently proposed mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH) for the simulation of electronically nonadiabatic dynamics. This new approach extends the original MASH method to be able to treat systems with more than two electronic states. It differs from previous approaches in that it is size consistent and rigorously recovers the original two-state MASH in appropriate limits. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method by application to a series of model systems for which exact benchmark results are available, and find that the method is well suited to the simulation of photochemical relaxation processes.</description>

      <title>Good rates from bad coordinates: the exponential average time-dependent rate approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our ability to calculate rates of biochemical processes using molecular dynamics simulations is severely limited by the fact that the time scales for reactions, or changes in conformational state, scale exponentially with the relevant free-energy barriers. In this work, we improve upon a recently proposed rate estimator that allows us to predict transition times with molecular dynamics simulations biased to rapidly explore one or several collective variables. This approach relies on the idea that not all bias goes into promoting transitions, and along with the rate, it estimates a concomitant scale factor for the bias termed the collective variable biasing efficiency $\gamma$. First, we demonstrate mathematically that our new formulation allows us to derive the commonly used Infrequent Metadynamics (iMetaD) estimator when using a perfect collective variable, $\gamma=1$. After testing it on a model potential, we then study the unfolding behavior of a previously well characterized coarse-grained protein, which is sufficiently complex that we can choose many different collective variables to bias, but which is sufficiently simple that we are able to compute the unbiased rate dire ctly. For this system, we demonstrate that our new Exponential Average Time-Dependent Rate (EATR) estimator converges to the true rate more rapidly as a function of bias deposition time than does the previous iMetaD approach, even for bias deposition times that are short. We also show that the $\gamma$ parameter can serve as a good metric for assessing the quality of the biasing coordinate. Finally, we demonstrate that the approach works when combining multiple less-than-optimal bias coordinates.</description>

      <title>The average bond-length of diatomic molecules in thermodynamical equilibrium depends on the volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of classical statistical mechanics and assuming the electronic ground-state Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we show in this work that a dependence of the equilibrium bond-length on the available volume is to be expected for a dilute gas of diatomic molecules. In a nutshell, this dependence is controlled by the relation between the potential well depth $D$ (through the factor $e^{-\beta D}$) and the quotient $L/R$ of the linear size of the container $L$ and the potential well width $R$. Using simplified analytical estimations, we predict that the equilibrium bond-length $\langle \rho \rangle$ is independent of $L$ for a range of volumes which is exponentially large on $\beta D$. At some point of the $L$ axis, $\langle \rho \rangle$ starts to increase and it eventually diverges, as it is to be expected, when $L \to \infty$, thus describing dissociated atoms. According to our estimations, it is possible that some diatomic molecules, such as halogens, could present volume dependence of their equilibrium bond-lengths for laboratory-size volumes at room temperature.</description>

      <title>A Fully Dynamical Description of Time-Resolved Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering of Pyrazine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in ultrashort and intense X-ray sources have enabled the utilisation of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) as a probing technique for monitoring photoinduced dynamics in molecular systems. To account for dynamic phenomena like non-adiabatic transitions across the entire electronic state manifold, a time-dependent framework is crucial. Here, we introduce a fully time-dependent approach for calculating transient RIXS spectra using wavepacket dynamics simulations, alongside an explicit treatment of the X-ray probe pulse that surpasses Kramers-Heisenberg-Dirac constraints. Our analysis of pyrazine at the nitrogen K-edge underscores the importance of considering motion effects in all electronic states involved in the transient RIXS process. As a result, we propose a numerically exact approach to computationally support and predict cutting-edge time-resolved RIXS experiments.</description>

      <title>Tell machine learning potentials what they are needed for: Simulation-oriented training exemplified for glycine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) are widely applied as an efficient alternative way to represent potential energy surface (PES) in many chemical simulations, e.g., geometry optimizations, frequency calculations, molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo computations. However, there is a growing realization that the evaluation of the reliability of MLPs cannot be reduced to the common metrics such as the mean absolute (MAE) or root-mean-square (RMSE) errors on the test set drawn from the same distribution as the training data. Here, we systematically investigate the relationship between such test errors and the accuracy of chemical simulations with MLPs on an example of a full-dimensional, global PES for the glycine amino acid, which is of great significance in both biology and astronomy. Our results show that, indeed, the errors in the test set do not unambiguously reflect the MLP performance in different simulation tasks such as relative conformer energies, barriers, vibrational levels, and zero-point vibrational energies. Importantly, we also offer a solution and an easily accessible tool to improve the fidelity of MLPs in a simulation-oriented manner. Guided by the loss function based on real simulation-oriented metrics, our solution ensures the quality of MLPs, ultimately yielding the most accurate one that can even obtain near-zero simulation errors in some tasks such as predicting relative conformer energies and barriers. Furthermore, this solution also passed the stringent test in the diffusion Monte Carlo simulations that confirmed the comprehensive description of the global PES by the resulting MLP.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Assessment of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Methods in Chemical Engineering Optimization Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter assesses the sensitivity of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods to modifications within the decision or objective matrix (DOM) in the context of chemical engineering optimization applications. Employing eight common or recent MCDM methods and three weighting methods, this study evaluates the impact of three specific DOM alterations: linear transformation of an objective (LTO), reciprocal objective reformulation (ROR), and the removal of alternatives (RA). Our comprehensive analysis reveals that the weights generated by entropy method are more sensitive to the examined modifications compared to the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC) and standard deviation (StDev) methods. ROR is found to have the largest effect on the ranking of alternatives. Moreover, certain methods, gray relational analysis (GRA) without any weights, multi-attributive border approximation area comparison (MABAC), combinative distance-based assessment (CODAS), and simple additive weighting (SAW) with entropy or CRITIC weights, and CODAS, SAW, and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) with StDev weight are more robust to DOM modifications. This investigation not only corroborates the findings from the previous study, but also offers insights into the stability and reliability of MCDM methods in the context of chemical engineering.</description>

      <title>Surface hopping molecular dynamics simulation of ultrafast methyl iodide photodissociation mapped by Coulomb explosion imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a highly efficient method to directly simulate the photodissociation followed by Coulomb explosion of methyl iodide. In order to achieve statistical reliability, more than 40,000 trajectories are calculated on accurate potential energy surfaces of both the neutral molecule and the doubly charged cation. Non-adiabatic effects during photodissociation are treated using a Landau-Zener surface hopping algorithm. The simulation is performed analogous to a recent pump-probe experiment using coincident ion momentum imaging [Ziaee \textit{et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.} 2023, \textbf{25}, 9999]. At large pump-probe delays, the simulated delay-dependent kinetic energy release signals show overall good agreement with the experiment, with two major dissociation channels leading to $\text{I}(^2\text{P}_{3/2})$ and $\text{I}^*(^2\text{P}_{1/2})$ products. At short pump-probe delays, the simulated kinetic energy release shows a clear bifurcation near 12 fs, owing to non-adiabatic transitions through a conical intersection. The developed method is particularly suitable and efficient in simulating processes that highly rely on statistics or for identifying rare reaction channels.</description>

      <title>Mechanical effects of carboxymethylcellulose binder in hard carbon electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrodes in sodium-ion batteries endure mechanical stress during production and application, which can damage these fragile coatings, causing performance inefficiencies and early failure. Binder material provides elasticity in electrode composites to resist fracture, but evaluating the effectiveness of binder is complicated by substrate dependency of these films, while conventional cell tests are beset by multiple electrochemical variables. This work introduces a practical low-cost indentation test to determine the elasticity of hard carbon electrodes containing standard carboxymethylcellulose binder. Using the proposed method, relative elastic moduli of hard carbon electrodes were found to be 0.079 GPa (1% binder), 0.088 GPa (2% binder), 0.105 GPa (3% binder) and 0.113 GPa (4% binder), which were validated using a computational model of film deflection to predict mechanical deformation under stress. Effects on the electrochemical performance of hard carbon anodes were also demonstrated with impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic cycling of sodium half-cells, revealing 8-9% higher capacity retention of anodes with 4% binder compared with those containing 1% binder. These findings suggest binder content in hard carbon electrodes should be selected according to requirements for both cycle life and film flexibility during cell manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Ion solvation in atomic baths: from snowballs to polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solvation, the result of the complicated interplay between solvent-solute and solvent-internal interactions, is one of the most important chemical processes. Consequently, a complete theoretical understanding of solvation seems a heroic task. However, it is possible to elucidate fundamental solvation mechanisms by looking into simpler systems, such as ion solvation in atomic baths. In this work, we study ion solvation by calculating the ground state properties of a single ion in a neutral bath from the high-density regime to the low-density regime, finding common ground for these two, in principle, disparate regimes. Our results indicate that a single $^{174}$Yb$^+$ ion in a bath of $^{7}$Li atoms forms a coordination complex at high densities with a coordination number of 8, with strong electrostriction, characteristic of the snowball effect. On the contrary, treating the atomic bath as a dilute quantum gas at low densities, we find that the ion-atom interaction's short-range plays a significant role in the physics of many-body bound states and polarons. Furthermore, in this regime, we explore the role of a putative ion trap, which drastically affects the binding mechanism of the ion and atoms from a quantum gas. Therefore, our results give a novel insight into the universality of ion-neutral systems in the ultracold regime and the possibilities of observing exotic many-body effects.</description>

      <title>Liquid-Liquid Crossover in Water Model: Local Structure vs. Kinetics of Hydrogen Bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In equilibrium and supercooled liquids, polymorphism is manifested by thermodynamic regions defined in the phase diagram, which are predominantly of different short- and medium-range order (local structure). It is found that on the phase diagram of the water model, the thermodynamic region corresponding to the equilibrium liquid phase is divided by a line of the smooth liquid-liquid crossover. In the case of the water model, this crossover is revealed by various local order parameters and corresponds to pressures of the order of $3\,150 \pm 350$ atm at ambient temperature. In the vicinity of the crossover, the dynamics of water molecules change significantly, which is reflected, in particular, in the fact that the self-diffusion coefficient reaches its maximum values. In addition, changes in the structure also manifest themselves in changes in the kinetics of hydrogen bonding, which is captured by values of such the quantities as the average lifetime of hydrogen bonding, the average lifetimes of different local coordination numbers, and the frequencies of changes in different local coordination numbers. An interpretation of the hydrogen bond kinetics in terms of the free energy landscape concept in the space of possible coordination numbers is proposed.</description>

      <title>Solvent-Aware 2D NMR Prediction: Leveraging Multi-Tasking Training and Iterative Self-Training Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy plays a pivotal role in various scientific fields, offering insights into structural information, electronic properties and dynamic behaviors of molecules. Accurate NMR spectrum prediction efficiently produces candidate molecules, enabling chemists to compare them with actual experimental spectra. This process aids in confirming molecular structures or pinpointing discrepancies, guiding further investigation. Machine Learning (ML) has then emerged as a promising alternative approach for predicting atomic NMR chemical shits of molecules given their structures. Although significant progresses have been made in predicting one-dimensional (1D) NMR, two-dimensional (2D) NMR prediction via ML remains a challenge due to the lack of annotated NMR training datasets. To address this gap, we propose an iterative self-training (IST) approach to train a deep learning model for predicting atomic 2DNMR shifts and assigning peaks in experimental spectra. Our model undergoes an initial pre-training phase employing a Multi-Task Training (MTT) approach, which simultaneously leverages annotated 1D NMR datasets of both $^{1}\text{H}$ and $^{13}\text{C}$ spectra to enhance its understanding of NMR spectra. Subsequently, the pre-trained model is utilized to generate pseudo-annotations for unlabelled 2D NMR spectra, which are subsequently used to refine the 2D NMR prediction model. Our approach iterates between annotated unlabelled 2D NMR data and refining our 2D NMR prediction model until convergence. Finally, our model is able to not only accurately predict 2D NMR but also annotate peaks in experimental 2D NMR spectra. Experimental results show that our model is capable of accurately handling medium-sized and large molecules, including polysaccharides, underscoring its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Replica Field Theory for a Generalized Franz--Parisi Potential of Inhomogeneous Glassy Systems: New Closure and the Associated Self-Consistent Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On approaching the dynamical transition temperature, supercooled liquids show heterogeneity over space and time. Static replica theory investigates the dynamical crossover in terms of the free energy landscape (FEL). Two kinds of static approaches have provided a self-consistent equation for determining this crossover, similar to the mode coupling theory for glassy dynamics. One uses the Morita-Hiroike formalism of the liquid state theory, whereas the other relies on the density functional theory (DFT). Each of the two approaches has advantages in terms of perturbative field theory. Here, we develop a replica field theory that has the benefits from both formulations. We introduce the generalized Franz-Parisi potential to formulate a correlation functional. Considering fluctuations around an inhomogeneous density determined by the Ramakrishnan--Yussouf DFT, we find a new closure as the stability condition of the correlation functional. The closure leads to the self-consistent equation involving the triplet direct correlation function. The present field theory further helps us study the FEL beyond the mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of laser cooling transitions in MgF</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the complete set of transition frequencies necessary to laser cool and trap MgF molecules. Specifically, we report the frequency of multiple low $J$ transitions of the $X^2\Sigma^+(v^{\prime\prime}=0,1) \rightarrow A^2\Pi_{1/2}(v^\prime=0)$, $X^2\Sigma^+(v^{\prime\prime}=1,2) \rightarrow A^2\Pi_{1/2}(v^\prime=1)$, and $X^2\Sigma^+(v^{\prime\prime}=1) \rightarrow B^2\Sigma^+(v^{\prime}=0)$ bands of MgF. The measured $X^2\Sigma^+(v^{\prime\prime}=1)\rightarrow B^2\Sigma^+(v^\prime=0)$ spectrum allowed the spin-rotation and hyperfine parameters of the $B^2\Sigma^+(v=0)$ state of MgF to be determined. Furthermore, we demonstrate optical cycling in MgF by pumping molecules into the $X^2\Sigma^+(v=1,2)$ states. Optical pumping enhances the spectroscopic signals of transitions originating in the $N^{\prime\prime}=1$ level of the $X^2\Sigma^+(v^{\prime\prime}=1,2)$ states.</description>

      <title>Kelvin equation for bridging transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study bridging transitions between a pair of non-planar surfaces. We show that the transition can be described using a generalized Kelvin equation by mapping the system to a slit of finite length. The proposed equation is applied to analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the growth of the bridging film, which occurs when the confining walls are gradually flattened. This phenomenon is characterized by a power-law divergence with geometry-dependent critical exponents that we determine for a wide class of walls' geometries. In particular, for a linear-wedge model, a covariance law revealing a relation between a geometric and Young's contact angle is presented. These predictions are shown to be fully in line with the numerical results obtained from a microscopic (classical) density functional theory.</description>

Abstract: The implementation of an efficient self-consistent field (SCF) method including both scalar relativistic effects and spin-orbit interaction in density functional theory (DFT) is presented. We make use of Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) and all integrals are evaluated in real space. Our implementation supports density functional approximations up to the level of meta-generalized gradient approximations (mGGAs) for SCF energies and gradients. The latter can be used to compute the stress tensor and consequently allow us to optimize the cell structure. Considering spin-orbit interaction requires the extension of the standard procedures to a two-component (2c) formalism and a non-collinear approach for open-shell systems. Here, we implemented both the canonical and the Scalmani-Frisch non-collinear DFT formalisms, with hybrid and range-separated hybrid functionals being presently restricted to SCF energies. We demonstrate both efficiency and relevance of spin-orbit effects for the electronic structure of discrete systems and systems periodic in one to three dimensions.</description>

      <title>MUBen: Benchmarking the Uncertainty of Molecular Representation Models</title>

Abstract: Large molecular representation models pre-trained on massive unlabeled data have shown great success in predicting molecular properties. However, these models may tend to overfit the fine-tuning data, resulting in over-confident predictions on test data that fall outside of the training distribution. To address this issue, uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods can be used to improve the models' calibration of predictions. Although many UQ approaches exist, not all of them lead to improved performance. While some studies have included UQ to improve molecular pre-trained models, the process of selecting suitable backbone and UQ methods for reliable molecular uncertainty estimation remains underexplored. To address this gap, we present MUBen, which evaluates different UQ methods for state-of-the-art backbone molecular representation models to investigate their capabilities. By fine-tuning various backbones using different molecular descriptors as inputs with UQ methods from different categories, we critically assess the influence of architectural decisions and training strategies. Our study offers insights for selecting UQ for backbone models, which can facilitate research on uncertainty-critical applications in fields such as materials science and drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Translational eigenstates of He@C$_{60}$ from four-dimensional \textit{ab initio} Potential Energy Surfaces interpolated using Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the endofullerene system $^3$He@C$_{60}$ with a four-dimensional Potential Energy Surface (PES) to include the three He translational degrees of freedom and C$_{60}$ cage radius. We compare MP2, SCS-MP2, SOS-MP2, RPA@PBE and C(HF)-RPA to calibrate and gain confidence in the choice of electronic structure method. Due to the high cost of these calculations, the PES is interpolated using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), owing to its effectiveness with sparse training data. The PES is split into a two-dimensional radial surface, to which corrections are applied to achieve an overall four-dimensional surface. The nuclear Hamiltonian is diagonalised to generate the in-cage translational/vibrational eigenstates. The degeneracy of the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator energies with principal quantum number $n$ is lifted due to the anharmonicity in the radial potential. The $(2l+1)$-fold degeneracy of the angular momentum states is also weakly lifted, due to the angular dependence in the potential. We calculate the fundamental frequency to range between 96cm$^{-1}$ and 110cm$^{-1}$ depending on the electronic structure method used. Error bars of the eigenstate energies were calculated from the GPR and are on the order of approximately $\pm$ 1.5cm$^{-1}$. Wavefunctions are also compared by considering their overlap and Hellinger distance to the one-dimensional empirical potential. As with the energies, the two \textit{ab initio} methods MP2 and RPA@PBE show the best agreement. While MP2 has better agreement than RPA@PBE, due to its higher computational efficiency and comparable performance, we recommend RPA as an alternative electronic structure method of choice to MP2 for these systems.</description>

      <title>Analytic Nuclear Gradients for Complete Active Space Linearized Pair-Density Functional Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12933v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately modeling photochemical reactions is difficult due to the presence of conical intersections and locally avoided crossings as well as the inherently multiconfigurational character of excited states. As such, one needs a multi-state method that incorporates state interaction in order to accurately model the potential energy surface at all nuclear coordinates. The recently developed linearized pair-density functional theory (L-PDFT) is a multi-state extension of multiconfiguration PDFT, and it has been shown to be a cost-effective post-MCSCF method (as compared to more traditional and expensive multireference many-body perturbation methods or multireference configuration interaction methods) that can accurately model potential energy surfaces in regions of strong nuclear-electronic coupling in addition to accurately predicting Franck-Condon vertical excitations. In this paper, we report the derivation of analytic gradients for L-PDFT and their implementation in the PySCF-forge software, and we illustrate the utility of these gradients for predicting ground- and excited-state equilibrium geometries and adiabatic excitation energies for formaldehyde, s-trans-butadiene, phenol, and cytosine.</description>

      <title>Mixing due to Solution-switch Limits the Performance of Electro-sorption for Desalination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electro-sorption (ES) is a research frontier in electrochemical separation, with proven potential applications in desalination, wastewater treatment, and selective resource extraction. However, due to the limited adsorption capacity of film electrodes, ES requires short circuiting or circuit reversal, accompanied by solution-switch between the feed solution and receiving solution, to sustain desalination over many charging-discharge cycles. In the literature, solution-switch have been commonly ignored to simplify experimental procedures and its impacts on separation performance are thus not well understood. This study aims to provide a quantitative analysis of the impacts of mixing due to solution-switch on the performance of ES-based desalination. A numerical model of ES has been employed to evaluate the adverse effects of solution-switch on the desalination performance in three different operation modes. The analysis reveals that the impacts of mixing due to solution-switch are more severe with a larger concentration difference between the desalinated water and the brine and provides insights on the effectiveness of increasing electrode loading or specific capacity in mitigating the detrimental impacts of mixing. Even with state-of-the-art systems, producing freshwater from seawater or even brackish water with medium-to-high salinity is practically challenging due to the presence of solution-switch.</description>

      <title>Alternant Hydrocarbon Diradicals as Optically Addressable Molecular Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-spin molecules allow for bottom-up qubit design and are promising platforms for magnetic sensing and quantum information science. Optical addressability of molecular electron spins has also been proposed in first-row transition metal complexes via optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) mechanisms analogous to the diamond-NV colour centre. However, significantly less progress has been made on the front of metal-free molecules, which can deliver lower costs and milder environmental impacts. At present, most luminescent open-shell organic molecules are $\pi$-diradicals, but such systems often suffer from poor ground-state open-shell characters necessary to realise a stable ground-state molecular qubit. In this work, we use alternancy symmetry to selectively minimise radical-radical interactions in the ground state, generating $\pi$-systems with high diradical characters. We call them m-dimers, referencing the need to covalently link two benzylic radicals at their meta carbon atoms for the desired symmetry. Through a detailed electronic structure analysis, we find that the excited states of alternant hydrocarbon m-diradicals contain important symmetries that can be used to construct ODMR mechanisms leading to ground-state spin polarisation. The molecular parameters are set in the context of a tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical dimer covalently tethered at the meta position, demonstrating the feasibility of alternant m-diradicals as molecular colour centres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient ways to prepare fermionic ground states on quantum computers are in high demand and different techniques have been developed over the last years. Despite having a vast set of methods, it is still unclear which method performs well for which system. In this work, we combine interpretable circuit designs with an effective basis approach in order to optimize a multiconfigurational valence bond wavefunction. Based on selected model systems, we show how this leads to explainable performance. We demonstrate that the developed methodology outperforms related methods in terms of the size of the effective basis as well as individual quantum resources for the involved circuits.</description>

      <title>Molecular Identification and Peak Assignment: Leveraging Multi-Level Multimodal Alignment on NMR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy plays an essential role in deciphering molecular structure and dynamic behaviors. While AI-enhanced NMR prediction models hold promise, challenges still persist in tasks such as molecular retrieval, isomer recognition, and peak assignment. In response, this paper introduces a novel solution, Multi-Level Multimodal Alignment with Knowledge-Guided Instance-Wise Discrimination (K-M3AID), which establishes correspondences between two heterogeneous modalities: molecular graphs and NMR spectra. K-M3AID employs a dual-coordinated contrastive learning architecture with three key modules: a graph-level alignment module, a node-level alignment module, and a communication channel. Notably, K-M3AID introduces knowledge-guided instance-wise discrimination into contrastive learning within the node-level alignment module. In addition, K-M3AID demonstrates that skills acquired during node-level alignment have a positive impact on graph-level alignment, acknowledging meta-learning as an inherent property. Empirical validation underscores K-M3AID's effectiveness in multiple zero-shot tasks.</description>

      <title>Escape from textured adsorbing surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The escape dynamics of sticky particles from textured surfaces is poorly understood despite importance to various scientific and technological domains. In this work, we address this challenge by investigating the escape time of adsorbates from prevalent surface topographies, including holes/pits, pillars, and grooves. Analytical expressions for the probability density function and the mean of the escape time are derived. A particularly interesting scenario is that of very deep and narrow confining spaces within the surface. In this case, the joint effect of the entrapment and stickiness prolongs the escape time, resulting in an effective desorption rate that is dramatically lower than that of the untextured surface. This rate is shown to abide a universal scaling law, which couples the equilibrium constants of adsorption with the relevant confining length scales. While our results are analytical and exact, we also present an approximation for deep and narrow cavities based on an effective description of one dimensional diffusion that is punctuated by motionless adsorption events. This simple and physically motivated approximation provides high-accuracy predictions within its range of validity and works relatively well even for cavities of intermediate depth. All theoretical results are corroborated with extensive Monte-Carlo simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long-range electrostatic interactions between molecules depend strongly on their relative orientation, which manifests as a rotational state dependence. Interactions between molecules in the same rotational quantum state are well-known attractive rotational van der Waals interactions. Interactions in rotational states that differ by one quantum show resonant dipole-dipole interactions. We show that where molecules are in rotational states that differ by more than one quantum, they exhibit repulsive van der Waals interactions. At temperatures below a millikelvin, this effect can reduce collisional loss by multiple orders of magnitude. These repulsive interactions lead to applications in quantum simulation and impurity physics with ultracold polar molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to repeatedly load laser-cooled molecules into optical tweezers, and transfer them to storage states that are rotationally excited by two additional quanta. Collisional loss of molecules in these storage states is suppressed, and a dipolar blockade prevents the accumulation of more than one molecule. Applying three cycles loads tweezers with single molecules at an 80~\% success rate, limited by residual collisional loss. This improved loading efficiency reduces the time needed for rearrangement of tweezer arrays, which would otherwise limit the scalability of neutral molecule quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Theory of Supervibronic Transitions via Casimir Polaritons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A remote energy transfer pathway from electronic to vibrational degrees of freedom is identified inside an infrared optical cavity under vibrational strong coupling conditions. This mechanism relies on the dynamical Casimir effect, whereby real infrared photons are generated due to a sudden electronic transition of anisotropic molecules. Moreover, the formation of vibrational polaritons enables the excited photon energy to be transferred to the vibrational degrees of freedom before any dissipation occurs. Both analytic solutions and numerical simulations reveal that the magnitude of this electronic to vibrational energy transfer depends quadratically on the number of molecules and resonantly on the vibration-cavity detuning. During this "supervibronic" transition process, because the vibrational energy gain per molecule can be meaningful in the macroscopic limit, this process may potentially be observed using conventional vibrational strong coupling devices.</description>

      <title>Cartesian atomic cluster expansion for machine learning interatomic potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials are revolutionizing large-scale, accurate atomistic modelling in material science and chemistry. Many potentials use atomic cluster expansion or equivariant message passing frameworks. Such frameworks typically use spherical harmonics as angular basis functions, and then use Clebsch-Gordan contraction to maintain rotational symmetry, which may introduce redundancies in representations and computational overhead. We propose an alternative: a Cartesian-coordinates-based atomic density expansion. This approach provides a complete set of polynormially indepedent features of atomic environments while maintaining interaction body orders. Additionally, we integrate low-dimensional embeddings of various chemical elements and inter-atomic message passing. The resulting potential, named Cartesian Atomic Cluster Expansion (CACE), exhibits good accuracy, stability, and generalizability. We validate its performance in diverse systems, including bulk water, small molecules, and 25-element high-entropy alloys.</description>

      <title>Systematic Improvement of Quantum Monte Carlo Calculations in Transition Metal Oxides: sCI-Driven Wavefunction Optimization for Reliable Band Gap prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of electronic properties of correlated oxides remains a significant challenge for computational theory. Traditional Hubbard-corrected density functional theory (DFT+U) frequently encounters limitations in precisely capturing electron correlation, particularly when predicting band gaps. We introduce a systematic methodology to enhance the accuracy of diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) simulations for both ground and excited states, focusing on LiCoO$_2$ as a case study. By employing a selected CI (sCI) approach, we demonstrate the capability to optimize wavefunctions beyond the constraints of single-reference DFT+U trial wavefunctions. We show that the sCI framework enables accurate prediction of band gaps in LiCoO$_2$, closely aligning with experimental values and substantially improving upon traditional computational methods. The study uncovers a nuanced mixed state of $t_{2g}$ a $e_g$ orbitals at the band edges that is not captured by conventional single-reference methods, further elucidating the limitations of PBE+U in describing $d$-$d$ excitations. Our findings advocate for the adoption of beyond-DFT methodologies, such as sCI, to capture the essential physics of excited state wavefunctions in strongly correlated materials. The improved accuracy in band gap predictions and the ability to generate more reliable trial wavefunctions for DMC calculations underscore the potential of this approach for broader applications in the study of correlated oxides. This work not only provides a pathway for more accurate simulations of electronic structures in complex materials but also suggests a framework for future investigations into the excited states of other challenging systems.</description>
