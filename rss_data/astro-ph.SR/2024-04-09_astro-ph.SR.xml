      <title>OGLE-2018-BLG-0971, MOA-2023-BLG-065, and OGLE-2023-BLG-0136: Microlensing events with prominent orbital effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We undertake a project to reexamine microlensing data gathered from high-cadence surveys. The aim of the project is to reinvestigate lensing events with light curves exhibiting intricate anomaly features associated with caustics, yet lacking prior proposed models to explain these features. Through detailed reanalyses considering higher-order effects, we identify that accounting for orbital motions of lenses is vital in accurately explaining the anomaly features observed in the light curves of the lensing events OGLE-2018-BLG-0971, MOA-2023-BLG-065, and OGLE-2023-BLG-0136. We estimate the masses and distances to the lenses by conducting Bayesian analyses using the lensing parameters of the newly found lensing solutions. From these analyses, we identify that the lenses of the events OGLE-2018-BLG-0971 and MOA-2023-BLG-065 are binaries composed of M dwarfs, while the lens of OGLE-2023-BLG-0136 is likely to be a binary composed of an early K-dwarf primary and a late M-dwarf companion. For all lensing events, the probability of the lens residing in the bulge is considerably higher than that of it being located in the disk.</description>

      <title>Resolution enhancement of SOHO/MDI Magnetograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on the solar magnetic field and its effects on solar dynamo mechanisms and space weather events has benefited from the continual improvements in instrument resolution and measurement frequency. The augmentation and assimilation of historical observational data timelines also play a significant role in understanding the patterns of solar magnetic field variation. Within the realm of astronomical data processing, superresolution reconstruction refers to the process of using a substantial corpus of training data to learn the nonlinear mapping between low-resolution and high-resolution images,thereby achieving higher-resolution astronomical images. This paper is an application study in highdimensional non-linear regression. Deep learning models were employed to perform SR modeling on SOHO/MDI magnetograms and SDO/HMI magnetograms, thus reliably achieving resolution enhancement of full-disk SOHO/MDI magnetograms and enhancing the image resolution to obtain more detailed information. For this study, a dataset comprising 9717 pairs of data from April 2010 to February 2011 was used as the training set,1332 pairs from March 2011 were used as the validation set, and 1,034 pairs from April 2011 were used as the test set. After data preprocessing, we randomly cropped 128x128 sub-images as the LR from the full-disk MDI magnetograms, and the corresponding 512x512 sub-images as HR from the HMI full-disk magnetograms for model training. The tests conducted have shown that the study successfully produced reliable 4x super-resolution reconstruction of full-disk MDI magnetograms.The MESR model'sresults (0.911) were highly correlated with the target HMI magnetographs as indicated by the correlation coefficient values. Furthermore, the method achieved the best PSNR, SSIM, MAE and RMSE values, indicating that the MESR model can effectively reconstruct magnetog.</description>

      <title>Estimating the lateral speed of a fast shock driven by a coronal mass ejection at the location of solar radio emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can drive shock waves capable of accelerating electrons to high energies. These shock-accelerated electrons act as sources of electromagnetic radiation, often in the form of solar radio bursts. Recent findings suggest that radio imaging of solar radio bursts can provide a means to estimate the lateral expansion of CMEs and associated shocks in the low corona. Our aim is to estimate the expansion speed of a CME-driven shock at the locations of radio emission using 3D reconstructions of the shock wave from multiple viewpoints. We estimated the 3D location of radio emission using radio imaging from the Nan\c{c}ay Radioheliograph and the 3D location of the shock. The 3D shock was reconstructed using white-light and extreme ultraviolet images of the CME from the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, Solar Dynamics Observatory, and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. The lateral expansion speed of the CME-driven shock at the electron acceleration locations was then estimated using the approximate 3D locations of the radio emission on the surface of the shock. The radio bursts associated with the CME were found to reside at the flank of the expanding CME-driven shock. We identified two prominent radio sources at two different locations and found that the lateral speed of the shock was in the range of $800-1000\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ at these locations. Such a high speed during the early stages of the eruption already indicates the presence of a fast shock in the low corona. We also found a larger ratio between the radial and lateral expansion speed compared to values obtained higher up in the corona. The high shock speed obtained is indicative of a fast acceleration during the initial stage of the eruption. This acceleration is most likely one of the key parameters contributing to the presence of metric radio emissions, such as type II radio bursts.</description>

      <title>The radius variations of accreting main sequence stars and mass transfer instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many previous works studied the dynamical timescale mass transfer stability criteria based on the donor response with neglecting the stellar structure of the accretor. In this letter, we investigate the radial response of accretors with mass accumulation and its effect on the binary mass transfer stability. We perform a series of detailed stellar evolution simulations with different types of accretors and obtain the radial variations of stars accreting at different rates. Since the time within which the donor loses half of the original mass has a correlation with the donor mass, we approximately obtain the mean mass transfer rate as a function of mass ratio. Assuming that the common envelope (CE) phase occurs if the accretor radius exceeds the outer Roche lobe radius, we obtain the critical mass ratio of dynamically unstable mass transfer. We find the critical mass ratios for donors filling their Roche lobes at the Main Sequence (MS) and Hertzsprung Gap (HG) stages are smaller than that derived from the radial response of the donor in the traditional way. Our results may suggest that the binary is easier to enter into the CE phase for a donor star at the MS or HG stage than previously believed.</description>

      <title>Understanding the thermal and magnetic properties of a X-class flare in the low solar atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the spatial distribution and vertical stratification of the physical parameters of the solar atmosphere when an X-class flare occurs. We made use of observations acquired by the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectropolarimeter instrument when observing the full Stokes parameters for the Fe I 6173 A and Ca II 8542 A transitions. We analysed the observed spectra using the newly developed DeSIRe code to infer the atmospheric parameters at photospheric and chromospheric layers over the entire observed field of view. Our findings reveal that the chromosphere is characterised by temperature enhancements and strong upflows in the flare ribbon area, which indicates that the flaring event is producing hot material that is moving outwards from the Sun. We did not detect any trace of temperature enhancements or strong velocities (of any sign) at photospheric layers, signalling that the impact of the flaring event mainly happens at the middle and upper layers. The information about the magnetic field vector revealed relatively smooth stratifications with height for both magnetic field strength and inclination. Still, when examining the spatial distribution of the magnetic field inclination, we observed the presence of large-scale mixed polarities in the regions where the flare ribbon is located. These results suggest that the interaction between those mixed polarities could be the flare's triggering mechanism.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Coronal Properties of AB Dor in the Radio Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multiwavelength study of AB Doradus, combining modelling that incorporates a spectropolarimetric magnetic field map with 8.4 GHz radio interferometry to measure the coronal extent and density of this young star. We use the surface magnetic field map to produce a 3D extrapolation of AB Dor's coronal magnetic field. From this model we create synthetic radio images throughout the stellar rotation period which we can compare with the interferometric radio observations. Our models reproduce the two-lobe structure seen in the radio observations. We successfully fit the observed flux magnitude and lobe separation with our model. We conclude that that the features seen in the radio images are a result of centrifugal containment of hot gas at the peak of closed magnetic loops, and that the corona of AB Dor extends to about 8-10 stellar radii, making it much more extended than the present-day solar corona.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave seismology of charged strange stars in the Cowling approximation: the fluid pulsation modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study, within the framework of Cowling approximation, the effect of the electric charge on the gravitational wave frequency of fluid oscillation modes of strange quark stars. For this purpose, the dense matter of the stellar fluid is described by the MIT bag model equation of state (EoS), while for the electric charge profile, we consider that the electric charge density is proportional to the energy density. We find that the gravitational wave frequencies change with the increment of electric charge; these effects are more noticeable at higher total mass values. We obtain that the $f$-mode is very sensitive to the change in the electric charge of the star. Furthermore, in the case of the $p_1$ mode, the effect of the electric charge is not very significant. Our results reveal that the study of the fundamental pulsation mode of an electrically charged compact star is very important to distinguish whether compact stars could contain electric charge.</description>

      <title>Detection of Contact Binary Candidates Observed By TESS Using Autoencoder Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contact binary may be the progenitor of a red nova that eventually produces a merger event and have a cut-off period around 0.2 days. Therefore, a large number of contact binaries is needed to search for the progenitor of red novae and to study the characteristics of short-period contact binaries. In this paper, we employ the Phoebe program to generate a large number of light curves based on the fundamental parameters of contact binaries. Using these light curves as samples, an autoencoder model is trained, which can reconstruct the light curves of contact binaries very well. When the error between the output light curve from the model and the input light curve is large, it may be due to other types of variable stars. The goodness of fit (R2) between the output light curve from the model and the input light curve is calculated. Based on the thresholds for global goodness of fit (R2), period, range magnitude, and local goodness of fit (R2), a total of 1322 target candidates were obtained.</description>

      <title>Constraining electron number density in the Sun via Earth-based neutrino flavor data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino flavor transformation offers a window into the physics of various astrophysical environments, including our Sun and the more exotic environs of core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron-star mergers. Here, we apply an inference framework - specifically: statistical data assimilation (SDA) - to neutrino flavor evolution in the Sun. We take a model for solar neutrino flavor evolution, together with Earth-based neutrino measurements, to infer solar properties. Specifically, we ask what signature of the radially-varying solar electron number density $n_e(r)$ is contained within these Earth-based measurements. Currently, the best estimates of $n_e(r)$ come from the standard solar model. We seek to ascertain, through novel application of the SDA method, whether estimates of the same from neutrino data can serve as independent constraints.</description>

      <title>The jet of BP Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strong global magnetic field of young low-mass stars and a high accretion rate are the necessary conditions for the formation of collimated outflows (jets) from these objects. But it is still unclear whether these conditions are also sufficient. We aim to check whether BP Tau, an actively accreting young star with a strong magnetic field, has a jet. We carried out narrowband SII 672 nm imaging and spectroscopic observations of BP Tau and its vicinity. We find that BP Tau is a source of a Herbig-Haro flow (assigned number HH 1181), which includes two HH objects moving from the star in opposite directions and a micro- (counter-) jet of ~ 1" projected length. The flow is oriented along position angle $59 \pm 1$ degree.</description>

      <title>Detection of Rydberg lines from the atmosphere of Betelgeuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emission lines from Rydberg transitions are detected for the first time from a region close to the surface of Betelgeuse. The H30${\alpha}$ line is observed at 231.905 GHz, with a FWHM ~42 km/s and extended wings. A second line at 232.025 GHz (FWHM ~21 km/s), is modeled as a combination of Rydberg transitions of abundant low First Ionization Potential metals. Both H30${\alpha}$ and the Rydberg combined line X30${\alpha}$ are fitted by Voigt profiles, and collisional broadening with electrons may be partly responsible for the Lorentzian contribution, indicating electron densities of a few 10$^8$cm$^{-3}$. X30${\alpha}$ is located in a relatively smooth ring at a projected radius of 0.9x the optical photospheric radius R$_*$, whereas H30${\alpha}$ is more clumpy, reaching a peak at ~1.4R$_*$. We use a semi-empirical thermodynamic atmospheric model of Betelgeuse to compute the 232 GHz (1.29mm) continuum and line profiles making simple assumptions. Photoionized abundant metals dominate the electron density and the predicted surface of continuum optical depth unity at 232 GHz occurs at ~1.3R$_*$, in good agreement with observations. Assuming a Saha-Boltzmann distribution for the level populations of Mg, Si, and Fe, the model predicts that the X30${\alpha}$ emission arises in a region of radially-increasing temperature and turbulence. Inclusion of ionized C and non-LTE effects could modify the integrated fluxes and location of emission. These simulations confirm the identity of the Rydberg transition lines observed towards Betelgeuse, and reveal that such diagnostics can improve future atmospheric models.</description>

      <title>Repeating partial disruptions and two-body relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-body relaxation may drive stars onto near-radial orbits around a massive black hole, resulting in a tidal disruption event (TDE). In some circumstances, stars are unlikely to undergo a single terminal disruption, but rather to have a sequence of many grazing encounters with the black hole. It has long been unclear what is the physical outcome of this sequence: each of these encounters can only liberate a small amount of stellar mass, but may significantly alter the orbit of the star. We study the phenomenon of repeating partial tidal disruptions (pTDEs) by building a semi-analytical model that accounts for mass loss and tidal excitations. In the empty loss cone regime, where two-body relaxation is weak, we estimate the number of consecutive partial disruption that a star can undergo, on average, before being significantly affected by two-body encounters. We find that in this empty loss cone regime, a star will be destroyed in a sequence of weak pTDEs, possibly explaining the tension between the low observed TDE rate and its higher theoretical estimates.</description>

      <title>Extinction values towards embedded planets in protoplanetary disks estimated from hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upcoming new coronographs with deeper contrast limits, together with planned and current high-contrast imaging campaigns will push the detectability limit of protoplanets. These planet-hunting campaigns present a new opportunity to characterize protoplanets and their surrounding environments. However, there are clear uncertainties as to what are the extinction levels at different regions of protoplanetary disks, which will impede our ability to characterize young planets. A correct understanding of the expected extinction together with multiple photometric observations will lead to constraints on the extinction levels, dust growth, disk evolution and protoplanetary accretion rates. In this work, we used hydrodynamic simulations and protoplanetary disk observational constraints obtained from both dust and gas emission to explore the expected extinction maps for continuum filters associated with strong hydrogen lines as tracers of accretion and key broadband photometric filters. We provide a scaling relationship for the extinction as a function of planetary separation and disk mass for three different gas giant masses. We also report values for a subset of disks of interest targetted by multiple imaging campaigns. The described values will be useful for the optimal design of future planet-hunting surveys and for giving context to non-detections in protoplanetary disks and the observed fluxes of point sources along with the birth conditions of protoplanets.</description>

Abstract: Over the past 4 decades, the exploration of planets beyond our solar system has yielded the discovery of over 5600 exoplanets orbiting different stars. Continuous advancements in instrumentation and cutting-edge techniques empower astronomers to unveil and characterize new exoworlds with increasing frequency. Notably, direct imaging, also called high-contrast imaging (HCI), stands out as the only method capable of capturing photons emitted directly from the planetary bodies. This innovative technique proves particularly advantageous for scrutinizing nascent planetary systems, where planets shine brilliantly and emit significant heat during their initial developmental phases. HCI provides comprehensive visuals of the entire system, encompassing the central star, potential circumstellar disks, and any additional companions. However, the complexity of imaging an object 10^6 fainter than its parent star necessitates state-of-the-art instrumentation. HCI demands cutting-edge tools such as exAO systems, telescopes exceeding 8 meters in diameter, coronagraphs, and modern imagers. The pivotal role of post-processing cannot be overstated in the quest for detecting and characterizing planets through HCI. This method has not only facilitated the discovery of numerous planets but has also presented invaluable opportunities to explore the properties of young substellar companions, both planets and brown dwarfs. Insights into their interactions with parent disks or other companions within the system, the composition of their atmospheres, and the identification of still accreting planets, also known as "protoplanets," contribute significantly to our understanding of planet formation scenarios. The continued refinement of HCI promises to unveil further revelations in the captivating field of exoplanetary exploration.</description>

      <title>Numerical validation of scaling laws for stratified turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical progress using multiscale asymptotic analysis has revealed various possible regimes of stratified turbulence. Notably, buoyancy transport can either be dominated by advection or diffusion, depending on the effective P\'eclet number of the flow. Two types of asymptotic models have been proposed, which yield measurably different predictions for the characteristic vertical velocity and length scale of the turbulent eddies in both diffusive and non-diffusive regimes. The first, termed a `single-scale model', is designed to describe flow structures having large horizontal and small vertical scales, while the second, termed a `multiscale model', additionally incorporates flow features with small horizontal scales, and reduces to the single-scale model in their absence. By comparing predicted vertical velocity scaling laws with direct numerical simulation data, we show that the multiscale model correctly captures the properties of strongly stratified turbulence within spatiotemporally-intermittent turbulent patches. Meanwhile its single-scale reduction accurately describes the more orderly layer-like flow outside those patches.</description>

      <title>Remnant masses from 1D+ core-collapse supernovae simulations: bimodal neutron star mass distribution and black holes in the low-mass gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The explosion of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is an extremely challenging problem, and there are still large uncertainties regarding which stars lead to successful explosions that leave behind a neutron star, and which ones will form a black hole instead. In this paper, we simulate 341 progenitors at three different metallicities using spherically symmetric simulations that include neutrino-driven convection via a mixing-length theory. We use these simulations to improve previously derived explosion criteria based on the density and entropy profiles of the pre-supernova progenitor. We also provide numerical fits to calculate the final mass of neutron stars based on either compactness, the location of the Si/Si-O interface, or the Chandrasekhar mass. The neutron star birth mass distribution derived from our 1D+ simulations is bimodal, contrary to what the most popular 1D CCSN simulations have shown so far. We compare the theoretically derived neutron star mass distributions with the observed ones and discuss potential implications for population synthesis studies. We also analyze the black hole mass distribution predicted by our simulations. To be consistent with current models of matter ejection in failed SNe, a large fraction of the envelope must be expelled, leading to small black holes in the low-mass gap. One black hole in this mass region has recently been observed in the GW230529 event by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. Our results naturally agree with this detection, which the most popular prescriptions for explodability and remnant masses are not able to reproduce. In general, we find that the explosion outcome and mass of the remnant strongly depend on the pre-collapse structure of the progenitor. However, their dependence on the initial mass of the star and the mass of the CO core is highly uncertain and non-linear.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Primordial Alignment: Insights from Stellar Obliquity Measurements for Compact Sub-Saturn Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite decades of effort, the mechanisms by which the spin axis of a star and the orbital axes of its planets become misaligned remain elusive. Particularly, it is of great interest whether the large spin-orbit misalignments observed are driven primarily by high-eccentricity migration -- expected to have occurred for short-period, isolated planets -- or reflect a more universal process that operates across systems with a variety of present-day architectures. Compact multi-planet systems offer a unique opportunity to differentiate between these competing hypotheses, as their tightly-packed configurations preclude violent dynamical histories, including high-eccentricity migration, allowing them to trace the primordial disk plane. In this context, we report measurements of the sky-projected stellar obliquity ($\lambda$) via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for two sub-Saturns in multiple-transiting systems: TOI-5126 b ($\lambda=1\pm 48\,^{\circ}$) and TOI-5398 b ($\lambda=-24^{+14}_{-13} \,^{\circ}$). Both are spin-orbit aligned, joining a fast-growing group of just three other compact sub-Saturn systems, all of which exhibit spin-orbit alignment. Our results strongly suggest that sub-Saturn systems are primordially aligned and become misaligned largely in the post-disk phase through violent dynamical interactions inherent to eccentric migration, as appears to be the case increasingly for other exoplanet populations.</description>

      <title>Korg: fitting, model atmosphere interpolation, and Brackett lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe several updates to Korg, a package for 1D LTE spectral synthesis of FGKM stars. Built-in functions to fit observed spectra via synthesis or equivalent widths make it easy to take advantage of Korg's automatic differentiation. Comparison to a past analysis of 18 Sco shows that we obtain significantly reduced line-to-line abundance scatter with Korg. Fitting and synthesis are facilitated by a rigorously-tested model atmosphere interpolation method, which introduces negligible error to synthesized spectra for stars with $T_\mathrm{eff} \gtrsim 4000\,\mathrm{K}$. For cooler stars, atmosphere interpolation is complicated by the presence of molecules, though we demonstrate an adequate method for cool dwarfs. The chemical equilibrium solver has been extended to include polyatomic and charged molecules, extending Korg's regime of applicability to M stars. We also discuss a common oversight regarding the synthesis of hydrogen lines in the infrared, and show that Korg's Brackett line profiles are a much closer match to observations than others available. Documentation, installation instructions, and tutorials are available at https://github.com/ajwheeler/Korg.jl.</description>

      <title>Expansion of accreting main-sequence stars during rapid mass transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09570v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accreting main-sequence stars expand significantly when the mass accretion timescale is much shorter than their thermal timescales. This occurs during mass transfer from an evolved giant star onto a main-sequence companion in a binary system, and is an important phase in the formation of compact binaries including X-ray binaries, cataclysmic variables, and gravitational-wave sources. In this study, we compute 1D stellar models of main-sequence accretors with different initial masses and accretion rates. The calculations are used to derive semi-analytical approximations to the maximum expansion radius. We assume that mass transfer remains fully conservative as long as the inflated accretor fits within its Roche lobe, leading stars to behave like hamsters, stuffing excess material behind their expanding cheeks. We suggest a physically motivated prescription for the mass growth of such "hamstars", which can be used to determine mass-transfer efficiency in rapid binary population synthesis models. With this prescription, we estimate that progenitors of high-mass X-ray binaries and gravitational-wave sources may have experienced highly non-conservative mass transfer. In contrast, for low-mass accretors, the accretion timescale can exceed the thermal timescale by a larger factor without causing significant radial expansion.</description>

      <title>Kaleidoscope of irradiated disks: MUSE observations of proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster. I. Sample presentation and ionization front sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), protoplanetary disks exhibit ionized gas clouds in the form of a striking teardrop shape as massive stars irradiate the disk material. We present the first spatially and spectrally resolved observations of 12 proplyds, using Integral Field Spectroscopy observations performed with the MUSE instrument in Narrow Field Mode (NFM) on the VLT. We present the morphology of the proplyds in seven emission lines and measure the radius of the ionization front (I-front) of the targets in four tracers, covering transitions of different ionization states for the same element. We also derive stellar masses for the targets. The measurements follow a consistent trend of increasing I-front radius for a decreasing strength of the far-UV radiation as expected from photoevaporation models. By analyzing the ratios of the I-front radii as measured in the emission lines of Ha, [OI] 6300, [OII] 7330, and [OIII] 5007, we observe the ionization stratification, that is, the most ionized part of the flow being the furthest from the disk (and closest to the UV source). The ratios of I-front radii scale in the same way for all proplyds in our sample regardless of the incident radiation. We show that the stratification can help constrain the densities near the I-front by using a 1D photoionization model. We derive the upper limits of photoevaporative mass-loss rates by assuming ionization equilibrium, and estimate values decreasing towards lower impinging radiation. We do not find a correlation between Mloss and stellar mass. The highest mass-loss rate is for the proplyd 244-440. These values of Mloss, combined with estimates of the disk mass with ALMA, confirm previous estimates of the short lifetime of these proplyds. This work demonstrates the potential of this dataset and offers a new set of observables to be used to test current and future models of external photoevaporation.</description>

      <title>PHL 5038AB: Is the brown dwarf causing pollution of its white dwarf host star?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new results on PHL 5038AB, a widely separated binary system composed of a white dwarf and a brown dwarf, refining the white and brown dwarf parameters and determining the binary separation to be $66^{+12}_{-24}$~AU. New spectra of the white dwarf show calcium absorption lines suggesting the hydrogen-rich atmosphere is weakly polluted, inferring the presence of planetesimals in the system, which we determine are in an S-type orbit around the white dwarf in orbits closer than 17-32 AU. We do not detect any infrared excess that would indicate the presence of a disc, suggesting all dust present has either been totally accreted or is optically thin. In this system, we suggest the metal pollution in the white dwarf atmosphere can be directly attributed to the presence of the brown dwarf companion disrupting the orbits of planetesimals within the system.</description>

      <title>Origin and Properties of the Near Subsonic Solar Wind Observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify and examine the solar wind intervals near the sonic critical point (i.e., $M_S \sim 1$) observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). The near subsonic wind intervals show similar properties: a low density, an extremely low velocity, a low proton temperature, and essentially no magnetic field deflections compared with the surrounding solar wind. The extremely low velocity is the primary contributor to the near crossing of the sonic critical point rather than the sound speed, which is roughly constant in these intervals. Source tracing with a potential field source surface (PFSS) model suggests that the near subsonic intervals all connect to the boundaries inside coronal holes. Heliospheric current sheet (HCS) and partial HCS crossings around the near subsonic intervals indicate that the near subsonic wind is a transition layer between the slow and fast wind. The above scenario is consistent with the nature of the near subsonic wind as a low Mach-number boundary layer (LMBL), which facilitates the crossing of the sonic critical point at 15-20 $R_S$. Moreover, we find a dependence of the amplitude of switchbacks on the radial sonic Mach number. Magnetic field deflections essentially disappear near the sonic critical point, which suggests that switchbacks originate from above the sonic critical point.</description>

      <title>MRI turbulence in vertically stratified accretion discs at large magnetic Prandtl numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the first binary neutron star merger, GW170817, has spawned a plethora of global numerical relativity simulations. These simulations are often ideal (with dissipation determined by the grid) and/or axisymmetric (invoking ad hoc mean-field dynamos). However, binary neutron star mergers (similar to X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei inner discs) are characterised by large magnetic Prandtl numbers, $\rm Pm$, (the ratio of viscosity to resistivity). $\rm Pm$ is a key parameter determining dynamo action and dissipation but it is ill-defined (and likely of order unity) in ideal simulations. To bridge this gap, we investigate the magnetorotational instability (MRI) and associated dynamo at large magnetic Prandtl numbers using fully compressible, three-dimensional, vertically stratified, isothermal simulations of a local patch of a disc. We find that, within the bulk of the disc ($z\lesssim2H$, where $H$ is the scale-height), the turbulent intensity (parameterized by the stress-to-thermal-pressure ratio $\alpha$), and the saturated magnetic field energy density, $E_\text{mag}$, produced by the MRI dynamo, both scale as a power with Pm at moderate Pm ($4\lesssim \text{Pm} \lesssim 32$): $E_\text{mag} \sim \text{Pm}^{0.74}$ and $\alpha \sim \text{Pm}^{0.71}$, respectively. At larger Pm ($\gtrsim 32$) we find deviations from power-law scaling and the onset of a plateau. Compared to our recent unstratified study, this scaling with Pm becomes weaker further away from the disc mid-plane, where the Parker instability dominates. We perform a thorough spectral analysis to understand the underlying dynamics of small-scale MRI-driven turbulence in the mid-plane and of large-scale Parker-unstable structures in the atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Stellar Escape from Globular Clusters. II. Clusters May Eat Their Own Tails</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply for the first time the Monte Carlo star cluster modeling method to study tidal tail and stellar stream formation from globular clusters, assuming a circular orbit in a smooth Galactic potential. Approximating energetically unbound bodies (potential escapers; PEs) as collisionless enables this fast but spherically symmetric method to capture asymmetric tidal phenomena with unprecedented detail. Beyond reproducing known stream features, including epicyclic overdensities, we show how 'returning tidal tails' may form after the stream fully circumnavigates the Galaxy back to the cluster, enhancing the stream's velocity dispersion. While a realistically clumpy, time-dependent Galactic potential may disrupt such tails, they warrant scrutiny as potentially excellent constraints on the Galactic potential's history and substructure. Re-examining the escape timescale $\Delta t$ of PEs, we find new behavior related to chaotic scattering in the three-body problem; the $\Delta t$ distribution features sharp plateaus corresponding to distinct locally smooth patches of the chaotic saddle separating the phase space basins of escape. We study for the first time $\Delta t$ in an evolving cluster, finding that $\Delta t\sim(E_{\rm J}^{-0.1},E_{\rm J}^{-0.4})$ for PEs with (low, high) Jacobi energy $E_{\rm J}$, flatter than for a static cluster ($E_{\rm J}^{-2}$). Accounting for cluster mass loss and internal evolution -- and (roughly) for ongoing relaxation among PEs -- lowers the median $\Delta t$ from ${\sim}10\,$Gyr to ${\lesssim}100\,$Myr. We finally outline future improvements to escape physics in the Monte Carlo method intended to enable both the first large-parameter-space studies of tidal tail/stellar stream formation from full globular cluster simulations and detailed comparisons to stream observations.</description>

      <title>Impact of Hot Inner Crust on Compact Stars at Finite Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conducted a study on the thermal properties of stellar matter with the nuclear energy density functional BCPM. This functional is based on microscopic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculations and has demonstrated success in describing cold neutron stars. To enhance its applicability in astrophysics, in this study we extend the BCPM equation of state to finite temperature for $\beta$-stable neutrino-free matter, taking into consideration the hot inner crust. Such an equation of state holds significant importance for hot compact objects, particularly those resulting from a binary neutron star merger event. Our exploration has shown that with increasing temperature there is a fast decrease of the crust-core transition density, suggesting that for hot stars it is not realistic to assume a fixed value of this density. The microscopic calculations also reveal that the presence of nuclear clusters persists up to $T=7.21$ MeV, identified as the limiting temperature of the crust. Above this threshold, the manifestation of clusters is not anticipated. Below this temperature, clusters within the inner crust are surrounded by uniform matter with varying densities, allowing for the distinction between the upper and lower transition density branches. Moreover, we computed mass--radius relations of neutron stars, assuming an isothermal profile for $\beta$-stable neutron star matter at various temperature values. Our findings highlight the significant influence of the hot inner crust on the mass--radius relationship, leading to the formation of larger and more inflated neutron stars. Consequently, under our prescription, the final outcome is a unified equation of state at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Dependence of Microlensing Planet Frequency on The Host Star Mass and Galactocentric Distance by using a Galactic Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We measure the dependence of planet frequency on host star mass, $M_{\rm L}$, and distance from the Galactic center, $R_{\rm L}$, using a sample of planets discovered by gravitational microlensing. We compare the two-dimensional distribution of the lens-source proper motion, $\mu_{\rm rel}$, and the Einstein radius crossing time, $t_{\rm E}$, measured for 22 planetary events from Suzuki et al. (2016) with the distribution expected from Galactic model. Assuming that the planet-hosting probability of a star is proportional to $M_{\rm L}^m R_{\rm L}^r$, we calculate the likelihood distribution of $(m,r)$. We estimate that $r = 0.10^{+0.51}_{-0.37}$ and $m = 0.50^{+0.90}_{-0.70}$ under the assumption that the planet-hosting probability is independent of the mass ratio. We also divide the planet sample into subsamples based on their mass ratio, $q$, and estimate that $m=-0.08^{+0.95}_{-0.65}$ for $q &lt; 10^{-3}$ and $1.25^{+1.07}_{-1.14}$ for $q &gt; 10^{-3}$. Although uncertainties are still large, this result implies a possibility that in orbits beyond the snowline, massive planets are more likely to exist around more massive stars whereas low-mass planets exist regardless of their host star mass.</description>

Abstract: A primary scientific goal of the future Habitable Worlds Observatory will be the direct detection and characterization of Earth-like planets. Estimates of the exoplanet yields for this concept will help guide mission design through detailed trade studies. It is therefore critical that yield estimation codes optimally adapt observations to the mission's performance parameters to ensure accurate trade studies. To aid in this, we implement wavelength optimization in yield calculations for the first time, allowing the yield code to determine the ideal detection and characterization bandpasses. We use this new capability to confirm the observational wavelength assumptions made for the LUVOIR-B study, namely that the optimum detection wavelength is 500 nm for the majority of targets and the optimum wavelength to detect water is near 1000 nm, given LUVOIR-B's assumed instrument performance parameters. We show that including the wavelength dependent albedo of an Earth twin as a prior provides no significant benefit to the yields of exoEarth candidates and caution against tuning observations to modern Earth twins. We also show that coronagraphs whose inner working angles are similar to step functions may benefit from wavelength optimization and demonstrate how wavelength-dependent instrument performance can impact the optimum wavelengths for detection and characterization. The optimization methods we implement automate wavelength selection and remove uncertainties regarding these choices, helping to adapt the observations to the instrument's performance parameters.</description>
