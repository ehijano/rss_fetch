      <title>Prompt Periodicity in the GRB 211211A Precursor: Black-hole or magnetar engine?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The merger origin long GRB 211211A was a class (re-)defining event. A precursor was identified with a $\sim 1$ s separation from the main burst, as well as a claimed candidate quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) with a frequency $\sim20$ Hz. Here, we explore the implications of the precursor, assuming the quasi-periodicity is real. The precursor variability timescale requires relativistic motion with a Lorentz factor $\Gamma\gtrsim80$, and implies an engine driven jetted outflow. The declining amplitude of the consecutive pulses requires an episodic engine with an `on/off' cycle consistent with the QPO. For a black-hole central engine, the QPO can have its origin in Lense-Thirring precession of the inner disk at $\sim6-9$ $r_g$ (gravitational radii) for a mass $M_\bullet\leq4.5$ M$_{\odot}$, and $\lesssim 7$ $r_g$ for $M_\bullet&gt;4.5$ M$_{\odot}$ and dimensionless spin $\chi\sim 0.3 - 0.9$. Alternatively, at a disk density of $\sim10^{8 - 12}$ g cm$^{-3}$, the required magnetic field strength for a QPO via magnetohydrodynamic effects will be on the order $B\sim10^{12 - 14}$ G. If the central engine is a short lived magnetar or hypermassive neutron star, then a low-frequency QPO can be produced via instabilities within the disk at a radius of $\sim20 - 70$ km, for a disk density $\sim10^{9 - 12}$ g cm$^{-3}$ and magnetic field $\gtrsim10^{13 - 14}$ G. The QPO cannot be coupled to the neutron star spin, as the co-rotation radius is beyond the scale of the disk. Neither engine can be ruled out -- however, we favour an origin for the precursor candidate QPO as early jet-disk coupling for a neutron star -- black hole merger remnant with mass $M_\bullet&gt;4.5$ M$_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Spatial dependence of the break in the energy spectrum of cosmic rays in the new anisotropic diffusion approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At present, there is no consensus on whether the spectral break in the cosmic ray flux of all elements around 4 PeV is a general characteristic of the Milky Way or is determined by a combination of factors that significantly affect the energy position of the knee. We argue that considering the anisotropic propagation of cosmic rays within a realistically modeled Galactic magnetic field, along with the acceleration limits in various source populations, allows for an accurate description of local experimental data from LHAASO, Tibet AS$\gamma$, and Fermi-LAT for gamma rays. To demonstrate this, we constructed a diffusion propagation model with a general form diffusion tensor within a two-component magnetic field and determined both the local cosmic ray spectrum and the spectra for specific regions of the Milky Way. We calculated the integral flux of diffuse gamma rays in the inner and outer regions of the Galaxy, finding that the spectral shape of the resulting flux aligns with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Ignition of weak interactions and r-process outflows in super-collapsar accretion disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collapse of rotating massive (~$10 M_\odot$) stars resulting in hyperaccreting black holes (BHs; "collapsars") is a leading model for the central engines of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and a promising source of rapid neutron capture ("r-process") elements. R-process nucleosynthesis in disk outflows requires the accretion flow to self-neutronize. This occurs because of Pauli-blocking at finite electron degeneracy, associated with a critical accretion rate $\dot M &gt; \dot{M}_{\rm ign}$. We analytically examine the assumptions underlying this "ignition threshold" and its possible breakdown with increasing BH mass $M$. Employing three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with weak interactions, we explore the physical conditions of collapsar accretion disks with $M$ ~ 80-3000 $M_\odot$ over more than a viscous timescale as they transition through the threshold. There is remarkable agreement between our simulations and the analytic result $\dot{M}_{\rm ign}\propto \alpha^{5/3}M^{4/3}$ for $M$ ~ 3-3000 $M_\odot$. Simulations and analytic analyses consistently show that the largest BHs leading to r-process nucleosynthesis at $\dot{M}_{\rm ign}$ are $\approx 3000 M_\odot$, beyond which self-neutronization ceases, since the disk temperature $T\propto M^{-1/6}$ decreases below the neutron-proton mass difference (~MeV), suppressing the conversion of protons into neutrons. We show that stellar models of ~$250-10^5M_\odot$ can give rise to BHs of $M$ ~30-1000 $M_\odot$ accreting at $\dot M\gtrsim \dot{M}_{\rm ign}$, yielding ~$10-100 M_\odot$ of light and heavy r-process elements per event. These rare but prolific r-process sources in low-metallicity environments are associated with super-kilonovae and likely extremely energetic GRBs. Such signatures may be used to probe Population III stars.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Analysis of GRB 250101A: From Gamma-ray Prompt Emission to Optical Afterglow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous transients in the universe. The interaction between the relativistic jet and the circumburst medium produces a multiwavelength afterglow through synchrotron radiation. In this work, we present multiwavelength properties of GRB~250101A based on the observations of Swift, Fermi, and Multi-channel Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto). The spectral analysis of Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM reveals a soft prompt spectrum with a low-energy photon index of $-1.18$ and a peak energy of 33 keV, and the isotropic energy is $1.4\times10^{52}~{\rm erg}$. The prompt emission of GRB 250101A aligns with Type II GRBs in the Amati relation. Meanwhile, our analysis indicates that GRB 250101A is an X-ray-rich or X-ray-dominated GRB, with intrinsic properties suggesting that it is relatively softer than most classical GRBs. Optical observation with Mephisto, beginning 197 s post-trigger, shows a single power-law decay in $uvgriz$ bands, with $F_{\nu,\mathrm{obs}} \propto t^{-0.76} \nu^{-1.20}$. The observed spectral index significantly exceeds theoretical predictions under standard afterglow models, suggesting a color excess of $\sim0.21$ mag. However, combining X-ray and optical afterglow, we find that GRB 250101A is more likely a ``normal burst'' rather than an ``optical-dark burst'', and the dust extinction effect plays an important role in the optical blue bands. Furthermore, there is a structural change at $T_0+2924$ s in the optical light curve, indicating a density drop of $\sim50$ \% in the interstellar medium at a distance of $\sim0.05~{\rm pc}$.</description>

      <title>Hide and seek with a Neutron Star. Hint of Neutron Star activity in SN 2015ap light curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We present a detailed study of the unique SN 2015ap, a very energetic event, notable for its exceptionally high bolometric peak magnitude if compared to other well-know Type Ib supernovae. We analyzed its multi-wavelength light curve, which exhibited a possible period modulation that could result from a geometrical effect. Methods. We analyzed the modulation present at all available bands in SN 2015ap's light curves using a Bayesian approach for measuring the period of variability. Additionally, narrow Ha emission is observed in late-time spectra, exhibiting periodic velocity shifts likely originating from hydrogen gas stripped from a companion and accreted onto the compact remnant. Results. We propose that SN 2015ap's significant light curve modulation arise from accretion onto a neutron star as the remnant of SN 2015ap. Our multi-wavelength observations reveal a sinusoidal modulation with a period of 8.4 days, confirmed by periodic variations in the Ha emission lines. Traditional models of circumstellar medium interactions cannot account for these features due to the unusually high ejection rates required. Using the Taylor-Spruit dynamo model, we suggest that the interaction between accreting matter and the neutron star's magnetosphere could account for the observed periodic modulation. This implies assuming an ejecta-companion interaction because the accretion from fallback ejecta alone would not produce the observed modulation. The binary configuration, characterized by a separation of less than 50 Ro, supports a magnetized neutron star central engine as the primary mechanism, rather than models involving circumstellar material interaction.</description>

      <title>Compression fronts from fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a fast radio burst (FRB) expands from its source through a surrounding tenuous plasma, it strongly heats and compresses the plasma at radii up to $\sim 10^{14}$cm. The likely central engines of FRBs are magnetars, and their ambient plasma at radii $r\gg 10^{10}$cm is a magnetized $e^\pm$ wind. We formulate equations describing the FRB-plasma interaction, solve them numerically, and provide an approximate analytical picture of the interaction. We find the following: (1) FRBs emitted at $r&lt;r_{\rm stoch}\sim 10^{12}$cm induce fast stochastic heating and strong compression of the wind, sweeping it like a broom. The outcome of this interaction is determined by the energy losses of the radio wave. We evaluate the parameter space where the FRB survives its interaction with the wind. (2) At radii $r&gt;r_{\rm stoch}$, the FRB induces regular heating to the Lorentz factor $\sim a_0$, where $a_0\propto r^{-1}$ is the wave strength parameter. At $r&gt;r_\star\sim 10^{13}$cm, the FRB drives a quasisteady compression wave in the wind, with compression factor $C_\star\approx 1+a_0^2$. Both characteristic radii $r_{\rm stoch}$ and $r_\star$ scale with FRB luminosity $L$ as $L^{1/3}$. FRBs avoid damping if they are released into the wind medium outside $r_{\rm damp}\sim 10^{11}$cm.</description>

      <title>Precision cross-sections for advancing cosmic-ray physics and other applications: a comprehensive programme for the next decade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray physics in the GeV-to-TeV energy range has entered a precision era thanks to recent data from space-based experiments. However, the poor knowledge of nuclear reactions, in particular for the production of antimatter and secondary nuclei, limits the information that can be extracted from these data, such as source properties, transport in the Galaxy and indirect searches for particle dark matter. The Cross-Section for Cosmic Rays at CERN workshop series has addressed the challenges encountered in the interpretation of high-precision cosmic-ray data, with the goal of strengthening emergent synergies and taking advantage of the complementarity and know-how in different communities, from theoretical and experimental astroparticle physics to high-energy and nuclear physics. In this paper, we present the outcomes of the third edition of the workshop that took place in 2024. We present the current state of cosmic-ray experiments and their perspectives, and provide a detailed road map to close the most urgent gaps in cross-section data, in order to efficiently progress on many open physics cases, which are motivated in the paper. Finally, with the aim of being as exhaustive as possible, this report touches several other fields -- such as cosmogenic studies, space radiation protection and hadrontherapy -- where overlapping and specific new cross-section measurements, as well as nuclear code improvement and benchmarking efforts, are also needed. We also briefly highlight further synergies between astroparticle and high-energy physics on the question of cross-sections.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Ray Burst Jets in Circumstellar Material: Dynamics, Breakout, and Diversity of Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations indicate that stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae are often surrounded by dense circumstellar material (CSM). Motivated by this, we develop an analytic model to systematically study the dynamics of long gamma-ray burst (LGRB) jet propagation in various CSM environments. We derive a general formula for the jet head velocity ($\beta_{\rm h}$) and breakout time ($t_{\rm b}$) valid across Newtonian, relativistic, and intermediate regimes, accounting for a previously unrecognized dependence on $1 - \beta_{\rm h}$. Our results highlight a fundamental distinction between jet propagation in massive stars, where $\beta_{\rm h}\ll 1$, and in extended CSM, where $1-\beta_{\rm h}\ll 1$. We establish an analytic success/failure criterion for jets and express it in terms of jet and CSM parameters, revealing a strong dependence on CSM radius. To quantify the relativistic nature of the jet-cocoon system, we introduce the energy-weighted proper velocity $\overline{\Gamma\beta}$. We identify three possible jet outcomes-(a) successful jets ($\overline{\Gamma\beta} \sim 10-100$), (b) barely failed jets ($\overline{\Gamma\beta} \sim 1$), and (c) completely failed jets ($\overline{\Gamma\beta} \sim 0.1$)-and constrain their respective jet/CSM parameter spaces. We show that in (b) and (c), large CSM radii can power luminous fast blue optical transients via cocoon cooling emission. This theoretical framework provides a basis for future observational and theoretical studies to elucidate the link between LGRBs, intermediate GRBs, low-luminosity LGRBs, and their environments.</description>

      <title>EP240414a: A Gamma-Ray Burst Jet Weakened by an Extended Circumstellar Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent Einstein Probe (EP) event EP240414a exhibits several unusual observational features. Its prompt and afterglow emissions place it between long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) and low-luminosity GRBs (LLGRBs). The event is followed by a fast optical transient (AT~2024gsa), initially exhibiting a thermal-like spectrum but later evolving into an unusually red peak at $\sim 3-5$ days, which is difficult to explain with thermal emission. Using our generalized analytic framework for jet propagation in a circumstellar material (CSM; Hamidani et al. 2025), we explore a scenario in which a conventional LGRB jet is launched in a progenitor surrounded by a dense CSM. For a CSM of $\sim 0.03 M_\odot$ extending to $\sim 3\times 10^{13}$ cm, we find that the jet is significantly weakened before breaking out, becoming ``barely failed'', an intermediate state between successful (LGRB) and completely failed (LLGRB) jets. This scenario naturally explains EP240414a's multi-wavelength observations, with the early thermal component produced by cocoon cooling emission, and the red peak explained by non-thermal afterglow emission from the mildly relativistic barely failed jet (and its inner cocoon). Our work demonstrates the important role of extended CSM in shaping GRB jets and illustrates how early multi-wavelength follow-up observations can reveal the physically diverse nature of jet-driven transients.</description>

      <title>Superluminal Dark Photons as a Solution to the GRB 221009A Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of exceptionally high-energy {\gamma}-photons (up to 18 TeV) from GRB 221009A by the LHAASO Collaboration challenges conventional physics. Photon-axion-like particle (ALP) oscillations have been proposed to explain this anomaly, but they rely on specific parameter tuning. We present an alternative explanation involving superluminal dark photons. Building on the frameworks of Markoulakis and Valamontes, we propose that dark photons facilitated faster-than-light (FTL) propagation of information, allowing {\gamma}-photons to bypass extragalactic background light (EBL) attenuation. This hypothesis aligns with cosmological observations and experimental results, including those from the LHC, providing a robust framework for addressing the GRB 221009A anomaly.</description>

      <title>Neutrino emission and corona heating induced by high-energy proton interactions in Seyfert galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent detection of very-high-energy neutrino emission from Seyfert type active galactic nuclei (AGN) provides a new insight into the physics of the AGN central engines. We notice that if high-energy protons responsible for neutrino emission are accelerated close to the surface of the accretion disk, the neutrino flux may have no unambiguously identifiable electromagnetic counterpart. This is because the electromagnetic power released in interactions of high-energy protons would only contribute to the heating of the disk surface and corona above the disk, rather than escape from the source. Given that the heat deposited in the corona is released in the hard X-ray range we notice that there still might be an "indirect" electromagnetic counterpart of the neutrino signal: the hard X-ray flux variability may be strongly or weakly correlated with the neutrino flux variations, depending on the importance of the high-energy proton heating in the disk/corona heat balance. If heating by high-energy protons provides a sizable contribution to the overall corona heating rate, the overall flux of diffuse GeV neutrino background from Seyfert galaxies may be comparable to the X-ray background flux and the high-energy tail of this background can provide a sizable contribution to the astrophysical neutrino flux in the TeV band.</description>

      <title>Proto-neutron star oscillations including accretion flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational wave signature from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is dominated by quadrupolar oscillation modes of the newly born proto-neutron star (PNS), and could be detectable at galactic distances. We have developed a framework for computing the normal oscillation modes of a PNS in general relativity, including, for the first time, the presence of an accretion flow and a surrounding stalled accretion shock. These new ingredients are key to understand PNS oscillation modes, in particular those related to the standing-accretion-shock instability (SASI). Their incorporation is an important step towards accurate PNS asteroseismology. For this purpose, we perform linear and adiabatic perturbations of a spherically symmetric background, in the relativistic Cowling approximation, and cast the resulting equations as an eigenvalue problem. We discretize the eigenvalue problem using collocation Chebyshev spectral methods, which is then solved by means of standard and efficient linear algebra methods. We impose boundary conditions at the accretion shock compatible with the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions. We present several numerical examples to assess the accuracy and convergence of the numerical code, as well as to understand the effect of an accretion flow on the oscillation modes, as a stepping stone towards a complete analysis of the CCSNe case.</description>

      <title>Stronger Constraints on Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter Derived from the Thermal Evolution of the Intergalactic Medium over the Last Twelve Billion Years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) have been explored as potential dark matter candidates, with various astrophysical observations placing upper limits on the fraction $f_\mathrm{PBH}$ of dark matter in the form of PBHs. However, a largely underutilized probe of PBH abundance is the temperature of the intergalactic medium (IGM), inferred from the thermal broadening of absorption lines in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest of quasar spectra. PBHs inject energy into the IGM via Hawking radiation, altering its thermal evolution. In this work, we constrain this energy injection by self-consistently modeling its interplay with the cosmological ultraviolet background from galaxies and supermassive black holes. Leveraging IGM temperature measurements spanning the past twelve billion years ($z \sim 0$ to $6$), we derive one of the most stringent constraints on PBH-induced heating from light PBHs within the mass range $10^{15}\unicode{x2013}10^{17}$ g. Specifically, for $M_\mathrm{PBH} = 10^{16}$ g, we find $f_\mathrm{PBH} &lt; 5 \times 10^{-5}$ at 95% confidence, with the bound scaling approximately as $M_\mathrm{PBH}^{4}$ at other masses. Our inclusion of helium reionization and low-redshift temperature measurements strengthens previous IGM-based PBH constraints by an order of magnitude or more. Compared to other existing limits, our result is among the strongest, second only to the constraints from the 511 keV line from the Galactic Centre, but with distinct systematics. More broadly, this study highlights the IGM thermal history as a powerful and independent probe of beyond-standard-model physics.</description>

      <title>Supernova production of axion-like particles coupling to electrons, reloaded</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the production of axion-like particles (ALPs) coupled to electrons at tree-level in a relativistic plasma. We explicitly demonstrate the equivalence between pseudoscalar and derivative couplings, incorporate previously neglected processes for the first time-namely, semi-Compton production ($\gamma e^-\rightarrow a e^-$) and pair annihilation ($e^+e^-\rightarrow a\gamma$)-and derive analytical expressions for the bremsstrahlung ($e^- N\to e^- N a$) production rate, enabling a more computationally efficient evaluation of the ALP flux. Additionally, we assess uncertainties in the production rate arising from electron thermal mass corrections, electron-electron Coulomb interactions, and the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect. The ALP emissivity is made available in a public repository as a function of the ALP mass, the temperature, and the electron chemical potential of the plasma. Finally, we examine the impact of ALP production and subsequent decays on astrophysical observables, deriving the leading bounds on ALPs coupling to electrons. At small couplings, the dominant constraints come from the previously neglected decay $a\to e^+ e^-\gamma$, except for a region of fireball formation where SN~1987A X-ray observations offer the best probe. At large couplings, bounds are dominated by the energy deposition argument, with a recently developed new prescription for the trapping regime.</description>

      <title>Search for continuous gravitational waves from neutron stars in five globular clusters with a phase-tracking hidden Markov model in the third LIGO observing run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A search is performed for continuous gravitational waves emitted by unknown neutron stars in five nearby globular clusters using data from the third Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) observing run, over the frequency range $100$--$800\,\mathrm{Hz}$. The search uses a hidden Markov model to track both the frequency and phase of the continuous wave signal from one coherent segment to the next. It represents the first time that a phase-tracking hidden Markov model has been used in a LIGO search. After applying vetoes to reject candidates consistent with non-Gaussian artifacts, no significant candidates are detected. Estimates of the strain sensitivity at 95\% confidence $h_{0,\mathrm{eff}}^{95\%}$ and corresponding neutron star ellipticity $\epsilon^{95\%}$ are presented. The best strain sensitivity, $h_{0,\mathrm{eff}}^{95\%} = 2.7 \times 10^{-26}$ at $211\,\mathrm{Hz}$, is achieved for the cluster NGC6544.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary stars are pairs of stars that are gravitationally bound, providing in some cases accurate measurements of their masses and radii. As such, they serve as excellent testbeds for the theory of stellar structure and evolution. Moreover, binary stars that orbit each other at a sufficiently small distance will interact during their lifetimes, leading to a multitude of different evolutionary pathways that are not present in single star evolution. Among other outcomes, this can lead to the production of stellar mergers, rejuvenated and chemically contaminated accreting stars, stars stripped of their hydrogen envelopes and gravitational wave sources. For stars massive enough to undergo a supernova, binary interaction is expected to impact the evolution of most of them, making the understanding of binary evolution a critical element to comprehend stellar populations and their impact at large scales.</description>

      <title>The First Model-Independent Chromatic Microlensing Search: No Evidence in the Gravitational Wave Catalog of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lensing of Gravitational Waves (GWs) due to intervening matter distribution in the universe can lead to chromatic and achromatic signatures in the wave-optics and geometrical-optics limit respectively. This makes it difficult to model for the unknown mass distribution of the lens and hence requires a model-independent lensing detection technique from GW data. We perform the first model-independent microlensing search in the wave-optics limit on the 80 GW events observed with both the LIGO detectors from the third observation catalog GWTC-3 of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA using the analysis method $\mu$-\texttt{GLANCE}. These unmodelled searches pick up one plausible candidate $\rm GW190408\_181802$ with a slightly above threshold residual amplitude compared to the residual expected from detector noise. However, exploring the microlensing modulation signatures on this event, we do not find any conclusive evidence of the microlensing signal in the data. With this, we confidently rule out the presence of any statistically significant microlensing signal in the 80 events of GWTC-3 in a model-independent way.</description>

      <title>Wolf-Rayet -- compact object binaries as progenitors of binary compact objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binaries with a Wolf-Rayet star and a compact object (WR-COs), either a black hole (BH) or a neutron star (NS), have been proposed as possible progenitors for the binary compact object mergers (BCOs) observed with the gravitational wave (GW) detectors. In this work, we use the open-source population synthesis code SEVN to investigate the role of WR-COs as BCO progenitors. We consider an initial population of $5 \times 10^6$ binaries and we evolve it across 96 combinations of metallicities, common envelope efficiencies, core-collapse supernova models and natal kick distributions. We find that WR-COs are the progenitors of most BCOs, especially at high and intermediate metallicity. At $Z=0.02,\,{}0.014,$ and $0.0014$, more than $\gtrsim 99 \%$ of all the BCOs in our simulations evolved as WR-COs. At $Z = 0.00014$, inefficient binary-stripping lowers the fraction of BCOs with WR-CO progenitors to $\approx 83-95 \%$. Despite their key role in BCO production, only $\approx 5-30 \%$ of WR-COs end their life as BCOs. We find that Cyg X-3, the only WR-CO candidate observed in the Milky Way, is a promising BCO progenitor, especially if it hosts a BH. In our simulations, about $\approx 70-100 \%$ of the Cyg X-3 - like systems in the WR-BH configuration (BH mass $ \leq 10 \rm ~ M_\odot$) are BCO progenitors, in agreement with the literature. Future observations of WR-COs similar to Cyg X-3 may be the Rosetta stone to interpret the formation of BCOs.</description>

      <title>Modeling of resistive relativistic astrophysical jets. Semianalytic results following a paraxial formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic jets of magnetized plasma are a common high-energy astrophysical phenomenon, observed across a wide range of spatial and energy scales. In the past, semianalytic meridionally self-similar models have proven highly successful in deciphering the intricate mechanisms that determine their acceleration, collimation, and morphological characteristics. In this work, we present a modification of this formalism based on the angular expansion of the equations of general-relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics in the vicinity of the jet axis for the description of resistive relativistic spine jets. Our paraxial formalism allows for the inclusion of resistivity and of a realistic, variable adiabatic index equation of state in the mathematical formulation. The electric potential gradient along poloidal magnetic field lines, caused by a gradient in the rotational angular velocity of the field lines, was identified as the mechanism behind the emergence of Ohmic dissipation in resistive jets. The semianalytic solutions that we present demonstrate that Ohmic dissipation is significant only over localized dissipation regions in resistive jets. Over the extent of these regions, Ohmic dissipation weakens the thermal acceleration mechanism and can even lead to the deceleration of these outflows. Additionally, the resistive jets display enhanced collimation and a strengthening of their toroidal magnetic fields over the dissipation regions, resulting in smaller asymptotic opening angles and a more helical magnetic field structure compared to their nonresistive counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) are likely sources of hadronic particle acceleration within our galaxy, contributing to the galactic cosmic ray flux. Next-generation instruments, such as the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO), will be of crucial importance in identifying new candidate SNRs. SWGO will observe two-thirds of the gamma-ray sky, covering the energy range between a few hundreds of GeV and a PeV. In this work, we apply a model of SNR evolution to a catalogue of SNRs in order to predict their gamma-ray spectra, explore the SNR emission phase space, and quantify detection prospects for SWGO. Finally, we validate our model for sources observed with current-generation instruments, fitting it using a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain technique to the observed gamma-ray emission from four SNRs. We anticipate that at least 6, and potentially as many as 11 SNRs will be detected by SWGO within 1 year.</description>

      <title>Limb-Brightened Jet in M87 from Anisotropic Nonthermal Electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very long baseline interferometry observations reveal that relativistic jets like the one in M87 have a limb-brightened, double-edged structure. Analytic and numerical models struggle to reproduce this limb-brightening. We propose a model in which we invoke anisotropy in the distribution function of synchrotron-emitting nonthermal electrons such that electron velocities are preferentially directed parallel to magnetic field lines, as suggested by recent particle-in-cell simulations of electron acceleration and the effects of synchrotron cooling. We assume that the energy injected into nonthermal electrons is proportional to the jet Poynting flux, and we account for synchrotron cooling via a broken power-law energy distribution. We implement our emission model in both general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and axisymmetric force-free electrodynamic (GRFFE) jet models and produce simulated jet images at multiple scales and frequencies using polarized general relativistic radiative transfer. We find that the synchrotron emission is concentrated parallel to the local helical magnetic field and that this feature produces limb-brightened jet images on scales ranging from tens of microarcseconds to hundreds of milliarcseconds in M87. We present theoretical predictions for horizon-scale M87 jet images at 230 and 345 GHz that can be tested with next generation instruments. Due to the scale-invariance of the GRMHD and GRFFE models, our emission prescription can be applied to other targets and serve as a foundation for a unified description of limb-brightened synchrotron images of extragalactic jets.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Multidimensional Models of Core-Collapse Supernovae: Progress and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-consistent, multidimensional core-collapse supernova (SN) simulations, especially in 3D, have achieved tremendous progress over the past 10 years. They are now able to follow the entire evolution from core collapse through bounce, neutrino-triggered shock revival, shock breakout at the stellar surface to the electromagnetic SN outburst and the subsequent SN remnant phase. Thus they provide general support for the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism by reproducing observed SN energies, neutron-star (NS) kicks, and diagnostically relevant radioactive isotope yields; they allow to predict neutrino and gravitational-wave signals for many seconds of proto-NS cooling; they confirm correlations between explosion and progenitor or remnant properties already expected from previous spherically symmetric (1D) and 2D models; and they carve out various scenarios for stellar-mass black-hole (BH) formation. Despite these successes it is currently unclear which stars explode or form BHs, because different modeling approaches disagree and suggest the possible importance of the 3D nature of the progenitors and of magnetic fields. The role of neutrino flavor conversion in SN cores still needs to be better understood, the nuclear equation of state including potential phase transitions implies major uncertainties, the SN 1987A neutrino measurements raise new puzzles, and tracing a possible correlation of NS spins and kicks requires still more refined SN simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SN 2023ixf is one of the brightest Core Collapse Supernovae of the 21st century and offers a rare opportunity to investigate the late stage of a Supernova through nebular phase spectroscopy. We present four nebular phase spectra from day +291 to +413 after explosion. This is supplemented with high cadence early phase spectroscopic observations and photometry covering the first 500 days to investigate explosion parameters. The narrow and blue-shifted nebular Oxygen emission lines are used to infer an ejected Oxygen mass of $&lt;0.65M_\odot$, consistent with models of a relatively low mass ($M_{ZAMS}&lt;15M_\odot$) progenitor. An energy of 0.3 to $1.4 \times10^{51}$ erg and a light curve powered by an initial $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.049 \pm 0.005 M_\odot$ appear consistent with a relatively standard Type II explosion, while an incomplete $\gamma$-ray trapping (with timescale of $240\pm4$ days) suggests a lower ejecta mass. Assuming a typical explosion, the broad Hydrogen and Calcium profiles suggest a common origin within a lower mass, partially stripped envelope. Hydrogen emission broadens with time, indicating contribution from an additional power source at an extended distance; while the emergence of high velocity ($\sim$6,000 km s$^{-1}$) Hydrogen emission features (beginning around day +200) may be explained by Shock Interaction with a dense Hydrogen-rich region located at $\sim1.5 \times 10^{16}$cm. Such envelope mass loss for a low mass progenitor may be explained through theoretical models of Binary interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light sterile neutrinos, $\nu_s$, are often introduced to explain an anomalous deficit in the electron antineutrino flux from nuclear reactors. If they exist, sterile neutrinos would also be produced in collapsing massive stars through the active-sterile neutrino oscillation. In order to investigate the impacts of sterile neutrinos on supernova dynamics, we perform two-dimensional neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations of stellar core-collapse coupled with the active-sterile oscillation. As the initial condition of our simulations, we adopt a blue supergiant model that is tuned to reproduce observational features of the SN 1987A progenitor to compare our models with observations of the event. It is found that the active-sterile oscillation reduces the $\nu_{e}$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ fluxes and decreases the explosion energy. We also find that, if the mixing angle $\theta$ and the mass difference $\delta m_\mathrm{s}^2$ between $\nu_e$ and $\nu_s$ are large enough, the star fails to explode. This suggests that these mixing parameters relevant to sterile neutrinos could be constrained by supernova explodability, though other uncertainties in supernova theory need to be addressed to refine them. In addition, we predict neutrino signals from a nearby supernova event and find that the neutrino event number can significantly decrease because the $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ fluxes are reduced. In particular, DUNE observations of $\nu_e$ will be useful to search for a signature of sterile neutrinos with a tiny mixing angle because a smaller mixing angle leads to a larger effect on the $\nu_e$ flux.</description>

      <title>The Anomalous Acceleration of PSR J2043+1711: Long-Period Orbital Companion or Stellar Flyby?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the rate of change of its orbital period, PSR J2043+1711 has a substantial peculiar acceleration of 3.5 $\pm$ 0.8 mm/s/yr, which deviates from the acceleration predicted by equilibrium Milky Way models at a $4\sigma$ level. The magnitude of the peculiar acceleration is too large to be explained by disequilibrium effects of the Milky Way interacting with orbiting dwarf galaxies ($\sim$1 mm/s/yr), and too small to be caused by period variations due to the pulsar being a redback. We identify and examine two plausible causes for the anomalous acceleration: a stellar flyby, and a long-period orbital companion. We identify a main-sequence star in \textit{Gaia} DR3 and Pan-STARRS DR2 with the correct mass, distance, and on-sky position to potentially explain the observed peculiar acceleration. However, the star and the pulsar system have substantially different proper motions, indicating that they are not gravitationally bound. However, it is possible that this is an unrelated star that just happens to be located near J2043+1711 along our line of sight (chance probability of 1.6\%). Therefore, we also constrain possible orbital parameters for a circumbinary companion in a hierarchical triple system with J2043+1711; the changes in the spindown rate of the pulsar are consistent with an outer object that has an orbital period of 80 kyr, a companion mass of 0.3 $M_\odot$ (indicative of a white dwarf or low-mass star), and a semi-major axis of 2000 AU. Continued timing and/or future faint optical observations of J2043+1711 may eventually allow us to differentiate between these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dark matter cooling during early matter-domination boosts sub-earth halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of an early matter-dominated epoch prior to the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis may lead to a scenario where the thermal dark matter cools faster than plasma before the radiation-dominated era begins. In the radiation-dominated epoch, dark matter free-streams after it decouples both chemically and kinetically from the plasma. In the presence of an early matter-dominated era, chemical decoupling of the dark matter may succeed by a partial kinetic decoupling before reheating ends, depending upon the contributions of different partial wave amplitudes in the elastic scattering rate of the dark matter. We show that the s-wave scattering is sufficient to partially decouple the dark matter from the plasma, if the entropy injection during the reheating era depends on the bath temperature, while p-wave scattering leads to full decoupling in such cosmological backdrop. The decoupling of dark matter before the end of reheating causes an additional amount of cooling, reducing its free-streaming horizon compared to the usual radiation-dominated cosmology. The enhanced matter perturbations for scales entering the horizon prior to the end of reheating, combined with the reduced free-steaming horizon, increase the number density of sub-earth mass halos. The resulting boost in the dark matter annihilation signatures could offer an intriguing probe to differentiate pre-BBN non-standard cosmological epochs. We show that the free-streaming horizon of the dark matter requires to be smaller than a cut-off to ensure a boost in the sub-earth halo populations. As case studies we present two examples: one for a scalar dark matter with $s$-wave elastic scattering and the other one featuring a fermionic dark matter with $p$-wave elastic scattering. We identify regions of parameter space in both models where the dark matter kinetically decouples during reheating, amplifying small-scale structure formation.</description>

      <title>Searching for MeV-mass neutrinophilic Dark Matter with Large Scale Dark Matter Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The indirect detection of dark matter (DM) through its annihilation products is one of the primary strategies for DM detection. One of the least constrained classes of models is neutrinophilic DM, because the annihilation products, weakly interacting neutrinos, are challenging to observe. Here, we consider a scenario where MeV-mass DM exclusively annihilates to the third neutrino mass eigenstate, which is predominantly of tau and muon flavor. In such a scenario, the potential detection rate of the neutrinos originating from the DM annihilation in our Galaxy in the conventional detectors would be suppressed by up to approximately two orders of magnitude. This is because the best sensitivity of such detectors for neutrinos with energies below approximately 100 MeV is for electron neutrino flavor. In this work, we highlight the potential of large-scale DM detectors in uncovering such signals in the tens of MeV range of DM masses. In addition, we discuss how coincident signals in direct detection DM experiments and upcoming neutrino detectors such as DUNE, Hyper-Kamiokande, and JUNO could provide new perspectives on the DM problem.</description>

      <title>Stealth black holes in Aether Scalar Tensor theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Aether Scalar Tensor (AeST) theory is an extension of general relativity(GR) successful at reproducing galactic rotational curves, gravitational lensing, linear large scale structure and cosmic microwave background power spectrum observations. We solve the most general static spherically symmetric vacuum equations in the strong-field regime of AeST and find two classes of stealth black hole solutions -- those with exact GR geometries -- containing non-trivial secondary hair. In particular, one of these can be continuously joined to the cosmological solution of AeST. We also derive a non-black hole solution with zero spatial component in the vector field. This result proves the existence of mathematically and observationally consistent candidates for black holes in AeST, and creates a basis for testing the theory in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>A new mass estimate method with hydrodynamical atmospheres for very massive WNh stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very massive stars with masses over 100 Msun are key objects in the Universe for our understanding of chemical and energetic feedback in the Universe, but their evolution and fate are almost entirely determined by their wind mass loss. We aim to determine the mass of the most massive star known in the Local Group R136a1. For this we compute the first hydrodynamically consistent non-local thermodynamical equilibrium atmosphere models for both R136a1 (WN5h) as well as the binary system R144 (WN5/6h+WN6/7h) in the Tarantula nebula. Using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet code, we simultaneously empirically derive and theoretically predict mass-loss rates and wind velocities. By fitting synthetic spectra derived from these models to multi-wavelength observations, we constrain the stellar and wind properties of R144 and R136a1. We first determine the clumping stratification required by our hydro-models to fit the spectra of R144 by using the available dynamical mass estimates for the two components. We then utilise this clumping stratification in hydrodynamic models of R136a1 and estimate a mass of $M_\mathrm{Hydro}$ of 233 Msun. Remarkably, the estimated mass is close to and entirely consistent with chemical homogeneous mass relations. This present-day mass of 233 Msun provides a lower limit to the initial stellar mass, that could be far higher due to previous wind mass loss.</description>

      <title>Probing the cosmic baryon distribution and the impact of AGN feedback with FRBs in CROCODILE simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Missing Baryon problem using Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) to trace cosmic baryons. We use the CROCODILE simulations with the GADGET3/4-OSAKA SPH code, incorporating star formation, supernova (SN), and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback. Light cones generated from large-scale structure simulations allow us to compute gas density profiles and dispersion measures (DMs) measurable by FRBs. Our results show that AGN feedback reduces central gas densities in halos, reshaping the boundary between the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and intergalactic medium (IGM). Zoom-in simulations further reveal that AGN feedback significantly modulates foreground halo DM contributions along different sightlines. By analyzing the DM--redshift (DM--z) relation and comparing it to the Macquart relation, we constrain the diffuse baryon mass fraction at z = 1 to fdiff = 0.865 (+0.101, -0.165) (fiducial) and fdiff = 0.856 (+0.101, -0.162) (NoBH), including IGM (fIGM) and halo (fHalos) contributions. We also quantify the redshift evolution of fdiff and fIGM, providing the fitting results. Our study provides a framework for understanding baryon distribution across cosmic structures, FRB host galaxies, and the role of AGN in shaping foreground DM contributions.</description>
