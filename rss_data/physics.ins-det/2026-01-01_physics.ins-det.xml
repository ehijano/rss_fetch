      <title>Control and read-out of the HEPD-02 tracking system onboard CSES-02 satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The High Energy Particle Detector (HEPD-02) is a payload of the second China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES-02), designed and built by the Italian Limadou collaboration. Its purpose is to detect cosmic rays and trapped particles of radiation belts, in the kinetic energy range 3-100 MeV for electrons, 30-200 MeV for protons. HEPD-02 is the first space detector to use a tracking detector based on Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS). The MAPS provides high spatial resolution, low noise, increased robustness, and low production costs. Operating MAPS in space presents a significant challenge due to strict power consumption requirements. To meet such constraints, a custom Tracker Data Acquisition (TDAQ) board and firmware have been designed and implemented, by using a commercial low-power Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). This paper addresses the design features of the TDAQ unit, enabling the tracking detector to be operated efficiently, with particular focus on the power consumption performance.</description>

      <title>Design, construction, and testing of the PandaX-xT cryogenics system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PandaX-xT is a next-generation experiment with broad scientific goals, including the search for dark matter, Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay, and astrophysical neutrinos, using a dual-phase time projection chamber with about 43 tons of liquid xenon. A new cryogenics system of the PandaX-xT is described in this paper. It is developed to handle large mass of liquid xenon efficiently and safely, including two cooling towers for normal operation and one liquid-nitrogen coil for emergency case. Each cooling tower equipped with an AL600 Gifford-McMahon cryocooler features a 1300 W heater, specifically designed to maintain the cold finger's temperature at the desired setpoint. The performance of the cooling tower and the coil has been tested. The cryogenics system with two cooling towers has achieved about 1900~W cooling power at 178~K. The liquid nitrogen coil provides emergency cooling power of more than 1500~W at liquid xenon temperature. For the prototype of a 1-tonne liquid xenon detector, the fluctuation of xenon saturated vapor pressure remains below 1 kPa over one month, while the pressure is around 210~kPa.</description>

      <title>Performance of an LYSO-Based Active Converter for a Photon Pair-Spectrometer aiming for 52.8 MeV photon detection in Future $\mu^+ \to e^+ \gamma$ Search Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For future $\mu^+ \to e^+ \gamma$ search experiments with a branching-ratio sensitivity of $10^{-15}$, we are developing a photon pair-spectrometer employing an active LYSO converter, aiming at target resolutions of 30 ps in timing and 200 keV in energy measurement for detecting 52.8 MeV photons. The converter generates electron-positron pairs from incident photons while simultaneously measuring their energy deposition and timing. On the basis of simulation studies, we optimized the converter thickness and segment dimensions, and accordingly fabricated prototype LYSO segments. Their single-MIP detection performance was evaluated using an electron beam at the KEK PF-AR test beamline. The prototypes exhibited excellent performance, achieving a time resolution of 25 ps and a light yield of $10^4$ photoelectrons, both substantially surpassing the design requirements.</description>

      <title>GPT-like transformer model for silicon tracking detector simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating physics processes and detector responses is essential in high energy physics and represents significant computing costs. Generative machine learning has been demonstrated to be potentially powerful in accelerating simulations, outperforming traditional fast simulation methods. The efforts have focused primarily on calorimeters. This work presents the very first studies on using neural networks for silicon tracking detectors simulation. The GPT-like transformer architecture is determined to be optimal for this task and applied in a fully generative way, ensuring full correlations between individual hits. Taking parallels from text generation, hits are represented as a flat sequence of feature values. The resulting tracking performance, evaluated on the Open Data Detector, is comparable with the full simulation.</description>

      <title>Fast reconstruction-based ROI triggering via anomaly detection in the CYGNO optical TPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical-readout Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) produce megapixel-scale images whose fine-grained topological information is essential for rare-event searches, but whose size challenges real-time data selection. We present an unsupervised, reconstruction-based anomaly-detection strategy for fast Region-of-Interest (ROI) extraction that operates directly on minimally processed camera frames. A convolutional autoencoder trained exclusively on pedestal images learns the detector noise morphology without labels, simulation, or fine-grained calibration. Applied to standard data-taking frames, localized reconstruction residuals identify particle-induced structures, from which compact ROIs are extracted via thresholding and spatial clustering. Using real data from the CYGNO optical TPC prototype, we compare two pedestal-trained autoencoder configurations that differ only in their training objective, enabling a controlled study of its impact. The best configuration retains (93.0 +/- 0.2)% of reconstructed signal intensity while discarding (97.8 +/- 0.1)% of the image area, with an inference time of approximately 25 ms per frame on a consumer GPU. The results demonstrate that careful design of the training objective is critical for effective reconstruction-based anomaly detection and that pedestal-trained autoencoders provide a transparent and detector-agnostic baseline for online data reduction in optical TPCs.</description>

      <title>A Low Background Beta Detection System using a Time Projection Chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) system for low-background beta radiation measurements. The system consists of a TPC with two-dimensional-strip readout Micromegas and an anti-coincidence detector with readout pads for cosmic ray veto. The detector system utilize an AGET-based waveform sampling system for data acquisition.
  The beta detection capability of the system was verified through experimental test using $^{90}$Sr beta source. Additionally, a dedicated simulation program based on Geant4 was developed to model the entire detection process, including responses to both the beta source and background radiation. Simulation results were compared with experimental data for both beta and background samples, showing good agreements.
  The simulation samples were utilized to optimize and train classification models for beta and background discrimination. By applying the selected model into test data, the system achieved a background rate of 0.49 $\rm cpm/cm^2$ while retaining more than 55% of $^{90}$Sr beta signals within a 7 cm diameter detection region. Further analysis revealed that approximately 70% of the background originates from environmental gamma radiation, while the remaining contribution mainly comes from intrinsic radioactivity of detector materials, particularly the FR-4 based field cage and readout plane. Based on the knowledge gained from the experiments and simulations, an optimization of the TPC system has been proposed, with simulation predicting a potential reduction of the background rate to 0.0012 $\rm cpm/cm^2$.</description>

      <title>Detector Response Matrices, Effective Areas, and Flash-Effective Areas for Radiation Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Detector Response Matrix (DRM) is a discrete representation of an instrument's Detector Response Function (DRF), which quantifies how many discrete energy depositions occur in a detector volume for a given distribution of particles incident on the detector. For simple radiation detectors that can count such energy depositions (such as scintillators, Proportional Counter Tubes (PCTs), etc), we consider the ideal counting DRF, $\mathbf{G}_\varphi (E_\mathrm{in}, E_\mathrm{dep})$, which relates the detector's counting histogram (number of energy depositions within a given channel) to an incident particles characterization, $\varphi$ (e.g. incident flux, fluence, intensity). From the counting DRF we can derive the counting DRM, the effective area, and the flash effective area (which measures the total energy deposited in the detector from a large, instantaneous fluence).</description>

      <title>Image-Plane Detection of Spatially Entangled Photon Pairs with a CMOS Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially entangled photon pairs (biphotons) generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion offer unique opportunities for quantum imaging, but image-plane biphoton correlations are difficult to observe with camera-based detectors. Previous camera-based biphoton imaging experiments have relied on photon-counting detection, which necessitates operation deep in the photon-sparse regime and requires extremely low dark rates.
  Here, we demonstrate the detection of spatial biphoton joint probability distributions in both the image plane and the pupil plane (also termed "near-field plane" and "far-field plane" respectively) using a conventional scientific CMOS camera operated in linear mode. We work at mesoscopic intensity levels, corresponding to a photon flux approximately four orders of magnitude higher than typical photon-counting approaches. From the measured image- and pupil plane correlations, we observe position and momentum correlations consistent with an EPR-type entanglement witness.
  A tailored correlation analysis suited for image plane imaging suppresses detector artifacts and intensity fluctuations, enabling acquisition with significantly fewer frames. Our results demonstrate that spatially entangled-light imaging can be performed efficiently with standard imaging hardware, extending quantum imaging techniques beyond the photon-counting regime.</description>

      <title>Optimal operating parameters for next-generation xenon gas time projection chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next-generation of neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) searches are targeting half-life sensitivities towards 10$^{27}$--10$^{28}$ years. Gaseous xenon time projection chamber (GXeTPC) detectors are a technology that may be able to meet this challenge due to their excellent background rejection power, scalability, and energy resolution. This paper explores how the design choices of a next-generation GXeTPC time projection chamber can impact the overall performance of the experiment. We study the performance of systems using xenon enriched in the isotope $^{136}$Xe or natural xenon, focusing on scenarios that incorporate one tonne of source isotope. The detector size, copper shielding mass, energy resolution, pressure, and diffusion amount are surveyed to evaluate the overall performance dependencies on these parameters. A detector optimized for using enriched xenon is preferred, with a factor of 10 lower background rate, driven by the large intrinsic backgrounds introduced by the copper shielding used in the detector. The performance of three types of gas TPC technologies was also explored based on different gas additives used to reduce diffusion to different levels. For all TPC technologies, we find background rates of a fraction of a count per tonne year in the region of interest are achievable. These performances are contingent on suitable energy resolution and event position placement in the drift direction being achieved for the specific detector technology. When factoring in the considerations for the construction of the detector in addition to the selection performance, there is no clear optimum pressure, with advantages and disadvantages if a high or low pressure default configuration is chosen.</description>

      <title>Constraints on inelastic dark matter from the CDEX-1B experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present limits on spin-independent inelastic weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP)-nucleus scattering using the 737.1 kg$\cdot$day dataset from the CDEX-1B experiment. Expected nuclear recoil spectra for various inelastic WIMP masses $m_\chi$ and mass splittings $\delta$ are calculated under the standard halo model. An accurate background model of CDEX-1B is constructed by simulating all major background sources. The model parameters are then determined through maximum likelihood estimation and Markov chain Monte Carlo fitting. The resulting 90\% confidence level upper limits on the WIMP-nucleon cross section $\sigma_{\mathrm{n}}$ exclude certain DAMA/LIBRA allowed regions: the $\chi^2 &lt; 4$ regions for $\delta &lt; 30$ keV at $m_\chi = 250$ GeV and the $\chi^2 &lt; 9$ region for $\delta &lt; 50$ keV at $m_\chi = 500$ GeV. The method is applicable to other inelastic dark matter scenarios, and the upcoming CDEX-50 experiment is expected to improve sensitivity by four orders of magnitude.</description>
