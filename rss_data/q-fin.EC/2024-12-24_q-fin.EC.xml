      <title>Unveiling the Role of Artificial Intelligence and Stock Market Growth in Achieving Carbon Neutrality in the United States: An ARDL Model Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the fact that climate change has become one of the most pressing problems in many countries in recent years, specialized research on how to mitigate climate change has been adopted by many countries. Within this discussion, the influence of advanced technologies in achieving carbon neutrality has been discussed. While several studies investigated how AI and Digital innovations could be used to reduce the environmental footprint, the actual influence of AI in reducing CO2 emissions (a proxy measuring carbon footprint) has yet to be investigated. This paper studies the role of advanced technologies in general, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and ICT use in particular, in advancing carbon neutrality in the United States, between 2021. Secondly, this paper examines how Stock Market Growth, ICT use, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and Population affect CO2 emissions using the STIRPAT model. After examining stationarity among the variables using a variety of unit root tests, this study concluded that there are no unit root problems across all the variables, with a mixed order of integration. The ARDL bounds test for cointegration revealed that variables in this study have a long-run relationship. Moreover, the estimates revealed from the ARDL model in the short- and long-run indicated that economic growth, stock market capitalization, and population significantly contributed to the carbon emissions in both the short-run and long-run. Conversely, AI and ICT use significantly reduced carbon emissions over both periods. Furthermore, findings were confirmed to be robust using FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR estimations. Furthermore, diagnostic tests indicated the absence of serial correlation, heteroscedasticity, and specification errors and, thus, the model was robust.</description>

      <title>(Mis)information diffusion and the financial market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the interplay between information diffusion in social networks and its impact on financial markets with an Agent-Based Model (ABM). Agents receive and exchange information about an observable stochastic component of the dividend process of a risky asset \`a la Grossman and Stiglitz. A small proportion of the network has access to a private signal about the component, which can be clean (information) or distorted (misinformation). Other agents are uninformed and can receive information only from their peers. All agents are Bayesian, adjusting their beliefs according to the confidence they have in the source of information. We examine, by means of simulations, how information diffuses in the network and provide a framework to account for delayed absorption of shocks, that are not immediately priced as predicted by classical financial models. We investigate the effect of the network topology on the resulting asset price and evaluate under which condition misinformation diffusion can make the market more inefficient.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Economic Agent-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economic agent-based models (ABMs) are becoming more and more data-driven, establishing themselves as increasingly valuable tools for economic research and policymaking. We propose to classify the extent to which an ABM is data-driven based on whether agent-level quantities are initialized from real-world micro-data and whether the ABM's dynamics track empirical time series. This paper discusses how making ABMs data-driven helps overcome limitations of traditional ABMs and makes ABMs a stronger alternative to equilibrium models. We review state-of-the-art methods in parameter calibration, initialization, and data assimilation, and then present successful applications that have generated new scientific knowledge and informed policy decisions. This paper serves as a manifesto for data-driven ABMs, introducing a definition and classification and outlining the state of the field, and as a guide for those new to the field.</description>

      <title>The impact of Egypt's accession to the BRICS group on the foreign exchange crisis in Egypt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigated the impact of Egypt's accession to the BRICS bloc by studying the participation rate of BRICS countries in Egypt, as well as the exposure rate and the ratio of foreign investment of BRICS countries in Egypt to the total foreign investment in Egypt, as well as Egypt's export opportunities in the BRICS markets and the impact of these variables on the ratio of foreign assets in Egypt during the period from 2000 to 2024, In order to predict the impact of Egypt's accession to the BRICS bloc in the coming years as well. The study used the ARDL model to determine the impact of the four independent variables on the dependent variable (foreign assets), which is the ratio of foreign assets. It also used automatic ARIMA model to predict the values of the study variables during the period from 2024 to 2030.</description>

      <title>Experimenting with Multi-modal Information to Predict Success of Indian IPOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With consistent growth in Indian Economy, Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) have become a popular avenue for investment. With the modern technology simplifying investments, more investors are interested in making data driven decisions while subscribing for IPOs. In this paper, we describe a machine learning and natural language processing based approach for estimating if an IPO will be successful. We have extensively studied the impact of various facts mentioned in IPO filing prospectus, macroeconomic factors, market conditions, Grey Market Price, etc. on the success of an IPO. We created two new datasets relating to the IPOs of Indian companies. Finally, we investigated how information from multiple modalities (texts, images, numbers, and categorical features) can be used for estimating the direction and underpricing with respect to opening, high and closing prices of stocks on the IPO listing day.</description>
