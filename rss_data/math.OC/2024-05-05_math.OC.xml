      <title>Bike network planning in limited urban space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of cycling infrastructure in urban environments hinders the adoption of cycling as a viable mode for commuting, despite the evident benefits of (e-)bikes as sustainable, efficient, and health-promoting transportation modes. Bike network planning is a tedious process, relying on heuristic computational methods that frequently overlook the broader implications of introducing new cycling infrastructure, in particular the necessity to repurpose car lanes. In this work, we call for optimizing the trade-off between bike and car networks, effectively pushing for Pareto optimality. This shift in perspective gives rise to a novel linear programming formulation towards optimal bike network allocation. Our experiments, conducted using both real-world and synthetic data, testify the effectiveness and superiority of this optimization approach compared to heuristic methods. In particular, the framework provides stakeholders with a range of lane reallocation scenarios, illustrating potential bike network enhancements and their implications for car infrastructure. Crucially, our approach is adaptable to various bikeability and car accessibility evaluation criteria, making our tool a highly flexible and scalable resource for urban planning. This paper presents an advanced decision-support framework that can significantly aid urban planners in making informed decisions on cycling infrastructure development.</description>

      <title>Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Koopman-based Optimal Control: Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm based on Gibbs sampling with parallel tempering to solve nonlinear optimal control problems. The algorithm is applicable to nonlinear systems with dynamics that can be approximately represented by a finite dimensional Koopman model, potentially with high dimension. This algorithm exploits linearity of the Koopman representation to achieve significant computational saving for large lifted states. We use a video-game to illustrate the use of the method.</description>

      <title>Learning equilibria in Cournot mean field games of controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Cournot mean field games of controls, a model originally developed for the production of an exhaustible resource by a continuum of producers. We prove uniqueness of the solution under general assumptions on the price function. Then, we prove convergence of a learning algorithm which gives existence of a solution to the mean field games system. The learning algorithm is implemented with a suitable finite difference discretization to get a numerical method to the solution. We supplement our theoretical analysis with several numerical examples and illustrate the impacts of model parameters.</description>

      <title>A cost function approximation method for dynamic vehicle routing with docking and LIFO constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a dynamic pickup and delivery problem with docking constraints. There is a homogeneous fleet of vehicles to serve pickup-and-delivery requests at given locations. The vehicles can be loaded up to their capacity, while unloading has to follow the last-in-first-out (LIFO) rule. The locations have a limited number of docking ports for loading and unloading, which may force the vehicles to wait. The problem is dynamic since the transportation requests arrive real-time, over the day. Accordingly, the routes of the vehicles are to be determined dynamically. The goal is to satisfy all the requests such that a combination of tardiness penalties and traveling costs is minimized. We propose a cost function approximation based solution method. In each decision epoch, we solve the respective optimization problem with a perturbed objective function to ensure the solutions remain adaptable to accommodate new requests. We penalize waiting times and idle vehicles. We propose a variable neighborhood search based method for solving the optimization problems, and we apply two existing local search operators, and we also introduce a new one. We evaluate our method using a widely adopted benchmark dataset, and the results demonstrate that our approach significantly surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider geodesically convex optimization problems involving distances to a finite set of points $A$ in a CAT(0) cubical complex. Examples include the minimum enclosing ball problem, the weighted mean and median problems, and the feasibility and projection problems for intersecting balls with centers in $A$. We propose a decomposition approach relying on standard Euclidean cutting plane algorithms. The cutting planes are readily derivable from efficient algorithms for computing geodesics in the complex.</description>

      <title>A Penalty-Based Guardrail Algorithm for Non-Decreasing Optimization with Inequality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional mathematical programming solvers require long computational times to solve constrained minimization problems of complex and large-scale physical systems. Therefore, these problems are often transformed into unconstrained ones, and solved with computationally efficient optimization approaches based on first-order information, such as the gradient descent method. However, for unconstrained problems, balancing the minimization of the objective function with the reduction of constraint violations is challenging. We consider the class of time-dependent minimization problems with increasing (possibly) nonlinear and non-convex objective function and non-decreasing (possibly) nonlinear and non-convex inequality constraints. To efficiently solve them, we propose a penalty-based guardrail algorithm (PGA). This algorithm adapts a standard penalty-based method by dynamically updating the right-hand side of the constraints with a guardrail variable which adds a margin to prevent violations. We evaluate PGA on two novel application domains: a simplified model of a district heating system and an optimization model derived from learned deep neural networks. Our method significantly outperforms mathematical programming solvers and the standard penalty-based method, and achieves better performance and faster convergence than a state-of-the-art algorithm (IPDD) within a specified time limit.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation in ODEs: assessing the potential of local and global solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of parameter estimation in dynamic systems described by ordinary differential equations. A review of the existing literature emphasizes the need for deterministic global optimization methods due to the nonconvex nature of these problems. Recent works have focused on expanding the capabilities of specialized deterministic global optimization algorithms to handle more complex problems. Despite advancements, current deterministic methods are limited to problems with a maximum of around five state and five decision variables, prompting ongoing efforts to enhance their applicability to practical problems.
  Our study seeks to assess the effectiveness of state-of-the-art general-purpose global and local solvers in handling realistic-sized problems efficiently, and evaluating their capabilities to cope with the nonconvex nature of the underlying estimation problems.</description>

      <title>On finding optimal collective variables for complex systems by minimizing the deviation between effective and full dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with collective variables, or reaction coordinates, that map a discrete-in-time Markov process $X_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to a (much) smaller dimension $k \ll d$. We define the effective dynamics under a given collective variable map $\xi$ as the best Markovian representation of $X_n$ under $\xi$. The novelty of the paper is that it gives strict criteria for selecting optimal collective variables via the properties of the effective dynamics. In particular, we show that the transition density of the effective dynamics of the optimal collective variable solves a relative entropy minimization problem from certain family of densities to the transition density of $X_n$. We also show that many transfer operator-based data-driven numerical approaches essentially learn quantities of the effective dynamics. Furthermore, we obtain various error estimates for the effective dynamics in approximating dominant timescales / eigenvalues and transition rates of the original process $X_n$ and how optimal collective variables minimize these errors. Our results contribute to the development of theoretical tools for the understanding of complex dynamical systems, e.g. molecular kinetics, on large timescales. These results shed light on the relations among existing data-driven numerical approaches for identifying good collective variables, and they also motivate the development of new methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Coverage Control on Surfaces Using Conformal Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time environmental monitoring using a multi-agent system (MAS) has long been a focal point of cooperative control. It is still a challenging task to provide cost-effective services for potential emergencies in surface environments. This paper explores the transformation of a general surface into a two-dimensional (2D) disk through the construction of a conformal mapping. Multiple agents are strategically deployed within the mapped convex disk, followed by mapping back to the original surface environment. This approach circumvents the complexities associated with handling the difficulties and intricacies of path planning. Technical analysis encompasses the design of distributed control laws and the method to eliminate distortions introduced by the mapping. Moreover, the developed coverage algorithm is applied to a scenario of monitoring surface deformation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper aims to investigate relevant computational issues of deep neural network architectures with an eye to the interaction between the optimization algorithm and the classification performance. In particular, we aim to analyze the behaviour of state-of-the-art optimization algorithms in relationship to their hyperparameters setting in order to detect robustness with respect to the choice of a certain starting point in ending on different local solutions. We conduct extensive computational experiments using nine open-source optimization algorithms to train deep Convolutional Neural Network architectures on an image multi-class classification task. Precisely, we consider several architectures by changing the number of layers and neurons per layer, in order to evaluate the impact of different width and depth structures on the computational optimization performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven approach to design a feedforward Neural Network (NN) controller with a stability guarantee for systems with unknown dynamics. We first introduce data-driven representations of stability conditions for Neural Feedback Loops (NFLs) with linear plants. These conditions are then formulated into a semidefinite program (SDP). Subsequently, this SDP constraint is integrated into the NN training process resulting in a stable NN controller. We propose an iterative algorithm to solve this problem efficiently. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its superiority compared to model-based methods via numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Regularized Q-learning through Robust Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new Q-learning variant, called 2RA Q-learning, that addresses some weaknesses of existing Q-learning methods in a principled manner. One such weakness is an underlying estimation bias which cannot be controlled and often results in poor performance. We propose a distributionally robust estimator for the maximum expected value term, which allows us to precisely control the level of estimation bias introduced. The distributionally robust estimator admits a closed-form solution such that the proposed algorithm has a computational cost per iteration comparable to Watkins' Q-learning. For the tabular case, we show that 2RA Q-learning converges to the optimal policy and analyze its asymptotic mean-squared error. Lastly, we conduct numerical experiments for various settings, which corroborate our theoretical findings and indicate that 2RA Q-learning often performs better than existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the moment matching techniques are adopted to obtain reduced-order closed-loop systems with reduced-order controllers that maintain the closed-loop stability and guarantee desired asymptotic performance, after revealing the relationship between the Internal Model Principle used in control design and the time-domain moment matching problem. As a result, the design of a low order controller can be done starting from considering the achieving of asymptotic performance as a moment matching problem, resulting in a reduced order closed-loop system.</description>

      <title>Optimization without retraction on the random generalized Stiefel manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization over the set of matrices that satisfy $X^\top B X = I_p$, referred to as the generalized Stiefel manifold, appears in many applications involving sampled covariance matrices such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and the generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP). Solving these problems is typically done by iterative methods, such as Riemannian approaches, which require a computationally expensive eigenvalue decomposition involving fully formed $B$. We propose a cheap stochastic iterative method that solves the optimization problem while having access only to a random estimate of the feasible set. Our method does not enforce the constraint in every iteration exactly, but instead it produces iterations that converge to a critical point on the generalized Stiefel manifold defined in expectation. The method has lower per-iteration cost, requires only matrix multiplications, and has the same convergence rates as its Riemannian counterparts involving the full matrix $B$. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in various machine learning applications involving generalized orthogonality constraints, including CCA, ICA, and GEVP.</description>

      <title>Robust Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning with Conditional Value-at-Risk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) have received significant research interest, offering an alternative to standard Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) that often assume fixed transition probabilities. RMDPs address this by optimizing for the worst-case scenarios within ambiguity sets. While earlier studies on RMDPs have largely centered on risk-neutral reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of minimizing expected total discounted costs, in this paper, we analyze the robustness of CVaR-based risk-sensitive RL under RMDP. Firstly, we consider predetermined ambiguity sets. Based on the coherency of CVaR, we establish a connection between robustness and risk sensitivity, thus, techniques in risk-sensitive RL can be adopted to solve the proposed problem. Furthermore, motivated by the existence of decision-dependent uncertainty in real-world problems, we study problems with state-action-dependent ambiguity sets. To solve this, we define a new risk measure named NCVaR and build the equivalence of NCVaR optimization and robust CVaR optimization. We further propose value iteration algorithms and validate our approach in simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Anisotropic Smoothing for Noisy Derivative-Free Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm that extends the methods of ball smoothing and Gaussian smoothing for noisy derivative-free optimization by accounting for the heterogeneous curvature of the objective function. The algorithm dynamically adapts the shape of the smoothing kernel to approximate the Hessian of the objective function around a local optimum. This approach significantly reduces the error in estimating the gradient from noisy evaluations through sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through numerical experiments on artificial problems. Additionally, we show improved performance when tuning NP-hard combinatorial optimization solvers compared to existing state-of-the-art heuristic derivative-free and Bayesian optimization methods.</description>

      <title>On Smale's 17th problem over the reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of efficiently solving a system of $n$ non-linear equations in ${\mathbb R}^d$. Addressing Smale's 17th problem stated in 1998, we consider a setting whereby the $n$ equations are random homogeneous polynomials of arbitrary degrees. In the complex case and for $n= d-1$, Beltr\'{a}n and Pardo proved the existence of an efficient randomized algorithm and Lairez recently showed it can be de-randomized to produce a deterministic efficient algorithm. Here we consider the real setting, to which previously developed methods do not apply. We describe an algorithm that efficiently finds solutions (with high probability) for $n= d -O(\sqrt{d\log d})$. If the maximal degree is very large, we also give an algorithm that works up to $n=d-1$.</description>

      <title>A Feedback Linearized Model Predictive Control Strategy for Input-Constrained Self-Driving Cars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel real-time affordable solution to the trajectory tracking control problem for self-driving cars subject to longitudinal and steering angular velocity constraints. To this end, we develop a dual-mode Model Predictive Control (MPC) solution starting from an input-output feedback linearized description of the vehicle kinematics. First, we derive the state-dependent input constraints acting on the linearized model and characterize their worst-case time-invariant inner approximation. Then, a dual-mode MPC is derived to be real-time affordable and ensuring, by design, constraints fulfillment, recursive feasibility, and uniformly ultimate boundedness of the tracking error in an ad-hoc built robust control invariant region. The approach's effectiveness and performance are experimentally validated via laboratory experiments on a Quanser Qcar. The obtained results show that the proposed solution is computationally affordable and with tracking capabilities that outperform two alternative control schemes.</description>

      <title>Early years of Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithms: A systematic review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis focusing on Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithms (BRKGA). BRKGA is a metaheuristic framework that uses random-key-based chromosomes with biased, uniform, and elitist mating strategies alongside a genetic algorithm. This review encompasses around~250 papers, covering a diverse array of applications ranging from classical combinatorial optimization problems to real-world industrial scenarios, and even non-traditional applications like hyperparameter tuning in machine learning and scenario generation for two-stage problems. In summary, this study offers a comprehensive examination of the BRKGA metaheuristic and its various applications, shedding light on key areas for future research.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective Optimal Trade-off Between V2G Activities and Battery Degradation in Electric Mobility-as-a-Service Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents optimization models for electric Mobility-as-a-Service systems, whereby electric vehicles not only provide on-demand mobility, but also perform charging and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) operations to enhance the fleet operator profitability. Specifically, we formulate the optimal fleet operation problem as a mixed-integer linear program, with the objective combining of operational costs and revenues generated from servicing requests and grid electricity sales. Our cost function explicitly captures battery price and degradation, reflecting their impact on the fleet total cost of ownership due to additional charging and discharging activities. Simulation results for Eindhoven, The Netherlands, show that integrating V2G activities does not compromise the number of travel requests being served. Moreover, we emphasize the significance of accounting for battery degradation, as the costs associated with it can potentially outweigh the revenues stemming from V2G operations.</description>

      <title>Experimental jet control with Bayesian optimization and persistent data topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study experimentally optimizes the mixing of a turbulent jet at $Re=10000$ with the surrounding air by targeted shear layer actuation. The forcing is composed of superposed harmonic signals of different azimuthal wavenumber $m$ generated by eight loudspeakers circumferentially distributed around the nozzle lip. Amplitudes and frequencies of the individual harmonic contributions serve as optimization parameters and the time-averaged centerline velocity downstream of the potential core is used as a metric for mixing optimization. The actuation is optimized through Bayesian optimization. Three search spaces are explored - axisymmetric forcing, $m=0$, superposed axisymmetric and helical forcing, $m \in \{0,1\}$, and axisymmetric actuation combined with two counter-rotating helical modes, $m \in \{-1,0,1\}$. High-speed PIV is employed to analyze the jet response to the optimized forcing. The optimization processes are analyzed by persistent data topology. In the search space of axisymmetric excitation, the routine identifies an actuation at the natural frequency of the flow to be most efficient, with the centerline velocity being decreased by $15\%$. The optimal solutions in both the two-mode and three-mode search space converge to a similar forcing with one axial and one helical mode combined at a frequency ratio of around $2.3$. Spectral analysis of the PIV images reveals that for the identified optimal forcing frequencies, a non-linear interaction between forced and natural structures in the jet flow is triggered, leading to a reduction in centerline velocity of around $35\%$. The topology of the most complex search space from the discrete data reveals four basins of attractions, classified into three forcing patterns including axisymmetric, axisym.-helical, and axisym.-flapping. Two deep basins are related to the optimal axisym.-helical pattern, and the others are shallower.</description>

      <title>Zero-Sum Positional Differential Games as a Framework for Robust Reinforcement Learning: Deep Q-Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust Reinforcement Learning (RRL) is a promising Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm aimed at training robust to uncertainty or disturbances models, making them more efficient for real-world applications. Following this paradigm, uncertainty or disturbances are interpreted as actions of a second adversarial agent, and thus, the problem is reduced to seeking the agents' policies robust to any opponent's actions. This paper is the first to propose considering the RRL problems within the positional differential game theory, which helps us to obtain theoretically justified intuition to develop a centralized Q-learning approach. Namely, we prove that under Isaacs's condition (sufficiently general for real-world dynamical systems), the same Q-function can be utilized as an approximate solution of both minimax and maximin Bellman equations. Based on these results, we present the Isaacs Deep Q-Network algorithms and demonstrate their superiority compared to other baseline RRL and Multi-Agent RL algorithms in various environments.</description>

Abstract: We propose a general framework for studying optimal issue of CAT bonds in the presence of uncertainty on the parameters. In particular, the intensity of arrival of natural disasters is inhomogeneous and may depend on unknown parameters. Given a prior on the distribution of the unknown parameters, we explain how it should evolve according to the classical Bayes rule. Taking these progressive prior-adjustments into account, we characterize the optimal policy through a quasi-variational parabolic equation, which can be solved numerically. We provide examples of application in the context of hurricanes in Florida.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.05726v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Cut-and-Play, a practically-efficient algorithm for computing Nash equilibria in simultaneous non-cooperative games where players decide via nonconvex and possibly unbounded optimization problems with separable payoff functions. Our algorithm exploits an intrinsic relationship between the equilibria of the original nonconvex game and the ones of a convexified counterpart. In practice, Cut-and-Play formulates a series of convex approximations of the game and iteratively refines them with cutting planes and branching operations. Our algorithm does not require convexity or continuity of the player's optimization problems and can be integrated with existing optimization software. We test Cut-and-Play on two families of challenging nonconvex games involving discrete decisions and bilevel problems, and we empirically demonstrate that it efficiently computes equilibria while outperforming existing game-specific algorithms.</description>

      <title>Rank-one Boolean tensor factorization and the multilinear polytope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.07053v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the NP-hard problem of finding the closest rank-one binary tensor to a given binary tensor, which we refer to as the rank-one Boolean tensor factorization (BTF) problem. This optimization problem can be used to recover a planted rank-one tensor from noisy observations. We formulate rank-one BTF as the problem of minimizing a linear function over a highly structured multilinear set. Leveraging on our prior results regarding the facial structure of multilinear polytopes, we propose novel linear programming relaxations for rank-one BTF. We then establish deterministic sufficient conditions under which our proposed linear programs recover a planted rank-one tensor. To analyze the effectiveness of these deterministic conditions, we consider a semi-random model for the noisy tensor, and obtain high probability recovery guarantees for the linear programs. Our theoretical results as well as numerical simulations indicate that certain facets of the multilinear polytope significantly improve the recovery properties of linear programming relaxations for rank-one BTF.</description>

      <title>The superiorization method with restarted perturbations for split minimization problems with an application to radiotherapy treatment planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05663v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the split minimization problem that consists of two constrained minimization problems in two separate spaces that are connected via a linear operator that maps one space into the other. To handle the data of such a problem we develop a superiorization approach that can reach a feasible point with reduced (not necessarily minimal) objective function values. The superiorization methodology is based on interlacing the iterative steps of two separate and independent iterative processes by perturbing the iterates of one process according to the steps dictated by the other process. We include in our developed method two novel elements. The first one is the permission to restart the perturbations in the superiorized algorithm which results in a significant acceleration and increases the computational efficiency. The second element is the ability to independently superiorize subvectors. This caters to the needs of real-world applications, as demonstrated here for a problem in intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment planning.</description>

      <title>Parabolic Regularity of Spectral Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the second-order variational analysis of spectral functions. It is well-known that spectral functions can be expressed as a composite function of symmetric functions and eigenvalue functions. We establish several second-order properties of spectral functions when their associated symmetric functions enjoy these properties. Our main attention is given to characterize parabolic regularity for this class of functions. It was observed recently that parabolic regularity can play a central rule in ensuring the validity of important second-order variational properties such as twice epi-differentiability. We demonstrates that for convex spectral functions, their parabolic regularity amounts to that of their symmetric functions. As an important consequence, we calculate the second subderivative of convex spectral functions, which allows us to establish second-order optimality conditions for a class of matrix optimization problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a variant of the circumcenter method for the Convex Feasibility Problem (CFP), ensuring finite convergence under a Slater assumption. The method replaces exact projections onto the convex sets with projections onto separating halfspaces, perturbed by positive exogenous parameters that decrease to zero along the iterations. If the perturbation parameters decrease slowly enough, such as the terms of a diverging series, finite convergence is achieved. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first circumcenter method for CFP that guarantees finite convergence.</description>

      <title>Relating Electric Vehicle Charging to Speed Scaling with Job-Specific Speed Limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the ongoing electrification of transport in combination with limited power grid capacities, efficient ways to schedule the charging of electric vehicles (EVs) are needed for the operation of, for example, large parking lots. Common approaches such as model predictive control repeatedly solve a corresponding offline problem. In this work, we first present and analyze the Flow-based Offline Charging Scheduler (FOCS), an offline algorithm to derive an optimal EV charging schedule for a fleet of EVs that minimizes an increasing, convex and differentiable function of the corresponding aggregated power profile. To this end, we relate EV charging to processor speed scaling models with job-specific speed limits. We prove our algorithm to be optimal and derive necessary and sufficient conditions for any EV charging profile to be optimal. Furthermore, we discuss two online algorithms and their competitive ratios for a specific class objective functions. In particular, we show that if those algorithms are applied and adapted to the presented EV scheduling problem, the competitive ratios for Average Rate and Optimal Available match those of the classical speed scaling problem. Finally, we present numerical results using real-world EV charging data to put the theoretical competitive ratios into a practical perspective.</description>

Abstract: We present the development and analysis of a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed to solve continuous-space mean field game (MFG) and mean field control (MFC) problems in a unified manner. The proposed approach pairs the actor-critic (AC) paradigm with a representation of the mean field distribution via a parameterized score function, which can be efficiently updated in an online fashion, and uses Langevin dynamics to obtain samples from the resulting distribution. The AC agent and the score function are updated iteratively to converge, either to the MFG equilibrium or the MFC optimum for a given mean field problem, depending on the choice of learning rates. A straightforward modification of the algorithm allows us to solve mixed mean field control games (MFCGs). The performance of our algorithm is evaluated using linear-quadratic benchmarks in the asymptotic infinite horizon framework.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on the distributed online convex optimization problem with time-varying inequality constraints over a network of agents, where each agent collaborates with its neighboring agents to minimize the cumulative network-wide loss over time. To reduce communication overhead between the agents, we propose a distributed event-triggered online primal-dual algorithm over a time-varying directed graph. With several classes of appropriately chose decreasing parameter sequences and non-increasing event-triggered threshold sequences, we establish dynamic network regret and network cumulative constraint violation bounds. Finally, a numerical simulation example is provided to verify the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we newly formulate and solve the optimal density control problem with Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) terminal cost in discrete-time linear Gaussian systems. Differently from the Wasserstein or Kullback-Leibler distances employed in the existing works, the GW distance quantifies the difference in shapes of the distribution, which is invariant under translation and rotation. Consequently, our formulation allows us to find small energy inputs that achieve the desired shape of the terminal distribution, which has practical applications, e.g., robotic swarms. We demonstrate that the problem can be reduced to a Difference of Convex (DC) programming, which is efficiently solvable through the DC algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we confirm that the state distribution reaches the terminal distribution that can be realized with the minimum control energy among those having the specified shape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.12416v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently introduced distributed zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) algorithms have shown their utility in distributed reinforcement learning (RL). Unfortunately, in the gradient estimation process, almost all of them require random samples with the same dimension as the global variable and/or require evaluation of the global cost function, which may induce high estimation variance for large-scale networks. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed zeroth-order algorithm by leveraging the network structure inherent in the optimization objective, which allows each agent to estimate its local gradient by local cost evaluation independently, without use of any consensus protocol. The proposed algorithm exhibits an asynchronous update scheme, and is designed for stochastic non-convex optimization with a possibly non-convex feasible domain based on the block coordinate descent method. The algorithm is later employed as a distributed model-free RL algorithm for distributed linear quadratic regulator design, where a learning graph is designed to describe the required interaction relationship among agents in distributed learning. We provide an empirical validation of the proposed algorithm to benchmark its performance on convergence rate and variance against a centralized ZOO algorithm.</description>

      <title>Compressed sensing for inverse problems and the sample complexity of the sparse Radon transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compressed sensing allows for the recovery of sparse signals from few measurements, whose number is proportional to the sparsity of the unknown signal, up to logarithmic factors. The classical theory typically considers either random linear measurements or subsampled isometries and has found many applications, including accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, which is modeled by the subsampled Fourier transform. In this work, we develop a general theory of infinite-dimensional compressed sensing for abstract inverse problems, possibly ill-posed, involving an arbitrary forward operator. This is achieved by considering a generalized restricted isometry property, and a quasi-diagonalization property of the forward map.
  As a notable application, for the first time, we obtain rigorous recovery estimates for the sparse Radon transform (i.e., with a finite number of angles $\theta_1,\dots,\theta_m$), which models computed tomography, in both the parallel-beam and the fan-beam settings. In the case when the unknown signal is $s$-sparse with respect to an orthonormal basis of compactly supported wavelets, we prove stable recovery under the condition \[ m\gtrsim s, \] up to logarithmic factors.</description>

Abstract: Adversarial robustness and generalization are both crucial properties of reliable machine learning models. In this letter, we study these properties in the context of quantum machine learning based on Lipschitz bounds. We derive parameter-dependent Lipschitz bounds for quantum models with trainable encoding, showing that the norm of the data encoding has a crucial impact on the robustness against data perturbations. Further, we derive a bound on the generalization error which explicitly involves the parameters of the data encoding. Our theoretical findings give rise to a practical strategy for training robust and generalizable quantum models by regularizing the Lipschitz bound in the cost. Further, we show that, for fixed and non-trainable encodings, as those frequently employed in quantum machine learning, the Lipschitz bound cannot be influenced by tuning the parameters. Thus, trainable encodings are crucial for systematically adapting robustness and generalization during training. The practical implications of our theoretical findings are illustrated with numerical results.</description>

      <title>Koopman-based feedback design with stability guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method to design a state-feedback controller ensuring exponential stability for nonlinear systems using only measurement data. Our approach relies on Koopman-operator theory and uses robust control to explicitly account for approximation errors due to finitely many data samples. To simplify practical usage across various applications, we provide a tutorial-style exposition of the feedback design and its stability guarantees for single-input systems. Moreover, we extend this controller design to multi-input systems and more flexible nonlinear state-feedback controllers using gain-scheduling techniques to increase the guaranteed region of attraction. As the proposed controller design is framed as a semidefinite program, it allows for an efficient solution. Further, we enhance the geometry of the region of attraction through a heuristic algorithm that establishes a connection between the employed Koopman lifting and the dynamics of the system. Finally, we validate the proposed feedback design procedure by means of numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Optimal Power Flow Pursuit via Feedback-based Safe Gradient Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of controlling the operation of inverter-interfaced distributed energy resources (DERs) in a distribution grid, to achieve operational and performance goals with limited system-level information. We develop an online feedback optimization method to drive the DERs' power setpoints to solutions of an AC optimal power flow (OPF) problem based only on voltage measurements (and without requiring measurements of the power consumption of non-controllable assets). The proposed method - grounded on the theory of control barrier functions - is based on a continuous approximation of the projected gradient flow, appropriately modified to accommodate measurements from the power network. We provide results in terms of local exponential stability, and assess the robustness to errors in the measurements and in the system Jacobian matrix. We show that the proposed method ensures anytime satisfaction of the voltage constraints when no model and measurement errors are present; if these errors are present and are small, the voltage violation is practically negligible. We also discuss extensions of the framework to virtual power plant setups. Numerical experiments on a 93-bus distribution system and with realistic load and production profiles show a superior performance in terms of voltage regulation relative to existing methods.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Optimization Studies of Group Centrality Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Centrality metrics have become a popular concept in network science and optimization. Over the years, centrality has been used to assign importance and identify influential elements in various settings, including transportation, infrastructure, biological, and social networks, among others. That said, most of the literature has focused on nodal versions of centrality. Recently, group counterparts of centrality have started attracting scientific and practitioner interest. The identification of sets of nodes that are influential within a network is becoming increasingly more important. This is even more pronounced when these sets of nodes are required to induce a certain motif or structure. In this study, we review group centrality metrics from an operations research and optimization perspective for the first time. This is particularly interesting due to the rapid evolution and development of this area in the operations research community over the last decade. We first present a historical overview of how we have reached this point in the study of group centrality. We then discuss the different structures and motifs that appear prominently in the literature, alongside the techniques and methodologies that are popular. We finally present possible avenues and directions for future work, mainly in three areas: (i) probabilistic metrics to account for randomness along with stochastic optimization techniques; (ii) structures and relaxations that have not been yet studied; and (iii) new emerging applications that can take advantage of group centrality. Our survey offers a concise review of group centrality and its intersection with network analysis and optimization.</description>

      <title>The Privacy Power of Correlated Noise in Decentralized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized learning is appealing as it enables the scalable usage of large amounts of distributed data and resources (without resorting to any central entity), while promoting privacy since every user minimizes the direct exposure of their data. Yet, without additional precautions, curious users can still leverage models obtained from their peers to violate privacy. In this paper, we propose Decor, a variant of decentralized SGD with differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Essentially, in Decor, users securely exchange randomness seeds in one communication round to generate pairwise-canceling correlated Gaussian noises, which are injected to protect local models at every communication round. We theoretically and empirically show that, for arbitrary connected graphs, Decor matches the central DP optimal privacy-utility trade-off. We do so under SecLDP, our new relaxation of local DP, which protects all user communications against an external eavesdropper and curious users, assuming that every pair of connected users shares a secret, i.e., an information hidden to all others. The main theoretical challenge is to control the accumulation of non-canceling correlated noise due to network sparsity. We also propose a companion SecLDP privacy accountant for public use.</description>
