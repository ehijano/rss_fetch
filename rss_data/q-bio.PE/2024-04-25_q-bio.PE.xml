      <title>A Minimal Framework for Optimizing Vaccination Protocols Targeting Highly Mutable Pathogens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A persistent public health challenge is finding immunization schemes that are effective in combating highly mutable pathogens such as HIV and influenza viruses. To address this, we analyze a simplified model of affinity maturation, the Darwinian evolutionary process B cells undergo during immunization. The vaccination protocol dictates selection forces that steer affinity maturation to generate antibodies. We focus on determining the optimal selection forces exerted by a generic time-dependent vaccination protocol to maximize production of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that can protect against a broad spectrum of pathogen strains. The model lends itself to a path integral representation and operator approximations within a mean-field limit, providing guiding principles for optimizing time-dependent vaccine-induced selection forces to enhance bnAb generation. We compare our analytical mean-field results with the outcomes of stochastic simulations and discuss their similarities and differences.</description>

      <title>Seed Selection in the Heterogeneous Moran Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Moran process is a classic stochastic process that models the rise and takeover of novel traits in network-structured populations. In biological terms, a set of mutants, each with fitness $m\in(0,\infty)$ invade a population of residents with fitness $1$. Each agent reproduces at a rate proportional to its fitness and each offspring replaces a random network neighbor. The process ends when the mutants either fixate (take over the whole population) or go extinct. The fixation probability measures the success of the invasion. To account for environmental heterogeneity, we study a generalization of the Standard process, called the Heterogeneous Moran process. Here, the fitness of each agent is determined both by its type (resident/mutant) and the node it occupies. We study the natural optimization problem of seed selection: given a budget $k$, which $k$ agents should initiate the mutant invasion to maximize the fixation probability? We show that the problem is strongly inapproximable: it is $\mathbf{NP}$-hard to distinguish between maximum fixation probability 0 and 1. We then focus on mutant-biased networks, where each node exhibits at least as large mutant fitness as resident fitness. We show that the problem remains $\mathbf{NP}$-hard, but the fixation probability becomes submodular, and thus the optimization problem admits a greedy $(1-1/e)$-approximation. An experimental evaluation of the greedy algorithm along with various heuristics on real-world data sets corroborates our results.</description>
