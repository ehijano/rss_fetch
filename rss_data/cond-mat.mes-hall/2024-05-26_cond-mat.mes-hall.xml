      <title>The nuclear-spin dark state in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the formation of a nuclear-spin dark state in a gate-defined silicon double quantum dot. The dark state has been predicted to emerge during dynamic nuclear polarization when the electrons in the quantum dot drive the nuclei in the semiconductor into a decoupled state. We show that, as expected, the electron-nuclear coupling rapidly diminishes in the dark state, and that this state depends on the synchronized precession of the nuclear spins. Moreover, the dark state significantly increases the lifetimes of electronic spin states. This nuclear-spin dark state could be used as a quantum memory or as a resource for quantum sensing, and further studies of the dark state may point the way toward increased polarization of nuclear spin ensembles.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced strong zero modes in short quantum dot chains with time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the emergence of strong zero modes in a two-site chain consisting of two quantum dots coupled due to a central dot that mediates electron hopping and singlet superconducting pairing. In the presence of time-reversal symmetry, the on-site Coulomb interaction leads to a three-fold ground-state degeneracy when tuning the system to a sweet spot as a function of the inter-dot couplings. This degeneracy is protected against changes of the dot energies in the same way as "poor man's'' Majorana bound states in short Kitaev chains. In the limit of strong interactions, this protection is maximal and the entire spectrum becomes triply degenerate, indicating the emergence of a ''poor man's'' version of a strong zero mode. We explain the degeneracy and protection by constructing corresponding Majorana Kramers-pair operators and $\mathbb{Z}_3$-parafermion operators. The strong zero modes share many properties of Majorana bound states in short Kitaev chains, including the stability of zero-bias peaks in the conductance and the behavior upon coupling to an additional quantum dot. However, they can be distinguished through finite-bias spectroscopy and the exhibit a different behavior when scaling to longer chains.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional electrons at internal and twistronic twin boundaries of van der Waals ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (MX$_2$) occur in 2H and rhombohedral polytypes, respectively distinguished by anti-parallel and parallel orientation of consecutive monolayer lattices. In its bulk form, rhombohedral MX$_2$ is ferroelectric, hosting an out-of-plane electric polarization, the direction of which is dictated by stacking. Here, we predict that twin boundaries, separating adjacent polarization domains with reversed built-in electric fields, are able to host two-dimensional electrons and holes with an areal density reaching $\sim 10^{13} {\rm cm}^{-2}$. Our modelling suggests that n-doped twin boundaries have a more promising binding energy than p-doped ones, whereas hole accumulation is stable at external surfaces of a twinned film. We also propose that the introduction of a twist at the twinned interface, with a `magic' angle $\theta^* \approx 3^{\circ}$, should promote a regime of strongly correlated states of electrons, such as Wigner crystals, due to commensurability between the moir\'e pattern at the interface and the accumulated carrier density.</description>

      <title>Imaging topological polar structures in marginally twisted 2D semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moire superlattices formed in van der Waals heterostructures due to twisting, lattice mismatch and strain present an opportunity for creating novel metamaterials with unique properties not present in the individual layers themselves. Ferroelectricity for example, arises due to broken inversion symmetry in twisted and strained bilayers of 2D semiconductors with stacking domains of alternating out-of-plane polarization. However, understanding the individual contributions of twist and strain to the formation of topological polar nanostructures remains to be established and has proven to be experimentally challenging. Inversion symmetry breaking has been predicted to give rise to an in-plane component of polarization along the domain walls, leading to the formation of a network of topologically non-trivial merons (half-skyrmions) that are Bloch-type for twisted and Neel-type for strained systems. Here we utilise angle-resolved, high-resolution vector piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) to spatially resolve polarization components and topological polar nanostructures in marginally twisted bilayer WSe2, and provide experimental proof for the existence of topologically non-trivial meron/antimeron structures. We observe both Bloch-type and Neel-type merons, allowing us to differentiate between moire superlattices formed due to twist or heterogeneous strain. This first demonstration of non-trivial real-space topology in a twisted van der Waals heterostructure opens pathways for exploring the connection between twist and topology in engineered nano-devices.</description>

      <title>Multi-Orbital Interactions and Spin Polarization in Single Rare-Earth Adatoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface-adsorbed rare-earth nanostructures are ideal platforms to investigate the interplay between intra-atomic interactions and multi-orbital spin configurations. However, addressing these properties has posed severe experimental and theoretical challenges. Here, we use the orbital selectivity offered by X-ray absorption spectroscopy to quantify the Coulomb integrals of Nd atoms on conductive surfaces, as well as the variation of individual orbital occupation upon cluster nucleation. Using X-ray magnetic circular dichroism we identify magnetic moments of the order of \MK{few tens of}~$\mu_{\rm{B}}$ at the $5d$ orbitals and their magnetic coupling with the $4f$ spins. Our results validate orbital-resolved X-ray spectroscopy as a reliable method for quantifying complex multi-orbital interactions in surface-adsorbed lanthanides.</description>

      <title>Electric Hall Effect and Quantum Electric Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring new Hall effect is always a fascinating research topic. The ordinary Hall effect and the quantum Hall effect, initially discovered in two-dimensional (2D) non-magnetic systems, are the phenomena that a transverse current is generated when a system carrying an electron current is placed in a magnetic field perpendicular to the currents. In this work, we propose the electric counterparts of these two Hall effects, termed as electric Hall effect (EHE) and quantum electric Hall effect (QEHE). The EHE and QEHE emerge in 2D magnetic systems, where the transverse current is generated by applying an electric gate-field instead of a magnetic field. We present a symmetry requirement for intrinsic EHE and QEHE. With a weak gate-field, we establish an analytical expression of the intrinsic EHE coefficient. We show that it is determined by intrinsic band geometric quantities: Berry curvature and its polarizability which consists of both intraband and interband layer polarization. Via first-principles calculations, we investigate the EHE in the monolayer Ca(FeN)$_2$, where significant EHE coefficient is observed around band crossings. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the QEHE can appear in the semiconductor monolayer $\rm BaMn_2S_3$, of which the Hall conductivity exhibits steps that take on the quantized values $0$ and $\pm1$ in the unit of $e^2/h$ by varying the gate-field within the experimentally achievable range. Due to the great tunability of the electric gate-field, the EHE and QEHE proposed here can be easily controlled and should have more potential applications.</description>

      <title>Super-diffusive transport in two-dimensional Fermionic wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional model of a Fermionic wire in contact with reservoirs along its two opposite edges. With the reservoirs biased around a Fermi level, $E$, we study the scaling of the conductance of the wire with its length, $L$ as the width of the wire $W\rightarrow\infty$. The wire is disordered along the direction of the transport so the conductance is expected to exponentially decay with the length of the wire. However, we show that our model shows a super-diffusive scaling ($1/L^{1/2}$) of the conductance within $|E|&lt;E_c$. This behavior is attributed to the presence of eigenstates of diverging localization length as $W\rightarrow\infty$. At $|E|=E_c$, the conductance behavior is sensitive to the disorder and scales sub-diffusively as $1/L^{3/2}$, and $1/L^{5/2}$ for zero and nonzero expectation value of the disorder. Furthermore, at this Fermi level and at certain points in the parameter space of the wire, the behavior of the conductance is also sensitive to the sign of the expectation value of the disorder. At these points we find $1/L^{7/4}$ for zero expectation value of the disorder and $1/L$, $1/L^{3}$ for different signs of the expectation value of the disorder.</description>

      <title>Probing Berry curvature in magnetic topological insulators through resonant infrared magnetic circular dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing the quantum geometry and topology in condensed matter systems has relied heavily on static electronic transport experiments in magnetic fields. Yet, contact-free optical measurements have rarely been explored. Magnetic dichroism (MCD), the nonreciprocal absorption of circular polarized light, was theoretically linked to the quantized anomalous Hall effect in magnetic insulators and can identify the bands and momenta responsible for the underlying Berry Curvature (BC). Detecting BC through MCD faces two challenges: First, the relevant inter-band transitions usually generate MCD in the infrared (IR) range, requiring large samples with high quality. Second, while most magnetic materials are metallic, the relation between MCD and BC in metals remains unclear. Here, we report the observation of MCD in the IR range along with the anomalous Hall effect in thin film MnBi2Te4. Both phenomena emerge with a field-driven phase transition from an antiferromagnet to a canted ferromagnet. By theoretically relating the MCD to the anomalous Hall effect via BC in a metal, we show that this transition accompanies an abrupt onset of BC, signaling a topological phase transition from a topological insulator to a doped Chern insulator. Our density functional theory calculation suggests the MCD signal mainly originates from an optical transition at the Brillouin zone edge, hinting at a potential new source of BC away from the commonly considered {\Gamma} point. Our findings demonstrate a novel experimental approach for detecting BC and identifying the responsible bands and momenta, generally applicable to magnetic materials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical orientation and alignment of excitons in semiconductor indirect gap quantum dots have been studied theoretically. A special regime is analyzed in which the energy of the hyperfine interaction of an electron with lattice nuclei is small compared to the exchange splitting between bright and dark excitonic levels, but is comparable to the anisotropic exchange splitting of the radiative doublet. The dependencies of degrees of circular and linear polarization on the external magnetic field under resonant excitation of excitons by polarized light are calculated.</description>

      <title>Correlated Charge Density Wave Insulators in Chirally Twisted Triple Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrons residing in flat-band system can play a vital role in triggering spectacular phenomenology due to relatively large interactions and spontaneous breaking of different degeneracies. In this work we demonstrate chirally twisted triple bilayer graphene, a new moir\'e structure formed by three pieces of helically stacked Bernal bilayer graphene, as a highly tunable flat-band system. In addition to the correlated insulators showing at integer moir\'e fillings, commonly attributed to interaction induced symmetry broken isospin flavors in graphene, we observe abundant insulating states at half-integer moir\'e fillings, suggesting a longer-range interaction and the formation of charge density wave insulators which spontaneously break the moir\'e translation symmetry. With weak out-of-plane magnetic field applied, as observed half-integer filling states are enhanced and more quarter-integer filling states appear, pointing towards further quadrupling moir\'e unit cells. The insulating states at fractional fillings combined with Hartree-Fock calculations demonstrate the observation of a new type of correlated charge density wave insulators in graphene and points to a new accessible twist manner engineering correlated moir\'e electronics.</description>

      <title>Arresting Quantum Chaos Dynamically in Transmon Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ergodic quantum many-body systems evolving under unitary time dynamics typically lose memory of their initial state via information scrambling. Here we consider a paradigmatic translationally invariant many-body Hamiltonian of interacting bosons -- a Josephson junction array in the transmon regime -- in the presence of a strong Floquet drive. Generically, such a time-dependent drive is expected to heat the system to an effectively infinite temperature, featureless state in the late-time limit. However, using numerical exact-diagonalization we find evidence of special ratios of the drive amplitude and frequency where the system develops {\it emergent} conservation laws, and {\it approximate} integrability. Remarkably, at these same set of points, the Lyapunov exponent associated with the semi-classical dynamics for the coupled many-body equations of motion drops by orders of magnitude, arresting the growth of chaos. We supplement our numerical results with an analytical Floquet-Magnus expansion that includes higher-order corrections, and capture the slow dynamics that controls decay away from exact freezing.</description>

      <title>Magnetic single wall CrI3 nanotubes encapsulated within multiwall Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CrI3 is a layered ferromagnetic insulator that has recently attracted enormous interest as it was the first example of a stand-alone monolayer ferromagnet, paving the way towards the study of two-dimensional magnetic materials and their use as building blocks of hybrid van der Waals layered heterostructures. Here we go one step down in the dimensionality ladder and report the synthesis and characterization of a tubular one-dimensional van der Waals heterostructure where CrI3 nanotubes are encapsulated within multiwall carbon nanotubes, integrating a magnetic insulator and a conductor. By means of the capillary filling of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), we obtained single-wall CrI3 nanotubes with diameters ranging between 2 nm and 10 nm, with an average of 5.3 nm. Using aberration corrected electron microscopy in combination with spectroscopic techniques we confirm the structure and chemical composition of the nanotubes. SQUID measurements, combined with element-specific X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) indicate unequivocally that the Cr atoms in encapsulated CrI3 nanotubes are magnetic with a collective state compatible with a radial magnetization state predicted both by first-principles calculations and a model Hamiltonian. Our results represent a step forward in establishing 1D van der Waals heterostructures as a playground for the exploration of non-collinear magnetic states arising from the interplay between magnetic anisotropy and curvature in tubular geometries.</description>

      <title>Layers of planar hexagonal heterostructure modeled by quantum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work presents a study on the quantum theory of periodic graphs applied to mono- and bilayer hexagonal materials. Different parameters associated with the atoms present at the vertices of these materials were analyzed, verifying the existence of gaps in the spectral bands and expressing the width of these openings according to the parameters. The study was extended to heterostructures with mixed layers and "sandwiches" of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. The dispersion relationships obtained in these models were analyzed and it was concluded that the inclusion of hBN layers on graphene layers can induce a gap in the graphene. Furthermore, it was observed that the inclusion of a single layer of graphene between two layers of hBN reduces the width of the spectral gap. The interaction between carbon atoms and nitrogen and boron atoms was pointed out as responsible for these results. Finally, the inclusion of a magnetic field in the hBN layer was considered, demonstrating that specific values of magnetic flux can eliminate conical touches in the dispersion relation of the operator and ensure the existence of gaps.</description>

      <title>Procedural Construction of Atomistic Polyurethane Block Copolymer Models for High Throughput Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, methods are presented to automatically generate a fully atomistic LAMMPS models of arbitrary linear multiblock polyurethane copolymers. The routine detailed here receives as parameters the number of repeat units per hard block, the number of units in a soft block, and the number of soft blocks per chain, as well as chemical formulae of three monomers which will form the hard component, soft component, and chain extender. A routine is detailed for converting the chemical structure of a free monomer to the urethane bonded repeat units in a polymer. The python package RadonPy is leveraged to assemble these units into blocks, and the blocks into copolymers. Care is taken in this work to ensure that plausible atomic charges are assigned to repeat units in different parts of the chain. The static structure factor is calculated for a variety of chemistries, and the results compared with wide angle x-ray scattering data from experiments with corresponding composition. The generated models reproduce the amorphous halo observed in the scattering data as well as some of the finer details. Structure factor calculations are decomposed into the partial structure factors to interrogate the structural properties of the two block types separately. Parametric surveys are carried out of the effects of various parameters, including temperature, soft block length, and block connectivity on the observed structure. The routine detailed here for constructing models is robust enough to be executed automatically in a high throughput workflow for material design and discovery.</description>

Abstract: Controlling light at subwavelength scales is one of the main challenges of nanophotonics. Leveraging hyperbolic polaritons supporting arbitrarily large wavevectors can lead to extreme light confinement, effectively overcoming the diffraction limit. Hyperbolicity was initially realized in artificial metamaterials, but their performances are limited by high losses in the metallic components and the constraint of long wavelengths. While recently discovered natural low-loss hyperbolic phonon polaritons initiated a revival in the interest for hyperbolic materials, they are confined to the mid-infrared frequency range, limiting their use for several applications. Some hyperbolic materials at visible frequencies have been studied, but they are either very lossy or only feature out-of-plane hyperbolicity. Here, we demonstrate the presence of low-loss, in-plane hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in the visible and near-infrared in thin films of MoOCl2, a natural van der Waals crystal. The polariton dispersion is predicted based on the framework of light propagation in biaxial media, and experimentally confirmed by real space nano imaging on exfoliated flakes. MoOCl2 constitutes a novel material platform for visible-range applications leveraging the hyperbolic dispersion, such as hyperlensing, Purcell factor enhancement and super-resolution imaging, without the drawbacks of metamaterials.</description>

Abstract: We present the development of an automated scanning probe microscopy (SPM) measurement system using an advanced large-scale language model (LLM). This SPM system can receive instructions via social networking services (SNS), and the integration of SNS and LLMs enables real-time, language-agnostic control of SPM operations, thereby improving accessibility and efficiency. The integration of LLMs with AI systems with specialized functions brings the realization of self-driving labs closer.</description>

      <title>Creation and manipulation of Schr\"odinger cat states of a nuclear spin qudit in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum systems are a valuable resource for quantum information processing. They can be used to encode error-correctable logical qubits, for instance in continuous-variable states of oscillators such as microwave cavities or the motional modes of trapped ions. Powerful encodings include 'Schr\"odinger cat' states, superpositions of widely displaced coherent states, which also embody the challenge of quantum effects at the large scale. Alternatively, recent proposals suggest encoding logical qubits in high-spin atomic nuclei, which can host hardware-efficient versions of continuous-variable codes on a finite-dimensional system. Here we demonstrate the creation and manipulation of Schr\"odinger cat states using the spin-7/2 nucleus of a single antimony ($^{123}$Sb) atom, embedded and operated within a silicon nanoelectronic device. We use a coherent multi-frequency control scheme to produce spin rotations that preserve the SU(2) symmetry of the qudit, and constitute logical Pauli operations for logical qubits encoded in the Schr\"odinger cat states. The Wigner function of the cat states exhibits parity oscillations with a contrast up to 0.982(5), and state fidelities up to 0.913(2). These results demonstrate high-fidelity preparation of nonclassical resource states and logical control in a single atomic-scale object, opening up applications in quantum information processing and quantum error correction within a scalable, manufacturable semiconductor platform.</description>

      <title>First-principles studies of fermiology in topological phases of bulk ZrTe$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators have been studied intensively over the last decades. Among these materials, three-dimensional (3D) zirconium pentatelluride (ZrTe$_5$) stands out as one of the most intriguing for both theoretical and experimental studies because of its diverse range of distinct topological phases. In this work, we employ density functional theory to study the electronic structure and quantum oscillations exhibited by various topological phases of 3D bulk ZrTe$_5$. We have discovered that by analyzing combined patterns in band structures, Fermi surfaces, and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations we can determine the corresponding topological phase without relying on the conventional calculation of topological invariants or boundary state contributions. This approach facilitates the identification of topological phases in ZrTe$_5$ directly from experimental quantum oscillation measurements. Using this method, we have analyzed the entire process of topological phase transition, revealing changes in the topology of the Fermi pockets and validating the shapes deduced from the experimental data for the topological phases.</description>

      <title>Digitized Counterdiabatic Quantum Algorithms for Logistics Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a job shop scheduling problem for an automatized robot in a high-throughput laboratory and a travelling salesperson problem with recently proposed digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (DCQO) algorithms. In DCQO, we find the solution of an optimization problem via an adiabatic quantum dynamics, which is accelerated with counterdiabatic protocols. Thereafter, we digitize the global unitary to encode it in a digital quantum computer. For the job-shop scheduling problem, we aim at finding the optimal schedule for a robot executing a number of tasks under specific constraints, such that the total execution time of the process is minimized. For the traveling salesperson problem, the goal is to find the path that covers all cities and is associated with the shortest traveling distance. We consider both hybrid and pure versions of DCQO algorithms and benchmark the performance against digitized quantum annealing and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). In comparison to QAOA, the DCQO solution is improved by several orders of magnitude in success probability using the same number of two-qubit gates. Moreover, we experimentally implement our algorithms on superconducting and trapped-ion quantum processors. Our results demonstrate that circuit compression using counterdiabatic protocols is amenable to current NISQ hardware and can solve logistics scheduling problems, where other digital quantum algorithms show insufficient performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polar dielectrics with low crystal symmetry and sharp phonon resonances can support hyperbolic shear polaritons - highly confined surface modes with frequency-dependent optical axes and asymmetric dissipation features. So far, these modes have been observed only in bulk natural materials at mid-infrared frequencies, with properties limited by available crystal geometries and phonon resonance strength. Here we introduce hyperbolic shear metasurfaces: ultrathin engineered surfaces supporting hyperbolic surface modes with symmetry-tailored axial dispersion and loss redistribution that can maximally enhance light-matter interactions. By engineering effective shear phenomena in these engineered surfaces, we demonstrate geometry-controlled, ultra-confined, low-loss hyperbolic surface waves with broadband Purcell enhancements, applicable across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum.</description>

      <title>Energy states of Rydberg excitons in finite crystals: From weak to strong confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to quantum confinement, excitons in finite-sized crystals behave rather differently than in bulk materials. We investigate the dependence of energies of Rydberg excitons on the strengths of parabolic as well as rectangular confinement potentials in finite-sized crystals. The evolution of the energy levels of hydrogen-like excitons in the crossover region from weak to strong parabolic confinement is analyzed for different quantum numbers by numerical solution of the two-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The energy spectrum of hydrogen-like excitons in Cu$_{2}$O-based rectangular quantum wells is, in turn, obtained numerically from the solution of the three-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger equation as a function of the quantum well width. Various crossings and avoided crossings of Rydberg energy levels are observed and categorized based on the symmetry properties of the exciton wave function. Particular attention is paid to the two limiting cases of narrow and wide quantum wells attributed to strong and weak confinement, respectively. The energies obtained with the pure Coulomb interaction are compared with the results originating from the Rytova-Keldysh potential, i.e., by taking into account the dielectric contrast in the quantum well and in the barrier.</description>

      <title>Tunable moir\'e bandgap in hBN-aligned bilayer graphene device with in-situ electrostatic gating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the years, great efforts have been devoted in introducing a sizable and tunable band gap in graphene for its potential application in next-generation electronic devices. The primary challenge in modulating this gap has been the absence of a direct method for observing changes of the band gap in momentum space. In this study, we employ advanced spatial- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy technique to directly visualize the gap formation in bilayer graphene, modulated by both displacement fields and moir\'e potentials. The application of displacement field via in-situ electrostatic gating introduces a sizable and tunable electronic bandgap, proportional to the field strength up to 100 meV. Meanwhile, the moir\'e potential, induced by aligning the underlying hexagonal boron nitride substrate, extends the bandgap by ~ 20 meV. Theoretical calculations, effectively capture the experimental observations. Our investigation provides a quantitative understanding of how these two mechanisms collaboratively modulate the band gap in bilayer graphene, offering valuable guidance for the design of graphene-based electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Topological interfacial states in ferroelectric domain walls of two-dimensional bismuth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using machine learning methods, we explore different types of domain walls in the recently unveiled single-element ferroelectric, the bismuth monolayer [Nature 617, 67 (2023)]. Remarkably, our investigation reveals that the charged domain wall configuration exhibits lower energy compared to the uncharged domain wall structure. We also demonstrate that the experimentally discovered tail-to-tail domain wall maintains topological interfacial states caused by the change in the Z_2 number between ferroelectric and paraelectric states. Interestingly, due to the intrinsic built-in electric fields in asymmetry DW configurations, we find that the energy of topological interfacial states splits, resulting in an accidental band crossing at the Fermi level. Our study suggests that domain walls in two-dimensional bismuth hold potential as a promising platform for the development of ferroelectric domain wall devices.</description>

Abstract: The local density of states (LDOS) of electromagnetic field drives many basic processes associated to light-matter interaction such as the thermal emission of object, the spontaneous emission of quantum systems or the fluctuation-induced electromagnetic forces on molecules. Here, we study the LDOS in the close vicinity of magneto-optical metamaterials under the action of an external magnetic field and demonstrate that it can be efficiently changed in a narrow or a broad spectral range simply by changing the spatial orientation or the magnitude of this field. This result paves the way for an active control of the photonic density of states at deep-subwavelength scale.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocity permits edge states and strong localization in stochastic topological phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological phases exhibit edge responses that are robust against deformations and defects. Such phases have recently been realized in stochastic systems, which model a large class of biological and chemical phenomena. However, general theoretical principles are lacking for these systems, such as the relation between the bulk topological invariant and observed edge responses, i.e. the celebrated bulk-edge correspondence. We show that contrary to established topological phases, stochastic systems require non-reciprocal (or non-Hermitian) transitions to have edge responses, which holds across all dimensions and geometries. For both equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states, we demonstrate that stochastic edge responses grow dramatically with non-reciprocity while the quantum version plateaus. Having established the necessity and importance of non-reciprocity for stochastic edge states, we point out fundamental theoretical and physical consequences of this result. Lastly, we present a novel mechanism by which non-reciprocity engenders robust edge currents in stochastic systems. Our work establishes the crucial role of non-reciprocal interactions in permitting robust responses in active and living matter.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal entanglement in cavity magnomechanics exploiting chiral cavity-magnon coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to achieve nonreciprocal quantum entanglement in a cavity magnomechanical system by exploiting the chiral cavity-magnon coupling. The system consists of a magnon mode, a mechanical vibration mode, and two degenerate counter-propagating microwave cavity modes in a torus-shaped cavity. We show that nonreciprocal stationary microwave-magnon and -phonon bipartite entanglements and photon-magnon-phonon tripartite entanglement can be achieved by respectively driving different circulating cavity modes that hold a chiral coupling to the magnon mode. The nonreciprocal entanglements are shown to be robust against various experimental imperfections. We specifically show how such nonreciprocal entanglement can realize the channel multiplexing quantum teleportation. The work may find promising applications of the cavity magnomechanical systems in noise-tolerant quantum processing, channel multiplexing quantum teleportation, and chiral magnonic quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Continuously tunable uniaxial strain control of van der Waals heterostructure devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uniaxial strain has been widely used as a powerful tool for investigating and controlling the properties of quantum materials. However, existing strain techniques have so far mostly been limited to use with bulk crystals. Although recent progress has been made in extending the application of strain to two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, these techniques have been limited to optical characterization and extremely simple electrical device geometries. Here, we report a piezoelectric-based \textit{in situ} uniaxial strain technique enabling simultaneous electrical transport and optical spectroscopy characterization of dual-gated vdW heterostructure devices. Critically, our technique remains compatible with vdW heterostructure devices of arbitrary complexity fabricated on conventional silicon/silicon dioxide wafer substrates. We demonstrate a large and continuously tunable strain of up to $-0.15\%$ at millikelvin temperatures, with larger strain values also likely achievable. We quantify the strain transmission from the silicon wafer to the vdW heterostructure, and further demonstrate the ability of strain to modify the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene. Our technique provides a highly versatile new method for exploring the effect of uniaxial strain on both the electrical and optical properties of vdW heterostructures, and can be easily extended to include additional characterization techniques.</description>

Abstract: We study the Josephson effect in a superconductor/altermagnet/superconductor (S/AM/S) junction. We find anomalous phenomena including $0$-$\pi$ transition as well as multi-nodal current-phase relations. Similar to $d$-wave superconductor, $d$-wave altermagnet can support $\varphi$ junction where free energy minima locate neither $\varphi=0$ nor $\pm \pi$ with double degeneracy. These properties can be tunable by parameters, e.g., the exchange energy, the orientation of crystal axis, the length, and the applied gate voltage of altermagnet. These rich features lead to accessible functionality of S/AM/S junction.</description>
