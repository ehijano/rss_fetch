      <title>Physics-informed kernel learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning typically integrates physical priors into the learning process by minimizing a loss function that includes both a data-driven term and a partial differential equation (PDE) regularization. Building on the formulation of the problem as a kernel regression task, we use Fourier methods to approximate the associated kernel, and propose a tractable estimator that minimizes the physics-informed risk function. We refer to this approach as physics-informed kernel learning (PIKL). This framework provides theoretical guarantees, enabling the quantification of the physical prior's impact on convergence speed. We demonstrate the numerical performance of the PIKL estimator through simulations, both in the context of hybrid modeling and in solving PDEs. In particular, we show that PIKL can outperform physics-informed neural networks in terms of both accuracy and computation time. Additionally, we identify cases where PIKL surpasses traditional PDE solvers, particularly in scenarios with noisy boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional learning of narrow neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have been marked with the fast-pace diversification and increasing ubiquity of machine learning applications. Yet, a firm theoretical understanding of the surprising efficiency of neural networks to learn from high-dimensional data still proves largely elusive. In this endeavour, analyses inspired by statistical physics have proven instrumental, enabling the tight asymptotic characterization of the learning of neural networks in high dimensions, for a broad class of solvable models. This manuscript reviews the tools and ideas underlying recent progress in this line of work. We introduce a generic model -- the sequence multi-index model -- which encompasses numerous previously studied models as special instances. This unified framework covers a broad class of machine learning architectures with a finite number of hidden units, including multi-layer perceptrons, autoencoders, attention mechanisms; and tasks, including (un)supervised learning, denoising, contrastive learning, in the limit of large data dimension, and comparably large number of samples. We explicate in full detail the analysis of the learning of sequence multi-index models, using statistical physics techniques such as the replica method and approximate message-passing algorithms. This manuscript thus provides a unified presentation of analyses reported in several previous works, and a detailed overview of central techniques in the field of statistical physics of machine learning. This review should be a useful primer for machine learning theoreticians curious of statistical physics approaches; it should also be of value to statistical physicists interested in the transfer of such ideas to the study of neural networks.</description>

      <title>Consistency for Large Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks have shown remarkable success, especially in overparameterized or "large" models. Despite increasing empirical evidence and intuitive understanding, a formal mathematical justification for the behavior of such models, particularly regarding overfitting, remains incomplete. In this paper, we prove that the Mean Integrated Squared Error (MISE) of neural networks with either $L^1$ or $L^2$ penalty decreases after a certain model size threshold, provided that the sample size is sufficiently large, and achieves nearly the minimax optimality in the Barron space. These results challenge conventional statistical modeling frameworks and broadens recent findings on the double descent phenomenon in neural networks. Our theoretical results also extend to deep learning models with ReLU activation functions.</description>

      <title>A competitive baseline for deep learning enhanced data assimilation using conditional Gaussian ensemble Kalman filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensemble Kalman Filtering (EnKF) is a popular technique for data assimilation, with far ranging applications. However, the vanilla EnKF framework is not well-defined when perturbations are nonlinear. We study two non-linear extensions of the vanilla EnKF - dubbed the conditional-Gaussian EnKF (CG-EnKF) and the normal score EnKF (NS-EnKF) - which sidestep assumptions of linearity by constructing the Kalman gain matrix with the `conditional Gaussian' update formula in place of the traditional one. We then compare these models against a state-of-the-art deep learning based particle filter called the score filter (SF). This model uses an expensive score diffusion model for estimating densities and also requires a strong assumption on the perturbation operator for validity. In our comparison, we find that CG-EnKF and NS-EnKF dramatically outperform SF for a canonical problem in high-dimensional multiscale data assimilation given by the Lorenz-96 system. Our analysis also demonstrates that the CG-EnKF and NS-EnKF can handle highly non-Gaussian additive noise perturbations, with the latter typically outperforming the former.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Exogenous Structure for Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of structured Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) known as Exo-MDPs, characterized by a partition of the state space into two components. The exogenous states evolve stochastically in a manner not affected by the agent's actions, whereas the endogenous states are affected by the actions, and evolve in a deterministic and known way conditional on the exogenous states. Exo-MDPs are a natural model for various applications including inventory control, finance, power systems, ride sharing, among others. Despite seeming restrictive, this work establishes that any discrete MDP can be represented as an Exo-MDP. Further, Exo-MDPs induce a natural representation of the transition and reward dynamics as linear functions of the exogenous state distribution. This linear representation leads to near-optimal algorithms with regret guarantees scaling only with the (effective) size of the exogenous state space $d$, independent of the sizes of the endogenous state and action spaces. Specifically, when the exogenous state is fully observed, a simple plug-in approach achieves a regret upper bound of $O(H^{3/2}\sqrt{dK})$, where $H$ denotes the horizon and $K$ denotes the total number of episodes. When the exogenous state is unobserved, the linear representation leads to a regret upper bound of $O(H^{3/2}d\sqrt{K})$. We also establish a nearly matching regret lower bound of $\Omega(Hd\sqrt{K})$ for the no observation regime. We complement our theoretical findings with an experimental study on inventory control problems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Conformal Inference for Multi-Step Ahead Time-Series Forecasting Online</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to propose an adaptation of the well known adaptive conformal inference (ACI) algorithm to achieve finite-sample coverage guarantees in multi-step ahead time-series forecasting in the online setting. ACI dynamically adjusts significance levels, and comes with finite-sample guarantees on coverage, even for non-exchangeable data. Our multi-step ahead ACI procedure inherits these guarantees at each prediction step, as well as for the overall error rate. The multi-step ahead ACI algorithm can be used with different target error and learning rates at different prediction steps, which is illustrated in our numerical examples, where we employ a version of the confromalised ridge regression algorithm, adapted to multi-input multi-output forecasting. The examples serve to show how the method works in practice, illustrating the effect of variable target error and learning rates for different prediction steps, which suggests that a balance may be struck between efficiency (interval width) and coverage.t</description>

      <title>Embedding Knowledge Graph in Function Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel embedding method diverging from conventional approaches by operating within function spaces of finite dimension rather than finite vector space, thus departing significantly from standard knowledge graph embedding techniques. Initially employing polynomial functions to compute embeddings, we progress to more intricate representations using neural networks with varying layer complexities. We argue that employing functions for embedding computation enhances expressiveness and allows for more degrees of freedom, enabling operations such as composition, derivatives and primitive of entities representation. Additionally, we meticulously outline the step-by-step construction of our approach and provide code for reproducibility, thereby facilitating further exploration and application in the field.</description>

      <title>(De)-regularized Maximum Mean Discrepancy Gradient Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a (de)-regularization of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (DrMMD) and its Wasserstein gradient flow. Existing gradient flows that transport samples from source distribution to target distribution with only target samples, either lack tractable numerical implementation ($f$-divergence flows) or require strong assumptions, and modifications such as noise injection, to ensure convergence (Maximum Mean Discrepancy flows). In contrast, DrMMD flow can simultaneously (i) guarantee near-global convergence for a broad class of targets in both continuous and discrete time, and (ii) be implemented in closed form using only samples. The former is achieved by leveraging the connection between the DrMMD and the $\chi^2$-divergence, while the latter comes by treating DrMMD as MMD with a de-regularized kernel. Our numerical scheme uses an adaptive de-regularization schedule throughout the flow to optimally trade off between discretization errors and deviations from the $\chi^2$ regime. The potential application of the DrMMD flow is demonstrated across several numerical experiments, including a large-scale setting of training student/teacher networks.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Path Integral Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we present a novel approach for sampling from a continuous multivariate probability distribution, which may either be explicitly known (up to a normalization factor) or represented via empirical samples. Our method constructs a time-dependent bridge from a delta function centered at the origin of the state space at $t=0$, optimally transforming it into the target distribution at $t=1$. We formulate this as a Stochastic Optimal Control problem of the Path Integral Control type, with a cost function comprising (in its basic form) a quadratic control term, a quadratic state term, and a terminal constraint. This framework, which we refer to as Harmonic Path Integral Diffusion (H-PID), leverages an analytical solution through a mapping to an auxiliary quantum harmonic oscillator in imaginary time.
  The H-PID framework results in a set of efficient sampling algorithms, without the incorporation of Neural Networks. The algorithms are validated on two standard use cases: a mixture of Gaussians over a grid and images from CIFAR-10. We contrast these algorithms with other sampling methods, particularly simulated annealing and path integral sampling, highlighting their advantages in terms of analytical control, accuracy, and computational efficiency on benchmark problems.
  Additionally, we extend the methodology to more general cases where the underlying stochastic differential equation includes an external deterministic, possibly non-conservative force, and where the cost function incorporates a gauge potential term. These extensions open up new possibilities for applying our framework to a broader range of statistics specific to applications.</description>

      <title>Rule Extrapolation in Language Models: A Study of Compositional Generalization on OOD Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs show remarkable emergent abilities, such as inferring concepts from presumably out-of-distribution prompts, known as in-context learning. Though this success is often attributed to the Transformer architecture, our systematic understanding is limited. In complex real-world data sets, even defining what is out-of-distribution is not obvious. To better understand the OOD behaviour of autoregressive LLMs, we focus on formal languages, which are defined by the intersection of rules. We define a new scenario of OOD compositional generalization, termed rule extrapolation. Rule extrapolation describes OOD scenarios, where the prompt violates at least one rule. We evaluate rule extrapolation in formal languages with varying complexity in linear and recurrent architectures, the Transformer, and state space models to understand the architectures' influence on rule extrapolation. We also lay the first stones of a normative theory of rule extrapolation, inspired by the Solomonoff prior in algorithmic information theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prior Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), adapted from classification model attacks, fail due to ignoring the generative process of LLMs across token sequences. In this paper, we present a novel attack that adapts MIA statistical tests to the perplexity dynamics of subsequences within a data point. Our method significantly outperforms prior loss-based approaches, revealing context-dependent memorization patterns in pre-trained LLMs.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Variational State-Space Gaussian Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential equations are important mechanistic models that are integral to many scientific and engineering applications. With the abundance of available data there has been a growing interest in data-driven physics-informed models. Gaussian processes (GPs) are particularly suited to this task as they can model complex, non-linear phenomena whilst incorporating prior knowledge and quantifying uncertainty. Current approaches have found some success but are limited as they either achieve poor computational scalings or focus only on the temporal setting. This work addresses these issues by introducing a variational spatio-temporal state-space GP that handles linear and non-linear physical constraints while achieving efficient linear-in-time computation costs. We demonstrate our methods in a range of synthetic and real-world settings and outperform the current state-of-the-art in both predictive and computational performance.</description>

      <title>Causal Feature Selection Method for Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits in Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Features (a.k.a. context) are critical for contextual multi-armed bandits (MAB) performance. In practice of large scale online system, it is important to select and implement important features for the model: missing important features can led to sub-optimal reward outcome, and including irrelevant features can cause overfitting, poor model interpretability, and implementation cost. However, feature selection methods for conventional machine learning models fail short for contextual MAB use cases, as conventional methods select features correlated with the outcome variable, but not necessarily causing heterogeneuous treatment effect among arms which are truely important for contextual MAB. In this paper, we introduce model-free feature selection methods designed for contexutal MAB problem, based on heterogeneous causal effect contributed by the feature to the reward distribution. Empirical evaluation is conducted based on synthetic data as well as real data from an online experiment for optimizing content cover image in a recommender system. The results show this feature selection method effectively selects the important features that lead to higher contextual MAB reward than unimportant features. Compared with model embedded method, this model-free method has advantage of fast computation speed, ease of implementation, and prune of model mis-specification issues.</description>

      <title>Learning Recourse Costs from Pairwise Feature Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel technique for incorporating user input when learning and inferring user preferences. When trying to provide users of black-box machine learning models with actionable recourse, we often wish to incorporate their personal preferences about the ease of modifying each individual feature. These recourse finding algorithms usually require an exhaustive set of tuples associating each feature to its cost of modification. Since it is hard to obtain such costs by directly surveying humans, in this paper, we propose the use of the Bradley-Terry model to automatically infer feature-wise costs using non-exhaustive human comparison surveys. We propose that users only provide inputs comparing entire recourses, with all candidate feature modifications, determining which recourses are easier to implement relative to others, without explicit quantification of their costs. We demonstrate the efficient learning of individual feature costs using MAP estimates, and show that these non-exhaustive human surveys, which do not necessarily contain data for each feature pair comparison, are sufficient to learn an exhaustive set of feature costs, where each feature is associated with a modification cost.</description>

Abstract: Accurate solar flare prediction is crucial due to the significant risks that intense solar flares pose to astronauts, space equipment, and satellite communication systems. Our research enhances solar flare prediction by utilizing advanced data preprocessing and classification methods on a multivariate time series-based dataset of photospheric magnetic field parameters. First, our study employs a novel preprocessing pipeline that includes missing value imputation, normalization, balanced sampling, near decision boundary sample removal, and feature selection to significantly boost prediction accuracy. Second, we integrate contrastive learning with a GRU regression model to develop a novel classifier, termed ContReg, which employs dual learning methodologies, thereby further enhancing prediction performance. To validate the effectiveness of our preprocessing pipeline, we compare and demonstrate the performance gain of each step, and to demonstrate the efficacy of the ContReg classifier, we compare its performance to that of sequence-based deep learning architectures, machine learning models, and findings from previous studies. Our results illustrate exceptional True Skill Statistic (TSS) scores, surpassing previous methods and highlighting the critical role of precise data preprocessing and classifier development in time series-based solar flare prediction.</description>

Abstract: This study explores the prediction of high-frequency price changes using deep learning models. Although state-of-the-art methods perform well, their complexity impedes the understanding of successful predictions. We found that an inadequately defined target price process may render predictions meaningless by incorporating past information. The commonly used three-class problem in asset price prediction can generally be divided into volatility and directional prediction. When relying solely on the price process, directional prediction performance is not substantial. However, volume imbalance improves directional prediction performance.</description>

      <title>Order of Magnitude Speedups for LLM Membership Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have the promise to revolutionize computing broadly, but their complexity and extensive training data also expose significant privacy vulnerabilities. One of the simplest privacy risks associated with LLMs is their susceptibility to membership inference attacks (MIAs), wherein an adversary aims to determine whether a specific data point was part of the model's training set. Although this is a known risk, state of the art methodologies for MIAs rely on training multiple computationally costly shadow models, making risk evaluation prohibitive for large models. Here we adapt a recent line of work which uses quantile regression to mount membership inference attacks; we extend this work by proposing a low-cost MIA that leverages an ensemble of small quantile regression models to determine if a document belongs to the model's training set or not. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on fine-tuned LLMs of varying families (OPT, Pythia, Llama) and across multiple datasets. Across all scenarios we obtain comparable or improved accuracy compared to state of the art shadow model approaches, with as little as 6% of their computation budget. We demonstrate increased effectiveness across multi-epoch trained target models, and architecture miss-specification robustness, that is, we can mount an effective attack against a model using a different tokenizer and architecture, without requiring knowledge on the target model.</description>

      <title>A convergent scheme for the Bayesian filtering problem based on the Fokker--Planck equation and deep splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A numerical scheme for approximating the nonlinear filtering density is introduced and its convergence rate is established, theoretically under a parabolic H\"{o}rmander condition, and empirically for two examples. For the prediction step, between the noisy and partial measurements at discrete times, the scheme approximates the Fokker--Planck equation with a deep splitting scheme, and performs an exact update through Bayes' formula. This results in a classical prediction-update filtering algorithm that operates online for new observation sequences post-training. The algorithm employs a sampling-based Feynman--Kac approach, designed to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. Our convergence proof relies on the Malliavin integration-by-parts formula. As a corollary we obtain the convergence rate for the approximation of the Fokker--Planck equation alone, disconnected from the filtering problem.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI needs formal notions of explanation correctness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of machine learning (ML) in critical domains such as medicine poses risks and requires regulation. One requirement is that decisions of ML systems in high-risk applications should be human-understandable. The field of "explainable artificial intelligence" (XAI) seemingly addresses this need. However, in its current form, XAI is unfit to provide quality control for ML; it itself needs scrutiny. Popular XAI methods cannot reliably answer important questions about ML models, their training data, or a given test input. We recapitulate results demonstrating that popular XAI methods systematically attribute importance to input features that are independent of the prediction target. This limits their utility for purposes such as model and data (in)validation, model improvement, and scientific discovery. We argue that the fundamental reason for this limitation is that current XAI methods do not address well-defined problems and are not evaluated against objective criteria of explanation correctness. Researchers should formally define the problems they intend to solve first and then design methods accordingly. This will lead to notions of explanation correctness that can be theoretically verified and objective metrics of explanation performance that can be assessed using ground-truth data.</description>

      <title>Testing Causal Models with Hidden Variables in Polynomial Delay via Conditional Independencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Testing a hypothesized causal model against observational data is a key prerequisite for many causal inference tasks. A natural approach is to test whether the conditional independence relations (CIs) assumed in the model hold in the data. While a model can assume exponentially many CIs (with respect to the number of variables), testing all of them is both impractical and unnecessary. Causal graphs, which encode these CIs in polynomial space, give rise to local Markov properties that enable model testing with a significantly smaller subset of CIs. Model testing based on local properties requires an algorithm to list the relevant CIs. However, existing algorithms for realistic settings with hidden variables and non-parametric distributions can take exponential time to produce even a single CI constraint. In this paper, we introduce the c-component local Markov property (C-LMP) for causal graphs with hidden variables. Since C-LMP can still invoke an exponential number of CIs, we develop a polynomial delay algorithm to list these CIs in poly-time intervals. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that enables poly-delay testing of CIs in causal graphs with hidden variables against arbitrary data distributions. Experiments on real-world and synthetic data demonstrate the practicality of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Kriformer: A Novel Spatiotemporal Kriging Approach Based on Graph Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately estimating data in sensor-less areas is crucial for understanding system dynamics, such as traffic state estimation and environmental monitoring. This study addresses challenges posed by sparse sensor deployment and unreliable data by framing the problem as a spatiotemporal kriging task and proposing a novel graph transformer model, Kriformer. This model estimates data at locations without sensors by mining spatial and temporal correlations, even with limited resources. Kriformer utilizes transformer architecture to enhance the model's perceptual range and solve edge information aggregation challenges, capturing spatiotemporal information effectively. A carefully constructed positional encoding module embeds the spatiotemporal features of nodes, while a sophisticated spatiotemporal attention mechanism enhances estimation accuracy. The multi-head spatial interaction attention module captures subtle spatial relationships between observed and unobserved locations. During training, a random masking strategy prompts the model to learn with partial information loss, allowing the spatiotemporal embedding and multi-head attention mechanisms to synergistically capture correlations among locations. Experimental results show that Kriformer excels in representation learning for unobserved locations, validated on two real-world traffic speed datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in spatiotemporal kriging tasks.</description>

      <title>Designing an Interpretable Interface for Contextual Bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextual bandits have become an increasingly popular solution for personalized recommender systems. Despite their growing use, the interpretability of these systems remains a significant challenge, particularly for the often non-expert operators tasked with ensuring their optimal performance. In this paper, we address this challenge by designing a new interface to explain to domain experts the underlying behaviour of a bandit. Central is a metric we term "value gain", a measure derived from off-policy evaluation to quantify the real-world impact of sub-components within a bandit. We conduct a qualitative user study to evaluate the effectiveness of our interface. Our findings suggest that by carefully balancing technical rigour with accessible presentation, it is possible to empower non-experts to manage complex machine learning systems. We conclude by outlining guiding principles that other researchers should consider when building similar such interfaces in future.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Conventional Wisdom in Machine Learning: From Generalization to Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable success of large language pretraining and the discovery of scaling laws signify a paradigm shift in machine learning. Notably, the primary objective has evolved from minimizing generalization error to reducing approximation error, and the most effective strategy has transitioned from regularization (in a broad sense) to scaling up models. This raises a critical question:
  Do the established principles that proved successful in the generalization-centric era remain valid in this new era of scaling?
  This paper examines several influential regularization-based principles that may no longer hold true in the scaling-centric, large language model (LLM) era. These principles include explicit L2 regularization and implicit regularization through small batch sizes and large learning rates. Additionally, we identify a new phenomenon termed ``scaling law crossover,'' where two scaling curves intersect at a certain scale, implying that methods effective at smaller scales may not generalize to larger ones. Together, these observations highlight two fundamental questions within this new paradigm:
  $\bullet$ Guiding Principles for Scaling: If regularization is no longer the primary guiding principle for model design, what new principles are emerging to guide scaling?
  $\bullet$ Model Comparison at Scale: How to reliably and effectively compare models at the scale where only a single experiment is feasible?</description>

      <title>Precise Asymptotics of Bagging Regularized M-estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the squared prediction risk of ensemble estimators obtained through subagging (subsample bootstrap aggregating) regularized M-estimators and construct a consistent estimator for the risk. Specifically, we consider a heterogeneous collection of $M \ge 1$ regularized M-estimators, each trained with (possibly different) subsample sizes, convex differentiable losses, and convex regularizers. We operate under the proportional asymptotics regime, where the sample size $n$, feature size $p$, and subsample sizes $k_m$ for $m \in [M]$ all diverge with fixed limiting ratios $n/p$ and $k_m/n$. Key to our analysis is a new result on the joint asymptotic behavior of correlations between the estimator and residual errors on overlapping subsamples, governed through a (provably) contractible nonlinear system of equations. Of independent interest, we also establish convergence of trace functionals related to degrees of freedom in the non-ensemble setting (with $M = 1$) along the way, extending previously known cases for square loss and ridge, lasso regularizers.
  When specialized to homogeneous ensembles trained with a common loss, regularizer, and subsample size, the risk characterization sheds some light on the implicit regularization effect due to the ensemble and subsample sizes $(M,k)$. For any ensemble size $M$, optimally tuning subsample size yields sample-wise monotonic risk. For the full-ensemble estimator (when $M \to \infty$), the optimal subsample size $k^\star$ tends to be in the overparameterized regime $(k^\star \le \min\{n,p\})$, when explicit regularization is vanishing. Finally, joint optimization of subsample size, ensemble size, and regularization can significantly outperform regularizer optimization alone on the full data (without any subagging).</description>

      <title>Counterfactual inference for sequential experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06891v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider after-study statistical inference for sequentially designed experiments wherein multiple units are assigned treatments for multiple time points using treatment policies that adapt over time. Our goal is to provide inference guarantees for the counterfactual mean at the smallest possible scale -- mean outcome under different treatments for each unit and each time -- with minimal assumptions on the adaptive treatment policy. Without any structural assumptions on the counterfactual means, this challenging task is infeasible due to more unknowns than observed data points. To make progress, we introduce a latent factor model over the counterfactual means that serves as a non-parametric generalization of the non-linear mixed effects model and the bilinear latent factor model considered in prior works. For estimation, we use a non-parametric method, namely a variant of nearest neighbors, and establish a non-asymptotic high probability error bound for the counterfactual mean for each unit and each time. Under regularity conditions, this bound leads to asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the counterfactual mean as the number of units and time points grows to $\infty$ together at suitable rates. We illustrate our theory via several simulations and a case study involving data from a mobile health clinical trial HeartSteps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.09141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms do not scale well for large datasets leading to difficulties in Neural Network posterior sampling. In this paper, we propose Penalty Bayesian Neural Networks - PBNNs, as a new algorithm that allows the evaluation of the likelihood using subsampled batch data (mini-batches) in a Bayesian inference context towards addressing scalability. PBNN avoids the biases inherent in other naive subsampling techniques by incorporating a penalty term as part of a generalization of the Metropolis Hastings algorithm. We show that it is straightforward to integrate PBNN with existing MCMC frameworks, as the variance of the loss function merely reduces the acceptance probability. By comparing with alternative sampling strategies on both synthetic data and the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that PBNN achieves good predictive performance even for small mini-batch sizes of data. We show that PBNN provides a novel approach for calibrating the predictive distribution by varying the mini-batch size, significantly reducing predictive overconfidence.</description>

Abstract: To mitigate the limitation that the classical reinforcement learning (RL) framework heavily relies on identical training and test environments, Distributionally Robust RL (DRRL) has been proposed to enhance performance across a range of environments, possibly including unknown test environments. As a price for robustness gain, DRRL involves optimizing over a set of distributions, which is inherently more challenging than optimizing over a fixed distribution in the non-robust case. Existing DRRL algorithms are either model-based or fail to learn from a single sample trajectory. In this paper, we design a first fully model-free DRRL algorithm, called distributionally robust Q-learning with single trajectory (DRQ). We delicately design a multi-timescale framework to fully utilize each incrementally arriving sample and directly learn the optimal distributionally robust policy without modelling the environment, thus the algorithm can be trained along a single trajectory in a model-free fashion. Despite the algorithm's complexity, we provide asymptotic convergence guarantees by generalizing classical stochastic approximation tools. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superior robustness and sample complexity of our proposed algorithm, compared to non-robust methods and other robust RL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rates for Stochastic Approximation: Biased Noise with Unbounded Variance, and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02828v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the convergence properties of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method for finding a stationary point of a given objective function $J(\cdot)$. The objective function is not required to be convex. Rather, our results apply to a class of ``invex'' functions, which have the property that every stationary point is also a global minimizer. First, it is assumed that $J(\cdot)$ satisfies a property that is slightly weaker than the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) condition, denoted here as (KL'). It is shown that the iterations $J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t)$ converge almost surely to the global minimum of $J(\cdot)$. Next, the hypothesis on $J(\cdot)$ is strengthened from (KL') to the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition. With this stronger hypothesis, we derive estimates on the rate of convergence of $J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t)$ to its limit. Using these results, we show that for functions satisfying the PL property, the convergence rate of both the objective function and the norm of the gradient with SGD is the same as the best-possible rate for convex functions. While some results along these lines have been published in the past, our contributions contain two distinct improvements. First, the assumptions on the stochastic gradient are more general than elsewhere, and second, our convergence is almost sure, and not in expectation. We also study SGD when only function evaluations are permitted. In this setting, we determine the ``optimal'' increments or the size of the perturbations. Using the same set of ideas, we establish the global convergence of the Stochastic Approximation (SA) algorithm under more general assumptions on the measurement error, compared to the existing literature. We also derive bounds on the rate of convergence of the SA algorithm under appropriate assumptions.</description>

Abstract: Decades after their inception, regression forests continue to provide state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming in this respect alternative machine learning models such as regression trees or even neural networks. However, being an ensemble method, the one aspect where regression forests tend to severely underperform regression trees is interpretability. In the present work, we revisit forest pruning, an approach that aims to have the best of both worlds: the accuracy of regression forests and the interpretability of regression trees. This pursuit, whose foundation lies at the core of random forest theory, has seen vast success in empirical studies. In this paper, we contribute theoretical results that support and qualify those empirical findings; namely, we prove the asymptotic advantage of a Lasso-pruned forest over its unpruned counterpart under extremely weak assumptions, as well as high-probability finite-sample generalization bounds for regression forests pruned according to the main methods, which we then validate by way of simulation. Then, we test the accuracy of pruned regression forests against their unpruned counterparts on 19 different datasets (16 synthetic, 3 real). We find that in the vast majority of scenarios tested, there is at least one forest-pruning method that yields equal or better accuracy than the original full forest (in expectation), while just using a small fraction of the trees. We show that, in some cases, the reduction in the size of the forest is so dramatic that the resulting sub-forest can be meaningfully merged into a single tree, obtaining a level of interpretability that is qualitatively superior to that of the original regression forest, which remains a black box.</description>

      <title>Convergence rate of random scan Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference under log-concavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference scheme is a popular algorithm used to compute the mean-field approximation of a probability distribution of interest. We analyze its random scan version, under log-concavity assumptions on the target density. Our approach builds on the recent work of M. Arnese and D. Lacker, \emph{Convergence of coordinate ascent variational inference for log-concave measures via optimal transport} [arXiv:2404.08792] which studies the deterministic scan version of the algorithm, phrasing it as a block-coordinate descent algorithm in the space of probability distributions endowed with the geometry of optimal transport. We obtain tight rates for the random scan version, which imply that the total number of factor updates required to converge scales linearly with the condition number and the number of blocks of the target distribution. By contrast, available bounds for the deterministic scan case scale quadratically in the same quantities, which is analogue to what happens for optimization of convex functions in Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>Length Optimization in Conformal Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conditional validity and length efficiency are two crucial aspects of conformal prediction (CP). Achieving conditional validity ensures accurate uncertainty quantification for data subpopulations, while proper length efficiency ensures that the prediction sets remain informative and non-trivial. Despite significant efforts to address each of these issues individually, a principled framework that reconciles these two objectives has been missing in the CP literature. In this paper, we develop Conformal Prediction with Length-Optimization (CPL) - a novel framework that constructs prediction sets with (near-) optimal length while ensuring conditional validity under various classes of covariate shifts, including the key cases of marginal and group-conditional coverage. In the infinite sample regime, we provide strong duality results which indicate that CPL achieves conditional validity and length optimality. In the finite sample regime, we show that CPL constructs conditionally valid prediction sets. Our extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the superior prediction set size performance of CPL compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse real-world and synthetic datasets in classification, regression, and large language model-based multiple choice question answering.</description>

      <title>Low dimensional representation of multi-patient flow cytometry datasets using optimal transport for minimal residual disease detection in leukemia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Representing and quantifying Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, is essential in the prognosis and follow-up of AML patients. As traditional cytological analysis cannot detect leukemia cells below 5\%, the analysis of flow cytometry dataset is expected to provide more reliable results. In this paper, we explore statistical learning methods based on optimal transport (OT) to achieve a relevant low-dimensional representation of multi-patient flow cytometry measurements (FCM) datasets considered as high-dimensional probability distributions. Using the framework of OT, we justify the use of the K-means algorithm for dimensionality reduction of multiple large-scale point clouds through mean measure quantization by merging all the data into a single point cloud. After this quantization step, the visualization of the intra and inter-patients FCM variability is carried out by embedding low-dimensional quantized probability measures into a linear space using either Wasserstein Principal Component Analysis (PCA) through linearized OT or log-ratio PCA of compositional data. Using a publicly available FCM dataset and a FCM dataset from Bordeaux University Hospital, we demonstrate the benefits of our approach over the popular kernel mean embedding technique for statistical learning from multiple high-dimensional probability distributions. We also highlight the usefulness of our methodology for low-dimensional projection and clustering patient measurements according to their level of MRD in AML from FCM. In particular, our OT-based approach allows a relevant and informative two-dimensional representation of the results of the FlowSom algorithm, a state-of-the-art method for the detection of MRD in AML using multi-patient FCM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a wide array of machine learning algorithms are specific instances of one single paradigm: reciprocal learning. These instances range from active learning over multi-armed bandits to self-training. We show that all these algorithms do not only learn parameters from data but also vice versa: They iteratively alter training data in a way that depends on the current model fit. We introduce reciprocal learning as a generalization of these algorithms using the language of decision theory. This allows us to study under what conditions they converge. The key is to guarantee that reciprocal learning contracts such that the Banach fixed-point theorem applies. In this way, we find that reciprocal learning algorithms converge at linear rates to an approximately optimal model under relatively mild assumptions on the loss function, if their predictions are probabilistic and the sample adaption is both non-greedy and either randomized or regularized. We interpret these findings and provide corollaries that relate them to specific active learning, self-training, and bandit algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When split conformal prediction operates in batch mode with exchangeable data, we determine the exact distribution of the empirical coverage of prediction sets produced for a finite batch of future observables, as well as the exact distribution of its almost sure limit when the batch size goes to infinity. Both distributions are universal, being determined solely by the nominal miscoverage level and the calibration sample size, thereby establishing a criterion for choosing the minimum required calibration sample size in applications.</description>

      <title>High-Level Synthetic Data Generation with Data Set Archetypes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cluster analysis relies on effective benchmarks for evaluating and comparing different algorithms. Simulation studies on synthetic data are popular because important features of the data sets, such as the overlap between clusters, or the variation in cluster shapes, can be effectively varied. Unfortunately, curating evaluation scenarios is often laborious, as practitioners must find lower-level geometric parameters (like cluster covariance matrices) to match a higher-level scenario description like "clusters with very different shapes." To make benchmarks more convenient and informative, we propose synthetic data generation based on data set archetypes. In this paradigm, the user describes an evaluation scenario in a high-level manner, and the software automatically generates data sets with the desired characteristics. Combining such data set archetypes with large language models (LLMs), it is possible to set up benchmarks purely from verbal descriptions of the evaluation scenarios. We provide an open-source Python package, repliclust, that implements this workflow. A demo of data generation from verbal inputs is available at https://demo.repliclust.org.</description>

      <title>Batches Stabilize the Minimum Norm Risk in High Dimensional Overparameterized Linear Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning algorithms that divide the data into batches are prevalent in many machine-learning applications, typically offering useful trade-offs between computational efficiency and performance. In this paper, we examine the benefits of batch-partitioning through the lens of a minimum-norm overparametrized linear regression model with isotropic Gaussian features. We suggest a natural small-batch version of the minimum-norm estimator and derive bounds on its quadratic risk. We then characterize the optimal batch size and show it is inversely proportional to the noise level, as well as to the overparametrization ratio. In contrast to minimum-norm, our estimator admits a stable risk behavior that is monotonically increasing in the overparametrization ratio, eliminating both the blowup at the interpolation point and the double-descent phenomenon. We further show that shrinking the batch minimum-norm estimator by a factor equal to the Weiner coefficient further stabilizes it and results in lower quadratic risk in all settings. Interestingly, we observe that the implicit regularization offered by the batch partition is partially explained by feature overlap between the batches. Our bound is derived via a novel combination of techniques, in particular normal approximation in the Wasserstein metric of noisy projections over random subspaces.</description>

      <title>Noise Stability Optimization for Finding Flat Minima: A Hessian-based Regularization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08553v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The training of over-parameterized neural networks has received much study in recent literature. An important consideration is the regularization of over-parameterized networks due to their highly nonconvex and nonlinear geometry. In this paper, we study noise injection algorithms, which can regularize the Hessian of the loss, leading to regions with flat loss surfaces. Specifically, by injecting isotropic Gaussian noise into the weight matrices of a neural network, we can obtain an approximately unbiased estimate of the trace of the Hessian. However, naively implementing the noise injection via adding noise to the weight matrices before backpropagation presents limited empirical improvements. To address this limitation, we design a two-point estimate of the Hessian penalty, which injects noise into the weight matrices along both positive and negative directions of the random noise. In particular, this two-point estimate eliminates the variance of the first-order Taylor's expansion term on the Hessian. We show a PAC-Bayes generalization bound that depends on the trace of the Hessian (and the radius of the weight space), which can be measured from data.
  We conduct a detailed experimental study to validate our approach and show that it can effectively regularize the Hessian and improve generalization. First, our algorithm can outperform prior approaches on sharpness-reduced training, delivering up to a 2.4% test accuracy increase for fine-tuning ResNets on six image classification datasets. Moreover, the trace of the Hessian reduces by 15.8%, and the largest eigenvalue is reduced by 9.7% with our approach. We also find that the regularization of the Hessian can be combined with weight decay and data augmentation, leading to stronger regularization. Second, our approach remains effective for improving generalization in pretraining multimodal CLIP models and chain-of-thought fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Stability for Inference with Persistent Homology Rank Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistent homology barcodes and diagrams are a cornerstone of topological data analysis that capture the "shape" of a wide range of complex data structures, such as point clouds, networks, and functions. However, their use in statistical settings is challenging due to their complex geometric structure. In this paper, we revisit the persistent homology rank function, which is mathematically equivalent to a barcode and persistence diagram, as a tool for statistics and machine learning. Rank functions, being functions, enable the direct application of the statistical theory of functional data analysis (FDA)-a domain of statistics adapted for data in the form of functions. A key challenge they present over barcodes in practice, however, is their lack of stability-a property that is crucial to validate their use as a faithful representation of the data and therefore a viable summary statistic. In this paper, we fill this gap by deriving two stability results for persistent homology rank functions under a suitable metric for FDA integration. We then study the performance of rank functions in functional inferential statistics and machine learning on real data applications, in both single and multiparameter persistent homology. We find that the use of persistent homology captured by rank functions offers a clear improvement over existing non-persistence-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Spectrum-Aware Debiasing: A Modern Inference Framework with Applications to Principal Components Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07810v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Debiasing is a fundamental concept in high-dimensional statistics. While degrees-of-freedom adjustment is the state-of-the-art technique in high-dimensional linear regression, it is limited to i.i.d. samples and sub-Gaussian covariates. These constraints hinder its broader practical use. Here, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Debiasing--a novel method for high-dimensional regression. Our approach applies to problems with structured dependencies, heavy tails, and low-rank structures. Our method achieves debiasing through a rescaled gradient descent step, deriving the rescaling factor using spectral information of the sample covariance matrix. The spectrum-based approach enables accurate debiasing in much broader contexts. We study the common modern regime where the number of features and samples scale proportionally. We establish asymptotic normality of our proposed estimator (suitably centered and scaled) under various convergence notions when the covariates are right-rotationally invariant. Such designs have garnered recent attention due to their crucial role in compressed sensing. Furthermore, we devise a consistent estimator for its asymptotic variance.
  Our work has two notable by-products: first, we use Spectrum-Aware Debiasing to correct bias in principal components regression (PCR), providing the first debiased PCR estimator in high dimensions. Second, we introduce a principled test for checking alignment between the signal and the eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix. This test is independently valuable for statistical methods developed using approximate message passing, leave-one-out, or convex Gaussian min-max theorems. We demonstrate our method through simulated and real data experiments. Technically, we connect approximate message passing algorithms with debiasing and provide the first proof of the Cauchy property of vector approximate message passing (V-AMP).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models inspired by dynamical transport of measure -- such as flows and diffusions -- construct a continuous-time map between two probability densities. Conventionally, one of these is the target density, only accessible through samples, while the other is taken as a simple base density that is data-agnostic. In this work, using the framework of stochastic interpolants, we formalize how to \textit{couple} the base and the target densities, whereby samples from the base are computed conditionally given samples from the target in a way that is different from (but does preclude) incorporating information about class labels or continuous embeddings. This enables us to construct dynamical transport maps that serve as conditional generative models. We show that these transport maps can be learned by solving a simple square loss regression problem analogous to the standard independent setting. We demonstrate the usefulness of constructing dependent couplings in practice through experiments in super-resolution and in-painting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce discriminator guidance in the setting of Autoregressive Diffusion Models. The use of a discriminator to guide a diffusion process has previously been used for continuous diffusion models, and in this work we derive ways of using a discriminator together with a pretrained generative model in the discrete case. First, we show that using an optimal discriminator will correct the pretrained model and enable exact sampling from the underlying data distribution. Second, to account for the realistic scenario of using a sub-optimal discriminator, we derive a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm which iteratively takes the predictions from the discriminator into account during the generation process. We test these approaches on the task of generating molecular graphs and show how the discriminator improves the generative performance over using only the pretrained model.</description>

      <title>Policy Learning with Distributional Welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15878v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore optimal treatment allocation policies that target distributional welfare. Most literature on treatment choice has considered utilitarian welfare based on the conditional average treatment effect (ATE). While average welfare is intuitive, it may yield undesirable allocations especially when individuals are heterogeneous (e.g., with outliers) - the very reason individualized treatments were introduced in the first place. This observation motivates us to propose an optimal policy that allocates the treatment based on the conditional quantile of individual treatment effects (QoTE). Depending on the choice of the quantile probability, this criterion can accommodate a policymaker who is either prudent or negligent. The challenge of identifying the QoTE lies in its requirement for knowledge of the joint distribution of the counterfactual outcomes, which is generally hard to recover even with experimental data. Therefore, we introduce minimax policies that are robust to model uncertainty. A range of identifying assumptions can be used to yield more informative policies. For both stochastic and deterministic policies, we establish the asymptotic bound on the regret of implementing the proposed policies. In simulations and two empirical applications, we compare optimal decisions based on the QoTE with decisions based on other criteria. The framework can be generalized to any setting where welfare is defined as a functional of the joint distribution of the potential outcomes.</description>

Abstract: Real-world time series data frequently have significant amounts of missing values, posing challenges for advanced analysis. A common approach to address this issue is imputation, where the primary challenge lies in determining the appropriate values to fill in. While previous deep learning methods have proven effective for time series imputation, they often produce overconfident imputations, which could brings a potentially overlooked risk to the reliability of the intelligent system. Diffusion methods are proficient in estimating probability distributions but face challenges with high missing rates and moreover, computationally expensive due to the nature of the generative model framework. In this paper, we propose Quantile Sub-Ensembles, a novel method to estimate uncertainty with ensemble of quantile-regression-based task networks and then incorporate Quantile Sub-Ensembles into a non-generative time series imputation method. Our method not only produces accurate imputations that is robust to high missing rates, but also is computationally efficient due to the fast training of its non-generative model. We examine the performance of the proposed method on two real-world datasets, the air quality and health-care datasets, and conduct extensive experiments to show that our method outperforms other most of the baseline methods in making deterministic and probabilistic imputations. Compared with the diffusion method, CSDI, our approach can obtain comparable forecasting results which is better when more data is missing, and moreover consumes a much smaller computation overhead, yielding much faster training and test.</description>

      <title>Early alignment in two-layer networks training is a two-edged sword</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training neural networks with first order optimisation methods is at the core of the empirical success of deep learning. The scale of initialisation is a crucial factor, as small initialisations are generally associated to a feature learning regime, for which gradient descent is implicitly biased towards simple solutions. This work provides a general and quantitative description of the early alignment phase, originally introduced by Maennel et al. (2018) . For small initialisation and one hidden ReLU layer networks, the early stage of the training dynamics leads to an alignment of the neurons towards key directions. This alignment induces a sparse representation of the network, which is directly related to the implicit bias of gradient flow at convergence. This sparsity inducing alignment however comes at the expense of difficulties in minimising the training objective: we also provide a simple data example for which overparameterised networks fail to converge towards global minima and only converge to a spurious stationary point instead.</description>

      <title>Predictive Analysis for Optimizing Port Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maritime transport is a pivotal logistics mode for the long-distance and bulk transportation of goods. However, the intricate planning involved in this mode is often hindered by uncertainties, including weather conditions, cargo diversity, and port dynamics, leading to increased costs. Consequently, accurate estimation of the total (stay) time of the vessel and any delays at the port are essential for efficient planning and scheduling of port operations. This study aims to develop predictive analytics to address the shortcomings in the previous works of port operations for a vessels Stay Time and Delay Time, offering a valuable contribution to the field of maritime logistics. The proposed solution is designed to assist decision making in port environments and predict service delays. This is demonstrated through a case study on Brazil's ports. Additionally, feature analysis is used to understand the key factors impacting maritime logistics, enhancing the overall understanding of the complexities involved in port operations. Furthermore, we perform Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis to interpret the effects of the features on the outcomes and understand their impact on each sample, providing deeper insights into the factors influencing port operations.</description>

      <title>Chain of Thought Empowers Transformers to Solve Inherently Serial Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12875v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instructing the model to generate a sequence of intermediate steps, a.k.a., a chain of thought (CoT), is a highly effective method to improve the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) on arithmetics and symbolic reasoning tasks. However, the mechanism behind CoT remains unclear. This work provides a theoretical understanding of the power of CoT for decoder-only transformers through the lens of expressiveness. Conceptually, CoT empowers the model with the ability to perform inherently serial computation, which is otherwise lacking in transformers, especially when depth is low. Given input length $n$, previous works have shown that constant-depth transformers with finite precision $\mathsf{poly}(n)$ embedding size can only solve problems in $\mathsf{TC}^0$ without CoT. We first show an even tighter expressiveness upper bound for constant-depth transformers with constant-bit precision, which can only solve problems in $\mathsf{AC}^0$, a proper subset of $ \mathsf{TC}^0$. However, with $T$ steps of CoT, constant-depth transformers using constant-bit precision and $O(\log n)$ embedding size can solve any problem solvable by boolean circuits of size $T$. Empirically, enabling CoT dramatically improves the accuracy for tasks that are hard for parallel computation, including the composition of permutation groups, iterated squaring, and circuit value problems, especially for low-depth transformers.</description>

      <title>Rapid Bayesian identification of sparse nonlinear dynamics from scarce and noisy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a fast probabilistic framework for identifying differential equations governing the dynamics of observed data. We recast the SINDy method within a Bayesian framework and use Gaussian approximations for the prior and likelihood to speed up computation. The resulting method, Bayesian-SINDy, not only quantifies uncertainty in the parameters estimated but also is more robust when learning the correct model from limited and noisy data. Using both synthetic and real-life examples such as Lynx-Hare population dynamics, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the new framework in learning correct model equations and compare its computational and data efficiency with existing methods. Because Bayesian-SINDy can quickly assimilate data and is robust against noise, it is particularly suitable for biological data and real-time system identification in control. Its probabilistic framework also enables the calculation of information entropy, laying the foundation for an active learning strategy.</description>

      <title>Calibration Error for Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13503v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calibration allows predictions to be reliably interpreted as probabilities by decision makers. We propose a decision-theoretic calibration error, the Calibration Decision Loss (CDL), defined as the maximum improvement in decision payoff obtained by calibrating the predictions, where the maximum is over all payoff-bounded decision tasks. Vanishing CDL guarantees the payoff loss from miscalibration vanishes simultaneously for all downstream decision tasks. We show separations between CDL and existing calibration error metrics, including the most well-studied metric Expected Calibration Error (ECE). Our main technical contribution is a new efficient algorithm for online calibration that achieves near-optimal $O(\frac{\log T}{\sqrt{T}})$ expected CDL, bypassing the $\Omega(T^{-0.472})$ lower bound for ECE by Qiao and Valiant (2021).</description>

      <title>SF-DQN: Provable Knowledge Transfer using Successor Feature for Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the transfer reinforcement learning (RL) problem where multiple RL problems have different reward functions but share the same underlying transition dynamics. In this setting, the Q-function of each RL problem (task) can be decomposed into a successor feature (SF) and a reward mapping: the former characterizes the transition dynamics, and the latter characterizes the task-specific reward function. This Q-function decomposition, coupled with a policy improvement operator known as generalized policy improvement (GPI), reduces the sample complexity of finding the optimal Q-function, and thus the SF \&amp; GPI framework exhibits promising empirical performance compared to traditional RL methods like Q-learning. However, its theoretical foundations remain largely unestablished, especially when learning the successor features using deep neural networks (SF-DQN). This paper studies the provable knowledge transfer using SFs-DQN in transfer RL problems. We establish the first convergence analysis with provable generalization guarantees for SF-DQN with GPI. The theory reveals that SF-DQN with GPI outperforms conventional RL approaches, such as deep Q-network, in terms of both faster convergence rate and better generalization. Numerical experiments on real and synthetic RL tasks support the superior performance of SF-DQN \&amp; GPI, aligning with our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Unmasking Trees for Tabular Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite much work on advanced deep learning and generative modeling techniques for tabular data generation and imputation, traditional methods have continued to win on imputation benchmarks. We herein present UnmaskingTrees, a simple method for tabular imputation (and generation) employing gradient-boosted decision trees which are used to incrementally unmask individual features. This approach offers state-of-the-art performance on imputation, and on generation given training data with missingness; and it has competitive performance on vanilla generation. To solve the conditional generation subproblem, we propose a tabular probabilistic prediction method, BaltoBot, which fits a balanced tree of boosted tree classifiers. Unlike older methods, it requires no parametric assumption on the conditional distribution, accommodating features with multimodal distributions; unlike newer diffusion methods, it offers fast sampling, closed-form density estimation, and flexible handling of discrete variables. We finally consider our two approaches as meta-algorithms, demonstrating in-context learning-based generative modeling with TabPFN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are having transformative impacts across a wide range of scientific fields, particularly in the biomedical sciences. Just as the goal of Natural Language Processing is to understand sequences of words, a major objective in biology is to understand biological sequences. Genomic Language Models (gLMs), which are LLMs trained on DNA sequences, have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of genomes and how DNA elements at various scales interact to give rise to complex functions. To showcase this potential, we highlight key applications of gLMs, including functional constraint prediction, sequence design, and transfer learning. Despite notable recent progress, however, developing effective and efficient gLMs presents numerous challenges, especially for species with large, complex genomes. Here, we discuss major considerations for developing and evaluating gLMs.</description>

      <title>A Resolution Independent Neural Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Deep operator network (DeepONet) is a powerful yet simple neural operator architecture that utilizes two deep neural networks to learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. This architecture is highly flexible, allowing the evaluation of the solution field at any location within the desired domain. However, it imposes a strict constraint on the input space, requiring all input functions to be discretized at the same locations; this limits its practical applications. In this work, we introduce RINO, which provides a framework to make DeepONet resolution-independent, enabling it to handle input functions that are arbitrarily, but sufficiently finely, discretized. To this end, we propose two dictionary learning algorithms to adaptively learn a set of appropriate continuous basis functions, parameterized as implicit neural representations (INRs), from correlated signals defined on arbitrary point cloud data. These basis functions are then used to project arbitrary input function data as a point cloud onto an embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions) with dimensionality equal to the dictionary size, which DeepONet can directly use without any architectural changes. In particular, we utilize sinusoidal representation networks (SIRENs) as trainable INR basis functions. The introduced dictionary learning algorithms can be used in a similar way to learn an appropriate dictionary of basis functions for the output function data. This approach can be seen as an extension of POD DeepONet for cases where the realizations of the output functions have different discretizations, making the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) approach inapplicable. We demonstrate the robustness and applicability of RINO in handling arbitrarily (but sufficiently richly) sampled input and output functions during both training and inference through several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Markov Chain Variance Estimation: A Stochastic Approximation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the asymptotic variance of a function defined on a Markov chain, an important step for statistical inference of the stationary mean. We design a novel recursive estimator that requires $O(1)$ computation at each step, does not require storing any historical samples or any prior knowledge of run-length, and has optimal $O(\frac{1}{n})$ rate of convergence for the mean-squared error (MSE) with provable finite sample guarantees. Here, $n$ refers to the total number of samples generated. Our estimator is based on linear stochastic approximation of an equivalent formulation of the asymptotic variance in terms of the solution of the Poisson equation.
  We generalize our estimator in several directions, including estimating the covariance matrix for vector-valued functions, estimating the stationary variance of a Markov chain, and approximately estimating the asymptotic variance in settings where the state space of the underlying Markov chain is large. We also show applications of our estimator in average reward reinforcement learning (RL), where we work with asymptotic variance as a risk measure to model safety-critical applications. We design a temporal-difference type algorithm tailored for policy evaluation in this context. We consider both the tabular and linear function approximation settings. Our work paves the way for developing actor-critic style algorithms for variance-constrained RL.</description>

      <title>Modelling Global Trade with Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global trade is shaped by a complex mix of factors beyond supply and demand, including tangible variables like transport costs and tariffs, as well as less quantifiable influences such as political and economic relations. Traditionally, economists model trade using gravity models, which rely on explicit covariates but often struggle to capture these subtler drivers of trade. In this work, we employ optimal transport and a deep neural network to learn a time-dependent cost function from data, without imposing a specific functional form. This approach consistently outperforms traditional gravity models in accuracy while providing natural uncertainty quantification. Applying our framework to global food and agricultural trade, we show that the global South suffered disproportionately from the war in Ukraine's impact on wheat markets. We also analyze the effects of free-trade agreements and trade disputes with China, as well as Brexit's impact on British trade with Europe, uncovering hidden patterns that trade volumes alone cannot reveal.</description>

      <title>Coherence influx is indispensable for quantum reservoir computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Echo state property (ESP) is a fundamental property that allows an input-driven dynamical system to perform information processing tasks. Recently, extensions of ESP to potentially nonstationary systems and subsystems, that is, nonstationary ESP and subset/subspace ESP, have been proposed. In this paper, we theoretically and numerically analyze the sufficient and necessary conditions for a quantum system to satisfy nonstationary ESP and subset/subspace nonstationary ESP. Based on extensive usage of the Pauli transfer matrix (PTM) form, we find that (1) the interaction with a quantum-coherent environment, termed $\textit{coherence influx}$, is indispensable in realizing nonstationary ESP, and (2) the spectral radius of PTM can characterize the fading memory property of quantum reservoir computing (QRC). Our numerical experiment, involving a system with a Hamiltonian that entails a spin-glass/many-body localization phase, reveals that the spectral radius of PTM can describe the dynamical phase transition intrinsic to such a system. To comprehensively understand the mechanisms under ESP of QRC, we propose a simplified model, multiplicative reservoir computing (mRC), which is a reservoir computing (RC) system with a one-dimensional multiplicative input. Theoretically and numerically, we show that the parameters corresponding to the spectral radius and coherence influx in mRC directly correlates with its linear memory capacity (MC). Our findings about QRC and mRC will provide a theoretical aspect of PTM and the input multiplicativity of QRC. The results will lead to a better understanding of QRC and information processing in open quantum systems.</description>
