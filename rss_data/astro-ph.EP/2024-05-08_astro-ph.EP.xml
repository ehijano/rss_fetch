      <title>TRACE: a Time-Reversible Algorithm for Close Encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present TRACE, a time-reversible hybrid integrator for the planetary N-body problem. Like hybrid symplectic integrators, TRACE can resolve close encounters between particles while retaining many of the accuracy and speed advantages of a fixed timestep symplectic method such the Wisdom-Holman map. TRACE switches methods time-reversibly during close encounters following the prescription of Hernandez and Dehnen (2023). In this paper we describe the derivation and implementation of TRACE and study its performance for a variety of astrophysical systems. In all our test cases TRACE is at least as accurate and fast as the hybrid symplectic integrator MERCURIUS. In many cases TRACE's performance is vastly superior to that of MERCURIUS. In test cases with planet-planet close encounters, TRACE is as accurate as MECURIUS with a 13x speedup. If close encounters with the central star are considered, TRACE achieves good error performance while MERCURIUS fails to give qualitatively correct results. In ensemble tests of violent scattering systems, TRACE matches the high-accuracy IAS15 while providing a 20x speed-up. In large N systems simulating lunar accretion, TRACE qualitatively gives the same results as IAS15 but at a 47x speedup. We also discuss some cases such as von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles where hybrid integrators perform poorly and provide some guidance on which integrator to use for which system. TRACE is freely available within the REBOUND package.</description>

      <title>Observation uncertainty effects on the precision of interior planetary parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining compositions of low-mass exoplanets is essential in understanding their origins. The certainty by which masses and radius are measured affects our ability to discern planets that are rocky or volatile rich. In this study, we aim to determine sound observational strategies to avoid diminishing returns. We quantify how uncertainties in mass, radius and model assumptions propagate into errors in inferred compositions of rocky and water planets. For a target error in a planet's iron-mass fraction or water content, we calculate the corresponding required accuracies in radius and mass. For instance, a rocky planet with a known radius error of 2% (corresponding to TESS detection best errors) demands mass precision to be at 5-11% to attain a 8 wt% precision in iron-mass fraction, regardless of mass. Similarly, a water world of equal radius precision requires 9-20% mass precision to confine the water content within a 10 wt% margin. Lighter planets are more difficult to constrain, especially water-rich versus water-poor worlds. Studying Earth as an exoplanet, we find a $\sim \pm5$ point "error floor" in iron-mass fraction and $\sim \pm7$ in core-mass fraction from our lack of knowledge on mineralogy. The results presented here can quickly guide observing strategies to maximize insights into small exoplanet compositions while avoiding over-observing.</description>

      <title>Energy and temperature dependencies for electron-induced sputtering from H$_2$O-ice: Implications for the icy Galilean moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To better assess the role that electrons play in exosphere production on icy-rich bodies, we measured the total and O$_2$ sputtering yields from H$_2$O-ice for electrons with energies between 0.75 and 10 keV and temperatures between 15 and 124.5 K. We find that both total and O$_2$ yields increase with decreasing energy over our studied range, increase rapidly at temperatures above 60 K, and that the relative amount of H$_2$O in the sputtered flux decreases quickly with increasing energy. Combining our data with other electron data in literature, we show that the accuracy of a widely used sputtering model can be improved significantly for electrons by adjusting some of the intrinsic parameter values. Applying our results to Europa, we estimate that electrons contribute to the production of the O$_2$ exosphere equally to all ion types combined. In contrast, sputtering of O$_2$ from Ganymede and Callisto appears to be dominated by irradiating ions, though electrons still likely contribute a non-negligible amount. While our estimates could be further refined by examining the importance of spatial variations in electron flux, we conclude that, at the very least, electrons seem to be important for exosphere production on icy surfaces and should be included in future modeling efforts.</description>

      <title>Scattering of Giant Planets and Implications for the Origin of the Hierarchical and Eccentric Two-planet System GJ 1148</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GJ 1148 system has two Saturn-mass planets orbiting around an M dwarf star on hierarchical and eccentric orbits, with orbital period ratio of 13 and eccentricities of both planets of 0.375. The inner planet is in the regime of eccentric warm Jupiters. We perform numerical experiments to study the planet-planet scattering scenario for the origin of this orbital architecture. We consider a third planet of $0.1 M_J$ (Jupiter's mass) in the initial GJ 1148 system with initial orbital separations of 3.5, 4, and 4.5 mutual Hill radii and initial semimajor axis of the innermost planet in the range of 0.10-0.50 au. The majority of scattering results in planet-planet collisions, followed by planet ejections, and planet-star close approaches. Among them, only planet ejections produce eccentric and widely separated two-planet systems, with some having similar orbital properties to the GJ 1148 system. We also examine the effects of general relativistic apsidal precession and a higher mass of $0.227 M_J$ for the third planet. The simulation results suggest that the GJ 1148 system may have lost a giant planet. We also perform simulations of the general problem of the origin of warm Jupiters by planet-planet scattering. As in the GJ 1148 simulations, a nontrivial number of stable two-planet systems are produced by ejection, which disagrees with the result from a previous study showing that two-planet systems arise exclusively through planet-planet collisions.</description>

      <title>Super-Earths and Earth-like Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last few years astronomical surveys have expanded the reach of planetary science into the realm of small and dense extrasolar worlds. These share a number of characteristics with the terrestrial and icy planetary objects of the Solar System, but keep stretching previous understanding of the known limits of planetary thermodynamics, material properties, and climate regimes. Improved compositional and thermal constraints on exoplanets below $\sim$2 Earth radii suggest efficient accretion of atmosphere-forming volatile elements in a fraction of planetary systems, pointing to rapid formation, planet-scale melting, and chemical equilibration between the core, mantle, and atmosphere of rocky and volatile-rich exoplanets. Meaningful interpretation of novel observational data from these worlds necessitates cross-disciplinary expansion of known material properties under extreme thermodynamic, non-solar conditions, and accounting for dynamic feedbacks between interior and atmospheric processes. Exploration of the atmosphere and surface composition of individual, short-period super-Earths in the next few years will enable key inferences on magma ocean dynamics, the redox state of rocky planetary mantles, and mixing between volatile and refractory phases in planetary regimes that are absent from the present-day Solar System, and reminiscent of the conditions of the prebiotic Earth. The atmospheric characterization of climate diversity and the statistical search for biosignatures on terrestrial exoplanets on temperate orbits will require space-based direct imaging surveys, capable of resolving emission features of major and trace gases in both shortwave and mid-infrared wavelengths.</description>

      <title>The utility of infrasound in global monitoring of extraterrestrial impacts: A case study of the 23 July 2008 Tajikistan bolide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among various observational techniques used for detection of large bolides on a global scale is a low frequency sound known as infrasound. Infrasound, which is also one of the four sensing modalities used by the International Monitoring System (IMS), offers continuous global monitoring, and can be leveraged towards planetary defense. Infrasonic records can provide an additional dimension for event characterization and a distinct perspective that might not be available through any other observational method. This paper describes infrasonic detection and characterization of the bolide that disintegrated over Tajikistan on 23 July 2008. This event was detected by two infrasound stations at distances of 1530 and 2130 km. Propagation paths to one of the stations were not predicted by the model despite being clearly detected. The presence of the signal is attributed to the acoustic energy being trapped in a weak but leaky stratospheric AtmoSOFAR channel. The infrasound signal analysis indicates that the shock originated at the point of the main breakup at an altitude of 35 km. The primary mode of shock production of the signal detected at the two stations was a spherical blast resulting from the main gross fragmentation episode. The energy estimate, based on the signal period, is 0.17-0.51 kt of TNT equivalent, suggesting a mass of 6.6-23.5 tons. The corresponding object radius, assuming the chondritic origin, was 0.78-1.18 m.</description>

      <title>How the presence of a giant planet affects the outcome of terrestrial planet formation simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The architecture and masses of planetary systems in the habitable zone could be strongly influenced by outer giant planets, if present. We investigate here the impact of outer giants on terrestrial planet formation, under the assumption that the final assembly of the planetary system is set by a giant impact phase. Utilizing a state-of-the-art N-body simulation software, GENGA, we interpret how the late stage of terrestrial planet formation results in diversity within planetary systems. We design two global model setups: in the first we place a gas giant on the outer side of planetesimals and embryos disk, while the other only has planetesimals and embryos but no giant. For the model including the outer giant, we study the effect of different giant initial masses, in the range 1.0-3.0 Jupiter mass, and orbital radii, in the range 2.0-5.8 AU.We also study the influence of different initial positions of planetesimals and embryos on the results. Our N-body simulation time is approximately 50 Myr. The results show that the existence of outer giant will promote the interaction between planetesimals and embryos, making the orbits of the formed terrestrial planets more compact, but placing the giant planet too close to the planetesimals and embryos disk suppresses the formation of massive rocky planets. In addition, under the classical theory, where planetary embryos and planetesimals collide to form terrestrial planets, our results show that the presence of a giant planet actually decreases the gap complexity of the inner planetary system.</description>

      <title>"Horseshoe" Structures in the Debris Disks of Planet-Hosting Binary Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of a planetary system from the protoplanetary disk leads to destruction of the latter; however, a debris disk can remain in the form of asteroids and cometary material. The motion of planets can cause the formation of coorbital structures from the debris disk matter. Previous calculations have shown that such a ring-like structure is more stable if there is a binary star in the center of the system, as opposed to a single star. To analyze the properties of the coorbital structure, we have calculated a grid of models of binary star systems with a circumbinary planet moving in a planetesimal disk. The calculations are performed considering circular orbits of the stars and the planet; the mass and position of the planet, as well as the mass ratio of the stars, are varied. The analysis of the models shows that the width of the coorbital ring and its stability significantly depend on the initial parameters of the problem. Additionally, the empirical dependences of the width of the coorbital structure on the parameters of the system have been obtained, and the parameters of the models with the most stable coorbital structures have been determined. The results of the present study can be used for the search of planets around binary stars with debris disks.</description>

      <title>The Chemical Composition of Ryugu: Prospects as a Reference Material for Solar System Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hayabusa 2 spacecraft sampled approximately 5.4 g of asteroid material from the Cb-type asteroid Ryugu. Initial analysis of the Ryugu materials revealed a mineralogical, chemical, and isotopic kinship to the CI chondrites. The pristine nature of Ryugu makes the returned samples ideal for constraining the composition of the Solar System. However, some elements (e.g., P, Ca, Mn, and rare earth elements) show large relative dispersions compared to the other elements in the returned materials studied so far, most likely due to the presence of aqueously formed secondary minerals (e.g., carbonates, phosphates) in Ryugu. Therefore, the estimation of the Solar System composition using currently available Ryugu data is challenging due to the so-called nugget effect of carbonates, phosphates, and possibly other accessory minerals. The nugget effect can be mitigated by analyzing a homogenized, relatively large amount of sample. We estimate that for approximately 0.1 g of Ryugu sample, the dispersion (2SD) of the bulk Mn/Cr and Rb/Sr ratios are +/-13% and +/-15%, respectively, while they will be improved to be better than +/-5% for approximately 1 g of homogenized Ryugu sample. To further constrain the Solar System composition and to evaluate if previous estimates based on CI chondrites stored in museums for decades to centuries are reliable, it is strongly recommended to determine the chemical and isotopic compositions of Ryugu using a homogenized sample prepared from relatively large (approx. 1 g) returned material. Determining Ryugu reference compositions will be used by multidisciplinary communities, including Earth and planetary sciences, astronomy, physics, and chemistry.</description>

      <title>SCExAO/CHARIS Multi-Wavelength, High-Contrast Imaging of the BD+45$^\circ$598 Debris Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength (1.16$\mu$m-2.37$\mu$m) view of the debris disk around BD+45$^\circ$598, using the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics system paired with the Coronagraphic High Angular Resolution Imaging Spectrograph. With an assumed age of 23 Myr, this source allows us to study the early evolution of debris disks and search for forming planets. We fit a scattered light model to our disk using a differential evolution algorithm, and constrain its geometry. We find the disk to have a peak density radius of $R_0 = 109.6$ au, an inclination of $i = 88.1^\circ$, and position angle $PA = 111.0^\circ$. While we do not detect a substellar companion in the disk, our calculated contrast limits indicate sensitivity to planets as small as $\sim 10 M_{\rm Jup}$ at a projected separation of 12 au of the star, and as small as $\sim 4 M_{\rm Jup}$ beyond 38 au. When measuring intensity as a function of wavelength, the disk color constrains the minimum dust grain size within a range of $\sim0.13$ to 1.01$\mu$m.</description>

      <title>The six-planet resonant chain of HD 110067</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HD 110067 is the brightest star known to have six transiting planets. Each adjacent pair of planets has a period ratio that is nearly equal to a ratio of small integers, suggesting the planets are in a chain of mean-motion resonances, but the limited timespan of the available data has prevented firm conclusions. Here, we show that the requirement of long-term dynamical stability implies that all six planets are very likely to form a resonant chain. Dynamical simulations of non-resonant systems with initial conditions compatible with the available data almost always suffer an instability within $25$ Myr ($\sim 0.3 \%$ of the system's age). Assuming the system is in resonance, we place upper limits on the planets' eccentricities, and lower limits on the masses of the planets that have not yet been measured. We also predict the characteristics of transit timing variations and the values of the three-body libration centers.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the Remarkably Red L/T Transition Object VHS J183135.58-551355.9</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of VHS J183135.58$-$551355.9 (hereafter VHS J1831$-$5513), an L/T transition dwarf identified as a result of its unusually red near-infrared colors ($J-K_{\rm S}=3.633\pm0.277$ mag; $J-W2=6.249\pm0.245$ mag) from the VISTA Hemisphere Survey and CatWISE2020 surveys. We obtain low resolution near-infrared spectroscopy of VHS J1831$-$5513 using Magellan/FIRE to confirm its extremely red nature and assess features sensitive to surface gravity (i.e., youth). Its near-infrared spectrum shows multiple CH$_{\rm 4}$ absorption features, indicating an exceptionally low effective temperature for its spectral type. Based on proper motion measurements from CatWISE2020 and a photometric distance derived from its $K_{\rm S}$-band magnitude, we find that VHS J1831$-$5513 is a likely ($\sim$85$\%$ probability) kinematic member of the $\beta$ Pictoris moving group. Future radial velocity and trigonometric parallax measurements will clarify such membership. Follow-up mid-infrared or higher resolution near-infrared spectroscopy of this object will allow for further investigation as to the cause(s) of its redness, such as youth, clouds, and viewing geometry.</description>

      <title>SPIRou spectropolarimetry of the T Tauri star TW Hydrae: magnetic fields, accretion and planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we report near-infrared observations of the classical T Tauri star TW Hya with the SPIRou high-resolution spectropolarimeter and velocimeter at the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. By applying Least-Squares Deconvolution (LSD) to our circularly polarized spectra, we derived longitudinal fields that vary from year to year from -200 to +100 G, and exhibit low-level modulation on the 3.6 d rotation period of TW Hya, despite the star being viewed almost pole-on. We then used Zeeman-Doppler Imaging to invert our sets of unpolarized and circularly-polarized LSD profiles into brightness and magnetic maps of TW Hya in all 4 seasons, and obtain that the large-scale field of this T Tauri star mainly consists of a 1.0-1.2 kG dipole tilted at about 20{\deg} to the rotation axis, whereas the small-scale field reaches strengths of up to 3-4 kG. We find that the large-scale field is strong enough to allow TW Hya to accrete material from the disc on the polar regions at the stellar surface in a more or less geometrically stable accretion pattern, but not to succeed in spinning down the star. We also report the discovery of a radial velocity signal of semi-amplitude $11.1^{+3.3}_{-2.6}$ m/s (detected at 4.3$\sigma$ at a period of 8.3 d in the spectrum of TW Hya, whose origin may be attributed to either a non-axisymmetric density structure in the inner accretion disc, or to a $0.55^{+0.17}_{-0.13}$ Jupiter mass candidate close-in planet (if orbiting in the disc plane), at an orbital distance of $0.075\pm0.001$ au.</description>

      <title>FRECKLL: Full and Reduced Exoplanet Chemical Kinetics distiLLed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new Python 1D chemical kinetic code FRECKLL (Full and Reduced Exoplanet Chemical Kinetics distiLLed) to evolve large chemical networks efficiently. FRECKLL employs `distillation' in computing the reaction rates, which minimizes the error bounds to the minimum allowed by double precision values ($\epsilon \leq 10^{-15}$). Compared to summation of rates with traditional algorithms like pairwise summation, distillation provides a tenfold reduction in solver time for both full and reduced networks. Both the full and reduced Venot2020 networks are packaged in FRECKLL as well as a TauREx 3.1 plugin for usage in forward modelling and retrievals of exoplanet atmospheres. We present TauREx retrievals performed on a simulated HD189733 JWST spectra using the full and reduced Venot2020 chemical networks and demonstrate the viability of total disequilibrium chemistry retrievals and the ability for JWST to detect disequilibrium processes.</description>

      <title>Keck and Hubble Observations Show That MOA-2008-BLG-379Lb Is a Super-Jupiter Orbiting an M Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present high angular resolution imaging that detects the MOA-2008-BLG-379L exoplanet host star using Keck adaptive optics and the Hubble Space Telescope. These observations reveal host star and planet masses of $M_{\rm host}=0.434\pm0.065 M_\odot$, and $m_p=2.44 \pm 0.49 M_{\rm Jupiter}$. They are located at a distance of $D_L=3.44\pm0.53\,$kpc, with a projected separation of $2.70\pm 0.42\,$AU. These results contribute to our determination of exoplanet host star masses for the Suzuki et al. (2016) statistical sample, which will determine the dependence of the planet occurrence rate on the mass and distance of the host stars. We also present a detailed discussion of the image constrained modeling version of the eesunhong light curve modeling code that applies high angular resolution image constraints to the light curve modeling process. This code increases modeling efficiency by a large factor by excluding models that are inconsistent with the high angular resolution images. The analysis of this and other events from the Suzuki et al. (2016) statistical sample reveals the importance of including higher order effects, such as microlensing parallax and planetary orbital motion even when these features are not required to fit the light curve data. The inclusion of these effects may be needed to obtain accurate estimates of the uncertainty of other microlensing parameters that affect the inferred properties of exoplanet microlens systems. This will be important for the exoplanet microlensing survey of the Roman Space Telescope, which will use both light curve photometry and high angular resolution imaging to characterize planetary microlens systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamo action driven by precessional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reveal and analyze an efficient magnetic dynamo action due to precession-driven hydrodynamic turbulence in the local model of a precessional flow, focusing on the kinematic stage of this dynamo. The growth rate of magnetic field monotonically increases with Poincar\'{e} number, $\rm Po$, characterizing precession strength, and magnetic Prandtl number, $\rm Pm$, equal to the ratio of viscosity to resistivity, for the considered ranges of these parameters. The critical ${\rm Po}_c$ for the dynamo onset decreases with increasing $\rm Pm$. To understand the scale-by-scale evolution (growth) of the precession dynamo and its driving processes, we perform spectral analysis by calculating the spectra of magnetic energy and of different terms in the induction equation in Fourier space. To this end, we decompose the velocity field of precession-driven turbulence into 2D vortical and 3D inertial wave modes. It is shown that the dynamo operates across a broad range of scales and exhibits a remarkable transition from a primarily vortex-driven regime at lower $\rm Po$ to a more complex regime at higher $\rm Po$ where it is driven jointly by vortices, inertial waves and the shear of the background precessional flow. The vortices and shear drive the dynamo mostly at large scales, comparable to the flow system size, and at intermediate scales, while at smaller scales it is mainly driven by inertial waves. This study can be important not only for understanding the magnetic dynamo action in precession-driven flows, but also in a general context of flows where vortices emerge and govern the flow dynamics and evolution.</description>
