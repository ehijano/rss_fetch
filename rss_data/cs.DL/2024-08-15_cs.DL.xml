      <title>Evaluating Research Quality with Large Language Models: An Analysis of ChatGPT's Effectiveness with Different Settings and Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating the quality of academic journal articles is a time consuming but critical task for national research evaluation exercises, appointments and promotion. It is therefore important to investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can play a role in this process. This article assesses which ChatGPT inputs (full text without tables, figures and references; title and abstract; title only) produce better quality score estimates, and the extent to which scores are affected by ChatGPT models and system prompts. The results show that the optimal input is the article title and abstract, with average ChatGPT scores based on these (30 iterations on a dataset of 51 papers) correlating at 0.67 with human scores, the highest ever reported. ChatGPT 4o is slightly better than 3.5-turbo (0.66), and 4o-mini (0.66). The results suggest that article full texts might confuse LLM research quality evaluations, even though complex system instructions for the task are more effective than simple ones. Thus, whilst abstracts contain insufficient information for a thorough assessment of rigour, they may contain strong pointers about originality and significance. Finally, linear regression can be used to convert the model scores into the human scale scores, which is 31% more accurate than guessing.</description>

      <title>Geotree of Geodetector: An Anatomy of Knowledge Diffusion of a Novel Statistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing number of citations to original publications highlighted their utility across academia, but the dissemination of knowledge from tacit conceptualization to scientific publications and its global applications remains understudied, and the prediction of knowledge trends in a disciplinary context is rare. Addressing the gaps, this paper constructed a tree-like hierarchical model (Geotree) to dissect the knowledge evolution paths of the Geodetector theory (a case) using the Web of Science citation database. Our results revealed that the knowledge evolution of 932 citations to Geodetector was partitioned into periods: a budding period of initial theoretical exploration, a growing period for emerging topics in application, and a mature period marked by significant citation growth. Our test R2 of the predicting model over the next decade, considering the tree-like hierarchy across research directions and disciplines, was 100% higher than that of the other two (from 0.29 to 0.58). The knowledge spreading, from China to North America in 2011, Europe in 2012, Oceania in 2017, South America in 2018, and Africa in 2019, was more associated with a country s production of scientific publications (q-statistic = 0.307***) than its income level. The Geotree modeling of two other cases from space science and physics confirmed the reliability of the source publication-based approach in tracking knowledge diffusion. Our established research framework enriched the current methodology of information science and provided valuable references for policymakers and scholars to enhance their decision-making processes.</description>
