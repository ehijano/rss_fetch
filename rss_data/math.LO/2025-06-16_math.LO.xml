      <title>On Effective Banach-Mazur Games and an application to the Poincar\'e Recurrence Theorem for Category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Banach-Mazur game characterizes sets of first category in a topological space. In this work, we show that an effectivized version of the game yields a characterization of sets of effective first category. Using this, we give a proof for the effective Banach Category Theorem. Further, we provide a game-theoretic proof of an effective theorem in dynamical systems, namely the category version of Poincar\'e Recurrence. The Poincar\'e Recurrence Theorem for category states that for a homeomorphism without open wandering sets, the set of non recurrent points forms a first category (meager) set. As an application of the effectivization of the Banach-Mazur game, we show that such a result holds true in effective settings as well.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity, extendable choice and descending distributive forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the forcing property of descending distributivity. A forcing $\mathbb{P}$ is $\kappa$-descending distributive if for all decreasing sequences $(D_\alpha)_{\alpha&lt;\kappa}$ of open dense sets, $\bigcap_\alpha D_\alpha$ is open dense. This generalises the informal idea that $\mathbb{P}$ doesn't affect much on the scale of $\kappa$, such as if $\mathbb{P}$ is $\kappa$-distributive or if $\kappa &gt; \lvert \mathbb{P} \rvert$. For example, a $\kappa$-descending distributive forcing will not change the cofinality of $\kappa$ or introduce fresh functions on $\kappa$.
  Using this, we investigate the phenomenon of eccentric sets, those sets $X$ such that, for some ordinal $\alpha$, $X$ surjects onto $\alpha$, but $\alpha$ does not inject into $X$. We refine prior works of the author by giving explicit calculations for the Hartogs and Lindenbaum numbers in eccentric constructions and providing a sharper description of the Hartogs-Lindenbaum spectra of models of small violations of choice. To do so we further develop an axiom (scheme) introduced by Levy that we call the axiom of extendable choice. For an ordinal $\alpha$, $\mathsf{EC}_\alpha$ asserts that if $\emptyset \notin A = \{A_\gamma \mid \gamma &lt; \alpha\}$ and, for all $\beta &lt; \alpha$, $\{ A_\gamma \mid \gamma &lt; \beta\}$ has a choice function, then $A$ has a choice function. This is closely tied to the presence of eccentric sets, and we construct symmetric extensions that give fine control over the $\alpha$ for which $\mathsf{EC}_\alpha$ holds by using descending distributivity.</description>

      <title>Rate of metastability of an iterative algorithm for quadratic optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, relying on methods from proof mining, we provide a quantitative analysis of a theorem due to Xu, stating that an iteration strongly converges to the solution of a well known quadratic optimization problem. Rates of metastability and some rates of asymptotic regularity were obtained. We get quadratic rates of asymptotic regularity for particular sequences.</description>

      <title>Blok-Esakia Theorems via Stable Canonical Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.08863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new uniform method for studying modal companions of superintuitionistic rule systems and related notions, based on the machinery of stable canonical rules. Using this method, we obtain alternative proofs of the Blok-Esakia theorem and of the Dummett-Lemmon conjecture for rule systems. Since stable canonical rules may be developed for any rule system admitting filtration, our method generalizes smoothly to richer signatures. Using essentially the same argument, we obtain a proof of an analogue of the Blok-Esakia theorem for bi-superintuitionistic and tense rule systems, and of the Kuznetsov-Muravitsky isomorphism between rule systems extending the modal intuitionistic logic $\logic{KM}$ and modal rule systems extending the provability logic $\logic{GL}$. In addition, our proof of the Dummett-Lemmon conjecture also generalizes to the bi-superintuitionistic and tense cases.</description>

      <title>Two types of filtrations for $\mathrm{wK4}$ and its relatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00457v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the finite model property of subframe logics with expressible transitive reflexive closure modality. For $m&gt;0$, let $\mathrm{L}_m$ be the logic defined by axiom $\lozenge^{m+1} p\to \lozenge p\vee p$. We construct filtrations for the logics $\mathrm{L}_m$. It follows that these logics and their tense counterparts have the finite model property. Then we show that every canonical subframe logic that contains $\mathrm{L}_m$ have the finite model property.</description>

      <title>Definable separability and second-countability in o-minimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that separability and second-countability are first-order properties among topological spaces definable in o-minimal expansions of $(\mathbb{R},&lt;)$. We do so by introducing first-order characterizations -- definable separability and definable second-countability -- which make sense in a wider model-theoretic context. We prove that, within o-minimality, these notions have the desired properties, including their equivalence among definable metric spaces, and conjecture a definable version of Urysohn's Metrization Theorem.</description>

      <title>The elementary theory of free Steiner triple systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free Steiner triple systems (STS) are infinite structures that are naturally characterised by a universal property. We consider the class of free STSs from a model theoretic viewpoint. We show that free STSs on any number of generators are elementarily equivalent. We axiomatise their theory and show that it is stable.</description>

      <title>Twenty years of Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il's classification programme of Ramsey classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 1970s, structural Ramsey theory emerged as a new branch of combinatorics. This development came with the isolation of the concepts of the $\mathbf{A}$-Ramsey property and Ramsey class. Following the influential Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il-R\"odl theorem, several Ramsey classes have been identified. In the 1980s Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, inspired by a seminar of Lachlan, discovered a crucial connection between Ramsey classes and Fra\"iss\'e classes and, in his 1989 paper, connected the classification programme of homogeneous structures to structural Ramsey theory. In 2005, Kechris, Pestov, and Todor\v{c}evi\'c revitalized the field by connecting Ramsey classes to topological dynamics. This breakthrough motivated Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il to propose a program for classifying Ramsey classes. We review the progress made on this program in the past two decades, list open problems, and discuss recent extensions to new areas, namely the extension property for partial automorphisms (EPPA), and big Ramsey structures.</description>

      <title>Fractal dimensions and profinite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a finitely branching rooted tree such that any node has at least two successors. The path space $[T]$ is an ultrametric space: for distinct paths $f,g$ let $d(f,g)= 1/|T_n|$, where $T_n$ denotes the $n$-th level of the tree, and $n$ is least such that $f(n)\neq g(n)$. Let $S$ be a subtree of $T$ without leaves that is level-wise uniformly branching, in the sense that the number of successors of a node only depends on its level. We show that the Hausdorff and lower box dimensions coincide for~$[S]$, and the packing and upper box dimensions also coincide. We give geometric proofs, as well as proofs based on the point-to-set principles. We use the first result to reprove a result of Barnea and Shalev on the dimension of closed subgroups of a profinite group $G$, referring only on the geometric structure of the closed subgroup in the canonical path space given by an inverse system for $G$.</description>

      <title>Distributive Laws of Monadic Containers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Containers are used to carve out a class of strictly positive data types in terms of shapes and positions. They can be interpreted via a fully-faithful functor into endofunctors on Set. Monadic containers are those containers whose interpretation as a Set functor carries a monad structure. The category of containers is closed under container composition and is a monoidal category, whereas monadic containers do not in general compose.
  In this paper, we develop a characterisation of distributive laws of monadic containers. Distributive laws were introduced as a sufficient condition for the composition of the underlying functors of two monads to also carry a monad structure. Our development parallels Ahman and Uustalu's characterisation of distributive laws of directed containers, i.e. containers whose Set functor interpretation carries a comonad structure. Furthermore, by combining our work with theirs, we construct characterisations of mixed distributive laws (i.e. of directed containers over monadic containers and vice versa), thereby completing the 'zoo' of container characterisations of (co)monads and their distributive laws.
  We have found these characterisations amenable to development of existence and uniqueness proofs of distributive laws, particularly in the mechanised setting of Cubical Agda, in which most of the theory of this paper has been formalised.</description>

      <title>Notes on applicative matching logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matching logic (ML) was developed by Grigore Ro\c{s}u and collaborators as a logic for defining the formal semantics of programming languages and for specifying and reasoning about the behavior of programs. These lecture notes present basic definitions and results on applicative matching logic (AML), a functional variant of ML introduced recently by Xiaohong Chen and Grigore Ro\c{s}u. They can be used as an introductory text in the theory of AML. Monk's textbook on mathematical logic has an enormous influence on the notes.</description>
