      <title>ESCAPE project: testing active observing strategies for high-contrast imaging in space on the HiCAT testbed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Roman Space Telescope will be a critical mission to demonstrate high-contrast imaging technologies allowing for the characterisation of exoplanets in reflected light. It will demonstrate $10^{-7}$ contrast limits or better at 3--9 $\lambda / D$ separations with active wavefront control for the first time in space. The detection limits for the Coronagraph Instrument are expected to be set by wavefront variations between the science target and the reference star observations. We are investigating methods to use the deformablel mirrors to methodically probe the impact of such variations on the coronagraphic PSF, generating a PSF library during observations of the reference star to optimise the starlight subtraction at post-processing. We are collaborating with STScI to test and validate these methods in lab using the HiCAT tested, a high-contrast imaging lab platform dedicated to system-level developments for future space missions. In this paper, we will present the first applications of these methods on HiCAT.</description>

      <title>Vision foundation models: can they be applied to astrophysics data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision foundation models, which have demonstrated significant potential in many multimedia applications, are often underutilized in the natural sciences. This is primarily due to mismatches between the nature of domain-specific scientific data and the typical training data used for foundation models, leading to distribution shifts. Scientific data often differ substantially in structure and characteristics; researchers frequently face the challenge of optimizing model performance with limited labeled data of only a few hundred or thousand images. To adapt foundation models effectively requires customized approaches in preprocessing, data augmentation, and training techniques. Additionally, each vision foundation model exhibits unique strengths and limitations, influenced by differences in architecture, training procedures, and the datasets used for training. In this work, we evaluate the application of various vision foundation models to astrophysics data, specifically images from optical and radio astronomy. Our results show that using features extracted by specific foundation models improves the classification accuracy of optical galaxy images compared to conventional supervised training. Similarly, these models achieve equivalent or better performance in object detection tasks with radio images. However, their performance in classifying radio galaxy images is generally poor and often inferior to traditional supervised training results. These findings suggest that selecting suitable vision foundation models for astrophysics applications requires careful consideration of the model characteristics and alignment with the specific requirements of the downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>The SST-1M imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope for gamma-ray astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SST-1M is a Small-Sized Telescope (SST) designed to provide a cost-effective and high-performance solution for gamma-ray astrophysics, particularly for energies beyond a few TeV. The goal is to integrate this telescope into an array of similar instruments, leveraging its lightweight design, earthquake resistance, and established Davies-Cotton configuration. Additionally, its optical system is designed to function without a protective dome, allowing it to withstand the harsh atmospheric conditions typical of mountain environments above 2000 m. The SST-1M utilizes a fully digitizing camera system based on silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). This camera is capable of digitizing all signals from the UV-optical light detectors, allowing for the implementation of various triggers and data analysis methods. We detail the process of designing, prototyping, and validating this system, ensuring that it meets the stringent requirements for gamma-ray detection and performance. An SST-1M stereo system is currently operational and collecting data at the Ond\v{r}ejov observatory in the Czech Republic, situated at 500 m. Preliminary results from this system are promising. A forthcoming paper will provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance of the telescopes in detecting gamma rays and operating under real-world conditions.</description>

      <title>Full-shape analysis with simulation-based priors: cosmological parameters and the structure growth anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore full-shape analysis with simulation-based priors, which is the simplest approach to galaxy clustering data analysis that combines effective field theory (EFT) on large scales and numerical simulations on small scales. The core ingredient of our approach is the prior density of EFT parameters which we extract from a suite of 10500 galaxy simulations based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model. We measure the EFT parameters with the field-level forward model, which enables us to cancel cosmic variance. On the theory side, we develop a new efficient approach to calculate field-level transfer functions using time-sliced perturbation theory and the logarithmic fast Fourier transform. We study cosmology dependence of EFT parameters of dark matter halos and HOD galaxies and find that it can be ignored for the purpose of prior generation. We use neural density estimation to model the measured distribution of EFT parameters. Our distribution model is then used as a prior in a reanalysis of the BOSS full-shape galaxy power spectrum data. Assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model, we find significant ($\approx 30\%$ and $\approx 60\%$) improvements for the matter density fraction and the mass fluctuation amplitude, which are constrained to $\Omega_m= 0.315 \pm 0.010$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.671 \pm 0.027$. The value of the Hubble constant does not change, $H_0= 68.7\pm 1.1$ km/s/Mpc. This reaffirms earlier reports of the structure growth tension from the BOSS data. Finally, we use the measured EFT parameters to constrain galaxy formation physics.</description>

      <title>The Juno Mission as a Probe of Long-Range New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbits of celestial objects, especially the geocentric and heliocentric ones, have been well explored to constrain new long-range forces beyond the Standard Model (SM), often referred to as fifth forces. In this paper, for the first time, we apply the motion of a spacecraft around Jupiter to probe fifth forces that don't violate the equivalence principle. The spacecraft is the Juno orbiter, and ten of its early orbits already allow a precise determination of the Jovian gravitational field. We use the shift in the precession angle as a proxy to test non-gravitational interactions between Juno and Jupiter. Requiring that the contribution from the fifth force does not exceed the uncertainty of the precession shift inferred from data, we find that a new parameter space with the mass of the fifth-force mediator around $10^{-14}$ eV is excluded at 95% C.L.</description>

      <title>Inferring stellar parameters and their uncertainties from high-resolution spectroscopy using invertible neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: New spectroscopic surveys will increase the number of astronomical objects requiring characterization by over tenfold.. Machine learning tools are required to address this data deluge in a fast and accurate fashion. Most machine learning algorithms can not estimate error directly, making them unsuitable for reliable science.
  Aims: We aim to train a supervised deep-learning algorithm tailored for high-resolution observational stellar spectra. This algorithm accurately infer precise estimates while providing coherent estimates of uncertainties by leveraging information from both the neural network and the spectra.
  Methods: We train a conditional Invertible Neural Network (cINN) on observational spectroscopic data obtained from the GIRAFFE spectrograph (HR10 and HR21 setups) within the Gaia-ESO survey. A key features of cINN is its ability to produce the Bayesian posterior distribution of parameters for each spectrum. By analyzing this distribution, we inferred parameters and their uncertainties. Several tests have been applied to study how parameters and errors are estimated.
  Results: We achieved an accuracy of 28K in $T_{\text{eff}}$, 0.06 dex in $\log g$, 0.03 dex in $[\text{Fe/H}]$, and between 0.05 dex and 0.17 dex for the other abundances for high quality spectra. Accuracy remains stable with low signal-to-noise ratio spectra. The uncertainties obtained are well within the same order of magnitude. The network accurately reproduces astrophysical relationships both on the scale of the Milky Way and within smaller star clusters. We created a table containing the new parameters generated by our cINN.
  Conclusion: This neural network represents a compelling proposition for future astronomical surveys. These coherent derived uncertainties make it possible to reuse these estimates in other works as Bayesian priors and thus present a solid basis for future work.</description>

      <title>A Novel Optimal Transport-Based Approach for Interpolating Spectral Time Series: Paving the Way for Photometric Classification of Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for creating spectral time series, which can be used for generating synthetic light curves for photometric classification but also for applications like K-corrections and bolometric corrections. This approach is particularly valuable in the era of large astronomical surveys, where it can significantly enhance the analysis and understanding of an increasing number of SNe, even in the absence of extensive spectroscopic data. methods: By employing interpolations based on optimal transport theory, starting from a spectroscopic sequence, we derive weighted average spectra with high cadence. The weights incorporate an uncertainty factor, for penalizing interpolations between spectra with significant epoch differences and with poor match between the synthetic and observed photometry. results: Our analysis reveals that even with phase difference of up to 40 days between pairs of spectra, optical transport can generate interpolated spectral time series that closely resemble the original ones. Synthetic photometry extracted from these spectral time series aligns well with observed photometry. The best results are achieved in the V band, with relative residuals less than 10% for 87% and 84% of the data for type Ia and II, respectively. For the B, g, R and r bands the relative residuals are between 65% and 87% within the previously mentioned 10% threshold for both classes. The worse results correspond to the i and I bands where, in the case, of SN~Ia the values drop to 53% and 42%, respectively. conclusions: We introduce a new method to construct spectral time series for individual SN starting from a sparse spectroscopic sequence, demonstrating its capability to produce reliable light curves that can be used for photometric classification.</description>

      <title>High-order Accurate Entropy Stable Schemes for Relativistic Hydrodynamics with General Synge-type Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All the existing entropy stable (ES) schemes for relativistic hydrodynamics (RHD) in the literature were restricted to the ideal equation of state (EOS), which however is often a poor approximation for most relativistic flows due to its inconsistency with the relativistic kinetic theory. This paper develops high-order ES finite difference schemes for RHD with general Synge-type EOS, which encompasses a range of special EOSs. We first establish an entropy pair for the RHD equations with general Synge-type EOS in any space dimensions. We rigorously prove that the found entropy function is strictly convex and derive the associated entropy variables, laying the foundation for designing entropy conservative (EC) and ES schemes. Due to relativistic effects, one cannot explicitly express primitive variables, fluxes, and entropy variables in terms of conservative variables. Consequently, this highly complicates the analysis of the entropy structure of the RHD equations, the investigation of entropy convexity, and the construction of EC numerical fluxes. By using a suitable set of parameter variables, we construct novel two-point EC fluxes in a unified form for general Synge-type EOS. We obtain high-order EC schemes through linear combinations of the two-point EC fluxes. Arbitrarily high-order accurate ES schemes are achieved by incorporating dissipation terms into the EC schemes, based on (weighted) essentially non-oscillatory reconstructions. Additionally, we derive the general dissipation matrix for general Synge-type EOS based on the scaled eigenvectors of the RHD system. We also define a suitable average of the dissipation matrix at the cell interfaces to ensure that the resulting ES schemes can resolve stationary contact discontinuities accurately. Several numerical examples are provided to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of our schemes for RHD with four special EOSs.</description>

      <title>AESOPUS 2.1: Low-Temperature Opacities Extended to High Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the critical need for accurate Rosseland mean gas opacities in high-pressure environments, spanning temperatures from 100 K to 32000 K. Current opacity tables from Wichita State University and AESOPUS 2.0 are limited to $\log(R) \le 1$, where $R=\rho\, T_6^{-3}$ in units of $\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}(10^6\mathrm{K})^{-3}$. This is insufficient for modeling very low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, and planets with atmospheres exhibiting higher densities and pressures ($\log(R) &gt; 1$). Leveraging extensive databases such as ExoMol, ExoMolOP, MoLLIST, and HITEMP, we focus on expanding the AESOPUS opacity calculations to cover a broad range of pressure and density conditions ($-8 \leq \log(R) \leq +6$). We incorporate the thermal Doppler mechanism and micro-turbulence velocity. Pressure broadening effects on molecular transitions, leading to Lorentzian or Voigt profiles, are explored in the context of atmospheric profiles for exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stars. We also delve into the impact of electron degeneracy and non-ideal effects such as ionization potential depression under high-density conditions, emphasizing its notable influence on Rosseland mean opacities at temperatures exceeding $10,000$ K. As a result, this study expands AESOPUS public web interface for customized gas chemical mixtures, promoting flexibility in opacity calculations based on specific research needs. Additionally, pre-computed opacity tables, inclusive of condensates, are provided. We present a preliminary application to evolutionary models for very low-mass stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emittance measurements using synchrotron radiation are usually performed using x-rays to avoid diffraction limits. Interferometric techniques using visible light are also used to measure either the horizontal or the vertical beam projection. Several measurements rotating the interferometry axis are needed to obtain a full beam reconstruction. In this report we present a new interferometric multi-aperture masking technique and data analysis, inspired by astronomical methods, that are able to provide a full 2-D transverse beam reconstruction in a single acquisition. Results of beam characterization obtained at ALBA synchrotron light source will also been shown.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Key Features of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic high-energy events with unknown origins, which are observationally divided into two categories, i.e., repeaters and non-repeaters. However, there are potentially a number of non-repeaters that may be misclassified, as repeating bursts are missed due to the limited sensitivity and observation periods, thus misleading the investigation of their physical properties. In this work, we propose a repeater identification method based on the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm and apply the classification to the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) catalog. We find that the spectral morphology parameters, specifically spectral running ($r$), represent the key features for identifying repeaters from the non-repeaters. Also, the results suggest that repeaters are more biased towards narrowband emission, whereas non-repeaters are inclined toward broadband emission. We provide a list of 163 repeater candidates, with $5$ of which are confirmed with an updated repeater catalog from CHIME/FRB. Our findings help to the understanding of the various properties underlying repeaters and non-repeaters, as well as guidelines for future FRB detection and categorization.</description>

      <title>The Spectro-Polarimeter (SP) of the Andrei B. Severny Solar Tower Telescope (STT) at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory: Optical Design and Implementation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Spectro-Polarimeter (SP) is a new instrument installed at the upgraded Andrei B. Severny Solar Tower Telescope (STT) at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory. The instrument is a traditional echelle slit dual-beam spectropolarimeter with temporal modulation of the polarization. STT-SP provides simultaneous spectropolarimetric observations of the Sun within three 15 Angstrom wide spectral ranges around photospheric Fe I 5250, Fe I 5324, and chromospheric Mg I b2 5172 spectral lines. The spectral resolution of the instrument reaches 70,000 with the seeing-constrained slit width of 1 arcsec. The field-of-view of STT-SP is 200 arcsec allowing one to map a moderate size active region within a single raster scan. The instrument will provide new opportunities in the analysis of magnetic fields and thermodynamics of the lower atmosphere of the Sun. In this paper we describe the optical design of STT-SP and present the preliminary results acquired during the commissioning of the instrument.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical searches for subsolar-mass binaries and the third-generation gravitational wave detector era</title>

Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from coalescing compact binaries has become routine with ground-based detectors like LIGO and Virgo. However, beyond standard sources such as binary black holes and neutron stars and neutron star black holes, no exotic sources revealing new physics have been discovered. Detecting ultra-compact objects, such as subsolar mass (SSM) compact objects, offers a promising opportunity to explore diverse astrophysical populations. However, searching for these objects using standard matched-filtering techniques is computationally intensive due to the dense parameter space involved. This increasing computational demand not only challenges current search methodologies but also poses significant obstacles for third-generation (3G) ground-based GW detectors. In the 3G era, signals may last tens of minutes, and detection rates could reach one per minute, requiring efficient search strategies to manage the computational load of long-duration signals. In this paper, we demonstrate a hierarchical search strategy designed to address the challenges of searching for long-duration signals, such as those from SSM compact binaries, and the anticipated issues with 3G detectors. We show that by adopting optimization techniques in a two-stage hierarchical approach, we can efficiently search for the SSM compact object in the current LIGO detectors. Our preliminary results show that conducting matched filtering at a lower frequency of 35 Hz improves the signal-to-noise ratio by 6% and enhances the detection volume by 10-20%, compared to the standard two-detector PyCBC search. This improvement is achieved while reducing computational costs by a factor of 2.5.</description>

      <title>Teaching dark matter simulations to speak the halo language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a transformer-based conditional generative model for discrete point objects and their properties. We use it to build a model for populating cosmological simulations with gravitationally collapsed structures called dark matter halos. Specifically, we condition our model with dark matter distribution obtained from fast, approximate simulations to recover the correct three-dimensional positions and masses of individual halos. This leads to a first model that can recover the statistical properties of the halos at small scales to better than 3% level using an accelerated dark matter simulation. This trained model can then be applied to simulations with significantly larger volumes which would otherwise be computationally prohibitive with traditional simulations, and also provides a crucial missing link in making end-to-end differentiable cosmological simulations. The code, named GOTHAM (Generative cOnditional Transformer for Halo's Auto-regressive Modeling) is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/shivampcosmo/GOTHAM}.</description>

      <title>System performance of a cryogenic test-bed for the time-division multiplexing readout for NewAthena X-IFU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) is an instrument of ESA's future NewAthena space observatory, with the goal to provide high-energy resolution ($&lt;$ 4 eV at X-ray energies up to 7 keV) and high-spatial resolution (9") spectroscopic imaging over the X-ray energy range from 200 eV to 12 keV, by means of an array of about 1500 transition-edge sensors (TES) read out via SQUID time-division multiplexing (TDM). In 2022, to aid in the transfer of TDM readout technology from the laboratory toward flight hardware, our team commissioned a new TDM-based laboratory test-bed at SRON. This setup hosts an array of $75\times 75\ \mu$m$^2$ TESs that are read out via 2-column $\times$ 32-row TDM. A system component that is critical to high-performance operation is the wiring harness that connects the room-temperature electronics to the cryogenic readout componentry. In November 2023, we implemented a re-designed flex harness, which in the SRON test-bed has a length close to what is envisioned for the X-IFU flight harness. We report here on our characterization of the TDM system with the new flex harness, which allowed the system to achieve a co-added energy resolution at a level of 2.7~eV FWHM at 6~keV via 32-row readout. In addition, we provide an outlook on the upcoming integration of TDM readout into the X-IFU Focal-Plane Assembly Development Model.</description>

      <title>Unveiling habitable planets: Toy coronagraph tackles the exozodiacal dust challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Directly imaging Earth-like exoplanets within habitable zones is challenging because faint signals can be obscured by exozodiacal dust, analogous to our solar system's zodiacal dust. This dust scatters starlight, creating a bright background noise. This paper introduces Toy Coronagraph, a Python package designed to quantify the impact of this dust on exoplanet detection. It takes circularly symmetric disk images point spread functions (PSFs), and exoplanet orbital parameters as input, generating key metrics like contrast curves, signal-to-noise ratios, and dynamic visualizations of exoplanet motion under the dust background. The package also provides tools for generating vortex coronagraph PSFs and includes example disk images. Toy Coronagraph empowers researchers to understand exozodiacal dust, develop mitigation strategies, and optimize future telescope designs and mission time, ultimately advancing the search for potentially habitable worlds. Future work will focus on handling non-circularly symmetric inputs, incorporating realistic noise models, and estimating exoplanet yield rates for future space telescope missions.</description>
