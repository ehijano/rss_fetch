      <title>Cumulative, Adaptive, Open-ended Change through Self-Other Reorganization: Reply to comment on 'An evolutionary process without variation and selection'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-Other Reorganization (SOR) is a theory of how interacting entities or individuals, each of which can be described as an autocatalytic network, collectively exhibit cumulative, adaptive, open-ended change, or evolution. Zachar et al.'s critique of SOR stems from misunderstandings; it does not weaken the arguments in (Gabora &amp; Steel, 2021). The formal framework of Reflexively Autocatalytic and foodset-derived sets (RAFs) enables us to model the process whereby, through their interactions, a set of elements become a 'collective self.' SOR shows how the RAF setting provides a means of encompassing abiogenesis and cultural evolution under the same explanatory framework and provides a plausible explanation for the origins of both evolutionary processes. Although SOR allows for detrimental stimuli (and products), there is (naturally) limited opportunity for elements that do not contribute to or reinforce a RAF to become part of it. Replication and cumulative, adaptive change in RAFs is well-established in the literature. Contrary to Zachar et al., SOR is not a pure percolation model (such as SIR); it encompasses not only learning (modeled as assimilation of foodset elements) but also creative restructuring (modeled as generation of foodset-derived elements), as well as the emergence of new structures made possible by new foodset- and foodset-derived elements. Cultural SOR is robust to degradation, and imperfect replication. Zachar et al.'s simulation contains no RAFs, and does not model SOR.</description>

      <title>Information Clustering and Pathogen Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent outbreaks of infectious diseases have been monitored closely from an epidemiological and microbiological perspective. Extracting from this wealth of data the information that is relevant for the evolution of the pathogen and predict the further dynamic of the epidemic is a difficult task. We therefore consider clusterings of these data to condense this information. We interpret the relative abundance of (genetic) variants of the pathogen as a time-dependent probability distribution and consider clusterings that keep the Fisher information (approximately) invariant, in order to ensure that they capture the dynamics of the pandemic. By first studying analytic models, we show that this condition groups variants together that interact in a similar fashion with the population and show comparable adaptation to the epidemiological situation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the same clustering can be achieved by grouping variants together according to the time-derivative of their information, which is defined as a function of the probabilities alone. A computationally simple clustering based on the probability distribution therefore allows us to probe interactions of different variants of the pathogen with its environment. To validate these findings, we consider data of 551.459 amino acid sequences of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in France over the course of almost 4 years. We demonstrate that our proposed clustering enables us to identify and track point mutations that allow variants to become dominant and identify temporal correlations among such mutations. We identify indicators which point out dangerous variants, with a potential to grow to large probabilities. We show that we can accurately predict the temporal dynamics of such variants by using a universal model discussed in previous work.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Trade-off between Infections and Social Interactions Using a Compact Model of Endemic Infections on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many epidemiological and ecological contexts, there is a trade-off between infections and interaction. This arises because the links between individuals capable of spreading infections are also often associated with beneficial activities. Here, we consider how the presence of explicit network structure changes the optimal solution of a class of infection-interaction trade-offs. In order to do this, we develop and analyse a low-dimensional dynamical system approximating the network SIS epidemic. We find that network structure in the form of heterogeneous numbers of contacts can have a significant impact on the optimal number of contacts that comes out of a trade-off model.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Induced Competitive Release in a Meta-Population Model of Range Expansions in Disordered Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rare evolutionary events, such as the rise to prominence of deleterious mutations, can have drastic impacts on the evolution of growing populations. Heterogeneous environments may reduce the influence of selection on evolutionary outcomes through various mechanisms, including pinning of genetic lineages and of the population fronts. These effects play significant roles in enabling competitive release of otherwise trapped mutations. In this work we show that environments containing random arrangements of "hotspot" patches, where locally abundant resources enhance growth rates equally for all sub-populations, give rise to massively enriched deleterious mutant clones. We derive a geometrical optics description of mutant bubbles, which result from interactions with hotspots, that successfully predicts the observed increase in mutant survival. This prediction requires no fitting parameters and holds well in scenarios of rare mutations and of adaptation from standing variation. In addition, we find that the influence of environmental noise in shaping the fate of rare mutations is maximal near a percolation transition of overlapping discs, beyond which mutant survival decreases.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing networks from simple and complex contagions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00129v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network scientists often use complex dynamic processes to describe network contagions, but tools for fitting contagion models typically assume simple dynamics. Here, we address this gap by developing a nonparametric method to reconstruct a network and dynamics from a series of node states, using a model that breaks the dichotomy between simple pairwise and complex neighborhood-based contagions. We then show that a network is more easily reconstructed when observed through the lens of complex contagions if it is dense or the dynamic saturates, and that simple contagions are better otherwise.</description>
