      <title>Social and Genetic Ties Drive Skewed Cross-Border Media Coverage of Disasters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters worldwide. Media coverage of these events may be vital to generate empathy and mobilize global populations to address the common threat posed by climate change. Using a dataset of 466 news sources from 123 countries, covering 135 million news articles since 2016, we apply an event study framework to measure cross-border media activity following natural disasters. Our results shows that while media attention rises after disasters, it is heavily skewed towards certain events, notably earthquakes, accidents, and wildfires. In contrast, climatologically salient events such as floods, droughts, or extreme temperatures receive less coverage. This cross-border disaster reporting is strongly related to the number of deaths associated with the event, especially when the affected populations share strong social ties or genetic similarities with those in the reporting country. Achieving more balanced media coverage across different types of natural disasters may be essential to counteract skewed perceptions. Further, fostering closer social connections between countries may enhance empathy and mobilize the resources necessary to confront the global threat of climate change.</description>

      <title>An Approach on the Modelling of Long Economic Cycles in the Context of Sustainable Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the themes that have been approached more and more within the specialised literature is being represented by economic cycles. The analysis of these is very useful in the long term predictions, in finding solutions for the economic raise and for detecting the economic crisis. At the same time, it is underlined in a lot of scientific and research papers, the importance of the sustainable development in the present and future society. In this paper we intend to bring contributions to the study of the cycles of a sustainable economy and we will analyse it having in mind the purpose of creating the sustainable economy. We will demonstrate the fact that curves that represent graphically all these, are not simple logistics anymore, bi-logistics or multilogistics curves, but curves in plan that are obtained by composing logistics functions with the function of the sustainable development or with the function that shapes the economic component of it mathematically. We will present an interpretation of mathematic models within the frame of the sustainable development.</description>

      <title>Bridging financial gaps for infrastructure climate adaptation via integrated carbon markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate physical risks pose an increasing threat to urban infrastructure, necessitating urgent climate adaptation measures to protect lives and assets. Implementing such measures, including the development of resilient infrastructure and retrofitting existing systems, demands substantial financial investment. Unfortunately, a significant financial gap remains in funding infrastructure climate adaptation, primarily due to the unprofitability stemming from the conflict between long-term returns, uncertainty, and complexity of these adaptations and the short-term profit objectives of private capital. This study suggests incentivizing private capital to bridge this financial gap through integrated carbon markets. Specifically, the framework combines carbon taxes and carbon markets to involve infrastructures and individuals in the climate mitigation phase, using the funds collected for climate adaptation. It integrates lifestyle reformation, environmental mitigation, and infrastructure adaptation to establish harmonized standards and provide continuous positive feedback to sustain the markets. It is explored how integrated carbon markets can facilitate fund collection and discuss the challenges of incorporating them into infrastructure climate adaptation. This study aims to foster collaboration between private and public capital to enable a more scientific, rational, and actionable implementation of integrated carbon markets, thus supporting financial backing for infrastructure climate adaptation.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the Effect of Carbon Tax Implementation on Household Income Distribution in Indonesia: Quantitative Analysis with Miyazawa Input- Output Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change is a global challenge caused by greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel use. Indonesia, as a developing country, faces major challenges in implementing carbon tax policies to reduce emissions, especially related to their regressive impacts on low-income households. Currently, there is little in-depth research on how carbon tax policies impact household income distribution in Indonesia. This study uses a quantitative approach with the Input- Output model to analyze the impact of carbon tax on household income based on 10 income groups, both in urban and rural areas. The results show that carbon tax policies have a regressive impact, where low-income households bear a proportionally greater burden. Household income in Class - 10 decreased by IDR 19,144.85 million in urban areas and IDR 8,819.13 million in rural areas, while households in Class - 1 decreased by IDR 954.23 million. Therefore, mitigation policies such as cross subsidies are needed to reduce the impact on vulnerable groups. These findings are important for policy makers in formulating fair and effective fiscal policies, as well as ensuring social justice in the context of sustainable development. This study has limitations in the scope of analysis of long-term energy consumption behavior and certain sectors, so further research is needed to deepen these aspects.</description>

      <title>Specific Aspects of Intellectual Property Management in the Knowledge-Based Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of intellectual property management in the knowledge-based economy. The starting point in carrying out the study is the presentation of some concepts regarding in the first phase, the intellectual capital. Arguments are made that the knowledge-based economy is a challenge for the current century. The subject of intellectual property is approached through the prism of a topical concept operationalized in the current global economic context. The main institutions that are directly related to this concept are mentioned. The topic of patents related to WOS indexed scientific papers is also debated, along with a series of statistics and studies on the state of patent protection worldwide in the top fields. The last part of the paper contains the conclusions and own points of view on the debated topic.</description>

      <title>What is the general Welfare? Welfare Economic Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers cannot definitively interpret what the framers of the United States Constitution had in mind when they wrote of the general Welfare. Nevertheless, welfare economics can contribute to policy choice in democracies. Specifying social welfare functions enables coherent analysis, by formalizing mechanisms for preference aggregation and studying the policies they yield. This paper argues that it is essential for welfare economics to adequately express the richness and variety of actual human preferences over social states. I first discuss devices that economists have used in attempts to circumvent or grossly simplify specification of social welfare functions. I next discuss the common welfare economic practice of assuming that personal preferences are homogeneous, consequentialist, and self-centered. I then call for incorporation of broader forms of personal preferences into social welfare functions. Individuals may hold heterogeneous social preferences, being concerned in various ways with the distribution of outcomes in the population. They may hold heterogeneous deontological preferences, placing value on their own actions and the actions of others. They may have preferences for the mechanism used to aggregate preferences in a social welfare function. These potential aspects of personal preference should be recognized in welfare economics.</description>

      <title>Regression Equilibrium in Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two-stage electricity markets, renewable power producers enter the day-ahead market with a forecast of future power generation and then reconcile any forecast deviation in the real-time market at a penalty. The choice of the forecast model is thus an important strategy decision for renewable power producers as it affects financial performance. In electricity markets with large shares of renewable generation, the choice of the forecast model impacts not only individual performance but also outcomes for other producers. In this paper, we argue for the existence of a competitive regression equilibrium in two-stage electricity markets in terms of the parameters of private forecast models informing the participation strategies of renewable power producers. In our model, renewables optimize the forecast against the day-ahead and real-time prices, thereby maximizing the average profits across the day-ahead and real-time markets. By doing so, they also implicitly enhance the temporal cost coordination of day-ahead and real-time markets. We base the equilibrium analysis on the theory of variational inequalities, providing results on the existence and uniqueness of regression equilibrium in energy-only markets. We also devise two methods to compute regression equilibrium: centralized optimization and a decentralized ADMM-based algorithm.</description>

      <title>Can AI Help with Your Personal Finances?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19784v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative development in artificial intelligence (AI), drawing significant attention from industry and academia. Trained on vast datasets, these sophisticated AI systems exhibit impressive natural language processing and content generation capabilities. This paper explores the potential of LLMs to address key challenges in personal finance, focusing on the United States. We evaluate several leading LLMs, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, and Meta's Llama, to assess their effectiveness in providing accurate financial advice on topics such as mortgages, taxes, loans, and investments. Our findings show that while these models achieve an average accuracy rate of approximately 70%, they also display notable limitations in certain areas. Specifically, LLMs struggle to provide accurate responses for complex financial queries, with performance varying significantly across different topics. Despite these limitations, the analysis reveals notable improvements in newer versions of these models, highlighting their growing utility for individuals and financial advisors. As these AI systems continue to evolve, their potential for advancing AI-driven applications in personal finance becomes increasingly promising.</description>
