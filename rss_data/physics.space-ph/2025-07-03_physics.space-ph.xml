      <title>Langmuir Wave Excitation in Solar-wind Magnetic Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic holes are structures commonly observed in various space plasma environments throughout the solar system, including the solar wind. These structures are characterized by a localized decrease in magnetic field strength, coincident with an increase in plasma density. Previous observational studies in the solar wind link the presence of Langmuir waves to magnetic holes, suggesting a strong correlation between these phenomena. We develop a model based on magnetic-moment conservation and its violation to explain the excitation of Langmuir waves in magnetic holes. Our model illustrates that magnetic holes induce changes in the electron velocity distribution function that emit electrostatic Langmuir waves due to the bump-on-tail instability. Using data from the Solar Orbiter spacecraft, we provide a comprehensive analysis of this process and test our predictions with observations. The consistency between the model and observations indicates that our proposed process is a viable mechanism for producing Langmuir waves in magnetic holes in the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Climatology of Mars Topside Ionosphere during Solar Cycles 24 and 25 using MAVEN Dataset of 2015-2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mars ambient space environment evolves with the varying solar activity. Understanding the Martian space environment, particularly the topside ionosphere across different phases of Solar Cycles (SC) 24 \&amp; 25 remains a key research gap in planetary ionospheric science. In this study, we utilized the NASA Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission data (150-500 km) from Martian years 32-38 (2015-2024) during solar quiet-time. This study investigated the behavior of topside ionosphere (e-, CO2+, O2+, NO+, OH+, O+, N+ \&amp; C+) across different phases of SC over the northern hemisphere. A significant variation in ionosphere is observed over low-latitude (0-30{\deg}N) with higher densities compared to mid-latitude (31-60{\deg}N) across SC. Additionally, we found that the Martian northern ionospheric densities were highest during solar maximum phase on both dayside and nightside compared to low active phases. The dayside densities were approximately 1-2 orders higher compared to those on the nightside. The electron and molecular ions densities increased by factors of 1-5 and 1-13, respectively. While O+ ion density was enhanced by nearly 2-2.5 times, along with an upliftment of 40-50 km in the peak height. The enhanced dayside densities are attributed to the elevated solar irradiance (1.4-2 times) and varying solar wind flux. Furthermore, the enhanced day-to-night plasma transport and elevated solar electron flux during maxima, higher by 33-66\% than during low-activity, can contribute to the increased nightside ionization. This work, for the first time, uses long-term MAVEN datasets across the descending-to-maxima phases of SC to reveal climatology of Martian topside ionosphere.</description>

      <title>Large Scale Wind Driven Structures in the Orion Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A study of [C II] 158 micron and HI 21-cm spectroscopic images plus high velocity resolution optical and ultraviolet spectra has shown the structure of the Orion Nebula to be different from that found from the study of those data separately. The [C II] features recently identified as the [C II] Shell is shown to be part of the Veil-B HI foreground layer. Jointly called the Outer Shell, it covers the bright Huygens Region and the Extended Orion Nebula. Its maximum expansion velocity is 15 km/s. Closer to ThetaOne OrionisC there is a second expanding shell, called the Inner Shell. It has an expansion velocity of 27 km/s and probably results from a more recent period of strong wind from one or more of the Trapezium stars. Even closer to ThetaOne OrionisC there is a central high ionization bubble, freely expanding towards the observer but slowed in the opposite direction by photo-ionized gas coming off the Main Ionization Front. Utilization of spectroscopic measures of the equivalent width of Hbeta shows that the enhanced emission in [C II] seen just outside the visual wavelength boundaries of the Orion Nebula is not caused by limb-brightening of the Outer Shell. This enhanced emission is due to the radiation field of the Trapezium stars being filtered by intervening residual neutral hydrogen. A velocity component near 30 km/s (Heliocentric) first seen in HI is also present in [C II] and may result from a foreground cloud of the ISM.</description>

      <title>Investigating Magnetic Field Fluctuations in Jovian Auroral Electron Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Juno spacecraft provides a unique opportunity to explore the mechanisms generating Jupiter's aurorae. Past analyses of Juno data immensely advanced our understanding of its auroral acceleration processes, however, few studies utilized multiple instruments on Juno in a joint systematic analysis. This study uses measurements from the Juno Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS), the Jupiter Energetic particle Detector Instrument (JEDI), and the Juno Magnetometer (MAG) from the first 20 perijoves. On magnetic field lines associated with the diffuse aurora, we consistently find small-scale magnetic field fluctuations with amplitudes of up to 100 nT on time scales of seconds to 1 minute. On magnetic field lines directly linked to the main emission, the electron distribution is field-aligned, mostly broad-band in energy, and accompanied by large-scale magnetic field perturbations of several 100 nT on time scales of tens of min (except one case). These large-scale perturbations are generally associated with quasistatic field-aligned electric currents. Small-scale magnetic fields are not resolved over the main emission zone closer than radial distances 4 Jovian radii due to the digitization limit of the magnetometer. However, in all cases where Juno crosses the main auroral field lines beyond 4RJ, the digitization limit is significantly reduced and we detect small-scale magnetic field fluctuations of 2 nT to 10 nT consistent with a turbulent spectrum. Associated energy fluxes projected to Jupiter can exceed 1000 mW/m2. The general broad-band nature of the electron distributions and the consistent presence of small-scale magnetic field fluctuations over the main emission support that wave-particle interaction can dominantely contribute to power Jupiter's auroral processes.</description>
