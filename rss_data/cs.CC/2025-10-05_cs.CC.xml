      <title>How Pinball Wizards Simulate a Turing Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate the computational complexity of a novel physical problem known as the Pinball Wizard problem. It involves an idealized pinball moving through a maze composed of one-way gates (outswing doors), plane walls, parabolic walls, moving plane walls, and bumpers that cause acceleration or deceleration. Given the initial position and velocity of the pinball, the task is to decide whether it will hit a specified target point.
  By simulating a two-stack pushdown automaton, we show that the problem is Turing-complete -- even in two-dimensional space. In our construction, each step of the automaton corresponds to a constant number of reflections. Thus, deciding the Pinball Wizard problem is at least as hard as the Halting problem. Furthermore, our construction allows bumpers to be replaced with moving walls. In this case, even a ball moving at constant speed -- a so-called ray particle -- can be used, demonstrating that the Ray Particle Tracing problem is also Turing-complete.</description>

      <title>The Log-Rank Conjecture: New Equivalent Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The log-rank conjecture is a longstanding open problem with multiple equivalent formulations in complexity theory and mathematics. In its linear-algebraic form, it asserts that the rank and partitioning number of a Boolean matrix are quasi-polynomially related.
  We propose a relaxed but still equivalent version of the conjecture based on a new matrix parameter, signed rectangle rank: the minimum number of all-1 rectangles needed to express the Boolean matrix as a $\pm 1$-sum. Signed rectangle rank lies between rank and partition number, and our main result shows that it is in fact equivalent to rank up to a logarithmic factor. Additionally, we extend the main result to tensors. This reframes the log-rank conjecture as: can every signed decomposition of a Boolean matrix be made positive with only quasi-polynomial blowup?
  As an application, we prove an equivalence between the log-rank conjecture and a conjecture of Lovett and Singer-Sudan on cross-intersecting set systems.</description>

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Almost Stable Clustering with Penalties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the complexity of stable (or perturbation-resilient) instances of $\mathrm{k-M\small{EANS}}$ and $\mathrm{k-M\small{EDIAN}}$ clustering problems in metrics with small doubling dimension. While these problems have been extensively studied under multiplicative perturbation resilience in low-dimensional Euclidean spaces (e.g., (Friggstad et al., 2019; Cohen-Addad and Schwiegelshohn, 2017)), we adopt a more general notion of stability, termed ``almost stable'', which is closer to the notion of $(\alpha, \varepsilon)$-perturbation resilience introduced by Balcan and Liang (2016). Additionally, we extend our results to $\mathrm{k-M\small{EANS}}$/$\mathrm{k-M\small{EDIAN}}$ with penalties, where each data point is either assigned to a cluster centre or incurs a penalty.
  We show that certain special cases of almost stable $\mathrm{k-M\small{EANS}}$/$\mathrm{k-M\small{EDIAN}}$ (with penalties) are solvable in polynomial time. To complement this, we also examine the hardness of almost stable instances and $(1 + \frac{1}{poly(n)})$-stable instances of $\mathrm{k-M\small{EANS}}$/$\mathrm{k-M\small{EDIAN}}$ (with penalties), proving super-polynomial lower bounds on the runtime of any exact algorithm under the widely believed Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH).</description>

      <title>Smooth Trade-off for Tensor PCA via Sharp Bounds for Kikuchi Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit algorithms for Tensor PCA: given an order-$r$ tensor of the form $T = G+\lambda \cdot v^{\otimes r}$ where $G$ is a random symmetric Gaussian tensor with unit variance entries and $v$ is an unknown boolean vector in $\{\pm 1\}^n$, what's the minimum $\lambda$ at which one can distinguish $T$ from a random Gaussian tensor and more generally, recover $v$? As a result of a long line of work, we know that for any $\ell \in \N$, there is a $n^{O(\ell)}$ time algorithm that succeeds when the signal strength $\lambda \gtrsim \sqrt{\log n} \cdot n^{-r/4} \cdot \ell^{1/2-r/4}$. The question of whether the logarithmic factor is necessary turns out to be crucial to understanding whether larger polynomial time allows recovering the signal at a lower signal strength. Such a smooth trade-off is necessary for tensor PCA being a candidate problem for quantum speedups[SOKB25]. It was first conjectured by [WAM19] and then, more recently, with an eye on smooth trade-offs, reiterated in a blogpost of Bandeira.
  In this work, we resolve these conjectures and show that spectral algorithms based on the Kikuchi hierarchy \cite{WAM19} succeed whenever $\lambda \geq \Theta_r(1) \cdot n^{-r/4} \cdot \ell^{1/2-r/4}$ where $\Theta_r(1)$ only hides an absolute constant independent of $n$ and $\ell$. A sharp bound such as this was previously known only for $\ell \leq 3r/4$ via non-asymptotic techniques in random matrix theory inspired by free probability.</description>

      <title>Optimal Inapproximability of Promise Equations over Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A celebrated result of Hastad established that, for any constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, it is NP-hard to find an assignment satisfying a $(1/|G|+\varepsilon)$-fraction of the constraints of a given 3-LIN instance over an Abelian group $G$ even if one is promised that an assignment satisfying a $(1-\varepsilon)$-fraction of the constraints exists. Engebretsen, Holmerin, and Russell showed the same result for 3-LIN instances over any finite (not necessarily Abelian) group. In other words, for almost-satisfiable instances of 3-LIN the random assignment achieves an optimal approximation guarantee. We prove that the random assignment algorithm is still best possible under a stronger promise that the 3-LIN instance is almost satisfiable over an arbitrarily more restrictive group.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchy for Constant Communication Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Similarly to the Chomsky hierarchy, we offer a classification of communication complexity measures such that these measures are organized into equivalence classes. Different from previous attempts of this endeavor, we consider two communication complexity measures as equivalent, if, when one is constant, then the other is constant as well, and vice versa. Most previous considerations of similar topics have been using polylogarithmic input length as a defining characteristic of equivalence. In this paper, two measures ${\cal C}_1, {\cal C}_2$ are constant-equivalent, if and only if for all total Boolean (families of) functions $f:\{0, 1\}^n\times\{0, 1\}^n\rightarrow \{0, 1\}$ we have ${\cal C}_1(f)=O(1)$ if and only if ${\cal C}_2(f)=O(1)$. We identify five equivalence classes according to the above equivalence relation. Interestingly, the classification is counter-intuitive in that powerful models of communication are grouped with weak ones, and seemingly weaker models end up on the top of the hierarchy.</description>

      <title>New Limits on Distributed Quantum Advantage: Dequantizing Linear Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we give two results that put new limits on distributed quantum advantage in the context of the LOCAL model of distributed computing. First, we show that there is no distributed quantum advantage for any linear program. Put otherwise, if there is a quantum-LOCAL algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ that finds an $\alpha$-approximation of some linear optimization problem $\Pi$ in $T$ communication rounds, we can construct a classical, deterministic LOCAL algorithm $\mathcal{A}'$ that finds an $\alpha$-approximation of $\Pi$ in $T$ rounds. As a corollary, all classical lower bounds for linear programs, including the KMW bound, hold verbatim in quantum-LOCAL. Second, using the above result, we show that there exists a locally checkable labeling problem (LCL) for which quantum-LOCAL is strictly weaker than the classical deterministic SLOCAL model. Our results extend from quantum-LOCAL also to finitely dependent and non-signaling distributions, and one of the corollaries of our work is that the non-signaling model and the SLOCAL model are incomparable in the context of LCL problems: By prior work, there exists an LCL problem for which SLOCAL is strictly weaker than the non-signaling model, and our work provides a separation in the opposite direction.</description>
