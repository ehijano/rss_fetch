      <title>Mind the Prompt: Prompting Strategies in Audio Generations for Improving Sound Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the design of effective prompt strategies for generating realistic datasets using Text-To-Audio (TTA) models. We also analyze different techniques for efficiently combining these datasets to enhance their utility in sound classification tasks. By evaluating two sound classification datasets with two TTA models, we apply a range of prompt strategies. Our findings reveal that task-specific prompt strategies significantly outperform basic prompt approaches in data generation. Furthermore, merging datasets generated using different TTA models proves to enhance classification performance more effectively than merely increasing the training dataset size. Overall, our results underscore the advantages of these methods as effective data augmentation techniques using synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Generating Diverse Audio-Visual 360 Soundscapes for Sound Event Localization and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SELDVisualSynth, a tool for generating synthetic videos for audio-visual sound event localization and detection (SELD). Our approach incorporates real-world background images to improve realism in synthetic audio-visual SELD data while also ensuring audio-visual spatial alignment. The tool creates 360 synthetic videos where objects move matching synthetic SELD audio data and its annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that a model trained with this data attains performance gains across multiple metrics, achieving superior localization recall (56.4 LR) and competitive localization error (21.9deg LE). We open-source our data generation tool for maximal use by members of the SELD research community.</description>

      <title>RWKVTTS: Yet another TTS based on RWKV-7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-AI interaction thrives on intuitive and efficient interfaces, among which voice stands out as a particularly natural and accessible modality. Recent advancements in transformer-based text-to-speech (TTS) systems, such as Fish-Speech, CosyVoice, and MegaTTS 3, have delivered remarkable improvements in quality and realism, driving a significant evolution in the TTS domain. In this paper, we introduce RWKV-7 \cite{peng2025rwkv}, a cutting-edge RNN-based architecture tailored for TTS applications. Unlike traditional transformer models, RWKV-7 leverages the strengths of recurrent neural networks to achieve greater computational efficiency and scalability, while maintaining high-quality output. Our comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate that RWKV-7 outperforms transformer-based models across multiple key metrics, including synthesis speed, naturalness of speech, and resource efficiency. Furthermore, we explore its adaptability to diverse linguistic contexts and low-resource environments, showcasing its potential to democratize TTS technology. These findings position RWKV-7 as a powerful and innovative alternative, paving the way for more accessible and versatile voice synthesis solutions in real-world applications.Our code and weights are https://github.com/yynil/RWKVTTS, https://huggingface.co/spaces/RWKV-Red-Team</description>

      <title>An Efficient GPU-based Implementation for Noise Robust Sound Source Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robot audition, encompassing Sound Source Localization (SSL), Sound Source Separation (SSS), and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), enables robots and smart devices to acquire auditory capabilities similar to human hearing. Despite their wide applicability, processing multi-channel audio signals from microphone arrays in SSL involves computationally intensive matrix operations, which can hinder efficient deployment on Central Processing Units (CPUs), particularly in embedded systems with limited CPU resources. This paper introduces a GPU-based implementation of SSL for robot audition, utilizing the Generalized Singular Value Decomposition-based Multiple Signal Classification (GSVD-MUSIC), a noise-robust algorithm, within the HARK platform, an open-source software suite. For a 60-channel microphone array, the proposed implementation achieves significant performance improvements. On the Jetson AGX Orin, an embedded device powered by an NVIDIA GPU and ARM Cortex-A78AE v8.2 64-bit CPUs, we observe speedups of 4645.1x for GSVD calculations and 8.8x for the SSL module, while speedups of 2223.4x for GSVD calculation and 8.95x for the entire SSL module on a server configured with an NVIDIA A100 GPU and AMD EPYC 7352 CPUs, making real-time processing feasible for large-scale microphone arrays and providing ample capacity for real-time processing of potential subsequent machine learning or deep learning tasks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilingual speech translation (ST) in the medical domain enhances patient care by enabling efficient communication across language barriers, alleviating specialized workforce shortages, and facilitating improved diagnosis and treatment, particularly during pandemics. In this work, we present the first systematic study on medical ST, to our best knowledge, by releasing MultiMed-ST, a large-scale ST dataset for the medical domain, spanning all translation directions in five languages: Vietnamese, English, German, French, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese, together with the models. With 290,000 samples, our dataset is the largest medical machine translation (MT) dataset and the largest many-to-many multilingual ST among all domains. Secondly, we present the most extensive analysis study in ST research to date, including: empirical baselines, bilingual-multilingual comparative study, end-to-end vs. cascaded comparative study, task-specific vs. multi-task sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) comparative study, code-switch analysis, and quantitative-qualitative error analysis.

      <title>VietMed: A Dataset and Benchmark for Automatic Speech Recognition of Vietnamese in the Medical Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to privacy restrictions, there's a shortage of publicly available speech recognition datasets in the medical domain. In this work, we present VietMed - a Vietnamese speech recognition dataset in the medical domain comprising 16h of labeled medical speech, 1000h of unlabeled medical speech and 1200h of unlabeled general-domain speech. To our best knowledge, VietMed is by far the world's largest public medical speech recognition dataset in 7 aspects: total duration, number of speakers, diseases, recording conditions, speaker roles, unique medical terms and accents. VietMed is also by far the largest public Vietnamese speech dataset in terms of total duration. Additionally, we are the first to present a medical ASR dataset covering all ICD-10 disease groups and all accents within a country. Moreover, we release the first public large-scale pre-trained models for Vietnamese ASR, w2v2-Viet and XLSR-53-Viet, along with the first public large-scale fine-tuned models for medical ASR. Even without any medical data in unsupervised pre-training, our best pre-trained model XLSR-53-Viet generalizes very well to the medical domain by outperforming state-of-the-art XLSR-53, from 51.8% to 29.6% WER on test set (a relative reduction of more than 40%). All code, data and models are made publicly available: https://github.com/leduckhai/MultiMed/tree/master/VietMed.</description>

      <title>Real-time Speech Summarization for Medical Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In doctor-patient conversations, identifying medically relevant information is crucial, posing the need for conversation summarization. In this work, we propose the first deployable real-time speech summarization system for real-world applications in industry, which generates a local summary after every N speech utterances within a conversation and a global summary after the end of a conversation. Our system could enhance user experience from a business standpoint, while also reducing computational costs from a technical perspective. Secondly, we present VietMed-Sum which, to our knowledge, is the first speech summarization dataset for medical conversations. Thirdly, we are the first to utilize LLM and human annotators collaboratively to create gold standard and synthetic summaries for medical conversation summarization. Finally, we present baseline results of state-of-the-art models on VietMed-Sum. All code, data (English-translated and Vietnamese) and models are available online: https://github.com/leduckhai/MultiMed/tree/master/VietMed-Sum</description>

      <title>Ichigo: Mixed-Modal Early-Fusion Realtime Voice Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, but their application to speech-based tasks remains challenging due to the complexities of integrating audio and text modalities. This paper introduces Ichigo, a mixed-modal model that seamlessly processes interleaved sequences of speech and text. Utilizing a tokenized early-fusion approach, Ichigo quantizes speech into discrete tokens and employs a uniform transformer-based architecture for both speech and text modalities. This method enables joint reasoning and generation across modalities without the need for separate adapters. We present a comprehensive training methodology, including pre-training on multilingual speech recognition datasets and fine-tuning on a curated instruction dataset. Ichigo demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on speech question-answering benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source speech language models and achieving comparable results to cascaded systems. Notably, Ichigo exhibits a latency of just 111 ms to first token generation, significantly lower than current models. Our approach not only advances the field of multimodal AI but also provides a framework for smaller research teams to contribute effectively to open-source speech-language models.</description>

      <title>FADA: Fast Diffusion Avatar Synthesis with Mixed-Supervised Multi-CFG Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based audio-driven talking avatar methods have recently gained attention for their high-fidelity, vivid, and expressive results. However, their slow inference speed limits practical applications. Despite the development of various distillation techniques for diffusion models, we found that naive diffusion distillation methods do not yield satisfactory results. Distilled models exhibit reduced robustness with open-set input images and a decreased correlation between audio and video compared to teacher models, undermining the advantages of diffusion models. To address this, we propose FADA (Fast Diffusion Avatar Synthesis with Mixed-Supervised Multi-CFG Distillation). We first designed a mixed-supervised loss to leverage data of varying quality and enhance the overall model capability as well as robustness. Additionally, we propose a multi-CFG distillation with learnable tokens to utilize the correlation between audio and reference image conditions, reducing the threefold inference runs caused by multi-CFG with acceptable quality degradation. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets show that FADA generates vivid videos comparable to recent diffusion model-based methods while achieving an NFE speedup of 4.17-12.5 times. Demos are available at our webpage http://fadavatar.github.io.</description>

      <title>Supervised contrastive learning from weakly-labeled audio segments for musical version matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting musical versions (different renditions of the same piece) is a challenging task with important applications. Because of the ground truth nature, existing approaches match musical versions at the track level (e.g., whole song). However, most applications require to match them at the segment level (e.g., 20s chunks). In addition, existing approaches resort to classification and triplet losses, disregarding more recent losses that could bring meaningful improvements. In this paper, we propose a method to learn from weakly annotated segments, together with a contrastive loss variant that outperforms well-studied alternatives. The former is based on pairwise segment distance reductions, while the latter modifies an existing loss following decoupling, hyper-parameter, and geometric considerations. With these two elements, we do not only achieve state-of-the-art results in the standard track-level evaluation, but we also obtain a breakthrough performance in a segment-level evaluation. We believe that, due to the generality of the challenges addressed here, the proposed methods may find utility in domains beyond audio or musical version matching.</description>
