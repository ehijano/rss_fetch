      <title>Extreme events in two-coupled chaotic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since 1970, the R\"ossler system has remained as a considerably simpler and minimal dimensional chaos serving system. Unveiling the dynamics of a system of two coupled chaotic oscillators that leads to the emergence of extreme events in the system is an engrossing and crucial scientific research area. Our present study focuses on the emergence of extreme events in a system of diffusively and bidirectionally two coupled R\"ossler oscillators and unraveling the mechanism behind the genesis of extreme events. We find the appearance of extreme events in three different observables: average velocity, synchronization error, and one transverse directional variable to the synchronization manifold. The emergence of extreme events in average velocity variables happens due to the occasional in-phase synchronization. The on-off intermittency plays for the crucial role in the genesis of extreme events in the synchronization error dynamics and in the transverse directional variable to the synchronization manifold. The bubble transition of the chaotic attractor due to the on-off intermittency is illustrated for the transverse directional variable. We use generalized extreme value theory to study the statistics of extremes. The extreme events data sets concerning the average velocity variable follow generalized extreme value distribution. The inter-event intervals of the extreme events in the average velocity variable spread well exponentially. The upshot of the interplay between the coupling strength and the frequency mismatch between the system oscillators in the genesis of extreme events in the coupled system is depicted numerically.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot forecasting of chaotic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-series forecasting is a challenging task that traditionally requires specialized models custom-trained for the specific task at hand. Recently, inspired by the success of large language models, foundation models pre-trained on vast amounts of time-series data from diverse domains have emerged as a promising candidate for general-purpose time-series forecasting. The defining characteristic of these foundation models is their ability to perform zero-shot learning, that is, forecasting a new system from limited context data without explicit re-training or fine-tuning. Here, we evaluate whether the zero-shot learning paradigm extends to the challenging task of forecasting chaotic systems. Across 135 distinct chaotic dynamical systems and $10^8$ timepoints, we find that foundation models produce competitive forecasts compared to custom-trained models (including NBEATS, TiDE, etc.), particularly when training data is limited. Interestingly, even after point forecasts fail, foundation models preserve the geometric and statistical properties of the chaotic attractors, demonstrating a surprisingly strong ability to capture the long-term behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. Our results highlight the promises and pitfalls of foundation models in making zero-shot forecasts of chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Solvable models of many-body chaos from dual-Koopman circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual-unitary circuits are being vigorously studied as models of many-body quantum chaos that can be solved exactly for correlation functions and time evolution of states. Here we define their classical counterparts as dual-canonical transformations and associated dual-Koopman operators. Like their quantum counterparts, the correlations vanish everywhere except on the light cone, on which they decay with rates governed by a simple contractive map. Providing a large class of such dual-canonical transformations, we study in detail the example of a coupled standard map and show analytically that arbitrarily away from the integrable case, in the thermodynamic limit the system is mixing. We also define ``perfect" Koopman operators that lead to the correlation vanishing everywhere including on the light cone and provide an example of a cat-map lattice which would qualify to be a Bernoulli system at the apex of the ergodic hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Dynamic learning of synchronization in coupled nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11691v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization phenomena are pervasive in coupled nonlinear systems across the natural world and engineering domains. Understanding how to dynamically identify the parameter space (or network structure) of coupled nonlinear systems in a synchronized state is crucial for the study of system synchronization. To address the challenge of achieving stable synchronization in coupled nonlinear systems, we develop a set of mathematical optimization techniques for dynamic learning of synchronization (DLS) inspired by machine learning. This technology captures the state differences between nodes within the system and dynamically adjusts weights, allowing coupled nonlinear systems to maintain a stable state of synchronization after appropriate weight adjustments. To enhance synchronization optimization, we use the Master Stability Function (MSF) to demonstrate how DLS effectively adjusts networks into their synchronization regions. We introduce several variants of the DLS technique, including adaptive, supervised, and hybrid methods, effectively promoting synchronization in heterogeneous networks such as small-world, scale-free, and random networks. The efficacy of this technique is validated through its application to simple FitzHugh-Nagumo neural networks and complex Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal networks, examining its impact on both global and local synchronization. The DLS technique proposed in this study offers a new solution to synchronization problems in dynamic network environments, addressing the deficiencies in adaptability and flexibility of existing technologies and providing a fresh perspective for understanding and implementing synchronization phenomena in coupled nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Cyclic image generation using chaotic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Successive image generation using cyclic transformations is demonstrated by extending the CycleGAN model to transform images among three different categories. Repeated application of the trained generators produces sequences of images that transition among the different categories. The generated image sequences occupy a more limited region of the image space compared with the original training dataset. Quantitative evaluation using precision and recall metrics indicates that the generated images have high quality but reduced diversity relative to the training dataset. Such successive generation processes are characterized as chaotic dynamics in terms of dynamical system theory. Positive Lyapunov exponents estimated from the generated trajectories confirm the presence of chaotic dynamics, with the Lyapunov dimension of the attractor found to be comparable to the intrinsic dimension of the training data manifold. The results suggest that chaotic dynamics in the image space defined by the deep generative model contribute to the diversity of the generated images, constituting a novel approach for multi-class image generation. This model can be interpreted as an extension of classical associative memory to perform hetero-association among image categories.</description>

      <title>On the shifts of orbits and periodic orbits under perturbation and the change of Poincar\'e map Jacobian of periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic orbits and cycles, respectively, play a significant role in discrete- and continuous-time dynamical systems (i.e. maps and flows). To succinctly describe their shifts when the system is applied perturbation, the notions of functional and functional derivative are borrowed from functional analysis to consider the whole system as an argument of the geometric representation of the periodic orbit or cycle. The shifts of an orbit/trajectory and periodic orbit/cycle are analyzed and concluded as formulae for maps/flows, respectively. The theory shall be beneficial for analyzing sensitivity to perturbations, and optimizing and controlling various systems.</description>

      <title>Fourier neural operators for spatiotemporal dynamics in two-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity direct numerical simulation of turbulent flows for most real-world applications remains an outstanding computational challenge. Several machine learning approaches have recently been proposed to alleviate the computational cost even though they become unstable or unphysical for long time predictions. We identify that the Fourier neural operator (FNO) based models combined with a partial differential equation (PDE) solver can accelerate fluid dynamic simulations and thus address computational expense of large-scale turbulence simulations. We treat the FNO model on the same footing as a PDE solver and answer important questions about the volume and temporal resolution of data required to build pre-trained models for turbulence. We also discuss the pitfalls of purely data-driven approaches that need to be avoided by the machine learning models to become viable and competitive tools for long time simulations of turbulence.</description>
