      <title>The Role of Biomarkers on Haemodynamics in Atherosclerotic Artery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory cardiovascular disease, leads to arterial constriction caused by the accumulation of lipids, cholesterol, and various substances within artery walls. Such plaque can rupture, resulting in a blood clot that obstructs major arteries and may initiate myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, etc. Atherosclerotic plaque formation begins with the accumulation of foam cells and macrophages within the intima layer of the arterial wall. At the latter stage, the smooth muscle cells migrated from deeper artery wall layers, contributing to the fibrous cap formation and plaque stabilizing. A developed plaque gradually enters the lumen and narrows down the lumen to impede blood flow. We introduce a two-phase and macroscopic model to investigate the progression of plaque growth in its advanced stage and analyze the minimum gap (Lumen Clearance) within an atherosclerotic artery so that blood cells can pass through. Cardiac troponin, a high specificity and sensitivity biomarker, facilitates early detection of elevated myocardial infarction, Ischemic stroke, etc. risks. This study aims to establish a relationship between the troponin concentration in atherosclerotic arteries and their internal clearance, which could significantly improve our understanding of disease progression. Our observations show that the plaque undergoes rapid evolution in its initial stages, gradually slowing down over time to reach a steady state. At the same time, the lumen clearance exhibits an opposite behavior, decreasing slowly over time. Our study finds a positive correlation between plaque depth and troponin concentration in the blood and a negative relationship between troponin concentrations and lumen clearance in atherosclerotic arteries.</description>

      <title>Microfluidic 3D Cell Culture: Potential Application of Collagen Hydrogels with an Optimal Dose of Bioactive Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We engineered a microfluidic platform to study the effects of bioactive glass nanoparticles (BGNs) on cell viability under static culture. We incorporated different concentrations of BGNs (1%, 2%, and 3% w/v) in collagen hydrogel (with a concentration of 3.0 mg/mL). The microfluidic chip's dimensions were optimized through fluid flow and mass transfer simulations. Collagen type I extracted from rat tail tendons was used as the main material, and BGNs synthesized by the sol-gel method were used to enhance the mechanical properties of the hydrogel. The extracted collagen was characterized using FTIR and SDS-PAGE, and BGNs were analyzed using XRD, FTIR, DLS, and FE-SEM/EDX. The structure of the collagen-BGNs hydrogels was examined using SEM, and their mechanical properties were determined using rheological analysis. The cytotoxicity of BGNs was assessed using the MTT assay, and the viability of fibroblast (L929) cells encapsulated in the collagen-BGNs hydrogel inside the microfluidic device was assessed using a live/dead assay. Based on all these test results, the L929 cells showed high cell viability in vitro and promising microenvironment mimicry in a microfluidic device. Collagen3-BGNs3 (Collagen 3 mg/mL + BGNs 3% (w/v)) was chosen as the most suitable sample for further research on a microfluidic platform.</description>

      <title>Controlling moving interfaces in solid state batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe, all-solid-state lithium metal batteries enable high energy density applications, but suffer from instabilities during operation that lead to rough interfaces between the metal and electrolyte and subsequently cause void formation and dendrite growth that degrades performance and safety. Inspired by the morphogenetic control of thin lamina such as tree leaves that robustly grow into flat shapes -- we propose a range of approaches to control lithium metal stripping and plating. To guide discovery of materials that will implement these feedback mechanisms, we develop a reduced order model that captures couplings between mechanics, interface growth, temperature, and electrochemical variables. We find that long-range feedback is required to achieve true interface stability, while approaches based on local feedback always eventually grow into rough interfaces. All together, our study provides the beginning of a practical framework for analyzing and designing stable electrochemical interfaces in terms of the mechanical properties and the physical chemistry that underlie their dynamics.</description>
