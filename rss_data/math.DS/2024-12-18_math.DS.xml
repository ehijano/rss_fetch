      <title>A Novel Route to Oscillations via non-central SNICeroclinic Bifurcation: unfolding the separatrix loop between a saddle-node and a saddle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate saddle-node to saddle separatrix-loops that we term SNICeroclinic bifurcations. There are generic codimension-two bifurcations involving a heteroclinic loop between one non-hyperbolic and one hyperbolic saddle. A particular codimension-three case is the non-central SNICeroclinic bifurcation. We unfold this bifurcation in the minimal dimension (planar) case where the non-hyperbolic point is assumed to undergo a saddle-node bifurcation. Applying the method of Poincar\'{e} return maps, we present a minimal set of perturbations that captures all qualitatively distinct behaviours near a non-central SNICeroclinic loop. Specifically, we study how variation of the three unfolding parameters leads to transitions from a heteroclinic and homoclinic loops; saddle-node on an invariant circle (SNIC); and periodic orbits as well as equilibria. We show that although the bifurcation has been largely unexplored in applications, it can act as an organising center for transitions between various types of saddle-node and saddle separatrix loops. It is also a generic route to oscillations that are both born and destroyed via global bifurcations, compared to the commonly observed scenarios involving local (Hopf) bifurcations and in some cases a global (homoclinic or SNIC) and a local (Hopf) bifurcation.</description>

      <title>Tangential homoclinic points for Lozi maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the family of Lozi maps, we study homoclinic points for the saddle fixed point $X$ in the first quadrant. Specifically, in the parameter space, we examine the boundary of the region in which homoclinic points for $X$ exist. For all parameters on that boundary, all intersections of the stable and unstable manifold of $X$, apart from $X$, are tangential. We ultimately prove that for such parameters, all possible homoclinic points for $X$ are iterates of only two special points $Z$ and $V$. Additionally, we describe the parameter curves that form the boundary and provide explicit equations for several of them.</description>

      <title>Rare events statistics for $\mathbb Z^d$ map lattices coupled by collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb Z^d$-map lattices coupled by collision. We obtain a first order approximation for the first collision rate at a site $\textbf{p}^*\in \mathbb Z^d$ and we prove a distributional convergence for the first collision time to an exponential, with sharp error term. Moreover, we prove that the number of collisions at site $\textbf{p}^*$ converge in distribution to a compound Poisson distributed random variable. Key to our analysis in this infinite dimensional setting is the use of transfer operators associated with the decoupled map lattice at site $\textbf{p}^*$</description>

      <title>Robust heteroclinic cycles in pluridimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heteroclinic cycles are sequences of equilibria along with trajectories that connect them in a cyclic manner. We investigate a class of robust heteroclinic cycles that does not satisfy the usual condition that all connections between equilibria lie in flow-invariant subspaces of equal dimension. We refer to these as robust heteroclinic cycles in pluridimensions. The stability of these cycles cannot be expressed in terms of ratios of contracting and expanding eigenvalues in the usual way because, when the subspace dimensions increase, the equilibria fail to have contracting eigenvalues. We develop the stability theory for robust heteroclinic cycles in pluridimensions, allowing for the absence of contracting eigenvalues. We present four new examples, each with four equilibria and living in four dimensions, that illustrate the stability calculations. Potential applications include modelling the dynamics of evolving populations when there are transitions between equilibria corresponding to mixed populations with different numbers of species.</description>

      <title>Chaotic dynamics and fractal geometry in ring lattice systems of non-chaotic Rulkov neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the complex dynamics and fractal attractors that emerge from 60-dimensional ring lattice systems of electrically coupled non-chaotic Rulkov neurons. Although networks of chaotic Rulkov neurons are well-studied, systems of non-chaotic Rulkov neurons have not been extensively explored due to the piecewise complexity of the non-chaotic Rulkov map. We find rich dynamics emerge from the electrical coupling of regular spiking Rulkov neurons, including chaotic spiking, chaotic bursting, and complete chaos. We also discover general trends in the maximal Lyapunov exponent among different ring lattice systems as the electrical coupling strength between neurons is varied. By means of the Kaplan-Yorke conjecture, we also examine the fractal geometry of the chaotic attractors of the ring systems and find various correlations and differences between the fractal dimensions of the attractors and the chaotic dynamics on them.</description>

      <title>Extending Chaos Theory: The Role of Nonlinearity in Multiple Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work redefines the framework of chaos in dynamical systems by extending Devaney's definition to multiple mappings, emphasizing the pivotal role of nonlinearity. We propose a novel theorem demonstrating how nonlinear dynamics within a single mapping can induce chaos across a collective system, even when other components lack sensitivity. To validate these insights, we introduce advanced computational algorithms implemented in MATLAB, capable of detecting and visualizing key chaotic features such as transitivity, sensitivity, and periodic points. The results unveil new behaviors in higherdimensional systems, bridging theoretical advances with practical applications in physics, biology, and economics. By uniting rigorous mathematics with computational innovation, this study lays a foundation for future exploration of nonlinear dynamics in complex systems, offering transformative insights into the interplay between structure and chaos. Keywords: Nonlinearity, Chaos Theory, Multiple Mappings, Devaney Chaos, Computational Algorithms, Dynamical Systems.</description>

      <title>Clustering Time-Snapshots of Temporal Networks: From Synthetic Data to Real-World Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of many dynamical systems that describe relationships or interactions between objects can be effectively modeled by temporal networks, which are typically represented as a sequence of static network snapshots. In this paper, we introduce a novel random walk based approach that can identify clusters of time-snapshots in which network community structures are stable. This allows to detect significant structural shifts over time, such as the splitting, merging, birth, or death of communities. We also provide a low-dimensional representation of entire snapshots, placing those with similar community structure close to each other in the feature space. To validate our approach, we develop an agent-based algorithm that generates synthetic datasets with the desired characteristic properties, enabling thorough testing and benchmarking. We further demonstrate the effectiveness and broad applicability of our technique by testing it on various social dynamics models and real-world datasets and comparing its performance to several state-of-the-art algorithms. Our findings highlight the strength of our approach to correctly capture and analyze the dynamics of complex systems.</description>

      <title>A model for the dynamics of COVID-19 infection transmission in human with latent delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, we have derived a mathematical model for within human dynamics of COVID-19 infection using delay differential equations. The new model considers a 'latent period' and 'the time for immune response' as delay parameters, allowing us to study the effects of time delays in human COVID-19 infection. We have determined the equilibrium points and analyzed their stability. The disease-free equilibrium is stable when the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, is below unity. Stability switch of the endemic equilibrium occurs through Hopf-bifurcation. This study shows that the effect of latent delay is stabilizing whereas immune response delay has a destabilizing nature.</description>

      <title>Regularity lost: the fundamental limitations and constraint qualifications in the problems of elastoplasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and non-existence of a function-valued strain solution in various models of elastoplasticity from the perspective of the constraint-based ``dual'' formulations. We describe abstract frameworks for linear elasticity, elasticity-perfect plasticity and elasticity-hardening plasticity in terms of adjoint linear operators and convert them to equivalent formulations in terms of differential inclusions (the sweeping process in particular). Within such frameworks we consider several manually solvable examples of discrete and continuous models. Despite their simplicity, the examples show how for discrete models with perfect plasticity it is possible to find the evolution of stress and strain (elongation), yet continuum models within the same framework may not possess a function-valued strain. Although some examples with such phenomenon are already known, we demonstrate that it may appear due to displacement loading. The central idea of the paper is to explain the loss of strain regularity in the dual formulation by the lack of additivity of the normal cones and the failure of Slater's constraint qualification.
  In contrast to perfect plasticity, models with hardening are known to be well-solvable for strains. We show that more advanced constraint qualifications can help to distinguish between those cases and, in the case of hardening, ensure the additivity of the normal cones, which means the existence of a function-valued strain rate.</description>

A bound on the minimal time of reachability is obtained and the reachability property for integrable functions is characterized in terms of a left-coprime condition.

      <title>Validated enclosure of renormalization fixed points via Chebyshev series and the DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work develops a computational framework for proving existence, uniqueness, isolation, and stability results for real analytic fixed points of $m$-th order Feigenbaum-Cvitanovi\'{c} renormalization operators. Our approach builds on the earlier work of Lanford, Eckman, Wittwer, Koch, Burbanks, Osbaldestin, and Thurlby \cite{iii1982computer,eckmann1987complete,MR0727816, burbanks2021rigorous2,burbanks2021rigorous1}, however the main point of departure between ours and previous studies is that we discretize the domain of the renormalization operators using Chebyshev rather than Taylor series. The advantage of Chebyshev series is that they are naturally adapted to spaces of real analytic functions, in the sense that they converge on ellipses containing real intervals rather than on disks in $\mathbb{C}$. The main disadvantage of working with Chebyshev series in this context is that the essential operations of rescaling and composition are less straight forward for Chebysehv than for Taylor series. These difficulties are overcome using a combination of a-priori information about decay rates in the Banach space with a-posteriori estimates on Chebyshev interpolation errors for analytic functions.
  Our arguments are implemented in the Julia programming language and exploit extended precision floating point interval arithmetic. In addition to proving the existence of multiple renormalization fixed points of order $m = 3, \ldots, 10$, and computing validated bounds on the values of their the universal constants, we also reprove the existence of the classical $m=2$ Feigenbaum renormalization fixed point and compute its universal constants to close to 500 correct decimal digits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasing the complexity of solving budgetary allocation (NP-hardness problem) has led a wide range of methods to minimize the costs. Metaheuristics and Linear Programming (LP) are the most optimization in this fields. Therefore, this study provides insights and a deep understanding of the applicability of LP models in industry and how to formulate SM and affine IPM for solving real world linear problems. Moreover, it will present a better way to deal with decision making problems through the development and comparison of the SM and affine IPM to solve LP optimization problem to maximize profit. Finally, to other researchers particularly of similar interests who are undertaking further investigation on this topic, this study can be vital as a secondary source of information and guidance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a high dimensional generalisation of the standard Klein bottle, going beyond those considered previously. We address the problem of generating continuous scalar fields (distributions) and dynamical systems (flows) on such state spaces, which can provide a rich source of examples for future investigations. We consider a class of high dimensional dynamical systems that model distributed information processing within the human cortex, which may be capable of exhibiting some Klein bottle symmetries. We deploy topological data analytic methods in order to analyse their resulting dynamical behaviour, and suggesting future challenges.</description>
