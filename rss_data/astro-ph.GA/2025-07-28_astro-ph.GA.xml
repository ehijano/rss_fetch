      <title>The long-term stability of the Vast Polar Structure and its connection to a possible previous passage of the LMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vast Polar Structure (VPOS) is a thin, planar arrangement of co-orbiting dwarf galaxies, nearly perpendicular to the Milky Way (MW) disc. In this work we investigate the persistence and stability of the VPOS over time. We identify VPOS member galaxies and integrate their orbits over the past 5 Gyr using time evolving gravitational potentials that account for the mutual interaction between the MW and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The reconstructed trajectories allow us to examine the long-term evolution of the VPOS. We identify 15 galaxies as members of the VPOS, including 9 MW and 6 LMC satellites. We find that the VPOS has remained a stable structure, maintaining a roughly constant thickness ($\sim$ 15 kpc), flattening ($c/a \sim$ 0.2), and orientation over time. The VPOS is not a transient alignment, but a long-lived planar structure in the MW system, that has persisted for at least the last 5 Gyrs and predates the recent LMC infall. While the LMC exerts a strong gravitational influence on the MW satellites, its impact on the VPOS is limited, leading only to mild perturbations. The structural properties of the VPOS remain almost unchanged, whether or not LMC satellites are included in the analysis, indicating a smooth dynamical integration with the rest of VPOS members upon entering the MW virial radius. This minimal dynamical impact on the VPOS results from the remarkable alignment between the LMC's orbit and the plane's orientation. We conclude that the VPOS is a stable, long-lived structure that predates the recent infall of the LMC and retains nearly constant structural properties over the last 5 Gyrs. Our findings suggest a strong connection between the VPOS and the LMC, consistent with a scenario in which the LMC is on its second pericentre and the VPOS originated primarily from satellites stripped during the first passage.</description>

      <title>Invisible Accretion: Ionized Envelopes of TNG50 HVCs can Sustain Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic high-velocity clouds (HVCs) are known to be complex, multiphase systems consisting of neutral and/or ionized gas moving at high velocities relative to the rotation of the disk. In this work, we investigate Milky Way-like galaxies from the TNG50 simulation to characterize the properties, morphology, and accretion rates of the warm and hot ionized material comoving with neutral HVCs visible in HI. We find that the ionized gas forms an envelope around the neutral material, and in most cases (73% of the HVCs) it is prolate in morphology. We also find that the ionized mass is ~6 times greater than the neutral mass, which leads to significantly more accretion possible from the ionized gas ($\dot{M}_\mathrm{ion}$) than the neutral gas ($\dot{M}_\mathrm{neut}$), consistent with estimates made from observations of our own Galaxy. We investigate the accretion rates from both phases of HVCs around 47 Milky Way-like galaxies and find that $\dot{M}_\mathrm{ion}$ scales with $\dot{M}_\mathrm{neut}$, and both scale with the star formation rate of the galaxy. Finally, we find that, on average, $\dot{M}_\mathrm{ion}$ could account for 81% of the galactic star formation rate (assuming the material can sufficiently cool and condense), while $\dot{M}_\mathrm{neut}$ can only balance 11%. Thus, the diffuse, ionized, high-velocity circumgalactic medium plays a defining role in the evolution and growth of galaxies at low redshift.</description>

      <title>Mapping water ice with infrared broadband photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar ices play a fundamental role in the physical and chemical evolution of molecular clouds and star-forming regions, yet their large-scale distribution and abundance remain challenging to map. In this work, I present the ice color excess method, which parametrizes the peak optical depth ($\tau_{3.0}^{\mathrm{max}}$) of the prominent 3$\mu$m absorption feature, which is predominantly caused by the presence of solid H$_2$O. The method builds on well-established near-infrared color excess techniques and uses widely available infrared broadband photometry. Through detailed evaluation of passband combinations and a comprehensive error analysis, I construct the ice color excess metric $\Lambda(W_1 - I_1)$. This parameter emerges as the optimal choice that minimizes systematic errors while leveraging high-quality, widely available photometry from Spitzer and WISE data archives. To calibrate the method, I compile from the literature a sample of stars located in the background of nearby molecular clouds, for which spectroscopically measured optical depths are available. The empirical calibration yields a remarkably tight correlation between $\tau_{3.0}^{\mathrm{max}}$ and $\Lambda(W_1 - I_1)$. This photometric technique opens a new avenue for tracing the icy component of the interstellar medium on Galactic scales, providing a powerful complement to spectroscopic surveys and enabling new insights into the environmental dependence of the formation and evolution of icy dust grains.</description>

      <title>The z = 9.625 Cosmic Gems Galaxy was a "Compact Blue Monster" Propelled by Massive Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of five massive stellar clusters at z=9.625 in the Cosmic Gems has raised the question about the formation mechanism of star clusters in the first half Gyr after the Big-Bang. We infer the total stellar mass in clusters by normalizing and integrating the stellar cluster mass function (SCMF, dn(M)/dM ~ (n$_0$) $M^\beta$), assuming three different slopes $\beta$ = -1.5, -2.0 and -2.5 and different lower-mass limits between $10^2$ and $10^5$ Msun. The total integrated cluster stellar mass is compared to the stellar mass inferred from the counter-image of the Cosmic Gems, which provides the best, modestly magnified ($\mu$ = 1.84$\pm$0.05) representation of the entire galaxy. The delensed stellar mass of the Cosmic Gems galaxy is estimated as 3.5$_{-1.8}^{+3.3}$ x$10^7$ Msun, with an effective radius of Reff = 103$_{-15}^{+13}$ parsec and a stellar surface mass density of $\Sigma$mass = 520$_{-225}^{+340}$ Msun pc$^{-2}$. Accounting for normalization uncertainties - including different lensing magnification scenarios for the arc - a modified SCMF, combined with a significantly high star cluster formation efficiency (approaching 100%), appears to be a necessary condition to explain the relatively short formation timescale of both the star clusters and the counter-image, without exceeding the galaxy's stellar mass. By extrapolating the physical properties at the peak of the burst we find that in its recent past (&lt;~ 30 Myr) the Cosmic Gems galaxy has likely experienced a specific star formation rate (sSFR) exceeding 25 Gyr$^{-1}$ and luminosity approaching the ``blue monster'' regime (M$_{UV}$ &lt; -20). Our study provides insights into the extreme clustered nature of star formation in early galaxies and shed light into the formation of bound star clusters that might survive to z = 0 as globular clusters, older than 13 Gyr.</description>

      <title>Orbital statistics of multiple systems formed from small-$N$ subclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use numerical $N$-body experiments to explore the statistics of multiple systems formed in small-$N$ subclusters, i.e. the distributions of orbital semi-major axis, $a$, orbital eccentricity, $e$, mass ratio, $q$, mutual orbital inclination, $\theta$, and ejection velocity, $\upsilon_{\rm ej}$. The stars in a subcluster are evolved as if they are the fragmentation products of a single isolated prestellar core from which most of the natal gas has already been dispersed, and there are no correlations between the stars' initial positions and velocities. Two parameters are particularly important: the number of stars in the subcluster, $N$, and the fraction of kinetic energy in ordered rotation, $\alpha_{\rm rot}$. Increasing $N$ has the effect of systematically decreasing the semi-major axes of the tighter orbits, but has very little effect on the semi-major axes of the wider orbits. The main effect of $\alpha_{\rm rot}$ is to regulate the distribution of mutual orbital inclinations, with $\alpha_{\rm rot}\!\sim\!0.5$ producing a distribution of orbital inclinations for triple systems which is consistent with observed values. Triples frequently form in high-inclination orbits without the assistance of von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles. Our previous work demonstrated that subclusters with mass segregation, moderate rotation, and typically $N=4$ or 5 stars produced the best fit to the multiplicity statistics (proportions of singles, binaries, triples, etc.). Here we show that these parameters also reproduce the orbital statistics (distributions of orbital semi-major axis, $a$, orbital eccentricity, $e$, mass ratio, $q$, mutual orbital inclination, $\theta$, and ejection velocity, $\upsilon_{\rm ej}$). For the best-fit parameters, $21(\pm 1)\%$ of subclusters produce more than one multiple system.</description>

      <title>Magellan Spectroscopy of AGNs in Low-mass Galaxies: Scaling Relations and a Triple-Peaked AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to further populate the low-mass regime of black hole (BH) scaling relations to better understand the formation and growth mechanisms of central supermassive BHs. We target six galaxies that have been previously identified as hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN) based on optical spectroscopy from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey or the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with stellar masses reported to be M$_\star &lt; 5 \times 10^9$ M$_\odot$. Using follow-up optical spectroscopy from the Magellan Echellette Spectrograph (MagE), we extract galaxy velocity dispersions ($\sigma_\star$) and estimate virial BH masses from broad H$\alpha$ emission. We find that the galaxies in our sample do not deviate significantly from either the M$_{BH}-\sigma_\star$ or M$_{BH}-$M$_{\star}$ scaling relations defined by higher mass galaxies. Additionally, we identify one galaxy with triple-peaked SII, NII, H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines. This spectral shape is not shared by OIII and, in fact, the OIII line appears to have distinct kinematics from the other emission lines. Incorporating the spatial distribution of the various emission lines, we find that the galaxy spectrum is consistent with a prominent central AGN driving an outflow, surrounded by an extended ring/disk of gas predominantly ionized by shocks and/or star formation. This work has implications for the demographics of BHs in low-mass galaxies and the role of AGN feedback.</description>

      <title>JWST Spectroscopic Confirmation of the Cosmic Gems Arc at z=9.625 -- Insights into the small scale structure of a post-burst system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy of the Cosmic Gems arc, strongly magnified by the galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0615$-$5746. Six-hour integration using NIRSpec prism spectroscopy (resolution $\rm R\simeq 30-300$), covering the spectral range $0.8-5.3~\mu m$, reveals a pronounced $\rm Ly\alpha$-continuum break at $\lambda \simeq 1.3~\mu m$, and weak optical $\rm H\beta$ and $\rm [OIII]\lambda4959$ emission lines at $z=9.625\pm0.002$, located in the reddest part of the spectrum ($\lambda &gt; 5.1~\mu m$). No additional ultraviolet or optical emission lines are reliably detected. A weak Balmer break is measured alongside a very blue ultraviolet slope ($\beta \leq-2.5$, $\rm F_{\lambda} \sim \lambda^{\beta}$). Spectral fitting with $\tt Bagpipes$ suggests the Cosmic Gems galaxy is in a post-starburst phase, making it the highest-redshift system currently observed in a mini-quenched state. Spatially resolved spectroscopy at tens pc scales shows relatively uniform features across subcomponents of the arc. These findings align well with physical properties previously derived from JWST/NIRCam photometry of the stellar clusters, now corroborated by spectroscopic evidence. In particular, five observed star clusters exhibit ages of $\rm 7-30~Myr$. An updated lens model constrains the intrinsic sizes and masses of these clusters, confirming they are extremely compact and denser than typical star clusters in local star-forming galaxies. Additionally, four compact stellar systems consistent with star clusters ($\lesssim10$ pc) are identified along the extended tail of the arc. A sub-parsec line-emitting HII region straddling the critical line, lacking a NIRCam counterpart, is also serendipitously detected.</description>

      <title>The Arizona Molecular ISM Survey with the SMT: The Diverse Carbon Monoxide Line Ratios and Spectral Line Energy Distributions of Star Forming Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The carbon monoxide (CO) spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs) of galaxies contain a wealth of information about conditions in their cold interstellar gas. Here we use galaxy-scale observations of the three lowest energy CO lines to determine SLEDs and line ratios in a sample of 47 nearby, predominantly star forming galaxies. We find systematic trend of higher gas excitation with increasing star formation rate (SFR) and SFR surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), with the range of variations being even larger than predicted by simulations. Power law fits of the CO line ratios as a function of SFR and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ provide a good description of the trends seen in our sample and also accurately predict values for a wide range of galaxy types compiled from the literature. Based on these fits, we provide prescriptions for estimating CO(1-0) luminosities and molecular gas masses using CO(3-2) or CO(2-1) in cases where CO(1-0) is not observed directly. We compare our observed SLEDs with molecular cloud models in order to examine how the physical properties of cold gas vary across the galaxy population. We find that gas conditions in star forming and starburst galaxies lie on a continuum with increasing gas density in more actively star forming systems.</description>

      <title>The coherent satellite velocity field around the interacting spiral galaxy pair NGC5713/19: signature of two galaxy groups merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The luminous spirals NGC5713 and NGC5719 form an interacting galaxy pair 94 kpc apart and are connected by a straight, elongated neutral hydrogen structure extending over 200 kpc. Their 14 velocity-confirmed satellite galaxies and the two hosts separate into two distinct subgroups in their line-of-sight velocities and on-sky distribution revealing a prominent coherent kinematic structure with a velocity amplitude of 67+-12 kms-1 . We test four scenarios to explain the observed velocity field: isotropic motions in a dark matter halo, a plane of satellites seen nearly face-on, and a kinematically mixed satellite system with a co-rotating edge-on plane and an isotropic component, and a merger of two small galaxy groups. Taking the geometry and dynamical state of the NGC5713/19 pair into account together with their positions and motions in the Bootes Strip the most consistent picture is the infall of two satellite systems that follow their host galaxies along a cosmic filament. We believe this is the first clear example of an equal-mass L* disk galaxy merger where a kinematically coherent satellite system is in the process of formation. These observations reinforce the importance of major mergers as a channel for producing co-rotating satellite systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field of a ring-like shape molecular cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the magnetic field structure in the G111 molecular cloud, a ring-like filamentary cloud within the NGC 7538 region. We utilized interstellar dust polarization from the Planck telescope to trace large-scale field orientations, starlight extinction polarization from the Kanata telescope to probe the cloud's magnetic field after foreground subtraction, and velocity gradients derived from CO isotopologues, observed with the IRAP 30m telescope, to examine dense regions. Our results reveal a coherent yet spatially varying magnetic field within G111. We correct the significant foreground dust contamination through careful subtraction. We observe a global alignment of the magnetic field with density structures suggesting that the field is dynamically important in shaping the cloud. The curved magnetic field along the dense regions, coinciding with mid-infrared emission in WISE data, indicates shock compression, likely driven by stellar feedback or supernova remnants. Our findings support a scenario where G111's morphology results from turbulent shock-driven compression. The interplay between magnetic fields and external forces is crucial in shaping and maintaining the structure of the molecular cloud. Future high-resolution observations will be essential to further constrain the magnetic field's role in cloud evolution.</description>

      <title>A hidden link in the LMC star cluster formation history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The age distribution function of star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is known to present a feature called the cluster age gap, a period of time from ~ 4 to 11 Gyr ago with a remarkable small number of clusters identified. In this work we performed an in-depth analysis of three recently catalogued age gap cluster candidates with the aim of confirming their physical nature. We used GEMINI@GMOS g,i photometry centred on the objects to build colour-magnitude diagrams from which we recognised their main features. We also performed an automatic search of stellar overdensities using Gaussian mixture model techniques and analysed the corresponding colour-magnitude diagrams similarly as performed for the aforementioned candidates. The present GEMINI data sets would seem to discard any strong evidence of these object being real clusters, and rather support the possibility of the result of stellar density variations of the LMC field star distribution. These three objects, in addition to other 17 new identified candidates, are placed in the LMC outermost disc in a limited region toward the southwest from the LMC centre. They had embraced the possibility to answer the long-time conundrum about the absence of LMC age gap clusters. From an statistical approach, combined with the knowledge of the expected LMC age-metallicity relationship, and recent simulations of the interaction between the LMC and the Milky Way, we provide not only evidence against the physical nature of the studied objects, but also an interpretation on the lack of identification of more LMC age gap clusters.</description>

      <title>GATOS. n. On the physical origin of the extended MIR emission in AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polar mid-infrared (MIR) emission detected from tens to hundreds of parsecs in some active galactic nuclei (AGN) has been associated with dusty winds driven away by radiation pressure. However, the physical characterization of this extended polar emission remains uncertain. Here we combine $10-21\mu$m JWST/MIRI imaging observations with $7-25 \mu$m MRS integral field spectroscopic observations of 6 nearby, $\bar{D}=35.4\pm4.6$~Mpc, AGN from the GATOS Survey to quantify the nature of the extended MIR emission at $\sim75$ pc resolution at $21~\mu$m. These AGN have similar bolometric luminosities, $\log_{10}(\bar{L}_{\rm{bol}}~[\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}])=44.0\pm0.3$, span a wide range of optical outflow rates, $\dot{M}=0.003-0.21$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, column densities, $\log_{10}(N_{H}^{X-ray} [cm^{-2}])=22.2-24.3$, and Eddington ratios, $\lambda_{\rm{Edd}}=0.005-0.06$. We find a poor correlation between the line-only and continuum-only images, indicating that the extended MIR continuum emission is spatially uncorrelated with the warm outflows associated with narrow emission lines in the $10-15\,\mu$m wavelength range. The $75-450$~pc continuum emission has constant dust temperature, $T_{\rm{d}}=132^{+7}_{-7}$ K, and mass, $M_{\rm{d}}=728^{+29}_{-27}$ M$_{\odot}$. Using the conditions of energy balance between radiation pressure and gravity, we find that our AGN sample is in the gravitationally bounded regime, consistent with the lack of detection of dusty winds in our observations. At $10~\mu$m, the level of line emission contribution across the NLR is correlated with the outflow kinetic energy and mass outflow rates. We find no correlation with the AGN properties. These results indicate that the radio jet may be triggering the gas outflow and line emission, while the extended dust emission is distributed in molecular clouds and/or shocked regions across the narrow line region.</description>

      <title>NGC 6860, Mrk 915 and MCG -01-24-012. I. Spatial anti-correlation between cold molecular and ionized gas distributions in Seyfert galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the cold molecular versus the ionized gas distribution in three nearby Seyfert galaxies: NGC 6860, Mrk 915 and MCG -01-24-012. To constrain the cold molecular flux distribution at $\sim$ 0.5 - 0.8$^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim$ 150 - 400 pc) scales, we used data from the CO(2-1) emission line, obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). For the ionized gas, we used Hubble Space Telescope (HST) narrow-band images, centered on the [O III]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 emission lines. Within the inner kiloparsec of the three galaxies, we observe gaps in the CO emission in regions co-spatial with the [O III] flux distribution, similarly to what has been recently observed in other active galaxies. From our original sample of 13 nearby AGN sources, 12 objects present the same trend. This indicates that CO molecules might be partially dissociated by AGN radiation or that there is a deficit of cold molecular gas on nuclear scales driven by ionized gas outflows/jets. If so, this represents a form of AGN feedback that is not captured when only outflow kinematics properties, such as mass outflow rates, are considered. We also discuss that part of the molecular gas might still be present in hotter H$_2$ phases, as observed already in other objects.</description>

      <title>The SWAN view of dense gas in the Whirlpool -- A cloud-scale comparison of N2H+, HCO+, HNC and HCN emission in M51</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracing dense molecular gas, the fuel for star formation, is essential for the understanding of the evolution of molecular clouds and star formation processes. We compare the emission of HCN(1-0), HNC(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) with the emission of N2H+(1-0) at cloud-scales (125 pc) across the central 5x7 kpc of the Whirlpool galaxy, M51a, from "Surveying the Whirlpool galaxy at Arcseconds with NOEMA" (SWAN). We find that the integrated intensities of HCN, HNC and HCO+ are more steeply correlated with N2H+ emission compared to the bulk molecular gas tracer CO, and we find variations in this relation across the center, molecular ring, northern and southern disk of M51. Compared to HCN and HNC emission, the HCO+ emission follows the N2H+ emission more similarly across the environments and physical conditions such as surface densities of molecular gas, stellar mass, star-formation rate, dynamical equilibrium pressure and radius. Under the assumption that N2H+ is a fair tracer of dense gas at these scales, this makes HCO+ a more favorable dense gas tracer than HCN within the inner disk of M51. In all environments within our field of view, even when removing the central 2 kpc, HCN/CO, commonly used to trace average cloud density, is only weakly depending on molecular gas mass surface density. While ratios of other dense gas lines to CO show a steeper dependency on the surface density of molecular gas, it is still shallow in comparison to other nearby star-forming disk galaxies. The reasons might be physical conditions in M51 that are different from other normal star-forming galaxies. Increased ionization rates, increased dynamical equilibrium pressure in the central few kpc and the impact of the dwarf companion galaxy NGC 5195 are proposed mechanisms that might enhance HCN and HNC emission over HCO+ and N2H+ emission at larger-scale environments and cloud scales.</description>

      <title>JWST+ALMA reveal the build up of stellar mass in the cores of dusty star-forming galaxies at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dusty star-forming galaxies have long been suspected to serve as the missing evolutionary bridge between the star-forming and quiescent phases of massive galaxy evolution. With the combined power of JWST and ALMA, it is now possible to use high resolution imaging in rest-optical, rest near-infrared (NIR), and rest-submm wavelengths to study the multi-wavelength morphologies tracing both the stellar populations and dust within this key phase. We present the joint analysis of JWST/NIRCam imaging in GOODS-S and mm dust emission traced by ALMA for a sample of 33 galaxies at $z$=1.5 to $z$=5.5 selected from the 1.1mm GOODS-ALMA 2.0 survey, and compare the morphologies of this population to mass and redshift selected samples of field star-forming and quiescent galaxies. The 1.1mm-selected sample are morphologically distinct from other similarly massive star-forming galaxies; we find a steeper size-wavelength gradient from 1.5-4.4$\mu$m, with a more dramatic decrease in size towards longer wavelengths. While the rest-NIR surface brightness profiles of the 1.1mm-selected galaxies are brighter in the inner regions relative to the field star-forming population, they are remarkably similar to the quiescent population. These morphological differences could suggest that dusty star-forming galaxies, unlike more typical star-forming galaxies, have already built up stellar mass in a severely dust-obscured core, leading to extended and clumpy morphologies at rest-optical wavelengths and more compact emission in the rest-NIR that is co-spatial with dust. If the bulge is already established, we speculate that mm-selected galaxies may imminently evolve to join their quiescent descendants.</description>

      <title>Tracers of the ionization fraction in dense and translucent molecular gas: II. Using mm observations to constrain ionization fraction across Orion B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ionization fraction ($f_\mathrm{e}=n_\mathrm{e}/n_\mathrm{H}$) is a crucial parameter of interstellar gas, yet estimating it requires deep knowledge of molecular gas chemistry and observations of specific lines, such as those from isotopologs like HCO$^+$ and N$_2$H$^+$, which are detectable only in dense cores. Previous challenges in constraining $f_\mathrm{e}$ over large areas stemmed from the limitations of observational tracers and chemical models. Recent models have identified molecular line ratios that can trace $f_\mathrm{e}$ in different environments within molecular clouds. In this study, we analyze various molecular lines in the 3-4 mm range to derive the ionization fraction across the Orion B giant molecular cloud. We focus on dense and translucent gas, exploring variations with gas density ($n$) and the far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field ($G_0$). Our findings show that the ionization fraction ranges from $10^{-5.5}$ to $10^{-4}$ in translucent gas and $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-6}$ in dense gas. Notably, $f_\mathrm{e}$ is sensitive to $G_0$ in dense, UV-illuminated regions, decreasing with increasing volume density ($f_\mathrm{e} \propto n^{-0.227}$ for dense and $f_\mathrm{e} \propto n^{-0.3}$ for translucent gas) and increasing with $G_0$. In translucent gas, differing line ratios yield consistent fe values, indicating the importance of electron excitation of HCN and HNC. For dense gas, we recommend using the CN(1-0)/N$_2$H$^+$(1-0) ratio for upper limits on fe and C$^{18}$O(1-0)/HCO$^+$(1-0) for lower limits. In translucent environments, CCH(1-0)/HNC(1-0) effectively traces $f_\mathrm{e}$. The higher fe values in translucent gas align with the C$^+$/CI/CO transition, while values in dense gas are adequate for coupling with the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Probing the ionizing photon output of galaxies near cosmic dawn with the patchy kSZ effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key result from JWST's first cycles is that galaxy formation was well underway by $z=10$. The implications of these early galaxies for reionization are less clear, however. The CMB is one of the few windows into the ionization state of the IGM during reionization's first half, providing an important probe of the ionizing photon sources at those times. Meanwhile, measurements of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in the spectra of high-$z$ quasars have improved to the level of tightly constraining the timing of reionization's end. In this paper, we use radiative transfer simulations to explore how measurements of the patchy kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (pkSZ) effect, when combined with Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements, can be used to constrain the early stages of reionization and the nature of its sources. For a given source model, we find that the amplitude of the pkSZ power spectra strongly correlates with the start time of reionization, and constrains the number of ionizing photons produced by the high-$z$ source population. Allowing for variations in the source model, this correlation is weakened by a degeneracy between the reionization history and the effects of source clustering. However, we demonstrate two potential ways of breaking this degeneracy using: (1) measurements of large-scale fluctuations in the Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity at $z=5-6$, and/or; (2) the shape of the pkSZ power spectrum measured in future CMB surveys. Models with highly clustered sources yield steeper slopes in the pkSZ power around $\ell = 3,000$, so measurements at additional angular scales can be used to break the history-clustering degeneracy. Our results highlight how future pkSZ measurements will complement JWST observations to improve our understanding of the ionizing sources near cosmic dawn.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Rays Masquerading as Cool Cores: An Inverse-Compton Origin for Cool Core Cluster Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray bright cool-core (CC) clusters contain luminous radio sources accelerating cosmic ray (CR) leptons at prodigious rates. Near the acceleration region, high-energy leptons produce synchrotron (mini)halos and sometimes observable gamma rays, but these leptons have short lifetimes and so cannot propagate far from sources without some rejuvenation. However, low-energy (~0.1-1 GeV) CRs should survive for &gt;Gyr, potentially reaching ~100 kpc before losing energy via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons to keV X-ray energies, with remarkably thermal X-ray spectra. In groups/clusters, this will appear similar to relatively 'cool' gas in cluster cores (i.e. CCs). In lower-mass (e.g. Milky Way/M31) halos, analogous CR IC emission will appear as hot (super-virial) gas at outer CGM radii, explaining recent diffuse X-ray observations. We show that for plausible (radio/gamma-ray observed) lepton injection rates, the CR-IC emission could contribute significantly to the X-ray surface brightness (SB) in CCs, implying that CC gas densities may have been overestimated and alleviating the cooling flow problem. A significant IC contribution to diffuse X-ray emission in CC clusters also explains the tight correlation between the X-ray 'cooling luminosity' and AGN/cavity/jet power, because the apparent CC emission is itself driven by the radio source. Comparing observed Sunyaev Zeldovich to X-ray inferred pressures at $\ll 100$ kpc in CCs represents a clean test of this scenario, and existing data appears to favor significant CR-IC. A significant IC contribution also implies that X-ray inferred gas-phase metallicities have been underestimated in CCs, potentially explaining the discrepancy between X-ray (sub-Solar) and optical/UV (super-Solar) observed metallicities in the central ~10 kpc of nearby CCs. We also discuss the model's connection to observations of multiphase gas in clusters.</description>

      <title>The infrared jet of M87 observed with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first JWST+NIRCam images of the giant elliptical active galaxy M87 and its jet at 0.90, 1.50, 2.77 and 3.56 $\mu$m. We analysed the large-scale jet structure, identifying prominent components, and determined the near-infrared spectral index. The data were calibrated using the standard JWST pipeline. We subtracted a constant background level and a smooth model of the galaxy surface brightness to isolate the jet. The total image fluxes measured in the NIRCam filters follow the infrared bump pattern seen near 1.6 $\mu$m in the spectral energy distribution of M87, caused by the surrounding stellar population in the galaxy. The residual jet images broadly agree with the radio to optical synchrotron power law $S_\lambda\propto\lambda^\alpha$ with $\alpha=$0.7-1.0. We identified the most upstream knot L at a distance of (320$\pm$50) mas from the core. The component HST-1, at (950$\pm$50) mas from the core, is transversely resolved, and both the individual images and the spectral index map clearly indicate its double-component substructure with two elements of similar size and flux density, with centroids separated by (150$\pm$20) mas and with a significantly larger spectral index $\alpha$ observed in the downstream component ($\alpha_{\rm do}=0.3$) than in the upstream one ($\alpha_{\rm up}= -0.15$). We also observe the counter-jet component located about 24 arcsec away from the nucleus.</description>

      <title>A generalized semi-analytic model for the combined outflow from a cluster of stars with strong stellar winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive semi-analytic solutions for the thermally driven cumulative outflow from a dense stellar cluster that consists of a large number of stars with strong stellar winds, under the key assumption that their mass and energy deposition can be treated as a continuous source of thermalized wind material. Our approach provides explicit analytic forms for the flow critical radius and sound speed, which then allows for full solution by inward/outward integration from this critical radius. Application to previous models that assume either a power-law or exponential mass deposition allows a direct comparison of their velocity solutions. We then obtain solutions for new models that have mass depositions with a gaussian or the empirically motivated forms derived by Plummer and Elson. Comparisons show that, when cast in terms of the radius scaled by the critical radius, the overall velocity laws are all quite similar, asymptotically approaching the energy-averaged stellar wind speed $V_w$, and anchored to passing through a common critical/sonic speed $v_c = V_w/2$. By deriving associated variations in outflow density and temperature, we obtain scaling forms for the expected X-ray emission, and show that radiative cooling generally represents only a small correction to the assumed cooling from adiabatic expansion. An initial analysis of incomplete wind thermalization suggests this should likewise have modest effect on the overall outflow in dense clusters. The simplified semi-analytic method presented here can be readily applied to alternative mass depositions and so form a basis for interpreting results from detailed numerical simulations of outflows from young stellar clusters.</description>

      <title>On the protostellar mass-luminosity relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a preliminary view of the protostellar mass-luminosity relation using current samples of protostars with dynamical mass estimates. To provide a lower limit to the expected luminosities, we adopt an empirical estimate for the intrinsic (without accretion) protostellar luminosity and radius as a function of mass. We find that many of the protostars with current dynamical mass estimates track the empirical mass-luminosity "birthline" reasonably closely, suggesting that their accretion luminosities may be at most comparable to their photospheric radiation. In turn, this implies that mass accretion rates for many objects are well below that required to build up the final stellar mass in typical estimated protostellar lifetimes. A small subset of the protostars have luminosities well above the predicted photospheric values, consistent with evolutionarily-important mass addition. These results hint at a possible bimodal distribution of accretion, but a firm conclusion is not possible given the small size of and likely biases in the current sample.</description>

      <title>Emulating redshift-mixing due to blending in weak gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxies whose images overlap in the focal plane of a telescope, commonly referred to as blends, are often located at different redshifts. Blending introduces a challenge to weak lensing cosmology probes, as such blends are subject to shear signals from multiple redshifts. This effect can be described by joining shear bias and redshift characterisation in the effective redshift distribution, $n_{\gamma}(z)$, which includes the response of apparent shapes of detected objects to shear of galaxies at redshift $z$. In this work, we propose a novel method to correct $n_{\gamma}(z)$ for redshift-mixed blending by emulating the shear response to neighbouring galaxies. Specifically, we design a ``half-sky-shearing'' simulation with HSC-Wide-like specifications, in which we extract the response of a detected object's measured ellipticity to shear of neighbouring galaxies among numerous galaxy pairs. We demonstrate the feasibility of accurately emulating these pairwise responses and validate the robustness of our approach under varying observing conditions and galaxy population uncertainties. We find that the effective redshift of sources at the high-redshift tail of the distribution is about 0.05 lower than expected when not modelling the effect. Given appropriately processed image simulations, our correction method can be readily incorporated into future cosmological analyses to mitigate this source of systematic error.</description>

Abstract: The upper region of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is populated by massive stars in a diversity of evolutionary stages, and the classification of these stars is often based on observed characteristics exclusively in the optical spectral range. The near-infrared regime provides useful complementary information that can help resolving ambiguities in stellar classification and add valuable information about circumstellar envelopes or late-type companions. We present new, near-infrared medium-resolution K-band spectra for a sample of six evolved massive stars, four in M31 and two in M33. The spectra are obtained with the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS) at the Gemini North telescope. We detect CO band emission from the environment of two M31 objects, J004320.97+414039.6 and J004621.08+421308.2, which we classify as B[e] supergiants, with J004320.97+414039.6 being most likely in a post-red supergiant stage. Two objects have pure emission from the hydrogen Pfund series. Of these, we propose that J004415.00+420156.2 in M31 could also be a B[e] supergiant while J013410.93+303437.6 (Var 83) is a well-known luminous blue variable (LBV) in M33. The M31 star J004229.87+410551.8 has a featureless spectrum and its evolutionary stage remains inconclusive; it could be an LBV undergoing an S Dor cycle. The object J013242.26+302114.1 in M33 displays a pure absorption spectrum, including CO bands, consistent with its identification as a cool star. Radial velocity measurements of this red component, combined with modelling of the spectral energy distribution, suggest that J013242.26+302114.1 may be a binary system consisting of an LBV or B[e] supergiant primary and a red supergiant secondary. If confirmed, it would represent the first of its kind.</description>

      <title>Distributions of wide binary stars in theory and in Gaia data: II. Reconstruction of sample probability density of true orbit sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wide binary stars are important for testing alternative models of gravitation in the weak-field regime and understanding the statistical outcomes of dynamical interactions in the general Galactic field. The Gaia mission's collection of weakly bound pairs of stars offers a unique opportunity to estimate the rate of survivors at separations above 7 KAU, where non-Newtonian components of gravitation may become important. The available Gaia-based catalogs of resolved binaries provide the projected angular separation between the components, while the physical semimajor axis is the parameter of interest. The problem of reconstructing the distribution of orbit sizes is complex and ill-posed, because the observed apparent separations are defined by a number of underlying physical parameters including semimajor axis, eccentricity, orbit orientation, and orbital phase. Methods of inverse reconstruction of the marginal distribution of semimajor axes from the available data are proposed and implemented with two different strategies, namely, a direct Monte Carlo mapping and inverse filtering with impulse updates without regularization. We find rather similar results from the two methods for the outlying tail of the distribution, suggesting that the rate of orbit sizes is a shallow declining function on a logarithmic scale. A finite rate of extremely wide binaries is implied.</description>

      <title>EPOCHS VI: The Size and Shape Evolution of Galaxies since z ~ 8 with JWST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of a size and structural analysis of 1395 galaxies at $0.5 \leq z \lesssim 8$ with stellar masses $\log \left(M_* / M_{\odot}\right)$ $&gt;$ 9.5 within the JWST Public CEERS field that overlaps with the HST CANDELS EGS observations. We use GALFIT to fit single S\'ersic models to the rest-frame optical profile of our galaxies, which is a mass-selected sample complete to our redshift and mass limit. Our primary result is that at fixed rest-frame wavelength and stellar mass, galaxies get progressively smaller, evolving as $\sim (1+z)^{-0.71\pm0.19}$ up to $z \sim 8$. We discover that the vast majority of massive galaxies at high redshifts have low S\'ersic indices, thus do not contain steep, concentrated light profiles. Additionally, we explore the evolution of the size-stellar mass relationship, finding a correlation such that more massive systems are larger up to $z \sim 3$. This relationship breaks down at $z &gt; 3$, where we find that galaxies are of similar sizes, regardless of their star formation rates and S\'ersic index, varying little with mass. We show that galaxies are more compact at redder wavelengths, independent of sSFR or stellar mass up to $z \sim 3$. We demonstrate the size evolution of galaxies continues up to $z \sim 8$, showing that the process or causes for this evolution is active at early times. We discuss these results in terms of ideas behind galaxy formation and evolution at early epochs, such as their importance in tracing processes driving size evolution, including minor mergers and AGN activity.</description>

      <title>Black hole mass of a quiescent galaxy hosting a Type 1 AGN at z=2.09: Implications for black hole - galaxy co-evolution and AGN quenching at high redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a characterization of an X-ray-detected quiescent galaxy at $z=2.09$, named COS-XQG1, using JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec data. This galaxy is detected in Chandra imaging, suggesting the presence of an AGN with a high black hole accretion rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm BH}=0.22\pm0.03\, {\rm M_\odot yr^{-1}}$. Using multi-wavelength photometry from X-ray to sub-millimeter, including the latest JWST imaging, we confirm that COS-XQG1 is massive ($M_\star = (1.6\pm0.2)\times10^{11}\, M_\odot$) and quiescent (${\rm sSFR}&lt;10^{-10}\, {\rm yr^{-1}}$) as reported previously, even considering the contribution from AGN emission. Noticeably, COS-XQG1 displays a broad H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ emission component with a full width at half maximum of $4365^{+81}_{-81}\, {\rm km\, s^{-1}}$ in its NIRSpec spectrum, which is typical of Type 1 AGNs. The line width and luminosity of the broad H$\alpha$ emission give a black hole mass of $\log{(M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot)} = 8.43\pm0.02\, (\pm 0.5)$. With a stellar velocity dispersion measurement ($\sigma_\star=238\pm32\, {\rm km\, s^{-1}}$), we find that this galaxy is consistent with the local relations in the $M_{\rm BH} - \sigma_\star$ and $M_{\rm BH}- M_\star$ planes, which might suggest that massive quiescent galaxies at $z\geq2$ have already been mature in terms of both stellar and black hole masses and will not evolve significantly. In addition, image 2D-decomposition analysis finds that this galaxy comprises disk and point source components. The latter is likely the composition of an AGN and a stellar bulge. Based on a comparison with numerical simulations, we expect that COS-XQG1 will evolve into a typical quiescent galaxy with lower AGN activity by redshift 0. This study shows the usefulness of X-ray-detected quiescent galaxies in investigating the co-evolution between SMBHs and galaxies in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>CAPOS: The bulge Cluster APOgee Survey VII. First detailed chemical analysis of NGC 6316</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As part of the bulge Cluster APOgee Survey (CAPOS), high-resolution, high Signal-to-Noise Ratio Near-Infrared spectroscopy, we aim to conduct the most robust chemical study to date for NGC 6316, deriving abundances for a number of elements with a variety of nucleosynthetic origins, most of which have never been studied before in this cluster. We use the Brussels Automatic Code for Characterizing High accuracy Spectra (BACCHUS) with atmospheric parameters photometrically obtained in order to determine, for the first time, abundances for C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, P, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni and Ce for this cluster. We obtained a mean metallicity $[Fe/H]=-0.87\pm0.02$, finding no indication of an intrinsic metallicity spread. Our metallicity agrees with the most recent values from other studies, revising earlier values that were $\sim0.5$ dex metal-richer. With this new value, this cluster, long believed to be a member of the classical metal-rich group of bulge GCs around $-0.5$, now falls in the dominant bulge globular cluster peak around $[Fe/H]=-1$. The cluster presents a clear C-N anticorrelation. We also found a $[\alpha/Fe]=0.31\pm0.02$. Our abundances show similar behaviour to other in situ globular clusters with comparable metallicity. An isochrone fitting gave us $E(B-V)=0.71$, a higher value than any other from the literature for this cluster since we also estimated $R_V=2.7$, in good agreement with determinations from other works; $(M-m)_0=15.32\pm0.05$. We derive an overall metallicity $[M/H]=-0.6\pm0.05$, in agreement with our abundance determination.</description>

      <title>Detection of the 2175{\AA} UV Bump at z&gt;7: Evidence for Rapid Dust Evolution in a Merging Reionisation-Era Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dust is a fundamental component of the interstellar medium (ISM) within galaxies, as dust grains are highly efficient absorbers of UV and optical photons. Accurately quantifying this obscuration is crucial for interpreting galaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The extinction curves in the Milky Way (MW) and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) exhibit a strong feature known as the 2175A UV bump, most often attributed to small carbonaceous dust grains. This feature was recently detected in faint galaxies out to z=7.55 suggesting rapid formation channels. Here we report the detection of a strong UV bump in a luminous Lyman-break galaxy at z = 7.11235, GNWY-7379420231, through observations taken as part of the NIRSpec Wide GTO survey. We fit a dust attenuation curve that is consistent with the MW extinction curve within 1{\sigma}, in a galaxy just ~700 Myr after the Big Bang. From the integrated spectrum, we infer a young mass-weighted age (t* ~ 22-59 Myr) for this galaxy, however spatially resolved SED fitting unveils the presence of an older stellar population (t* ~ 252 Myr). Furthermore, morphological analysis provides evidence for a potential merger. The underlying older stellar population suggests the merging system could be pre-enriched, with the dust illuminated by a merger-induced starburst. Moreover, turbulence driven by stellar feedback in this bursty region may be driving PAH formation through top-down shattering. The presence of a UV bump in GNWY-7379420231 solidifies growing evidence for the rapid evolution of dust properties within the first billion years of cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Shaping the Milky Way: The interplay of mergers and cosmic filaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large-scale morphology of Milky Way (MW)-mass dark matter (DM) halos is shaped by two key processes: filamentary accretion from the cosmic web and interactions with massive satellites. Disentangling their contributions is essential for understanding galaxy evolution and constructing accurate mass models of the MW. We analyze the time-dependent structure of MW-mass halos from zoomed cosmological-hydrodynamical simulations by decomposing their mass distribution into spherical harmonic expansions. We find that the dipole ($\ell=1$) and quadrupole ($\ell=2$) moments dominate the gravitational power spectrum, encoding key information about the halo's shape and its interaction with the cosmic environment. While the dipole reflects transient perturbations from infalling satellites and damps on dynamical timescales, the quadrupole -- linked to the halo's triaxiality -- is a persistent feature. We show that the quadrupole's orientation aligns with the largest filaments, imprinting a long-lived memory on the halo's morphology even in its inner regions ($\sim30$ kpc). At the virial radius, the quadrupole distortion can reach 1-2 times the spherical density, highlighting the importance of environment in shaping MW-mass halos. Using multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis, we successfully disentangle the effects of satellite mergers and filamentary accretion on quadrupole. We find that the quadrupolar response induced by LMC-mass satellites has an order of magnitude larger gravitational power than in spherically symmetric MW models. This highlights the need for models that incorporate the MW's asymmetry and time-evolution, with direct consequences for observable structures such as disk warps, the LMC-induced wake, and stellar tracers -- particularly in the era of precision astrometry.</description>

      <title>A PAH deficit in the starburst core of a distant spiral galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present high-resolution and spatially-matched observations with JWST and ALMA of a starburst galaxy (PACS-830) at $z=1.46$. The NIRCam observations mainly trace the stellar light while the CO ($J$=5--4) observations map the dense molecular gas at kpc scales. Both datasets reveal the morphology to be that of a gas/dust rich bulge with two extending arms, together resembling a grand-design spiral galaxy. The more pronounced arm contributes 21 $\pm$ 6\% of the total CO emission. These results demonstrate that starburst activity at high redshift can be triggered, without undergoing a highly disruptive major merger. We assess the strength and distribution of star formation using two tracers: (1) Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) emission detected at $8~\mu$m ($L_8$) with a MIRI/F1800W image, and (2) $L_\mathrm{IR}$, inferred from the CO ($J$=5--4) map. The spatial profiles of the $L_\mathrm{IR}$ and $L_8$ are dissimilar, thus leading to a significant deficit of mid-IR ($L_8$) emission in the nucleus. We hypothesize that this is due to the destruction of PAH molecules by the intense ionizing radiation field or decreased emission in the photodissociation region, as seen in nearby star-forming regions and consistent with the galaxy-wide properties of distant starbursts. This study reveals spatial variations in the $L_8$ to $L_\mathrm{IR}$ ratio for the first time at $z&gt;1$, in agreement with expectations from theory. Our analysis underscores the pivotal role of joint high-resolution observations with JWST and ALMA in discerning the different phases of the interstellar medium (ISM) and revealing internal physics in galaxy substructures.</description>

      <title>A Metal-Free Galaxy at $z = 3.19$? Evidence of Late Population III Star Formation at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Star formation from metal-free gas, the hallmark of the first generation of Population III stars, was long assumed to occur in the very early Universe. We report the discovery of MPG-CR3 (Metal-Pristine Galaxy COSMOS Redshift 3; hereafter CR3), an extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift $z= 3.193\pm0.016$. From JWST, VLT, and Subaru observations, CR3 exhibits exceptionally strong Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, and He I $\lambda$10830 emission. We measure rest-frame equivalent widths of EW$_0$(Ly$\alpha$) $\approx822$ Angstrom and EW$_0$(H$\alpha$) $\approx2814$ Angstrom, among the highest seen in star-forming systems. No metal lines, e.g. [O III] $\lambda\lambda4959,5007$, C IV $\lambda\lambda1548,1550$, have statistically significant detections, placing a 2-$\sigma$ abundance upper limit of 12+log(O/H) &lt; 6.52 ($Z &lt; 8\times10^{-3}\ Z_\odot$). The observed Ly$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ flux ratio is $\approx13.9$, indicating negligible dust attenuation. Spectral energy distribution modeling with Pop III stellar templates indicates a very young ($\sim2$ Myr), low-mass ($M_* \approx 6.1\times 10^5 M_\odot$) stellar population. Further, the photometric redshifts reveal that CR3 could reside in a slightly underdense environment ($\delta \approx -0.12$). CR3 provides evidence that first-generation star formation could persist well after the epoch of reionization, challenging the conventional view that pristine star formation ended by $z\gtrsim6$.</description>

      <title>Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL): Rubin-era photometric redshift stress-testing and at-scale production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Virtually all extragalactic use cases of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) require the use of galaxy redshift information, yet the vast majority of its sample of tens of billions of galaxies will lack high-fidelity spectroscopic measurements thereof, instead relying on photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) subject to systematic imprecision and inaccuracy best encapsulated by photo-$z$ probability density functions (PDFs). We present the version 1 release of Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL), an open source Python library for at-scale probabilistic photo-$z$ estimation, initiated by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) with contributions from the LSST Interdisciplinary Network for Collaboration and Computing (LINCC) Frameworks team. RAIL's three subpackages provide modular tools for end-to-end stress-testing, including a forward modeling suite to generate realistically complex photometry, a unified API for estimating per-galaxy and ensemble redshift PDFs by an extensible set of algorithms, and built-in metrics of both photo-$z$ PDFs and point estimates. RAIL serves as a flexible toolkit enabling the derivation and optimization of photo-$z$ data products at scale for a variety of science goals and is not specific to LSST data. We thus describe to the extragalactic science community, including and beyond Rubin the design and functionality of the RAIL software library so that any researcher may have access to its wide array of photo-$z$ characterization and assessment tools.</description>

      <title>Assessing interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS with the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope</title>

Abstract: Context. Theories of the formation and evolution of small bodies in planetary systems predict that they may escape into interstellar space at any time. After having characterized just two such interlopers -1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) and 2I/Borisov more questions were raised than answered. Assessing the recently discovered interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will only broaden our understanding of this complex topic.
  Aims. Here, we investigate the spectral, cometary, and rotational properties of 3I/ATLAS as well as its dynamical context.
  Methods. We identified the spectral type of 3I/ATLAS from the visible reflectance spectrum and used photometric observations to derive its level of activity and rotational properties. Observational data were obtained with the OSIRIS camera spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope. We used N-body simulations and statistical analyses of Gaia DR3 data to investigate the origin of 3I/ATLAS and its Galactic background.
  Results. Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has a visible spectrum slightly redder than those of D-type asteroids, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, with a spectral slope of 18.3%/1000 A in the 4000-9000 A range, which is similar to those of TNOs and Centaurs. It has a conspicuous coma and its rotation period is 16.79 h. The heliocentric components of its Galactic velocity were (U, V, W) = (-51.233, -19.456, 18.930) km/s with a radiant in Sagittarius. The analysis of a sample of kinematic analogs of 3I/ATLAS extracted from Gaia DR3 suggests that its parent system is part of the Galactic thin disk and includes a solar-like star with slightly sub-solar metallicity.</description>
