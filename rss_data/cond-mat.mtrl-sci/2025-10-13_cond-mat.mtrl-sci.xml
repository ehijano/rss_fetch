      <title>Theory of non-resonant Raman scattering from electrons in nodal and flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raman scattering is emerging as a surprising probe of electron topology in quantum materials. It has been used recently to detect and characterize a topological phase transition that accompanies the magnetic transition in Nd$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$. Here we present a theory of Raman scattering from nodal electrons with Weyl and quadratic band touching spectra, which has to reach beyond the standard effective mass approximation. After reviewing and providing the details of our previous theory development, we discuss several new results. We show that the light-polarization dependence of Raman scattering is universal in the case of Weyl electrons and given by an analytic expression, while it contains symmetry-protected features in the case of quadratic band-touching nodes. We also analyze modifications of the Raman signal due to the ubiquitous tilting of the Weyl spectrum, and argue that universality is lost only in a finite frequency range that springs out of the threshold frequency for untilted nodes. Finally, we explore the frequency dependence of Raman scattering for the case of Dirac electrons coexisting with a flat band in the same region of the first Brillouin zone, which is inspired by the material V$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$.</description>

      <title>Accelerated prediction of dielectric functions in solar cell materials with graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an atomistic line graph neural network (ALIGNN) model for predicting dielectric functions directly from crystal structures. Trained on $\sim$7000 dielectric functions from the JARVIS-DFT database computed with a meta-GGA exchange-correlation functional, the model accurately reproduces spectral features, including peak intensities and overall line shapes, while enabling efficient high-throughput screening. Applied to the recently developed Alexandria materials database, containing over four hundred thousand insulating materials, we uncover a clear elemental trend, with vanadium emerging as a strong indicator of materials with high-spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME). In particular, vanadium-based perovskite materials show a substantially higher fraction of high-SLME compounds compared to the database average, underscoring their promise for optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Work Function Mapping Across a-In2Se3 to {\alpha}-In2Se3 to {\gamma}-InSe in RF-Sputtered Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indium selenide is a phase-change chalcogenide whose polymorphism enables a variety of physical properties to be tuned. Here we directly quantify the evolution of the surface work function across the amorphous-to-crystalline transition in RF-sputtered In2Se3 thin films grown on c-plane Al2O3 (001). By varying deposition temperature (100-500 {\deg}C) and film thickness, we establish processing windows for a- In2Se3, {\alpha}-In2Se3, and {\gamma}-InSe, and correlate structure with electronic and morphological properties. X-ray diffraction shows films deposited at 100 to 200 {\deg}C are amorphous, 300 to 400 {\deg}C yields {\alpha}-In2Se3, whereas 500 {\deg}C yields {\gamma}-InSe. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) maps the surface potential and yields spatially averaged work functions spanning 5.26 to 6.64 eV across the amorphous-crystalline transformation; pronounced intra-film heterogeneity is observed, with select {\alpha}-phase and {\gamma}-InSe grains exhibiting work functions exceeding the local mean. Topographical distinctions are found between phases with hexagonally faceted grains in the crystalline state, whereas homogeneous nano-mounds are found in amorphous films. Analysis of Tauc plots revealed optical bandgaps in the range of 2.50 to 1.55 eV across the observed phases. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements further indicated that the indium to selenium concentration ratio varied between 0.70 {\pm} 0.1 to 1.01 {\pm} 0.1 as the deposition temperature increased from 100 to 500 {\deg}C. These measurements provide direct, spatially resolved quantification of work-function evolution through the phase change, supplying parameters essential for contact engineering and device integration of In2Se3 and InSe.</description>

      <title>Modeling changes in atomic structure around a vacancy with increasing temperature and calculation of temperature dependences of vacancy characteristics in bcc iron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed an original natural thermostat algorithm to simulate the direct change in interatomic distances with temperature in both an ideal crystal and a system with a vacancy. In contrast to previous work, the results indicate that in a system with a defect, the radii of the first ten coordination spheres change nearly linearly with increasing temperature. However, the coefficients determining these dependencies, unlike the interatomic distances farther from the vacancy, are not equal to the linear thermal expansion coefficient of the ideal crystal. The implications of these results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Hidden integer quantum ferroelectricity in chiral Tellurium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectricity is a cornerstone of functional materials research, enabling diverse technologies from non-volatile memory to optoelectronics. Recently, type-I integer quantum ferroelectricity (IQFE), unconstrained by symmetry, has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated; however, as it arises from ionic displacements of an integer lattice vector, the initial and final states are macroscopically indistinguishable, rendering the physical properties unchanged. Here, we propose for the first time the nontrivial counterpart (i.e., type-II IQFE) where the polarization difference between the initial and final states is quantized but the macroscopical properties differ. We further demonstrate the existence of type-II IQFE in bulk chiral tellurium. In few-layer tellurium, the total polarization remains nearly quantized, composed of a bulk-inherited quantum component and a small surface-induced contribution. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal surface-initiated, layer-by-layer switching driven by reduced energy barriers, explaining why ferroelectricity was observed experimentally in few-layer tellurium, but not in bulk tellurium yet. Interestingly, the chirality of the initial and final states in bulk tellurium is opposite, suggesting a novel way to control structural chirality with electric field in chiral photonics and nonvolatile ferroelectric memory devices.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Screening of Transition Metal-Based 2D Multilayer Kagome Materials via the "1 + 3" Design Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) kagome materials have drawn extensive research interest due to their unique electronic properties, like flat bands, magnetic frustration, and topological quantum states, which enable precise quantum state control and novel device innovation. Yet, simultaneously achieving high stability, tunability, and multifunctionality in 2D kagome systems remains a key material design challenge. In this study, we innovatively propose a new paradigm for constructing two-dimensional multi-kagome-layer materials based on the "1+3" design concept. By seamlessly integrating high-throughput screening techniques, we have successfully identified 6,379 novel 2D multilayer kagome candidates from a vast pool of candidates. These materials exhibit a rich diversity of types, encompassing 173 metals, 27 semimetals, 166 ferromagnetic semiconductors, and as many as 6,013 semiconductors. Furthermore, based on the 2D flat-band scoring criteria, we conducted a detailed analysis of the flat-band characteristics of the energy bands near the Fermi level in the predicted systems. Our findings reveal that approximately two-thirds of the systems meet the 2D flat-band scoring criteria, and notably, several systems exhibit nearly perfect flat-band characteristics. Our work provides an excellent paradigm for the design and research of 2D multilayer kagome materials</description>

      <title>X-ray imaging of antiferromagnetic octupole domains in Mn$_3$Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel antiferromagnets with broken time reversal symmetry (TRS) have launched a new direction in spintronics research, combining the advantageous dynamical properties of conventional antiferromagnets with the controllability typically associated with ferromagnets. However, antiferromagnetic domains are notoriously challenging to image in real-space. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) offers a route to overcome this difficulty: XMCD contrast may be finite in TRS-breaking antiferromagnets with an appropriate magnetic space group. Here, we exploit this to image the octupole domains in a focused ion beam-fabricated device of the non-collinear antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn. Using scanning transmission x-ray microscopy, we spatially resolve the weak pre-edge XMCD contrast (of 0.2%) that is sensitive to $T_z$, achieving a contrast resolution better than 0.02%. We observe hysteretic switching of the octupole order through both the XMCD contrast and the corresponding anomalous Hall effect within the same device. These results confirm the bulk nature of this contrast, and establish XMCD-based microscopy as a powerful real space imaging method for TRS-breaking antiferromagnets, including altermagnets, enabling future studies of their dynamics, switching, and symmetry-tunable phenomena.</description>

      <title>Atomistic origin of low thermal conductivity in quaternary chalcogenides Cu(Cd, Zn)$_2$InTe$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystalline semiconductors with intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity ($\mathcal{K}$) are vital for device applications such as barrier coatings and thermoelectrics. Quaternary chalcogenide semiconductors such as CuCd$_2$InTe$_4$ and CuZn$_2$InTe$_4$ are experimentally shown to exhibit low $\mathcal{K}$, yet its microscopic origin remains poorly understood. Here, we analyse their thermal transport mechanisms using a unified first-principles framework that captures both the Peierls (particle-like propagation, $\mathcal{K}_P$) and coherence (wave-like tunneling, $\mathcal{K}_C$) mechanisms of phonon transport. We show that extended antibonding states below the Fermi level lead to enhanced phonon anharmonicity and strong scattering of heat-carrying phonon modes, suppressing $\mathcal{K}$ in these chalcogenides. We show that $\mathcal{K}_P$ dominates the total thermal conductivity, while $\mathcal{K}_C$ remains negligible even under strong anharmonicity of the phonon modes. The heavier Cd ions in CuCd$_2$InTe$_4$ induce greater acoustic-optical phonon overlap and scattering compared to CuZn$_2$InTe$_4$, further lowering thermal conductivity of the former. Additionally, grain boundary scattering in realistic samples contributes to further suppression of thermal transport. Our findings establish the atomistic origins of low $\mathcal{K}$ in quaternary chalcogenides and offer guiding principles for designing low-thermal-conductivity semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle effects and strong excitonic features in exfoliable 1D semiconducting materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive first-principles study of the electronic and optical properties of recently identified exfoliable one-dimensional semiconducting materials, focusing on chalcogenide-based atomic chains derived from van der Waals-bonded bulk crystals. Specifically, we investigate covalently bonded S3 and Te3 chains, and polar-bonded As2S3 and Bi2Te3 chains, using a fully first-principles approach that combines density-functional theory (DFT), density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and many-body perturbation theory within the GW approximation and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). Our vibrational analysis shows that freestanding isolated wires remain dynamically stable, with the zone-center optical phonon modes leading to infrared activity. The main finding of this study is the presence of very strong exciton binding energies (1-3 eV), which make these novel 1D materials ideal platforms for room-temperature excitonic applications. Interestingly, the exciton character remains Wannier-Mott-like, as indicated by average electron-hole separations larger than the lattice constant. Notably, the optical gaps of these materials span a wide range - from infrared (0.8 eV, Bi2Te3), through visible spectrum (yellow: 2.17 eV, Te3; blue: 2.71 eV, As2S3), up to ultraviolet (4.07 eV, S3) - highlighting their versatility for broadband optoelectronic applications. Our results offer a detailed, many-body perspective on the optoelectronic behavior of these low-dimensional materials and underscore their potential for applications in next-generation nanoscale optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$(001) surface reconstructions from first principles and experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of reconstructions on $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$(001) combining first-principles calculations with experimental observations. Using {\it ab initio} atomistic thermodynamics and replica-exchange grand-canonical molecular dynamics simulations, we explore the configurational space of possible reconstructions under varying chemical potentials of oxygen and gallium. Our calculations reveal several stable surface reconstructions, most notably a previously unreported 1$\times$2 reconstruction consisting of paired GaO$_4$ tetrahedra that exhibits remarkable stability across a wide range of experimental growth conditions. In this reconstruction, two Ga atoms share one oxygen bond and are separated by a distance of \SI{2.64}{\angstrom} along the [010] direction. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging of homoepitaxially grown (001) layers is consistent with the predicted structure. Additional investigations of possible indium substitution at the surface sites, which can occur during metal-exchange catalysis growth, reveal a cooperative effect in In incorporation, with distinct stability regions for In-substituted structures under O-rich conditions. Our findings provide an understanding for controlling surface properties during epitaxial growth of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$(001).</description>

      <title>Strained Donor-Bound Excitons in $^{28}$Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive experimental study of the neutral donor to donor-bound exciton transition (D$^0$$\rightarrow\,$D$^0$X) in isotopically enriched $^{28}$Si, focusing on the group-V donors P, As, and Sb under finely tuned uniaxial stress along the [100] and [110] crystal axes and magnetic fields from 3.5 mT to 1.7 T. From these measurements, donor-specific deformation potentials are extracted. The uniaxial electron deformation potential $\Xi_\mathrm{u}$ is found to be significantly larger than values reported for other states or transitions in silicon and shows a clear dependence on the donor species, indicating an increased sensitivity of the D$^0$X state to strain and central-cell effects. We also observe a magnetic field dependence of the hole shear deformation potential $d$, suggesting a more complex strain coupling mechanism than captured by standard theory. Diamagnetic shift parameters determined from Zeeman spectra show good agreement with earlier measurements. Our results provide a refined parameter set critical for the design of silicon quantum devices based on D$^0$X transitions.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature magnetic semiconductor with superhigh hole mobility and ferrotoroidicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and fabrication of room-temperature magnetic semiconductors are recognized worldwide as a great challenge, and of both theoretical and practical importance in the field of spintronics. Compared with diluted magnetic semiconductors, intrinsic room-temperature magnetic semiconductors have rarely been developed. Reported herein is a magnetic semiconductor film formed by supramolecular self-assembly based on uranyl and cyclodextrin, with the Curie temperature above room temperature. The electrical measurements show that the film exhibits typical p-type semiconductor characteristics with a superhigh carrier mobility of 3200 cm2V-1s-1, which can help achieve an excellent match with the n-type semiconductor. The room-temperature magnetic semiconductor with superhigh hole mobility can be attributed to the formation of ferrotoroidicity and the highly ordered transport channel. This work paves the way for the application of ferrotoroidic materials in sensing, information storage as well as flexible electronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum magnonics studies the quantum properties of magnons, the quanta of spin waves, and their application in quantum information processing. Progress in this field depends on identifying magnetic materials with characteristics tailored to the diverse requirements of magnonics and quantum magnonics. For single-magnon excitation, its control, hybrid coupling, and entanglement, the most critical property is the ability to support long magnon lifetimes. This perspective reviews established and emerging magnetic materials, including ferromagnetic metals, Heusler compounds, antiferromagnets, altermagnets, organic and 2D van der Waals magnets, hexaferrites, and in particular yttrium iron garnet (YIG), highlighting their key characteristics. YIG remains the benchmark, with bulk crystals supporting sub-microsecond Kittel-mode lifetimes and ultra-pure spheres achieving $\sim18\,\mu$s for dipolar-exchange magnons at millikelvin temperatures. However, thin YIG films on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates suffer from severe lifetime reduction due to substrate-induced losses. In contrast, YIG films on a new lattice matched, diamagnetic alternative, yttrium scandium gallium/aluminum garnet (YSGAG), overcomes these limitations and preserves low magnetic damping down to millikelvin temperatures. These advances provide a practical pathway toward ultralong-living magnons in thin films, enabling scalable quantum magnonics with coherent transport, strong magnon-photon, magnon-qubit coupling, and integrated quantum networks.</description>

Abstract: High-entropy oxides (HEOs) offer a unique platform for exploring the thermodynamic interaction between configurational entropy and enthalpy in stabilizing complex solid solutions. In this study, a series of rock-salt structured oxides with varying configurational entropy, ranging from binary to multi-cation systems, to elucidate the competing roles of enthalpy and entropy in phase stabilization is investigated. Compositions including (Ni$_{0.8}$Cu$_{0.2}$)O to(NiCuZnCoMg)$_{0.9}$A$_{0.1}$O (A = Li, Na, K) were synthesized and their stuctural, microstructural and thermal properties have been discussed. X-ray diffraction combined with thermal cycling confirms that even a medium configurational entropy ($\sim$ 0.95R) can induce single-phase behavior stabilized by configurational entropy ($\Delta S_{conf}$), challenging the traditional threshold of $1.5\,R$. High-resolution TEM and EDS mapping reveal nanocrytalline features and homogeneous elemental distribution respectively, while XPS analysis confirms divalent oxidation states. A strong coupling between high configurational entropy with thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) has been observed. First, a sharp decrease in $\kappa$ with increasing $\Delta S_{conf}$ is seen and then decomposed samples (while cooling) show high $\kappa$, demonstrating the role of $\Delta S_{conf}$ on $\kappa$. Furthermore, Li-doped compositions exhibit improved thermoelectric performance, with a maximum figure of merit ($zT$) of $\sim$0.15 at 1173K\, driven by low thermal conductivity and favorable carrier transport. The results highlight that configurational entropy, even at intermediate values, plays a significant role in stabilizing disordered single-phase oxides and tailoring phonon transport.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Assisted Separation of Weakly Magnetic Metal Ions in Porous Media.Part 1: Experiments</title>

Abstract: We report experiments on the magnetophoresis of paramagnetic (MnCl2) and diamagnetic (ZnCl2) metal ions in porous media under the influence of a non-uniform magnetic field generated by a permanent magnet. Experiments were carried out in a range of initial ion concentrations (1-100 mM), porous media particle sizes (63 um and 500 um), and varying mixture ratios of metal ion concentrations. For single-ion magnetophoresis, paramagnetic MnCl2 migrated toward the magnet surface, with an enrichment of approximately 2-4 percent near regions of high magnetic field. Conversely, diamagnetic ZnCl2 moved away from regions of highest magnetic field gradients, with depletion levels of 0.5-1.8 percent relative to the initial concentration. Our results demonstrate that magnetophoresis is directly proportional to porous media particle size, increasing with larger particle sizes, a trend attributed to the reduced drag forces experienced by the ions in media with larger particles. Interestingly, in binary mixtures, both MnCl2 and ZnCl2 migrated toward regions of highest magnetic field, contrary to their individual behaviors. The magnetophoretic effect of MnCl2 was diminished with increasing concentrations of ZnCl2, indicating interactions between the two ions. These findings suggest that both metal ions undergo field-induced cluster formation, with cluster sizes in the micrometer range, in both single and binary ion systems. In binary mixtures, the two ions appear to interact, potentially forming mixed clusters containing both MnCl2 and ZnCl2.</description>

      <title>Are diffusion models ready for materials discovery in unexplored chemical space?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While diffusion models are attracting increasing attention for the design of novel materials, their ability to generate low-energy structures in unexplored chemical spaces has not been systematically assessed. Here, we evaluate the performance of two diffusion models, MatterGen and DiffCSP, against three databases: a ternary oxide set (constructed by a genetic algorithm), a ternary nitride set (constructed by template informatics), and the GNoME database (constructed by a combination of both). We find that diffusion models generally perform stably in well-sampled chemical spaces (oxides and nitrides), but are less effective in uncommon ones (GNoME), which contains many compositions involving rare-earth elements and unconventional stoichiometry. Finally, we assess their size-extrapolation capability and observe a significant drop in performance when the number of atoms exceeds the trained range. This is attributed to the limitations imposed by periodic boundary conditions, which we refer to as the curse of periodicity. This study paves the way for future developments in materials design by highlighting both the strength and the limitations of diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Deep prior-based denoising for state-of-the-art scientific imaging and metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision, yet a major gap persists between complex, data-hungry deep learning models and the practical demands of state-of-the-art scientific measurements. To fundamentally bridge this gap, we propose deep prior-based denoising, a robust deep learning model that requires no training data. We demonstrate its effectiveness by removing grid artifacts in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), a long-standing and critical data analysis challenge in materials science. Our results demonstrate that deep prior-based denoising yields clearer ARPES images in a fraction of the time required by conventional, experiment-based denoising methods. This ultra-efficient approach to ARPES will enable high-speed, high-resolution three-dimensional band structure mapping in momentum space, thereby dramatically accelerating our understanding of microscopic electronic structures of materials. Beyond ARPES, deep prior-based denoising represents a versatile tool that could become a new standard in any advanced scientific measurement fields where data acquisition is limited.</description>

      <title>Room temperature optical control of spin states in organic diradicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a family of luminescent alternant diradicals which, at room temperature, support a ground-state spin-triplet, near-unity photoluminescence quantum yields, and optical spin addressability. These diradicals comprise trityl groups meta-linked via pyridyl or phenyl groups, enabling optically bright triplet-to-triplet and singlet-to-singlet transitions. At room temperature, we observe optically detected magnetic resonance in these systems at zero magnetic field and a strong magneto-photoluminescence (10% modulation at 2 mT applied magnetic field). Distinct photoluminescence bands (at 630 nm and 700 nm) show opposite-sign spin-optical responses, arising from spin-selective intersystem crossing between triplet and singlet manifolds. These bright, all-organic diradicals offer a new set of chemically tunable materials for room temperature spin-optical interfaces, paving the way for application as quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Optically induced orbital polarization in bulk germanium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical orientation has been proven as a powerful tool to inject spin-polarized electron and hole populations in III-V and group-IV semiconductors. In particular, the absorption of circularly-polarized light in bulk Ge generates a spin-oriented population of electrons in the conduction band with a spin-polarization up to 50%, whereas the hole spin-polarization, opposite to the electron one, can even reach values up to 83%. In this letter, we theoretically investigate the optical injection of orbital polarization by means of circularly-polarized light in bulk Ge and we show that the latter considerably exceeds 100% for holes and photon energies close to the direct Ge gap. These results suggest that Ge is a convenient platform for future development of orbitronics and opto-orbitronic devices.</description>

      <title>Insights into the OER, ORR, and HER Activity of a New MXene-Family SnSiGeN4 Photocatalyst for Water Splitting: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of efficient and cost-effective catalysts for clean energy conversion remains a central challenge in materials science. Although platinum serves as the benchmark catalyst, its scarcity and high cost hinder large-scale deployment. In this study, we propose a newly predicted SnSiGeN4 MXene-family monolayer as a promising candidate for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigated its electronic, vibrational, and optical properties across multiple exchange-correlation functionals, including hybrid approaches, revealing a wide and tunable band gap. Simulated infrared and Raman spectra further confirm the dynamical stability and the presence of catalytically active sites. Guided by these findings, we studied photocatalytic reaction analyses that demonstrate that the computed overpotentials for OER, ORR, and HER are comparable to those of Pt-based catalysts and outperform Ir-based systems, positioning SnSiGeN4 as a sustainable, high-performance platform for next-generation UV-visible-light-driven photocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Orientational Order of Phenyl Rotors on Triangular Platforms on Ag and Au(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated trioxatriangulenium functionalized with phenyl (phenyl-TOTA) on the (111) surfaces of Ag and Au using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT). On Ag(111), the molecules form hexagonal arrays, and on Au(111), honeycomb patterns are also observed. The orientations of the phenyl moieties are resolved on both substrates. On Ag(111), the orientations are parallel within a row and they differ by approximately $60^\circ$ between adjacent molecular rows, and STM images suggest dimerization of the molecules. DFT calculations for Ag(111) reveal that van der Waals interactions dominate this system. The optimized structure matches the experimental pattern, and the simulated STM images exhibit apparent dimerization. This dimerization results from an asymmetry of the phenyl wavefunction, which reflects intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the ligand and an oxygen atom within the triangulenium platform. The orientation of the phenyl moieties is explained by the interaction of each phenyl moiety with its triangulenium platform combined with the direct long-range interaction between phenyl moieties across molecules.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study on photocatalytic properties of PtSSe-WXY Janus heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor photocatalysis offers a sustainable route for converting solar energy into chemical energy, enabling the production of clean fuels and valuable chemical products. To this aim, we explore van der Waals heterostructures made up of Janus PtSSe and WXY (X, Y $=$ S, Se, Te and X $\neq$Y), in the context of photocatalytic applications. The redox capabilities of various heterostructure configurations (atom facing types and stacking orders) are evaluated by aligning the absolute band edge positions with respect to redox potentials of hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER) and CO$_2$ reduction reactions. The stability of photocatalyst candidates are checked by layer binding energy calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The optical absorption spectra suggest good light absorption in the visible range. Further, strain engineering is applied as a way to tune band edges and evaluate the possible use of the heterostructures as photocatalysts. This study shows that van der Waals heterostructure bilayers composed of Janus PtSSe and WSeTe in specific geometric configurations can be potential materials as photocatalysts for HER, OER and CO$_2$ reduction reactions. Finally, we suggest that, although systems made up of PtSSe and WSTe cannot be used for photocatalytic applications, they can be explored for applications in thermoelectric energy conversion or infrared photovoltaics.</description>

      <title>Interlaced dynamic XCT reconstruction with spatio-temporal implicit neural representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the use of spatio-temporalImplicit Neural Representations (INRs) for dynamic X-ray computed tomography (XCT) reconstruction under interlaced acquisition schemes. The proposed approach combines ADMM-based optimization with INCODE, a conditioning framework incorporating prior knowledge, to enable efficient convergence. We evaluate our method under diverse acquisition scenarios, varying the severity of global undersampling, spatial complexity (quantified via spatial information), and noise levels. Across all settings, our model achieves strong performance and outperforms Time-Interlaced Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (TIMBIR), a state-of-the-art model-based iterative method. In particular, we show that the inductive bias of the INR provides good robustness to moderate noise levels, and that introducing explicit noise modeling through a weighted least squares data fidelity term significantly improves performance in more challenging regimes. The final part of this work explores extensions toward a practical reconstruction framework. We demonstrate the modularity of our approach by explicitly modeling detector non-idealities, incorporating ring artifact correction directly within the reconstruction process. Additionally, we present a proof-of-concept 4D volumetric reconstruction by jointly optimizing over batched axial slices, an approach which opens up the possibilities for massive parallelization, a critical feature for processing large-scale datasets.</description>

      <title>Collective Variables Based on Multipole Expansion of Ewald Summation for Crystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystallization, a fundamental phase transition process governing material formation in natural and industrial contexts, involves the spontaneous emergence of long-range structural order from disordered phases. This long-range periodicity involves spatial and molecular orientation order. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of crystallization require collective variables (CVs) that accurately distinguish this long-\range periodicity. Existing CVs based on local descriptors (e.g., bond-orientational order) often lack transferability across crystal structures. To address this, we propose a unified CV framework derived from the multipole expansion of Ewald summation: a mathematical formalism bridging X-ray diffraction (XRD) principles and electrostatic energy computation in MD. By projecting atomic configurations onto a basis of spherical harmonics (complete for angular function representation), our CV achieves high-fidelity encoding of both translational and orientational order. Metadynamics simulations demonstrate that this CV drives efficient sampling of polymorphic pathways for known crystals and predicts stable phases even without crystal structures. This approach shows potential as a transferable platform for ab initio crystal structure prediction.</description>

      <title>Influence of an external static magnetic field on prebreakdown electron emission and heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High magnetic fields can increase the occurrence of vacuum arcing, suggesting that both electric and magnetic fields can play a role in the vacuum arcing process. The mechanism of vacuum arcing in high magnetic fields is believed to involve both the cathode and the anode, with the cathode serving as the originator of field-emitting nanoprotrusions or tips, while the anode serves a secondary role. Significant heating of the anode surface can be achieved by magnetic focusing of the emitted electron beam, leading to increased heat flux due to greater current density. We simulated the emitted electron beam in different configurations of the electric and magnetic fields using the particle-in-cell (PIC) and finite element methods (FEM). The heating caused by the impacting electron beam was simulated for magnetic fields ranging from 0 T to 30 T. The directions of the electric and magnetic fields were found to play a major role in the focusing of the electron beam. We found that a sufficient temperature increase on the anode surface for evaporation can be reached at magnetic fields on the order of 10-30 T, suggesting the possibility of plasma initiation on the anode side.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism and Superconductivity: A Short Historical Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores the deep interconnections among three seemingly unrelated concepts in condensed matter physics: electronic liquid crystal phases, multipole expansions, and altermagnetism. At the heart of these phenomena lies a shared foundation: spin-momentum locking in the nonrelativistic regime. Originally proposed in the context of electronic liquid crystal phases, spin-momentum locking was later elegantly incorporated into the formalism of multipole expansions. This framework can be further extended across multiple atomic sites, making it particularly effective for describing altermagnets, which feature localized magnetic moments distributed over at least two sublattices. In the second part of the article, we examine superconducting phenomena that stem from this shared mechanism, focusing on superconductivity in systems with spin-momentum locked Fermi surfaces. We highlight a rich variety of unconventional superconducting states, including finite-momentum pairing, $d$-wave and spin-triplet superconductivity, and topological Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, among others. Additional related topics are addressed in the concluding section. Overall, this work offers both an accessible introduction to the newly identified magnetic order known as altermagnetism and a conceptual guide for researchers aiming to harness the ensuing unconventional superconductivity in the development of future quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a rich anisotropic magnetic phase diagram of Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$, a previously proposed cobaltate Kitaev candidate, based on field- and temperature-dependent magnetization, specific heat, and magnetocaloric effect studies. At low temperatures, our experiments uncover a low-lying $j_{\textrm{eff}} = \frac{1}{2}$ state with an antiferromagnetic ground state and pronounced in-plane versus out-of-plane anisotropy. The experimentally identified magnetic phases are theoretically characterized through classical Monte Carlo simulations within an extended Kitaev-Heisenberg model with additional ring exchange interactions. The resulting phase diagram reveals a variety of exotic field-induced magnetic phases, including double-$\textbf{q}$, $\frac{1}{3}$-AFM, zigzag, and vortex phases.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Bethe-Salpeter Equation for Open Systems: Emergence of Exceptional Points in Excitonic Spectra from First Principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In open quantum systems hosting excitons, dissipation mechanisms critically shape the excitonic dynamics, band-structure and topological properties. A microscopic understanding of excitons in such non-Hermitian settings demands a first-principles generalization of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). Building on a recently introduced nonequilibrium Green's function formalism compatible with Lindbladian dynamics, we derive a non-Hermitian BSE from diagrammatic perturbation theory on the Keldysh contour, and obtain a microscopic excitonic Hamiltonian that incorporates dissipation while preserving causality. We apply the formalism to valley excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides coupled to structured photon baths. We uncover a rich landscape of exceptional points in momentum space, forming either discrete sets or continuous manifolds, depending on bath structure. The exceptional points give rise to nonanalytic valley-polarization, unusual polarization pattern in photoluminescence, and nontrivial topological signatures. Our results establish a first-principles framework for predicting and controlling excitonic behavior in open quantum materials, showing how engineered environments can be leveraged to induce and manipulate non-Hermitian and topological properties.</description>

      <title>Understanding How Synthetic Impurities Affect Glyphosate Solubility and Crystal Growth Using Free Energy Calculations and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glyphosate, the most widely used herbicide worldwide, crystallizes through complex intermolecular interactions that are strongly influenced by synthesis-derived impurities. Understanding this process at the molecular scale is critical for optimizing production, ensuring product quality, and assessing environmental impact. Here, we employ direct coexistence molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations to elucidate how glycine-a prevalent synthesis byproduct-modulates glyphosate solubility and crystal growth in aqueous solutions. Our simulations identify two major mechanisms by which glycine hinders crystallization. First, direct coexistence simulations show that glycine preferentially adsorbs at crystal surfaces, hindering glyphosate attachment and slowing growth. Second, free energy calculations demonstrate that glycine enhances glyphosate solubility, reducing the supersaturation driving force to incorporate into the crystal phase. Experimental measurements corroborate our predictions, confirming both enhanced solubility and reduced crystallization kinetics in glycine-bearing systems. These findings establish that glycine-typically considered an inert impurity-actively disrupts glyphosate crystallization by promoting its dissolution. More broadly, this integrated computational-experimental approach highlights the power of molecular simulations to disentangle impurity effects, interfacial phenomena, and solution thermodynamics in crystallization, providing molecular-level insights for optimizing industrial protocols and predicting agrochemical behavior under relevant environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Advances in momentum-resolved EELS of phonons, excitons and plasmons in 2D materials and their heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional nanomaterials, including 2D materials and their heterostructures are expected to impact fields ranging from catalysis, optoelectronics to nanophotonics. To realize their potential, novel experimental approaches need to be developed to characterize the combined materials and their components. Techniques using fast electrons, such as electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), probe phenomena over an unrivaled energy range with high resolution. In addition, momentum-resolved EELS simultaneously records energy and momentum transfer to the sample and thus generates two-dimensional data sets for each beam position. This allows excitations that occur at large momentum transfer to be resolved, including those outside of the light cone and beyond the first Brillouin zone, all whilst retaining nanometer sized spatial selectivity. Such capabilities are particularly important when probing phonons, plasmons, excitons and their coupling in 2D materials and their heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Is Platinum a Proton Blocking Catalyst?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Platinum, to date, is the most widely applied electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media. It is assumed to be a proton-blocking catalyst with only surface-limited adsorption of the reaction intermediates. Here, we critically evaluate the bulk interaction of Pt with hydrogen (H), and its heavier isotope deuterium (D), by monitoring operando mass change of the Pt electrode during galvanostatic heavy/water splitting by employing an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance. Unexpectedly, we observe an irreversible temporal mass gain and a change in the reaction's overpotential, arising from diffusion of H/D into Pt, confirmed by atom probe tomography and thermal desorption spectroscopy. Sub-surface concentration of at least ca. 15 at. % of D in Pt was observed, diffusing down to a depth of more than 10 nm. Analytical description quantified the diffusion coefficient of D in Pt to be 3.2X10^-18 cm2Xs-1. These findings challenge the existing credence of Pt-proton interaction being limited to the surface, prompting the expansion of the catalyst design strategies to account for property-modifying bulk diffusion of H/D in the Pt matrix</description>

      <title>Mapping the moir\'e potential in multi-layer rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rhombohedral graphene (rG) aligned with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been shown to host flat bands that stabilize various strongly correlated quantum phases, including Mott insulators, integer, and fractional quantum anomalous Hall phases. In this work, we use scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) to visualize the dispersion of flat bands with doping and applied displacement fields in a hBN-aligned rhombohedral trilayer graphene (rtG)/hBN moir\'e superlattice. In addition to the intrinsic flat bands of rtG induced by the displacement field, we observe low-energy features originating from moir\'e potential-induced band folding. Real-space variations of the spectroscopic features allow us to quantify the spatial structure of the moir\'e potential at the rtG/hBN interface. Importantly, we find that accurately capturing the moir\'e site-dependent spectra requires incorporating a moir\'e potential acting on the top graphene layer with a sign opposite to that of the bottom layer into the continuum model. Our results thus provide key experimental and theoretical insights into understanding the role of the moire superlattice in rG/hBN heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Defects in 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Terahertz Technologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Substitutional transition metal (TM) point defects have recently been controllably introduced in two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides. We identify quantum defect candidates through a first-principles materials discovery approach with 25 TM elements substituting Mo and W in 2D MoS2 and WSe2, respectively. We elucidate trends in the charge transition levels for these 50 systems and report the existence of defects with spin-triplet ground states and a zero-field splitting (ZFS) in the terahertz (THz) regime, in contrast to typical gigahertz values. These defects can couple to resonant near-infrared radiation, providing a route to applications as high-fidelity qubits controlled by spin-dependent optical transitions. The THz ZFS implies that these high-fidelity operations can take place at higher temperatures compared to the case for GHz qubits. Our results also point toward the possibility of realising a single-photon THz emitter. This work broadens the scope of quantum defects, highlighting the opportunities for next generation THz quantum technologies - an area of growing interest given the rapid advancement in the development of THz sources and detectors.</description>

      <title>Nonmonotonic temperature behavior of magnetization and related functional properties in ordering Fe-rich Fe-Al alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12486v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of alloys that undergo to chemical order-disorder transformations depend heavily on the degree of ordering in the crystal lattice. In particular, the ordering in a magnetic alloy like Fe-rich (x&gt;0.5) Fe_xAl_1-x, for example, leads typically to reducing its magnetization and even to a transition from the ferromagnetic (FM) to paramagnetic (PM) state at x&lt;0.7. Our study was focused on the kinetics of ordering in thin Fe_xAl_1-x films of a nonstoichiometric composition (0.5&lt;x&lt;0.7). We demonstrate that, when the alloy is aged at a sufficiently high temperature, the formation of a chemically ordered structure is accompanied by an increase in magnetization and related functional properties, such as the anomalous Hall (AH) resistivity. We believe that these properties improve owing to the segregation of Fe and its precipitation outside the growing nuclei of the ordered B2-Fe_0.5Al_0.5 phase. The driving force for the Fe segregation we observe is associated with the squeezing out of excess Fe into the surrounding matrix by growing B2 nuclei. Simulations of the B2 nucleation process, performed using the molecular dynamics method, confirm our experimental findings. The results we report contrast to previous studies, which assumed that the growth of the B2 phase in alloys such as Fe_xAl_1-x (0.5&lt;x&lt;0.7) occurred through the mechanism of continuous ordering.</description>

      <title>Effect of the Lattice-distortion on the Electronic Structure, Magnetic Anisotropy, and Hall Conductivities of the CoFeCrGa Spin Gapless Semiconductor: A First-Principles Study</title>

Abstract: Spin gapless semiconductors (SGSs), novel quantum materials, are notable for their tunable spin-transport properties. Considering that the SGS materials might have an invariably deformed lattice upon integration into devices, and given that the SGS nature is highly sensitive to external factors, the impact of lattice distortions on the different physical properties of CoFeCrGa SGS alloy has been investigated using density functional theory calculations. For lattice distortions, the uniform strain corresponding to $-6\% \leq \Delta V / V_0 \leq 6\% \quad (a: 5.60\text{-}5.83~\text\r{A})$, and the tetragonal distortion corresponding to $0.8 \leq c/a \leq 1.2 \quad (a: 5.38\text{-}6.16~\text\r{A},~c: 4.92\text{-}6.45~\text\r{A})$ are modelled. All uniformly strained CoFeCrGa structures are found to display SGS character, magnetic isotropy, small anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC), and small spin Hall conductivity (SHC) - closely resembling those of the ideal CoFeCrGa structure. In contrast, the tetragonally deformed structures display nearly half-metallic behavior with very high spin polarization, very large magnetic anisotropy ($ \sim 10^6~\mathrm{J/m^3}$), and very large AHC ranging from ($ -215 \text{ to } 250~\mathrm{S/cm} $) depending on the axial ratio of the distorted structure. The SHC, however, does not change significantly under tetragonal distortion and remains nearly of the same order as that of the Y-I ordered structure. In summary, these findings demonstrate that CoFeCrGa displays favorable spintronic properties even under lattice distortions, underscoring its potential for next-generation spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>WyckoffDiff -- A Generative Diffusion Model for Crystal Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06485v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystalline materials often exhibit a high level of symmetry. However, most generative models do not account for symmetry, but rather model each atom without any constraints on its position or element. We propose a generative model, Wyckoff Diffusion (WyckoffDiff), which generates symmetry-based descriptions of crystals. This is enabled by considering a crystal structure representation that encodes all symmetry, and we design a novel neural network architecture which enables using this representation inside a discrete generative model framework. In addition to respecting symmetry by construction, the discrete nature of our model enables fast generation. We additionally present a new metric, Fr\'echet Wrenformer Distance, which captures the symmetry aspects of the materials generated, and we benchmark WyckoffDiff against recently proposed generative models for crystal generation. As a proof-of-concept study, we use WyckoffDiff to find new materials below the convex hull of thermodynamical stability.</description>

      <title>A Unified Predictive and Generative Solution for Liquid Electrolyte Formulation</title>

Abstract: Liquid electrolytes are critical components of next-generation energy storage systems, enabling fast ion transport, minimizing interfacial resistance, and ensuring electrochemical stability for long-term battery performance. However, measuring electrolyte properties and designing formulations remain experimentally and computationally expensive. In this work, we present a unified framework for designing liquid electrolyte formulation, integrating a forward predictive model with an inverse generative approach. Leveraging both computational and experimental data collected from literature and extensive molecular simulations, we train a predictive model capable of accurately estimating electrolyte properties from ionic conductivity to solvation structure. Our physics-informed architecture preserves permutation invariance and incorporates empirical dependencies on temperature and salt concentration, making it broadly applicable to property prediction tasks across molecular mixtures. Furthermore, we introduce -- to the best of our knowledge -- the first generative machine learning framework for molecular mixture design, demonstrated on electrolyte systems. This framework supports multi-condition-constrained generation, addressing the inherently multi-objective nature of materials design. As a proof of concept, we experimentally identified three liquid electrolytes with both high ionic conductivity and anion-concentrated solvation structure. This unified framework advances data-driven electrolyte design and can be readily extended to other complex chemical systems beyond electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative macroscopic theory of interfaces with discontinuous dielectric constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15580v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discontinuity of dielectric constants at the interface is a common feature of all nanostructures and semiconductor heterostructures. Near such interfaces, a charged particle creates a singular self-interaction potential which may be attributed to interaction with fictitious mirror charges. The singularity of this interaction at the interface presents an obstruction to a perturbative approach. In several limiting cases, this problem can be avoided by zeroing out the carrier wave function at the interface. In this paper, we have developed a non-perturbative theory which gives a self-consistent description of carrier propagation through an interface with a dielectric discontinuity. It is based on conservation of the current density propagating through the interface, and it is formulated in terms of general boundary conditions (GBC) for the wave function at the interface with a single phenomenological parameter W. For these GBC, we find exact solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation near the interface and the carrier energy spectrum including resonances. Using these results, we describe the photo effect at the semiconductor/vacuum interface and the energy spectrum of quantum wells (QWs) at the interface with the vacuum or a high-k dielectric. For a surface of liquid helium, we estimate the parameter W, and match the resulting electron spectrum with the existing experimental data and theoretical analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17536v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of the phonon triplet in the region of OH-stretching modes in hydrogen-bonded materials is often explained by the interplay of OH-stretching modes and combinations and overtones of OH-bending modes. In order to elucidate the both contributions in KH$_2$PO$_4$ (KDP), we compare the pressure dependence of the OH-bending and stretching modes from ab initio calculation and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements. The ab initio calculation predicts a hardening of OH-bending modes and a softening of OH-stretching modes with pressure. At the same time, INS measurements in the region of OH-stretching modes indicate a hardening of the phonon triplet together with the bending modes. This means that this triplet in INS measurements is mainly due to combinations and overtones of OH-bending modes, while the intensity of OH-stretching modes appears to be relatively low. This conclusion may also apply to other hydrogen-bonded materials.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Ferroelectric Potential Landscape of 3R-MoS$_2$ through Optical Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, sliding ferroelectricity has emerged as a topic of significant interest due to its possible application in non-volatile, reconfigurable storage devices. This phenomenon is unique to two-dimensional van der Waals materials, where out-of-plane ferroelectric polarization switching is induced by relative in-plane sliding of adjacent layers. The intrinsic stacking order influences the resulting polarization, creating distinct polarization regions separated by domain walls. These regions and the domain walls can be manipulated using an applied vertical electric field, enabling a switchable system that retains the environmental robustness of van der Waals materials under ambient conditions. This study investigates 3R-MoS$_2$ using various optical measurement techniques at room temperature. The spatially resolved optical measurements reveal apparent signal changes corresponding to different ferroelectric stacking orders and variations in layer count. Our findings demonstrate that fast optical mapping at room temperature is a reliable method for probing ferroelectric potential steps in 3R-stacked MoS$_2$ samples, thereby facilitating the identification of the ferroelectric configuration. This approach does not require a conductive substrate or an electrical contact to the sample, making it more versatile than traditional atomic force probe techniques.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric bounds in spinful systems with trivial band topology</title>

Abstract: We derive quantum geometric bounds in spinful systems with spin topology characterized by a single $\mathbb{Z}$ index protected by a spin gap. Our bounds provide geometric conditions on the spin topology, distinct from the known quantum geometric bounds associated with Wilson loops and nontrivial band topologies. As a result, we obtain broader bounds in time-reversal symmetric systems with a nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index and also bounds in systems with a trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index, where the quantum metric should be otherwise unbounded. We benchmark these findings with first-principles calculations in elemental bismuth realizing a nontrivial even spin-Chern number. Moreover, we connect these bounds to optical responses and show their robustness in the presence of disorder within a real space marker formulation, demonstrating that spin-resolved quantum geometry is observable in realistic experimental settings of impure materials. Finally, we connect spin bounds to quantum Cram\'er-Rao bounds that are central to quantum metrology, showing that elemental Bi and other spin-topological phases hold promises for topological free fermion quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Techno-economic analysis of self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic systems for grid-scale energy generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To facilitate the widespread adoption of renewable energy, dispatchable, zero-emission power sources are essential for grid stability. This work performs a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of a self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system, an architecture that integrates solar charging to function as a standalone power generation asset. Using theory-based models for conventional air-bridge InGaAs and Si diode cells, our analysis reveals that while the system is not currently competitive from a pure levelized of storage cost (LCOS) perspective due to the high capital expenditure for thermal battery materials, its primary value lies in its competitive levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), which is comparable to that of conventional dispatchable generators such as gas turbines. Furthermore, we show that a full Si-based TPV system, utilizing a 50-{\mu}m-thick air-bridge cell for enhanced photon utilization, can also achieve an LCOE that is competitive with such conventional power sources at scales exceeding the gigawatt-hour level, despite its lower conversion efficiency relative to its InGaAs counterpart. This highlights a practical engineering pathway for leveraging the immense manufacturing scalability of Si, offering a lower-risk route to deployment compared to III-V materials. Ultimately, this work establishes the self-sustainable TPV architecture as a compelling pathway toward providing grid-scale, on-demand, zero-emission power.</description>
