      <title>Developing a Model-Consistent Reduced-Dimensionality training approach to quantify and reduce epistemic uncertainty in separated flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This proposed work introduces a data-assimilation-assisted approach to train neural networks, aimed at effectively reducing epistemic uncertainty in state estimates of separated flows. This method, referred to as model-consistent training, ensures that input features are derived directly from physics-based models, such as Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) turbulence models, to accurately represent the current state of the flow. Autoencoders have been selected for this task due to their capability to capture essential information from large datasets, making them particularly suitable for handling high-dimensional data with numerous discretization points in both spatial and temporal dimensions. This innovative approach integrates the ensemble Kalman method to enhance the training process, providing a robust framework for improving model accuracy and performance in turbulent flow predictions.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Surfactant-Laden Bubble Migration Dynamics in Self-Rewetting Fluids using Lattice Boltzmann Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-rewetting fluids (SRFs) (e.g., aqueous solutions of long-chain alcohols) show anomalous nonlinear (quadratic) variations of surface tension with temperature involving a positive gradient, leading to different thermocapillary convection compared to normal fluids (NFs). Moreover, surface-active materials or surfactants can significantly alter interfacial dynamics by their adsorption on fluid interfaces. The coupled effects of temperature- and surfactant-induced Marangoni stresses on migration bubbles in SRFs remain unexplored. We use a robust lattice Boltzmann (LB) method based on central moments to simulate the two-fluid motions, capture interfaces, and compute the transport of energy and surfactant concentration fields, and systematically study the surfactant-laden bubble dynamics in SRFs. When compared to motion of bubbles in normal fluids, in which they continuously migrate without a stationary behavior, our results show that they exhibit dramatically different characteristics in SRFs. Not only is the bubble motion directed from the hot to the cold sides in SRFs, which is opposite to that in NFs, but, more importantly, the bubble attains an equilibrium position. In the absence of surfactants, such an equilibrium position arises at the reference temperature occurring at the center of the domain. The addition of surfactants moves the equilibrium location further upstream, which is controlled by the magnitude of the Gibbs elasticity parameter that determines the magnitude of the surface tension variation with surfactants. The quadratic sensitivity coefficient of surface tension on temperature associated with the SRF modulates this behavior. The lower this quantity, the greater is the role of surfactants modifying the equilibrium position of the bubble in SRF. These findings provide new means to potentially manipulate the bubble dynamics, and especially to tune its equilibrium states.</description>

      <title>Gradient dynamics model for drops of volatile liquid on a porous substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mesoscopic hydrodynamic model for a spreading drop of volatile partially wetting liquid on a solid porous layer of small thickness. Thereby, evaporation takes place under strong confinement, i.e., we consider a drop that spreads on one of two parallel plates that form a narrow gap. Our gradient dynamics model describes the coupled dynamics of the vertically averaged vapor density profile, the drop height profile, and the vertically averaged saturation profile in the porous layer. The underlying free energy incorporates saturation-dependent wettability, capillarity of the drop and within the porous layer, air and vapor entropy, and an entropic contribution relevant close to complete filling of the porous layer. After developing the model we discuss the resulting sorption isotherm and illustrate typical drop spreading and imbibition behavior including the formation of a saturation halo within the porous substrate.</description>

      <title>Lack of self-similarity in transverse velocity increments and circulation statistics in two-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the statistics of longitudinal and transverse structure functions, as well as velocity circulation in the inverse energy cascade of two-dimensional turbulence. By means of direct numerical simulations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, we show that transverse structure functions exhibit an anomalous scaling, in contrast to the self-similar behavior of longitudinal ones. We argue that the intermittency of transverse structure functions explains the one observed for velocity circulation statistics, although they are driven by different turbulent structures.</description>

      <title>Generative Learning of the Solution of Parametric Partial Differential Equations Using Guided Diffusion Models and Virtual Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generative learning framework to model high-dimensional parametric systems using gradient guidance and virtual observations. We consider systems described by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) discretized with structured or unstructured grids. The framework integrates multi-level information to generate high fidelity time sequences of the system dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our framework with two case studies in incompressible, two dimensional, low Reynolds cylinder flow on an unstructured mesh and incompressible turbulent channel flow on a structured mesh, both parameterized by the Reynolds number. Our results illustrate the framework's robustness and ability to generate accurate flow sequences across various parameter settings, significantly reducing computational costs allowing for efficient forecasting and reconstruction of flow dynamics.</description>

      <title>A dynamical mechanism rooted in the Lorenz system for giant negative and positive mobility of a memory-driven active particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On applying a small bias force, non-equilibrium systems may respond in paradoxical ways such as with giant negative mobility (GNM) -- a large net drift opposite to the applied bias, or giant positive mobility (GPM) -- an anomalously large drift in the same direction as the applied bias. We consider an idealized model of a memory-driven active particle inspired from experiments with walking/superwalking droplets that takes the form of the celebrated Lorenz system. By adding a small bias force to this Lorenz model, we uncover a mechanism for simultaneous emergence of GNM and GPM in the parameter space. Within the chaotic sea of the parameter space, a symmetric pair of coexisting asymmetric limit cycles separate and migrate under applied bias force, resulting in anomalous transport behaviors that are sensitive to the particle's memory. This provides a general dynamical mechanism for the emergence of anomalous transport behaviors for self-driven particles described by low-dimensional autonomous chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Predicting nonlinear-flow regions in highly heterogeneous porous media using adaptive constitutive laws and neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a porous medium featuring heterogeneous permeabilities, a wide range of fluid velocities may be recorded, so that significant inertial and frictional effects may arise in high-speed regions. In such parts, the link between pressure gradient and velocity is typically made via Darcy's law, which may fail to account for these effects; instead, the Darcy Forchheimer law, which introduces a nonlinear term, may be more adequate. Applying the Darcy Forchheimer law globally in the domain is very costly numerically and, rather, should only be done where strictly necessary. The question of finding a prori the subdomain where to restrict the use of the Darcy Forchheimer law was recently answered in FP23 by using an adaptive model: given a threshold on the flow velocity, the model locally selects the more appropriate law as it is being solved. At the end of the resolution, each mesh cell is flagged as being in the Darcy or Darcy Forchheimer subdomain. Still, this model is nonlinear itself and thus relatively expensive to run. In this paper, to accelerate the subdivision of the domain into low and high speed regions, we instead exploit the adaptive model from FP23 to generate partitioning data given an array of different input parameters, such as boundary conditions and inertial coefficients, and then train neural networks on these data classifying each mesh cell as Darcy or not. Two test cases are studied to illustrate the results, where cost functions, parity plots, precision-recall plots and receiver operating characteristic curves are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Line tension from dual-geometry sessile droplet measurements: Combining contact angle size dependence data for axisymmetric and cylindrical droplets to determine the line tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a thermodynamic analysis of various contributions to the size dependence of the contact angle cosine for axisymmetric and cylindrical sessile droplets. This shows that a widely used method to determine the line tension from the slope of the contact angle cosine dependence on the three-phase contact line curvature (for axisymmetric droplets) provides a certain combination of the line tension, adsorptions at the three interfaces, and the macroscopic contact angle. To extract the leading-order contact-line-related contribution and determine the line tension, we propose a simple technique using contact angle size dependences for axisymmetric and cylindrical droplets at the same conditions.</description>

      <title>Towards the understanding of convective dissolution in confined porous media: thin bead pack experiments, two-dimensional direct numerical simulations and physical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the process of convective dissolution in homogeneous and isotropic porous media. The flow is unstable due to the presence of a solute that induces a density difference responsible for driving the flow. The mixing dynamics is thus driven by a Rayleigh-Taylor instability at the pore scale. We investigate the flow at the scale of the pores using Hele-Shaw type experiment with bead packs, 2D DNS and physical models. Experiments and simulations have been specifically designed to mimic the same flow conditions, namely matching porosities, high Schmidt numbers, and linear dependency of fluid density with solute concentration. In addition, the solid obstacles of the medium are impermeable to fluid and solute. We characterise the evolution of the flow via the mixing length, which quantifies the extension of the mixing region and grows linearly in time. The flow structure, analysed via the centre-line mean wavelength, is observed to grow in agreement with theoretical predictions. Finally, we analyse the dissolution dynamics of the system, quantified through the mean scalar dissipation, and three mixing regimes are observed: (i) The evolution is controlled by diffusion, which produces solute mixing across the initial horizontal interface; (ii) when the interfacial diffusive layer is sufficiently thick, it becomes unstable, forming finger-like structures and driving the system into a convection-dominated phase; (iii) when the fingers have grown sufficiently to touch the horizontal boundaries of the domain, the mixing reduces dramatically due to the absence of fresh unmixed fluid. With simple physical models, we explain the physics of the results obtained numerically and experimentally. The solute evolution presents a self-similar behaviour, and it is controlled by different length scales in each stage of the mixing process, namely length scale of diffusion, pore size, and domain height.</description>

      <title>Slip-induced odd viscous flow past a cylinder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Odd viscosity is a transport coefficient that can occur when fluids experience breaking of parity and time-reversal symmetry. Previous knowledge indicates that cylinders in incompressible odd viscous fluids, under no-slip boundary conditions, do not exhibit lift force, a phenomenon that poses challenges for the experimental detection of odd viscosity. This study investigates the impact of slip in Stokes flow, employing the odd generalization of the Lorentz reciprocal theorem. Our findings reveal that, at linear order in slip length, lift does not manifest. Subsequently, we explore the scenario involving a thin sheet with momentum decay as well as that of a finite system size, demonstrating that for Stokes flow lift does occur for the second order slip length contribution. We address cylinder flow beyond the Stokes approximation by solving the Oseen equation to obtain a fluid profile that shows an interplay between odd viscosity and inertia, and acquire an explicit expression for the leading order slip length contribution to Oseen lift at low Reynolds number.</description>

Abstract: The motion, settling, and dispersion of microplastics in the ocean are determined by their rotational dynamics. We present experiments on elongated, large aspect ratio, and mildly curved plastic fibers slightly longer than the Kolmogorov length scale. Exploiting their uniquely identifiable three dimensional orientation, we perform original optical Lagrangian investigations and provide a set of homogeneous data on their rotation rates around their longitudinal axis -- spinning rate -- and transversal axes -- tumbling rates -- which we explain in the context of the general features of turbulence.</description>

      <title>One-Dimensional, One-Phase and Two-Phase Eulerian Explicit Shock Tube Simulation Code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, a one-dimensional simulation code was developed for both single-phase and two-phase systems, focusing on time-dependent Euler equations for gas and particles. These equations, non-linear hyperbolic conservation laws, describe the dynamics of compressible materials, where body forces, viscous stresses, and heat flux are neglected. The Euler equations were discretized using the finite volume method, and the code was written in MATLAB. To test the accuracy of the computational fluid code, the Sod shock tube problem, a physical analogue of the Riemann problem, was employed. This problem models a pressure discontinuity where high and low-pressure regions are separated by a diaphragm, which breaks at t=0, creating a discontinuity in density as well. Exact solutions were used for code verification. A key focus was on modeling a curtain of particles impacted by a shock wave, relevant to multiphase heterogeneous cylindrical explosion studies by the PSAAP II project. This initiative, funded by the US Department of Energy (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Office of Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC), involves Sandia National Laboratories and the Center for Compressible Multiphase Turbulence at the University of Florida. The propagation of uncertainties in the maximum density of the particle curtain was studied by varying initial curtain thickness and initial high density. Given the computational expense of multiple code evaluations for uncertainty propagation, a multi-fidelity surrogate model combining low and high-fidelity simulations was implemented. This model facilitated uncertainty propagation using DAKOTA, a flexible and extensible interface between analysis codes and iterative systems analysis methods.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of vortex pairing in transitional jets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the onset of linear instabilities and their later nonlinear interactions in the shear layer of an initially-laminar jet using a combination of stability analysis and data from high-fidelity flow simulations. We provide a complete picture of the vortex-pairing process. Hydrodynamic instabilities initiate the transition to turbulence, causing the shear layer to spread rapidly. In this process, the shear layer rolls up to form vortices, accompanied by the exponential growth of the fundamental frequency. As the fundamental frequency grows, it gains energy from the mean flow. Subsequently, as it saturates and begins to decay, the fundamental vortices start to pair. During this vortex pairing process, the subharmonic vortex acquires energy both linearly from the mean flow and nonlinearly through a reverse cascade from the fundamental. The process concludes when the subharmonic vortex eventually saturates. Similarly, two subharmonic vortices merge to form a second subharmonic vortex. Our results confirm Kelly's (1967) hypothesis of a resonance mechanism between the fundamental and subharmonic, which supplies energy to the subharmonic. In this multi-tonal, convective-dominated flow, we clarify the ambiguity surrounding the fundamental frequency by demonstrating that the spatially most amplified frequency should be considered fundamental, rather than the structure associated with the spectral energy peak. For the initially-laminar jet considered here, the fundamental frequency corresponds to the fourth largest spectral peak, highlighting the important distinction between the energetically and dynamical significance of a tone. Despite its low energy, the fundamental frequency is dynamically dominant as it determines all other spectral peaks and supplies energy to the subharmonics through a reverse energy cascade.</description>

      <title>Toward ultra-efficient high-fidelity prediction of bed morphodynamics of large-scale meandering rivers using a novel LES-trained machine learning approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flood-induced deformation of the bed topography of fluvial meandering rivers could lead to river bank displacement, structural failure of the infrastructures, and the propagation of scour or deposition features. The assessment of sediment transport in large-scale meanders is, therefore, a key environmental issue. High-fidelity numerical models provide powerful tools for such assessments. However, high-fidelity simulations of large-scale rivers using the coupled flow and morphodynamics modules can be computationally expensive, owing to the costly two-way coupling between turbulence and bed morphodynamics. This study seeks to present a novel machine learning approach, which is trained using coupled large-eddy simulation (LES) and morphodynamics results. The proposed machine learning approach predicts bed shear stress and equilibrium bed morphology of large-scale meanders under bankfull flow conditions at a fraction of the cost of coupled LES-morphodynamics. We developed and evaluated the performance of a convolutional neural network autoencoder (CNNAE) algorithm to generate high-fidelity bed shear stress and equilibrium morphology of large-scale meandering rivers. The CNNAE algorithm utilizes instantaneous shear stress distribution and change of bed elevation of high-fidelity simulation results, along with geometric parameters of meanders as inputs to predict mean bed shear stress distribution and equilibrium bed elevation of rivers. The results demonstrated the feasibility, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed CNNAE algorithm.</description>
