      <title>Inverse optically-induced ring currents in ring-shaped molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permanent electronic ring currents can be supported within a manifold of $\Gamma_E$ degenerate excited electronic states as $E_{\pm} = E_x \pm i E_y$ excitations. This requires at least a 3-fold-symmetry rotational axis or higher, and includes the subclass of ring-shaped molecules. In [Phys. Rev. Res. {\bf 3}, L042003 (2021)] we showed the existence of inverse-current manifolds, where the direction of the electronic ring-current in each degenerate state $E_\pm$ is opposite to the circular polarization of the generating light-fields. This phenomenon can be traced back to vibronic effects, namely the exchange of orbital angular momentum between the circulating electrons and vibrational modes with the required symmetry. Here we consider the case of fixed nuclei and find that ring-shaped molecular systems can posses inverse-current manifolds on a purely electronic-structure basis, i.e. without intervention of vibronic coupling. The effect is illustrated and explained first on a simple tight-binding model with cyclic symmetry, and then considering the {\it{ab initio}} electronic structure of benzene and sym-triazine. A framework for discriminating regular- and inverse-current $\Gamma_E$ manifolds in molecules using quantum chemistry calculations is provided.</description>

      <title>Single vibronic level fluorescence spectra from Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence experiments, the electronically excited initial state is also excited in one or several vibrational modes. Whereas the time-independent approach of computing all contributing Franck-Condon factors becomes impractical in large systems, a time-dependent formalism has not been applied to simulate emission from arbitrary initial vibrational levels. Here, we apply Hagedorn functions, which are products of a Gaussian and carefully generated polynomials, to represent SVL initial states. Under an at most quadratic potential, the Hagedorn functions are exact solutions to the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation and can be propagated using the same equations of motion as a simple Gaussian wavepacket. Having developed an efficient recursive algorithm to compute the overlaps between two Hagedorn wavepackets, we can now evaluate emission spectra from arbitrary vibronic levels using a single trajectory. Here, we use two-dimensional global harmonic models to validate the method by comparing it with quantum split-operator calculations and to demonstrate the effects of displacement, distortion (squeezing), and Duschinsky rotation on SVL spectra. Additionally, we show the practicality of the Hagedorn approach in a high-dimensional system on a displaced, distorted, and Duschinsky-rotated harmonic model with 100 degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Ab initio simulation of single vibronic level fluorescence spectra of anthracene using Hagedorn wavepackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence spectroscopy contributes to the understanding of molecular vibrational structures and relaxation processes. Based on Hagedorn wavepackets, we have recently proposed a time-dependent approach to compute SVL spectra from arbitrary initial vibrational levels, i.e., higher excitations in multiple modes, and validated it against exact quantum calculations on model systems. Here, we extend the application of our method to a realistic molecular system, anthracene, employing a harmonic model constructed from ab initio electronic structure data. With the Hagedorn approach, we not only successfully reproduce the previously reported simulation results for singly excited $12^{1}$ and $\overline{11}^{1}$ levels, but are also able to compute SVL spectra from multiply excited levels in good agreement with experiments and from the same Hagedorn wavepacket trajectory without any additional propagation beyond what is required for ground-state emission spectra.</description>

      <title>Towards Prebiotic Chemistry on Titan: Impact experiments on organic haze particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Impacts are critical to producing the aqueous environments necessary to stimulate prebiotic chemistry on Titan's surface. Furthermore, organic hazes resting on the surface are a likely feedstock of biomolecules. In this work, we conduct impact experiments on laboratory-produced organic haze particles and haze/sand mixtures and analyze these samples for life's building blocks. Samples of unshocked haze and sand particles are also analyzed to determine the change in biomolecule concentrations and distributions from shocking. Across all samples, we detect seven nucleobases, nine proteinogenic amino acids, and five other biomolecules (e.g., urea) using a blank subtraction procedure to eliminate signals due to contamination. We find that shock pressures of 13 GPa variably degrade nucleobases, amino acids, and a few other organics in haze particles and haze/sand mixtures; however, certain individual biomolecules become enriched or are even produced from these events. Xanthine, threonine, and aspartic acid are enriched or produced in impact experiments containing sand, suggesting these minerals may catalyze the production of these biomolecules. On the other hand, thymine and isoleucine/norleucine are enriched or produced in haze samples containing no sand, suggesting catalytic grains are not necessary for all impact shock syntheses. Uracil, glycine, proline, cysteine, and tyrosine are the most unstable to impact-related processing. These experiments suggest that impacts alter biomolecule distributions on Titan's surface, and that organic hazes co-occurring with fine-grained material on the surface may provide an initial source for further prebiotic chemistry on Titan.</description>

      <title>Critical Nature of the Size Exponent of Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the basis of the thermodynamic theory of the excluded volume effects, we show that the size exponent varies abruptly, depending on the change of the segment concentration. For linear polymers, the exponent changes discontinuously from $\nu=3/5$ for the isolated system ($\bar{\phi}=0$) in good solvents to $\nu=1/2$ in the finite concentration ($0&lt;\bar{\phi}\le1$), while for branched polymers having $\nu_{0}=1/4$, the corresponding exponent varies from $\nu=1/2$ ($\bar{\phi}=0$) to $\nu\cong 1/3$ ($0&lt;\bar{\phi}\le1$).</description>

      <title>Validation of ML-UQ calibration statistics using simulated reference values: a sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some popular Machine Learning Uncertainty Quantification (ML-UQ) calibration statistics do not have predefined reference values and are mostly used in comparative studies. In consequence, calibration is almost never validated and the diagnostic is left to the appreciation of the reader. Simulated reference values, based on synthetic calibrated datasets derived from actual uncertainties, have been proposed to palliate this problem. As the generative probability distribution for the simulation of synthetic errors is often not constrained, the sensitivity of simulated reference values to the choice of generative distribution might be problematic, shedding a doubt on the calibration diagnostic. This study explores various facets of this problem, and shows that some statistics are excessively sensitive to the choice of generative distribution to be used for validation when the generative distribution is unknown. This is the case, for instance, of the correlation coefficient between absolute errors and uncertainties (CC) and of the expected normalized calibration error (ENCE). A robust validation workflow to deal with simulated reference values is proposed.</description>

      <title>X marks the spot: accurate energies from intersecting extrapolations of continuum quantum Monte Carlo data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the application of an extrapolative method that yields very accurate total and relative energies from variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (VMC and DMC) results. For a trial wave function consisting of a small configuration interaction (CI) wave function obtained from full CI quantum Monte Carlo and reoptimized in the presence of a Jastrow factor and an optional backflow transformation, we find that the VMC and DMC energies are smooth functions of the sum of the squared coefficients of the initial CI wave function, and that quadratic extrapolations of the non-backflow VMC and backflow DMC energies intersect within uncertainty of the exact total energy. With adequate statistical treatment of quasi-random fluctuations, the extrapolate and intersect with polynomials of order two (XSPOT) method is shown to yield results in agreement with benchmark-quality total and relative energies for the C2, N2, CO2, and H2O molecules, as well as for the C2 molecule in its first electronic singlet excited state, using only small CI expansion sizes.</description>

      <title>A foundation model for atomistic materials chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learned force fields have transformed the atomistic modelling of materials by enabling simulations of ab initio quality on unprecedented time and length scales. However, they are currently limited by: (i) the significant computational and human effort that must go into development and validation of potentials for each particular system of interest; and (ii) a general lack of transferability from one chemical system to the next. Here, using the state-of-the-art MACE architecture we introduce a single general-purpose ML model, trained on a public database of 150k inorganic crystals, that is capable of running stable molecular dynamics on molecules and materials. We demonstrate the power of the MACE-MP-0 model - and its qualitative and at times quantitative accuracy - on a diverse set problems in the physical sciences, including the properties of solids, liquids, gases, chemical reactions, interfaces and even the dynamics of a small protein. The model can be applied out of the box and as a starting or "foundation model" for any atomistic system of interest and is thus a step towards democratising the revolution of ML force fields by lowering the barriers to entry.</description>

      <title>Electron-correlated study of excited states and absorption spectra of some low-symmetry graphene quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have computed the linear optical absorption spectra of three graphene quantum dots (GQDs), saturated by hydrogens on the edges, using both first-principles time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) and the Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) model coupled with the configuration-interaction (CI) approach. To understand the influence of electron-correlation effects, we have also calculated the singlet-triplet energy gap (spin gap) of the three GQDs. Because of the presence of edge hydrogens, these GQDs are effectively polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) dibenzo[bc,ef]coronene (also known as benzo(1,14)bisanthene, C$_{30}$H$_{14}$), and two isomeric compounds, dinaphtho[8,1,2abc;2,1,8klm]coronene and dinaphtho[8,1,2abc;2,1,8jkl]coronene with the chemical formula C$_{36}$H$_{16}$. The two isomers have different point group symmetries, $C_{2v}$, and $C_{2h}$, therefore, this study will also help us understand the influence of symmetry on optical properties. A common feature of the absorption spectra of the three GQDs is that the first peak representing the optical gap is of low to moderate intensity, while the intense peaks appear at higher energies. For each GQD, PPP model calculations performed with the screened parameters agree well with the experimental results of the corresponding PAH, and also with the TDDFT calculations.</description>

      <title>Surface Phase Diagrams from Nested Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08509v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies in atomic-scale modeling of surface phase equilibria often focus on temperatures near zero Kelvin due to the challenges in calculating the free energy of surfaces at finite temperatures. The Bayesian-inference-based nested sampling (NS) algorithm allows for modeling phase equilibria at arbitrary temperatures by directly and efficiently calculating the partition function, whose relationship with free energy is well known. This work extends NS to calculate adsorbate phase diagrams, incorporating all relevant configurational contributions to the free energy. We apply NS to the adsorption of Lennard-Jones (LJ) gas particles on low-index and vicinal LJ solid surfaces and construct the canonical partition function from these recorded energies to calculate ensemble averages of thermodynamic properties, such as the constant-volume heat capacity and order parameters that characterize the structure of adsorbate phases. Key results include determining the nature of phase transitions of adsorbed LJ particles on flat and stepped LJ surfaces, which typically feature an enthalpy-driven condensation at higher temperatures and an entropy-driven reordering process at lower temperatures, and the effect of surface geometry on the presence of triple points in the phase diagrams. Overall, we demonstrate the ability and potential of NS for surface modeling.</description>
