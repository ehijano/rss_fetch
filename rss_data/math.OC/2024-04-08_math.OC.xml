      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid inertial self-adaptive algorithm for solving the split feasibility problem and fixed point problem in the class of demicontractive mappings. Our results are very general and extend several related results existing in literature from the class of nonexpansive or quasi-nonexpansive mappings to the larger class of demicontractive mappings. Examples to illustrate numerically the effectiveness of the new analytical results are presented.</description>

      <title>Gray-Box Nonlinear Feedback Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback optimization enables autonomous optimality seeking of a dynamical system through its closed-loop interconnection with iterative optimization algorithms. Among various iteration structures, model-based approaches require the input-output sensitivity of the system to construct gradients, whereas model-free approaches bypass this need by estimating gradients from real-time evaluations of the objective. These approaches own complementary benefits in sample efficiency and accuracy against model mismatch, i.e., errors of sensitivities. To achieve the best of both worlds, we propose gray-box feedback optimization controllers, featuring systematic incorporation of approximate sensitivities into model-free updates via adaptive convex combination. We quantify conditions on the accuracy of the sensitivities that render the gray-box approach preferable. We elucidate how the closed-loop performance is determined by the number of iterations, the problem dimension, and the cumulative effect of inaccurate sensitivities. The proposed controller contributes to a balanced closed-loop behavior, which retains provable sample efficiency and optimality guarantees for nonconvex problems. We further develop a running gray-box controller to handle constrained time-varying problems with changing objectives and steady-state maps.</description>

      <title>Why does the two-timescale Q-learning converge to different mean field solutions? A unified convergence analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the unified two-timescale Q-learning algorithm as initially introduced by Angiuli et al. \cite{angiuli2022unified}. This algorithm demonstrates efficacy in solving mean field game (MFG) and mean field control (MFC) problems, simply by tuning the ratio of two learning rates for mean field distribution and the Q-functions respectively. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive theoretical explanation of the algorithm's bifurcated numerical outcomes under fixed learning rates. We achieve this by establishing a diagram that correlates continuous-time mean field problems to their discrete-time Q-function counterparts, forming the basis of the algorithm. Our key contribution lies in the construction of a Lyapunov function integrating both mean field distribution and Q-function iterates. This Lyapunov function facilitates a unified convergence of the algorithm across the entire spectrum of learning rates, thus providing a cohesive framework for analysis.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Power Flow Approximations with Second-Order Sensitivity Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power flow equations are fundamental to power system planning, analysis, and control. However, the inherent non-linearity and non-convexity of these equations present formidable obstacles in problem-solving processes. To mitigate these challenges, recent research has proposed adaptive power flow linearizations that aim to achieve accuracy over wide operating ranges. The accuracy of these approximations inherently depends on the curvature of the power flow equations within these ranges, which necessitates looking at second-order sensitivities. In this paper, we leverage second-order sensitivities to both analyze and improve power flow approximations. We evaluate the curvature across broad operational ranges and subsequently utilize this information to inform the computation of various sampling-based power flow approximation techniques. Additionally, we leverage second-order sensitivities to guide the development of rational approximations that yield linear constraints in optimization problems. This approach is extended to enhance accuracy beyond the limitations of linear functions across varied operational scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimisation model for the set up of photovoltaic multiple self-consumption loops in semi-rural areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective self-consumption gains more and more interest in a context where localised consumption of energy is a lever of sustainable development. While easing energy distribution networks, collective self-consumption requires complementary prosumers' profiles. Before determining the proper energy exchanges happening between these prosumers, one must ensure their compatibility in the context of collective self-consumption. This article proposes network flow-based linear models, to solve both, the design aspect of the problem and the attribution of distribution flows to each involved prosumer. Two main models are proposed, handling (i) single collective self-consumption loop creation and (ii) multiple loop creation. One of the objectives of this work is to provide models that can be applied at a strategic level which implies their extension to large time scale and large spatial scale. To do so, associated Benders and Dantzig-Wolfe decompositions are proposed to ensure model scalability along temporal and spatial dimensions. The proposed models are tested on realistic use cases to assess their performances.</description>

      <title>Convex Reformulation of LMI-Based Distributed Controller Design with a Class of Non-Block-Diagonal Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses a distributed state feedback controller design problem for continuous-time linear time-invariant systems by means of linear matrix inequalities (LMI). As the exact convexification is still open, the block-diagonal relaxation of Lyapunov functions has been prevalent despite its conservatism. In this work, we target a class of non-block-diagonal Lyapunov functions that has the same sparsity as distributed controllers. By leveraging a block-diagonal factorization of sparse matrices and Finsler's lemma, we first present a (nonlinear) matrix inequality for stabilizing distributed controllers with such Lyapunov functions, which boils down to a necessary and sufficient condition for such controllers if the sparsity pattern is chordal. As a relaxation of the inequality, we derive an LMI that completely covers the conventional relaxation and then provide analogous results for $H_\infty$ control. Lastly, numerical examples underscore the efficacy of our results.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Pricing for Air Cargo Revenue Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address a dynamic pricing problem for airlines aiming to maximize expected revenue from selling cargo space on a single-leg flight. The cargo shipments' weight and volume are uncertain and their precise values remain unavailable at the booking time. We model this problem as a Markov decision process, and further derive a necessary condition for its optimal pricing strategy. To break the curse of dimensionality, we develop two categories of approximation methods and pricing strategies. One category is based on the quantity of accepted bookings, while the other is founded on the expected weight and volume of accepted bookings. We prove that the pricing strategy of the quantity-based method possesses several inherent structural properties, which are crucial for analytically validating the model and accelerating the computational process. For the weight-volume-based approximation method, we derive a theoretical upper bound for the optimality gap of total expected revenue. For both methods, we further develop augmented strategies to address the extreme pricing issues in scenarios with high product heterogeneity and incorporate the second moment to enhance performance in the scenarios of high uncertainty, respectively. We utilize realistic dataset to conduct extensive numerical tests, and the results show that the average performance gap between the optimal expected revenue and that of each proposed pricing strategy is less than 10%. The quantity-based method requires the least computation, and performs quite well in the scenarios with low product heterogeneity. The augmented quantity-based method and the weight-volume-based method further enhance the resilience to product heterogeneity. The augmented weight-volume-based method significantly improves the revenue when there are high penalties for overbooking and high uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Robotic Sorting Systems: Robot Management and Layout Design Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the contemporary logistics industry, automation plays a pivotal role in enhancing production efficiency and expanding industrial scale. Autonomous mobile robots, in particular, have become integral to the modernization efforts in warehouses. One noteworthy application in robotic warehousing is the robotic sorting system (RSS), distinguished by its characteristics such as cost-effectiveness, simplicity, scalability, and adaptable throughput control. While previous research has focused on analyzing the efficiency of RSS, it often assumed an ideal robot management system ignoring potential queuing delays by assuming constant travel times. This study relaxes this assumption and explores the quantitative relationship between RSS configuration parameters and system throughput. We introduce a novel robot traffic management method, named the rhythmic control for sorting scenario (RC-S), for RSS operations, equipped with an estimation formula establishing the relationship between system performance and configurations. Simulations validate that RC-S reduces average service time by 10.3\% compared to the classical cooperative A* algorithm, while also improving throughput and runtime. Based on the performance analysis of RC-S, we further develop a layout optimization model for RSS, considering RSS configuration, desired throughput, and costs, to minimize expenses and determine the best layout. Numerical studies show that at lower throughput levels, facility costs dominate, while at higher throughput levels, labor costs prevail. Additionally, due to traffic efficiency limitations, RSS is well-suited for small-scale operations like end-of-supply-chain distribution centers.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Stochastic Saddle Point Mirror Descent Algorithm -- A Projected Dynamical View Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Saddle point problems, ubiquitous in optimization, extend beyond game theory to diverse domains like power networks and reinforcement learning. This paper presents novel approaches to tackle saddle point problem, with a focus on continuous-time contexts. In this paper we propose a continuous time dynamics to tackle saddle point problem utilizing projected dynamical system in non-Euclidean domain. This involves computing the (sub/super) gradient of the min-max function within a Riemannian metric. Additionally, we establish viable Caratheodory solutions also prove the Lyapunov stability and asymptotic set stability of the proposed continuous time dynamical system. Next, we present the Stochastic Saddle Point Mirror Descent (SSPMD) algorithm and establish its equivalence with the proposed continuous-time dynamics. Leveraging stability analysis of the continuous-time dynamics, we demonstrate the almost sure convergence of the algorithm's iterates. Furthermore, we introduce the Zeroth-Order Saddle Point Mirror Descent (SZSPMD) algorithm, which approximates gradients using Nesterov's Gaussian Approximation, showcasing convergence to a neighborhood around saddle points. The analysis in this paper provides geometric insights into the mirror descent algorithm and demonstrates how these insights offer theoretical foundations for various practical applications of the mirror descent algorithm in diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>Integer Optimal Control with Fractional Perimeter Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by many applications, optimal control problems with integer controls have recently received a significant attention. Some state-of-the-art work uses perimeter-regularization to derive stationarity conditions and trust-region algorithms. However, the discretization is difficult in this case because the perimeter is concentrated on a set of dimension $d - 1$ for a domain of dimension $d$.
  This article proposes a potential way to overcome this challenge by using the fractional nonlocal perimeter with fractional exponent $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$. In this way, the boundary integrals in the perimeter regularization are replaced by volume integrals. Besides establishing some non-trivial properties associated with this perimeter, a $\Gamma$-convergence result is derived. This result establishes convergence of minimizers of fractional perimeter-regularized problem, to the standard one, as the exponent $\alpha$ tends to 1. In addition, the stationarity results are derived and algorithmic convergence analysis is carried out for $\alpha \in (0.5,1)$ under an additional assumption on the gradient of the reduced objective.
  The theoretical results are supplemented by a preliminary computational experiment. We observe that the isotropy of the total variation may be approximated by means of the fractional perimeter functional.</description>

      <title>Optimality of Decentralized Symmetric Policies for Stochastic Teams with Mean-Field Information Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of stochastic exchangeable teams comprising a finite number of decision makers (DMs) as well as their mean-field limits involving infinite numbers of DMs. In the finite population regime, we study exchangeable teams under the centralized information structure (IS). For the infinite population setting, we study exchangeable teams under the decentralized mean-field information sharing. The paper makes the following main contributions: i) For finite population exchangeable teams, we establish the existence of a randomized optimal policy that is exchangeable (permutation invariant) and Markovian. This optimal policy is obtained via value iterations for an equivalent measure-valued controlled Markov decision problem (MDP); ii) We show that a sequence of exchangeable optimal policies for a finite population setting converges to a conditionally symmetric (identical), independent, and decentralized randomized policy for the infinite population problem. This result establishes the existence of a symmetric, independent, decentralized optimal randomized policy for the infinite population problem. Additionally, it proves the optimality of the limiting measure-valued MDP for the representative DM; iii) Finally, we show that symmetric, independent, decentralized optimal randomized policies are approximately optimal for the corresponding finite-population team with a large number of DMs under the centralized IS.</description>

      <title>Oracle complexity of augmented Lagrangian methods for nonsmooth manifold optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel manifold inexact augmented Lagrangian method (\textbf{ManIAL}) and provide an oracle complexity analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first complexity result for the augmented Lagrangian method for solving nonsmooth problems on Riemannian manifolds. By using the Riemannian gradient method as a subroutine, we establish an oracle complexity result of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$, matching the best-known complexity result. Our algorithm relies on the careful selection of penalty parameters and the precise control of termination criteria for subproblems. Furthermore, we also propose a stochastic manifold inexact augmented Lagrangian method (\textbf{StoManIAL}) for cases where the smooth term follows an expectation form. By using a Riemannian recursive momentum method as a subroutine, we prove that \textbf{StoManIAL} achieves an oracle complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3.5})$, which is better than the best-known $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ result. Numerical experiments conducted on sparse principal component analysis and sparse canonical correlation analysis demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform an existing method with the previously best-known complexity result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with an indefinite linear-quadratic (LQ) mean field games of stochastic large-polulation system, where the individual diffusion coefficients can depend on both the state and the control of the agents and the population state average. Moreover, the control weights in the cost functionals could be indefinite. We use a direct approach to derive the $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium strategy. First, we formally solving an $N$-player game problem within a vast and finite population setting. Subsequently, decoupling or reducing high-dimensional systems by introducing two Riccati equations explicitly yields centralized strategies, contingent on the state of a specific player and the average state of the population. As the population size $N$ approaches infinity, the construction of decentralized strategies becomes feasible. Then, we demonstrated they are an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of controlled particle systems arising in deep learning: from finite to infinite sample size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with a class of neural SDEs and studies the limiting behavior of the associated sampled optimal control problems as the sample size grows to infinity. The neural SDEs with N samples can be linked to the N-particle systems with centralized control. We analyze the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation corresponding to the N-particle system and establish regularity results which are uniform in N. The uniform regularity estimates are obtained by the stochastic maximum principle and the analysis of a backward stochastic Riccati equation. Using these uniform regularity results, we show the convergence of the minima of objective functionals and optimal parameters of the neural SDEs as the sample size N tends to infinity. The limiting objects can be identified with suitable functions defined on the Wasserstein space of Borel probability measures. Furthermore, quantitative algebraic convergence rates are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Non-concave distributionally robust stochastic control in a discrete time finite horizon setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we present a general framework for non-concave distributionally robust stochastic control problems in a discrete time finite horizon setting. Our framework allows to consider a variety of different path-dependent ambiguity sets of probability measures comprising, as a natural example, the ambiguity set defined via Wasserstein-balls around path-dependent reference measures, as well as parametric classes of probability distributions. We establish a dynamic programming principle which allows to derive both optimal control and worst-case measure by solving recursively a sequence of one-step optimization problems. As a concrete application, we study the robust hedging problem of a financial derivative under an asymmetric (and non-convex) loss function accounting for different preferences of sell- and buy side when it comes to the hedging of financial derivatives. As our entirely data-driven ambiguity set of probability measures, we consider Wasserstein-balls around the empirical measure derived from real financial data. We demonstrate that during adverse scenarios such as a financial crisis, our robust approach outperforms typical model-based hedging strategies such as the classical Delta-hedging strategy as well as the hedging strategy obtained in the non-robust setting with respect to the empirical measure and therefore overcomes the problem of model misspecification in such critical periods.</description>

      <title>Finite Elements with Switch Detection for Numerical Optimal Control of Projected Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Finite Elements with Switch Detection (FESD) method is a highly accurate direct transcription method for optimal control of several classes of nonsmooth dynamical systems. This paper extends the FESD method to Projected Dynamical Systems (PDS) and first-order sweeping processes with time-independent sets. This method discretizes an equivalent dynamic complementarity system and exploits the particular structure of the discontinuities present in these systems. In the FESD method, allowing integration step sizes to be degrees of freedom, and introducing additional complementarity constraints, enables the exact detection of nonsmooth events. In contrast to the standard fixed-step Runge-Kutta methods, this approach allows for the recovery of full-order integration accuracy and the correct computation of numerical sensitivities. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in an optimal control context. This method and the examples are included in the open-source software package nosnoc.</description>

      <title>A Max-Min-Max Algorithm for Large-Scale Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust optimization (RO) is a powerful paradigm for decision making under uncertainty. Existing algorithms for solving RO, including the reformulation approach and the cutting-plane method, do not scale well, hindering the application of RO to large-scale decision problems. In this paper, we devise a first-order algorithm for solving RO based on a novel max-min-max perspective. Our algorithm operates directly on the model functions and sets through the subgradient and projection oracles, which enables the exploitation of problem structures and is especially suitable for large-scale RO. Theoretically, we prove that the oracle complexity of our algorithm for attaining an $\varepsilon$-approximate optimal solution is $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ or $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$, depending on the smoothness of the model functions. The algorithm and its theoretical results are then extended to RO with projection-unfriendly uncertainty sets. We also show via extensive numerical experiments that the proposed algorithm outperforms the reformulation approach, the cutting-plane method and two other recent first-order algorithms.</description>

      <title>B-ary Tree Push-Pull Method is Provably Efficient for Decentralized Learning on Heterogeneous Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the distributed learning problem where a group of agents cooperatively minimizes the summation of their local cost functions based on peer-to-peer communication. Particularly, we propose a highly efficient algorithm, termed ``B-ary Tree Push-Pull'' (BTPP), that employs two B-ary spanning trees for distributing the information related to the parameters and stochastic gradients across the network. The simple method is efficient in communication since each agent interacts with at most $(B+1)$ neighbors per iteration. More importantly, BTPP achieves linear speedup for smooth nonconvex objective functions with only $\tilde{O}(n)$ transient iterations, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art results to the best of our knowledge.</description>

      <title>A High-Performant Multi-Parametric Quadratic Programming Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a combinatorial method for computing explicit solutions to multi-parametric quadratic programs, which can be used to compute explicit control laws for linear model predictive control. In contrast to classical methods, which are based on geometrical adjacency, the proposed method is based on combinatorial adjacency. After introducing the notion of combinatorial adjacency, we show that the explicit solution forms a connected graph in terms of it. We then leverage this connectedness to propose an algorithm that computes the explicit solution. The purely combinatorial nature of the algorithm leads to computational advantages since it enables demanding geometrical operations (such as computing facets of polytopes) to be avoided. Compared with classical combinatorial methods, the proposed method requires fewer combinations to be considered by exploiting combinatorial connectedness. We show that an implementation of the proposed method can yield a speedup of about two orders of magnitude compared with state-of-the-art software packages such as MPT and POP.</description>

      <title>Feedback Stability Under Mixed Gain and Phase Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the robust feedback stability problem for multiple-input-multiple-output linear time-invariant systems involving sectored-disk uncertainty, namely, dynamic uncertainty subject to simultaneous gain and phase constraints. This problem is thereby called a sectored-disk problem. Employing a frequency-wise analysis approach, we derive a fundamental static matrix problem that serves as a key component in addressing the feedback stability. The study of this matrix problem heavily relies on the Davis-Wielandt (DW) shells of matrices, providing a profound insight into matrices subjected to simultaneous gain and phase constraints. This understanding is pivotal for establishing a less conservative sufficient condition for the matrix sectored-disk problem, from which we formulate several robust feedback stability conditions against sectored-disk uncertainty. Finally, several conditions based on linear matrix inequalities are developed for efficient computation and verification of feedback robust stability against sectored-disk uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Semi-Infinite Programs for Robust Control and Optimization: Efficient Solutions and Extensions to Existence Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete-time robust optimal control problems generally take a min-max structure over continuous variable spaces, which can be difficult to solve in practice. In this paper, we extend the class of such problems that can be solved through a previously proposed local reduction method to consider those with existence constraints on the uncountable variables. We also consider the possibility of non-unique trajectories that satisfy equality and inequality constraints. Crucially, we show that the problems of interest can be cast into a standard semi-infinite program and demonstrate how to generate optimal uncertainty scenario sets in order to obtain numerical solutions. We also include examples on model predictive control for obstacle avoidance with logical conditions, control with input saturation affected by uncertainty, and optimal parameter estimation to highlight the need for the proposed extension. Our method solves each of the examples considered, producing violation-free and locally optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>Error estimates for the discretization of bilinear control problems governed by semilinear elliptic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies an optimal control problem governed by a semilinear elliptic equation, in which the control acts in a multiplicative or bilinear way as the reaction coefficient of the equation. We focus on the numerical discretization of the problem. The discretization is carried out by using the finite element method, with piecewise constant functions for the control and continuous piecewise linear functions for the state and the adjoint state. We first prove convergence of the solutions of the discrete problems to solutions of the continuous problem. We also demonstrate that strict local solutions of the continuous problem can be approximated by local solutions of the discrete problems. Next we obtain an error estimate of order $O(h)$ for the difference between continuous and discrete locally optimal controls. To obtain this result we assume no-gap second order sufficient optimality conditions. As it is usual in this kind of discretization, a superconvergence phenomenon of order $O(h^2)$ is observed in numerical experiments for the error estimates of the state and adjoint state. The last part of the paper is dedicated to explain this behaviour. A numerical experiment confirming these results is included.</description>

      <title>Robust Nonparametric Stochastic Frontier Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benchmarking tools, including stochastic frontier analysis (SFA), data envelopment analysis (DEA), and its stochastic extension (StoNED) are core tools in economics used to estimate an efficiency envelope and production inefficiencies from data. The problem appears in a wide range of fields -- for example, in global health the frontier can quantify efficiency of interventions and funding of health initiatives. Despite their wide use, classic benchmarking approaches have key limitations that preclude even wider applicability. Here we propose a robust non-parametric stochastic frontier meta-analysis (SFMA) approach that fills these gaps. First, we use flexible basis splines and shape constraints to model the frontier function, so specifying a functional form of the frontier as in classic SFA is no longer necessary. Second, the user can specify relative errors on input datapoints, enabling population-level analyses. Third, we develop a likelihood-based trimming strategy to robustify the approach to outliers, which otherwise break available benchmarking methods. We provide a custom optimization algorithm for fast and reliable performance. We implement the approach and algorithm in an open source Python package `sfma'. Synthetic and real examples show the new capabilities of the method, and are used to compare SFMA to state of the art benchmarking packages that implement DEA, SFA, and StoNED.</description>

Abstract: We consider optimization problems for interacting particle systems. We show that critical points solve a Vlasov equation, and that in general no minimizers exist despite continuity of the action functional. We prove an explicit representation of the relaxation of the action functional. We show convergence of N-particle minimizers to minimizers of the relaxed action, and finally characterize minimizers of dynamic interacting particle optimal transport problems as solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations.</description>

      <title>Integrated Optimal Control for Fast Charging and Active Thermal Management of Lithium-Ion Batteries in Extreme Ambient Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an integrated control strategy for fast charging and active thermal management of Lithium-ion batteries in extreme ambient temperatures. A control-oriented thermal-NDC (nonlinear double-capacitor) battery model is proposed to describe the electrical and thermal dynamics, accounting for the impact from both an active thermal source and ambient temperature. A state-feedback model predictive control algorithm is then developed for integrated fast charging and active thermal management. Numerical experiments validate the algorithm under extreme temperatures, showing that the proposed algorithm can energy-efficiently adjust the battery temperature to enhance fast charging. Additionally, an output-feedback model predictive control algorithm with an extended Kalman filter is proposed for battery charging when states are partially measurable. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness under extreme temperatures.</description>

Abstract: It is well known that the iterates of an averaged nonexpansive mapping may only converge weakly to fixed point. A celebrated result by Baillon, Bruck, and Reich from 1978 yields strong convergence in the presence of linearity. In this paper, we extend this result to allow for flexible relaxation parameters. Examples are also provided to illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>Implicit Bias of AdamW: $\ell_\infty$ Norm Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adam with decoupled weight decay, also known as AdamW, is widely acclaimed for its superior performance in language modeling tasks, surpassing Adam with $\ell_2$ regularization in terms of generalization and optimization. However, this advantage is not theoretically well-understood. One challenge here is that though intuitively Adam with $\ell_2$ regularization optimizes the $\ell_2$ regularized loss, it is not clear if AdamW optimizes a specific objective. In this work, we make progress toward understanding the benefit of AdamW by showing that it implicitly performs constrained optimization. More concretely, we show in the full-batch setting, if AdamW converges with any non-increasing learning rate schedule whose partial sum diverges, it must converge to a KKT point of the original loss under the constraint that the $\ell_\infty$ norm of the parameter is bounded by the inverse of the weight decay factor. This result is built on the observation that Adam can be viewed as a smoothed version of SignGD, which is the normalized steepest descent with respect to $\ell_\infty$ norm, and a surprising connection between normalized steepest descent with weight decay and Frank-Wolfe.</description>

      <title>Self-organizing Multiagent Target Enclosing under Limited Information and Safety Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to address the target enclosing problem using non-holonomic multiagent systems, where agents autonomously self-organize themselves in the desired formation around a fixed target. Our approach combines global enclosing behavior and local collision avoidance mechanisms by devising a novel potential function and sliding manifold. In our approach, agents independently move toward the desired enclosing geometry when apart and activate the collision avoidance mechanism when a collision is imminent, thereby guaranteeing inter-agent safety. We rigorously show that an agent does not need to ensure safety with every other agent and put forth a concept of the nearest colliding agent (for any arbitrary agent) with whom ensuring safety is sufficient to avoid collisions in the entire swarm. The proposed control eliminates the need for a fixed or pre-established agent arrangement around the target and requires only relative information between an agent and the target. This makes our design particularly appealing for scenarios with limited global information, hence significantly reducing communication requirements. We finally present simulation results to vindicate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>To Cool or not to Cool? Temperature Network Meets Large Foundation Models via DRO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The temperature parameter plays a profound role during training and/or inference with large foundation models (LFMs) such as large language models (LLMs) and CLIP models. Particularly, it adjusts the logits in the softmax function in LLMs, which is crucial for next token generation, and it scales the similarities in the contrastive loss for training CLIP models. A significant question remains: Is it viable to learn a neural network to predict a personalized temperature of any input data for enhancing LFMs"? In this paper, we present a principled framework for learning a small yet generalizable temperature prediction network (TempNet) to improve LFMs. Our solution is composed of a novel learning framework with a robust loss underpinned by constrained distributionally robust optimization (DRO), and a properly designed TempNet with theoretical inspiration. TempNet can be trained together with a large foundation model from scratch or learned separately given a pretrained foundation model. It is not only useful for predicting personalized temperature to promote the training of LFMs but also generalizable and transferable to new tasks. Our experiments on LLMs and CLIP models demonstrate that TempNet greatly improves the performance of existing solutions or models, e.g. Table 1. The code to reproduce the experimental results in this paper can be found at https://github.com/zhqiu/TempNet.</description>

Abstract: The growing focus on reducing energy consumption, particularly in electric vehicles with limited autonomy, has prompted innovative solutions. In this context, we propose a real-time flap-based control system aimed at improving aerodynamic drag in real driving conditions. Employing a Recursive Subspace based Predictive Control (RSPC) approach, we conducted wind tunnel tests on a representative model vehicle at reduced scale equipped with flaps. Comprehensive assessments using pressure measurements and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) were undertaken to evaluate the control efficiency. Static and dynamic perturbation tests were conducted, revealing the system's effectiveness in both scenarios. The closed-loop controlled system demonstrated a substantial gain, achieving a 5\% base pressure recovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an equidistributed set in the whole Euclidean space, we have established in [1] that there exists a constant positive $C$ such that the observability inequality of diffusion equations holds for all $T\in]0,1[$, with an observability cost being of the form $Ce^{C/T}$. In this paper, for any small constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, we prove that there exists a nontrivial equidistributed set (in the sense that whose complementary set is unbounded), so that the above observability cost can be improved to a fast form of $Ce^{\varepsilon/T}$ for certain constant $C&gt;0$. The proof is based on the strategy used in [1], as well as an interpolation inequality for gradients of solutions to elliptic equations obtained recently in [2].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study revisits the problem of identifying the unknown interior Robin boundary of a connected domain using Cauchy data from the exterior region of a harmonic function. It investigates two shape optimization reformulations employing least-squares boundary-data-tracking cost functionals. Firstly, it rigorously addresses the existence of optimal shape solutions, thus filling a gap in the literature. The argumentation utilized in the proof strategy is contingent upon the specific formulation under consideration. Secondly, it demonstrates the ill-posed nature of the two shape optimization formulations by establishing the compactness of the Riesz operator associated with the quadratic shape Hessian corresponding to each cost functional. Lastly, the study employs multiple sets of Cauchy data to address the difficulty of detecting concavities in the unknown boundary. Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions illustrate the numerical procedure relying on Sobolev gradients proposed herein.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we solve an optimal control problem governed by a system of mean-field stochastic differential equations with multiple defaults (MMFSDEs). We transform the global optimal control problem into several optimal control subproblems governed by a system of mean-field stochastic differential equations with single default (SMFSDEs) and derive both the sufficient and necessary maximum principles for these subproblems. We also give the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the MMFSDEs and the mean-field backward stochastic differential equations with multiple defaults (MMFBSDEs), respectively. Finally, as an example, our results are applied to obtain the explicit solution for an optimal control problem whose cost function is considered as a recursive utility process with multiple defaults.</description>

      <title>Minimax Adaptive Control for a Finite Set of Linear Systems</title>

Abstract: An adaptive controller with bounded l2-gain from disturbances to errors is derived for linear time-invariant systems with uncertain parameters restricted to a finite set. The gain bound refers to the closed loop system, including the non-linear learning procedure. As a result, robustness to unmodelled dynamics (possibly nonlinear and infinite-dimensional) follows from the small gain theorem. The approach is based on a new zero-sum dynamic game formulation, which optimizes the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. An explicit upper bound on the optimal value function is stated in terms of semi-definite programming and a corresponding simple formula for an adaptive controller achieving the upper bound is given. Once the uncertain parameters have been sufficiently estimated, the controller behaves like standard H-infinity optimal control.</description>

      <title>The quadratic minimum spanning tree problem: lower bounds via extended formulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.10647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quadratic minimum spanning tree problem (QMSTP) is the problem of finding a spanning tree of a graph such that the total interaction cost between pairs of edges in the tree is minimized. We first show that most of the bounding approaches for the QMSTP are closely related. Then, we exploit an extended formulation for the minimum spanning tree problem to derive a sequence of relaxations for the QMSTP with increasing complexity. The resulting relaxations differ from the relaxations in the literature. Namely, our relaxations have a polynomial number of constraints and can be efficiently solved by a cutting plane algorithm. Moreover our bounds outperform most of the bounds from the literature.</description>

      <title>Application-Driven Learning: A Closed-Loop Prediction and Optimization Approach Applied to Dynamic Reserves and Demand Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.13273v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forecasting and decision-making are generally modeled as two sequential steps with no feedback, following an open-loop approach. In this paper, we present application-driven learning, a new closed-loop framework in which the processes of forecasting and decision-making are merged and co-optimized through a bilevel optimization problem. We present our methodology in a general format and prove that the solution converges to the best estimator in terms of the expected cost of the selected application. Then, we propose two solution methods: an exact method based on the KKT conditions of the second-level problem and a scalable heuristic approach suitable for decomposition methods. The proposed methodology is applied to the relevant problem of defining dynamic reserve requirements and conditional load forecasts, offering an alternative approach to current ad hoc procedures implemented in industry practices. We benchmark our methodology with the standard sequential least-squares forecast and dispatch planning process. We apply the proposed methodology to an illustrative system and to a wide range of instances, from dozens of buses to large-scale realistic systems with thousands of buses. Our results show that the proposed methodology is scalable and yields consistently better performance than the standard open-loop approach.</description>

Abstract: Consider the problem of minimizing a polynomial $f$ over a compact semialgebraic set ${\mathbf{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n}$. Lasserre introduces hierarchies of semidefinite programs to approximate this hard optimization problem, based on classical sum-of-squares certificates of positivity of polynomials due to Putinar and Schm\"udgen. When $\mathbf{X}$ is the unit ball or the standard simplex, we show that the hierarchies based on the Schm\"udgen-type certificates converge to the global minimum of $f$ at a rate in $O(1/r^2)$, matching recently obtained convergence rates for the hypersphere and hypercube $[-1,1]^n$. For our proof, we establish a connection between Lasserre's hierarchies and the Christoffel-Darboux kernel, and make use of closed form expressions for this kernel derived by Xu.</description>

      <title>An Enhanced ADMM-based Interior Point Method for Linear and Conic Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.01793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ADMM-based interior point (ABIP, Lin et al. 2021) method is a hybrid algorithm that effectively combines interior point method (IPM) and first-order methods to achieve a performance boost in large-scale linear optimization. Different from traditional IPM that relies on computationally intensive Newton steps, the ABIP method applies the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to approximately solve the barrier penalized problem. However, similar to other first-order methods, this technique remains sensitive to condition number and inverse precision. In this paper, we provide an enhanced ABIP method with multiple improvements. Firstly, we develop an ABIP method to solve the general linear conic optimization and establish the associated iteration complexity. Secondly, inspired by some existing methods, we develop different implementation strategies for ABIP method, which substantially improve its performance in linear optimization. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments in both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the empirical advantage of our developments. In particular, the enhanced ABIP method achieves a 5.8x reduction in the geometric mean of run time on $105$ selected LP instances from Netlib, and it exhibits advantages in certain structured problems such as SVM and PageRank. However, the enhanced ABIP method still falls behind commercial solvers in many benchmarks, especially when high accuracy is desired. We posit that it can serve as a complementary tool alongside well-established solvers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.15531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a novel algorithm for nonconvex composite minimization which can be interpreted in terms of dual space nonlinear preconditioning for the classical proximal gradient method. The proposed scheme can be applied to additive composite minimization problems whose smooth part exhibits an anisotropic descent inequality relative to a reference function. It is proved that the anisotropic descent property is closed under pointwise average if the dual Bregman distance is jointly convex and, more specifically, closed under pointwise conic combinations for the KL-divergence. We analyze the method's asymptotic convergence and prove its linear convergence under an anisotropic proximal gradient dominance condition. Applications are discussed including exponentially regularized LPs and logistic regression with nonsmooth regularization. In numerical experiments we show significant improvements of the proposed method over its Euclidean counterparts.</description>

      <title>A Non-Gaussian Bayesian Filter Using Power and Generalized Logarithmic Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13383v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to propose a consistent non-Gaussian Bayesian filter of which the system state is a continuous function. The distributions of the true system states, and those of the system and observation noises, are only assumed Lebesgue integrable with no prior constraints on what function classes they fall within. This type of filter has significant merits in both theory and practice, which is able to ameliorate the curse of dimensionality for the particle filter, a popular non-Gaussian Bayesian filter of which the system state is parameterized by discrete particles and the corresponding weights. We first propose a new type of statistics, called the generalized logarithmic moments. Together with the power moments, they are used to form a density surrogate, parameterized as an analytic function, to approximate the true system state. The map from the parameters of the proposed density surrogate to both the power moments and the generalized logarithmic moments is proved to be a diffeomorphism, establishing the fact that there exists a unique density surrogate which satisfies both moment conditions. This diffeomorphism also allows us to use gradient methods to treat the convex optimization problem in determining the parameters. Last but not least, simulation results reveal the advantage of using both sets of moments for estimating mixtures of complicated types of functions. A robot localization simulation is also given, as an engineering application to validate the proposed filtering scheme.</description>

      <title>An adaptive weighted self-representation method for incomplete multi-view clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For multi-view data in reality, part of its elements may be missing because of human or machine error. Incomplete multi-view clustering (IMC) clusters the incomplete multi-view data according to the characters of various views of the instances. Recently, IMC has attracted much attention and many related methods have been proposed. However, the existing approaches still need to be developed and innovated in the following aspects: (1) Current methods only consider the differences of different views, while the different influences of instances, as well as distinguishes between missing values and completed values are ignored. (2) The updating scheme for weighting matrix in adaptive weighted algorithms usually relies on an optimization sub-problem, whose optimal solution may not be easy to achieve. (3) The adaptive weighted subspace algorithms that can recover the incomplete data are anchor types. The randomness of the anchor matrix may cause unreliability. To tackle these limitations, we propose an adaptive weighted self-representation (AWSR) subspace method for IMC. The AWSR method tunes the weighting matrix adaptively in accordance with the views of different instances and the recovery process of the missing values. The low rank and smoothness constraints on the representation matrix make the subspace reveal the underlying features of the dataset accurately. We also analyze the convergence property of the block coordinate method for our optimization model theoretically. Numerical performance on five real-world data shows that the AWSR method is effective and delivers superior results when compared to other eight widely-used approaches considering the clustering accuracy (ACC), normalized mutual information (NMI) and Purity.</description>

Abstract: We study discrete-time finite-horizon optimal control problems in probability spaces, whereby the state of the system is a probability measure. We show that, in many instances, the solution of dynamic programming in probability spaces results from two ingredients: (i) the solution of dynamic programming in the "ground space" (i.e., the space on which the probability measures live) and (ii) the solution of an optimal transport problem. From a multi-agent control perspective, a separation principle holds: The "low-level control of the agents of the fleet" (how does one reach the destination?) and "fleet-level control" (who goes where?) are decoupled.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For finite-sum optimization, variance-reduced gradient methods (VR) compute at each iteration the gradient of a single function (or of a mini-batch), and yet achieve faster convergence than SGD thanks to a carefully crafted lower-variance stochastic gradient estimator that reuses past gradients. Another important line of research of the past decade in continuous optimization is the adaptive algorithms such as AdaGrad, that dynamically adjust the (possibly coordinate-wise) learning rate to past gradients and thereby adapt to the geometry of the objective function. Variants such as RMSprop and Adam demonstrate outstanding practical performance that have contributed to the success of deep learning. In this work, we present AdaLVR, which combines the AdaGrad algorithm with loopless variance-reduced gradient estimators such as SAGA or L-SVRG that benefits from a straightforward construction and a streamlined analysis. We assess that AdaLVR inherits both good convergence properties from VR methods and the adaptive nature of AdaGrad: in the case of $L$-smooth convex functions we establish a gradient complexity of $O(n+(L+\sqrt{nL})/\varepsilon)$ without prior knowledge of $L$. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of AdaLVR over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we empirically show that the RMSprop and Adam algorithm combined with variance-reduced gradients estimators achieve even faster convergence.</description>

      <title>A VMiPG method for composite optimization with nonsmooth term having no closed-form proximal mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the minimization of the sum of a twice continuously differentiable function $f$ and a nonsmooth convex function $g$ without closed-form proximal mapping. For this class of nonconvex and nonsmooth problems, we propose a line-search based variable metric inexact proximal gradient (VMiPG) method with uniformly bounded positive definite variable metric linear operators. This method computes in each step an inexact minimizer of a strongly convex model such that the difference between its objective value and the optimal value is controlled by its squared distance from the current iterate, and then seeks an appropriate step-size along the obtained direction with an armijo line-search criterion. We prove that the iterate sequence converges to a stationary point when $f$ and $g$ are definable in the same o-minimal structure over the real field $(\mathbb{R},+,\cdot)$, and if addition the objective function $f+g$ is a KL function of exponent $1/2$, the convergence has a local R-linear rate. The proposed VMiPG method with the variable metric linear operator constructed by the Hessian of the function $f$ is applied to the scenario that $f$ and $g$ have common composite structure, and numerical comparison with a state-of-art variable metric line-search algorithm indicates that the Hessian-based VMiPG method has a remarkable advantage in terms of the quality of objective values and the running time for those difficult problems such as high-dimensional fused weighted-lasso regressions.</description>

      <title>Integral Inequalities for the Analysis of Distributed Parameter Systems: A complete characterization via the Least-Squares Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A wide variety of integral inequalities (IIs) have been developed and studied for the stability analysis of distributed parameter systems using the Lyapunov functional approach. However, no unified mathematical framework has been proposed that could characterize the similarity and connection between these IIs, as most of them was introduced in a dispersed manner for the analysis of specific types of systems. Additionally, the extent to which the generality of these IIs can be expanded and the optimality of their lower bounds (LBs) remains open questions. In this study, we introduce two general classes of IIs that can generalize nearly all IIs in the literature. The integral kernels of the LBs of our IIs can contain an unlimited number of weighted $\mathcal{L}^2$ functions that are linearly independent in a Lebesgue sense. Moreover, we not only establish the equivalence relations between the LBs of our IIs, but also demonstrate that these LBs are guaranteed by the least squares principle, implying asymptotic convergence to the upper bound when the kernels functions constitutes a Schauder basis of the underlying Hilbert space. Owing to their general structures, our IIs are applicable in a variety of contexts, such as the stability analysis of coupled PDE-ODE systems or cybernetic systems with delay structures.</description>

      <title>Local Lipschitz Constant Computation of ReLU-FNNs: Upper Bound Computation with Exactness Verification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the computation of the local Lipschitz constant of feedforward neural networks (FNNs) with activation functions being rectified linear units (ReLUs). The local Lipschitz constant of an FNN for a target input is a reasonable measure for its quantitative evaluation of the reliability. By following a standard procedure using multipliers that capture the behavior of ReLUs,we first reduce the upper bound computation problem of the local Lipschitz constant into a semidefinite programming problem (SDP). Here we newly introduce copositive multipliers to capture the ReLU behavior accurately. Then, by considering the dual of the SDP for the upper bound computation, we second derive a viable test to conclude the exactness of the computed upper bound. However, these SDPs are intractable for practical FNNs with hundreds of ReLUs. To address this issue, we further propose a method to construct a reduced order model whose input-output property is identical to the original FNN over a neighborhood of the target input. We finally illustrate the effectiveness of the model reduction and exactness verification methods with numerical examples of practical FNNs.</description>

      <title>Tightening QC Relaxations of AC Optimal Power Flow through Improved Linear Convex Envelopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) is a fundamental problem in power system operations. Accurately modeling the network physics via the AC power flow equations makes AC OPF a challenging nonconvex problem. To search for global optima, recent research has developed a variety of convex relaxations that bound the optimal objective values of AC OPF problems. The well-known QC relaxation convexifies the AC OPF problem by enclosing the non-convex terms (trigonometric functions and products) within convex envelopes. The accuracy of this method strongly depends on the tightness of these envelopes. This paper proposes two improvements for tightening QC relaxations of OPF problems. We first consider a particular nonlinear function whose projections are the nonlinear expressions appearing in the polar representation of the power flow equations. We construct a convex envelope around this nonlinear function that takes the form of a polytope and then use projections of this envelope to obtain convex expressions for the nonlinear terms. Second, we use certain characteristics of the sine and cosine expressions along with the changes in their curvature to tighten this convex envelope. We also propose a coordinate transformation that rotates the power flow equations by an angle specific to each bus in order to obtain a tighter envelope. We demonstrate these improvements relative to a state-of-the-art QC relaxation implementation using the PGLib-OPF test cases. The results show improved optimality gaps in 68% of these cases.</description>

Abstract: Building upon the dynamic programming principle for set valued functions arising from many applications, in this paper we propose a new notion of set valued PDEs. The key component in the theory is a set valued It\^{o} formula, characterizing the flows on the surface of the dynamic sets. In the contexts of multivariate control problems, we establish the wellposedness of the set valued HJB equations, which extends the standard HJB equations in the scalar case to the multivariate case. As an application, a moving scalarization for certain time inconsistent problems is constructed by using the classical solution of the set valued HJB equation.</description>

      <title>A new use of the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property to study asymptotic behaviours of some stochastic optimization algorithms in a non-convex differentiable framework</title>

Abstract: The asymptotic analysis of a generic stochastic optimization algorithm mainly relies on the establishment of a specific descent condition. While the convexity assumption allows for technical shortcuts and generally leads to strict convergence, dealing with the non-convex framework, on the contrary, requires the use of specific results as those relying on the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) theory. While such tools have become popular in the field of deterministic optimisation, they are much less widespread in the stochastic context and, in this case, the few works making use of them are essentially based on trajectory-by-trajectory approaches. In this paper, we propose a new methodology, also based on KL theory, for deeper asymptotic investigations on a stochastic scheme verifying a descent condition. The specificity of our work is here to be of macroscopic nature insofar as our strategy of proof is more in-expectation-based and therefore seems more natural typically with respect to the noise properties, of conditional order, encountered in the stochastic literature nowadays.</description>

      <title>A method for multi-leader-multi-follower games by smoothing the followers' response function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multi-leader--multi-follower game (MLMFG) involves two or more leaders and followers and serves as a generalization of the Stackelberg game and the single-leader--multi-follower game (SLMFG). Although MLMFG covers wide range of real-world applications, its research is still sparse. Notably, fundamental solution methods for this class of problems remain insufficiently established. A prevailing approach is to recast the MLMFG as an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) and solve it using a solver. Meanwhile, interpreting the solution to the EPEC in the context of MLMFG may be complex due to shared decision variables among all leaders, followers' strategies that each leader can unilaterally change, but the variables are essentially controlled by followers. To address this issue, we introduce a response function of followers' noncooperative game that is a function with leaders' strategies as a variable. Employing this approach allows the MLMFG to be solved as a single-level differentiable variational inequality using a smoothing scheme for the followers' response function. We also demonstrate that the sequence of solutions to the smoothed variational inequality converges to a stationary equilibrium of the MLMFG. Finally, we illustrate the behavior of the smoothing method by numerical experiments and confirm its validity.</description>

      <title>Electric Vehicle Routing Problem for Emergency Power Supply: Towards Telecom Base Station Relief</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a telecom provider, our company has a critical mission to maintain telecom services even during power outages. To accomplish the mission, it is essential to maintain the power of the telecom base stations. Here we consider a solution where electric vehicles (EVs) directly supply power to base stations by traveling to their locations. The goal is to find EV routes that minimize both the total travel distance of all EVs and the number of downed base stations. In this paper, we formulate this routing problem as a new variant of the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) and propose a solver that combines a rule-based vehicle selector and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based node selector. The rule of the vehicle selector ensures the exact environmental states when the selected EV starts to move. In addition, the node selection by the RL model enables fast route generation, which is critical in emergencies. We evaluate our solver on both synthetic datasets and real datasets. The results show that our solver outperforms baselines in terms of the objective value and computation time. Moreover, we analyze the generalization and scalability of our solver, demonstrating the capability toward unseen settings and large-scale problems.

      <title>An Inexact Regularized Proximal Newton Method without Line Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an inexact regularized proximal Newton method (IRPNM) that does not require any line search. The method is designed to minimize the sum of a twice continuously differentiable function $f$ and a convex (possibly non-smooth and extended-valued) function $\varphi$. Instead of controlling a step size by a line search procedure, we update the regularization parameter in a suitable way, based on the success of the previous iteration. The global convergence of the sequence of iterations and its superlinear convergence rate under a local H\"olderian error bound assumption are shown. Notably, these convergence results are obtained without requiring a global Lipschitz property for $ \nabla f $, which, to the best of the authors' knowledge, is a novel contribution for proximal Newton methods. To highlight the efficiency of our approach, we provide numerical comparisons with an IRPNM using a line search globalization and a modern FISTA-type method.</description>

      <title>Fitting ARMA Time Series Models without Identification: A Proximal Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2002.06777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fitting autoregressive moving average (ARMA) time series models requires model identification before parameter estimation. Model identification involves determining the order of the autoregressive and moving average components which is generally performed by inspection of the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions or other offline methods. In this work, we regularize the parameter estimation optimization problem with a non-smooth hierarchical sparsity-inducing penalty based on two path graphs that allow performing model identification and parameter estimation simultaneously. A proximal block coordinate descent algorithm is then proposed to solve the underlying optimization problem efficiently. The resulting model satisfies the required stationarity and invertibility conditions for ARMA models. Numerical results supporting the proposed method are also presented.</description>

      <title>Approximate Information States for Worst-Case Control and Learning in Uncertain Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate discrete-time decision-making problems in uncertain systems with partially observed states. We consider a non-stochastic model, where uncontrolled disturbances acting on the system take values in bounded sets with unknown distributions. We present a general framework for decision-making in such problems by using the notion of the information state and approximate information state, and introduce conditions to identify an uncertain variable that can be used to compute an optimal strategy through a dynamic program (DP). Next, we relax these conditions and define approximate information states that can be learned from output data without knowledge of system dynamics. We use approximate information states to formulate a DP that yields a strategy with a bounded performance loss. Finally, we illustrate the application of our results in control and reinforcement learning using numerical examples.</description>

      <title>On the Circuit Diameter Conjecture for Counterexamples to the Hirsch Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circuit diameters of polyhedra are a fundamental tool for studying the complexity of circuit augmentation schemes for linear programming and for finding lower bounds on combinatorial diameters. The main open problem in this area is the circuit diameter conjecture, the analogue of the Hirsch conjecture in the circuit setting. A natural question is whether the well-known counterexamples to the Hirsch conjecture carry over. Previously, Stephen and Yusun showed that the Klee-Walkup counterexample to the unbounded Hirsch conjecture does not transfer to the circuit setting. Our main contribution is to show that the original counterexamples for the other variants, for bounded polytopes and using monotone walks, also do not transfer.
  Our results rely on new observations on structural properties of these counterexamples. To resolve the bounded case, we exploit the geometry of certain $2$-faces of the polytopes underlying all known bounded Hirsch counterexamples in Santos' work. For Todd's monotone Hirsch counterexample, we provide two alternative approaches. The first one uses sign-compatible circuit walks, and the second one uses the observation that Todd's polytope is anti-blocking. Along the way, we enumerate all linear programs over the polytope and find four new orientations that contradict the monotone Hirsch conjecture, while the remaining $7107$ satisfy the bound.</description>

      <title>Statistically Optimal K-means Clustering via Nonnegative Low-rank Semidefinite Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18436v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $K$-means clustering is a widely used machine learning method for identifying patterns in large datasets. Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations have recently been proposed for solving the $K$-means optimization problem that enjoy strong statistical optimality guarantees, but the prohibitive cost of implementing an SDP solver renders these guarantees inaccessible to practical datasets. By contrast, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a simple clustering algorithm that is widely used by machine learning practitioners, but without a solid statistical underpinning nor rigorous guarantees. In this paper, we describe an NMF-like algorithm that works by solving a nonnegative low-rank restriction of the SDP relaxed $K$-means formulation using a nonconvex Burer--Monteiro factorization approach. The resulting algorithm is just as simple and scalable as state-of-the-art NMF algorithms, while also enjoying the same strong statistical optimality guarantees as the SDP. In our experiments, we observe that our algorithm achieves substantially smaller mis-clustering errors compared to the existing state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Learning Dissipative Neural Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider an unknown nonlinear dynamical system that is known to be dissipative. The objective of this paper is to learn a neural dynamical model that approximates this system, while preserving the dissipativity property in the model. In general, imposing dissipativity constraints during neural network training is a hard problem for which no known techniques exist. In this work, we address the problem of learning a dissipative neural dynamical system model in two stages. First, we learn an unconstrained neural dynamical model that closely approximates the system dynamics. Next, we derive sufficient conditions to perturb the weights of the neural dynamical model to ensure dissipativity, followed by perturbation of the biases to retain the fit of the model to the trajectories of the nonlinear system. We show that these two perturbation problems can be solved independently to obtain a neural dynamical model that is guaranteed to be dissipative while closely approximating the nonlinear system.</description>

      <title>Effect of Constraint Relaxation on the Minimum Vertex Cover Problem in Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A statistical-mechanical study of the effect of constraint relaxation on the minimum vertex cover problem in Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs is presented. Using a penalty-method formulation for constraint relaxation, typical properties of solutions, including infeasible solutions that violate the constraints, are analyzed by means of the replica method and cavity method. The problem involves a competition between reducing the number of vertices to be covered and satisfying the edge constraints. The analysis under the replica-symmetric (RS) ansatz clarifies that the competition leads to degeneracies in the vertex and edge states, which determine the quantitative properties of the system, such as the cover and penalty ratios. A precise analysis of these effects improves the accuracy of RS approximation for the minimum cover ratio in the replica symmetry breaking (RSB) region. Furthermore, the analysis based on the RS cavity method indicates that the RS/RSB boundary of the ground states with respect to the mean degree of the graphs is expanded, and the critical temperature is lowered by constraint relaxation.</description>

      <title>On solution of tropical discrete best approximation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a discrete best approximation problem formulated in the framework of tropical algebra, which deals with the theory and applications of algebraic systems with idempotent operations. Given a set of samples of input and output of an unknown function, the problem is to construct a generalized tropical Puiseux polynomial that best approximates the function in the sense of a tropical distance function. The construction of an approximate polynomial involves the evaluation of both unknown coefficient and exponent of each monomial in the polynomial. To solve the approximation problem, we first reduce the problem to an equation in unknown vector of coefficients, which is given by a matrix with entries parameterized by unknown exponents. We derive a best approximate solution of the equation, which yields both vector of coefficients and approximation error parameterized by the exponents. Optimal values of exponents are found by minimization of the approximation error, which is transformed into minimization of a function of exponents over all partitions of a finite set. We solve this minimization problem in terms of max-plus algebra by using a computational procedure based on the agglomerative clustering technique. This solution is extended to the minimization problem of finding optimal exponents in the polynomial in terms of max-algebra. The results obtained are applied to develop new solutions for conventional problems of discrete best Chebyshev approximation of real functions by piecewise linear functions and piecewise Puiseux polynomials. We discuss computational complexity of the proposed solution and estimate upper bounds on the computational time. We demonstrate examples of approximation problems solved in terms of max-plus and max-algebra, and give graphical illustrations.</description>

      <title>An Execution-time-certified QP Algorithm for $\ell_1$ penalty-based Soft-constrained MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Providing an execution time certificate and handling possible infeasibility in closed-loop are two pressing requirements of Model Predictive Control (MPC). To simultaneously meet these two requirements, this paper uses an $\ell_1$ penalty-based soft-constrained MPC formulation and innovatively transforms the resulting non-smooth QP into a box-constrained QP, which is solved by our previously proposed direct and execution-time certified algorithm with only dimension-dependent (data-independent), simple-calculated and exact number of iterations (Wu and Braatz (2023)). This approach not only overcomes the limitation of our previously proposed algorithm (Wu and Braatz (2023)), only applicable to input-constrained MPC, but also enjoys exact recovery feature (exactly recover the same solution when the original problem is feasible) of $\ell_1$ penalty-based soft-constrained MPC formulation without suffering numerical difficulty of the resulting non-smoothness. Other various real-time QP applications, not limited to MPC, would also benefit from our QP algorithm with execution-time certificate and global feasibility.</description>
