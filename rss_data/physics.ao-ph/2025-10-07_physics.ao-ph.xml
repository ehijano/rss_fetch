      <title>Deep learning the sources of MJO predictability: a spectral view of learned features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) is a planetary-scale, intraseasonal tropical rainfall phenomenon crucial for global weather and climate; however, its dynamics and predictability remain poorly understood. Here, we leverage deep learning (DL) to investigate the sources of MJO predictability, motivated by a central difference in MJO theories: which spatial scales are essential for driving the MJO? We first develop a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to forecast the MJO indices (RMM and ROMI). Our model predicts RMM and ROMI up to 21 and 33 days, respectively, achieving skills comparable to leading subseasonal-to-seasonal models such as NCEP. To identify the spatial scales most relevant for MJO forecasting, we conduct spectral analysis of the latent feature space and find that large-scale patterns dominate the learned signals. Additional experiments show that models using only large-scale signals as the input have the same skills as those using all the scales, supporting the large-scale view of the MJO. Meanwhile, we find that small-scale signals remain informative: surprisingly, models using only small-scale input can still produce skillful forecasts up to 1-2 weeks ahead. We show that this is achieved by reconstructing the large-scale envelope of the small-scale activities, which aligns with the multi-scale view of the MJO. Altogether, our findings support that large-scale patterns--whether directly included or reconstructed--may be the primary source of MJO predictability.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric rivers and winter sea ice drive recent reversal in Antarctic ice mass loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since about 2000, the total mass of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) has declined at a near-linear rate, increasing global sea levels. Since 2016, however, satellite gravimetry data reveal a slowdown in net AIS mass loss and a net mass gain since 2020, despite increases in dynamically-driven ice loss by discharge from outlet glaciers. Here we use a suite of reanalyses and regional climate models to show that this reversal is caused by increased precipitation and positive surface mass balance anomalies linked to increased atmospheric river (AR) activity, strengthening westerlies, and loss of sea ice. ARs have become more frequent and intense since 2020, particularly over the Antarctic Peninsula, Queen Maud Land, and Wilkes Land, resulting in strong regional positive mass balance anomalies. High-resolution regional climate model simulations with modified sea ice extent show that the effect of sea ice on enhancing precipitation through increased evaporation accounts for around 10% of the winter increase, but is overall minor compared to remote large-scale processes. Combined, these factors result in accumulation increases that currently offset the mass loss from accelerated ice discharge in Antarctica and point to processes important for future projections.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Evolution of Global Atmospheric Rivers with Vapor Kinetic Energy Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric rivers (ARs) often cause damaging winds, rainfall, and floods. However, the physical mechanisms governing their evolution remain poorly understood. To close this gap, we perform a global Vapor Kinetic Energy (VKE) budget analysis. Using two formulations of VKE, we show that ARs are governed by similar mechanisms regardless of ocean basins. ARs intensify primarily through the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy (PE-to-KE), with horizontal convergence of vapor kinetic energy providing a secondary contribution in some regions. ARs decay mainly through condensation and turbulent dissipation, while their propagation is governed by the downstream convergence and upstream divergence of vapor kinetic energy. We also find PE-to-KE conversion varies spatially and strengthens in regions of greater baroclinic instability or enhanced topographic lifting, e.g., along North America's west coast. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the VKE framework provides a powerful diagnostic for how physical processes shape AR evolution and regional variability.</description>

      <title>Score-based generative emulation of impact-relevant Earth system model outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy targets evolve faster than the Couple Model Intercomparison Project cycles, complicating adaptation and mitigation planning that must often contend with outdated projections. Climate model output emulators address this gap by offering inexpensive surrogates that can rapidly explore alternative futures while staying close to Earth System Model (ESM) behavior. We focus on emulators designed to provide inputs to impact models. Using monthly ESM fields of near-surface temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, and wind speed, we show that deep generative models have the potential to model jointly the distribution of variables relevant for impacts. The specific model we propose uses score-based diffusion on a spherical mesh and runs on a single mid-range graphical processing unit. We introduce a thorough suite of diagnostics to compare emulator outputs with their parent ESMs, including their probability densities, cross-variable correlations, time of emergence, or tail behavior. We evaluate performance across three distinct ESMs in both pre-industrial and forced regimes. The results show that the emulator produces distributions that closely match the ESM outputs and captures key forced responses. They also reveal important failure cases, notably for variables with a strong regime shift in the seasonal cycle. Although not a perfect match to the ESM, the inaccuracies of the emulator are small relative to the scale of internal variability in ESM projections. We therefore argue that it shows potential to be useful in supporting impact assessment. We discuss priorities for future development toward daily resolution, finer spatial scales, and bias-aware training. Code is made available at https://github.com/shahineb/climemu.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking atmospheric circulation variability in an AI emulator, ACE2, and a hybrid model, NeuralGCM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-based atmosphere-land models with prescribed sea surface temperature have notable successes but also biases in their ability to represent atmospheric variability compared to observations. Recently, AI emulators and hybrid models have emerged with the potential to overcome these biases, but still require systematic evaluation against metrics grounded in fundamental atmospheric dynamics. Here, we evaluate the representation of four atmospheric variability benchmarking metrics in a fully data-driven AI emulator (ACE2-ERA5) and hybrid model (NeuralGCM). The hybrid model and emulator can capture the spectra of large-scale tropical waves and extratropical eddy-mean flow interactions, including critical levels. However, both struggle to capture the timescales associated with quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO, $\sim 28$ months) and Southern annular mode propagation ($\sim 150$ days). These dynamical metrics serve as an initial benchmarking tool to inform AI model development and understand their limitations, which may be essential for out-of-distribution applications (e.g., extrapolating to unseen climates).</description>

      <title>DANRA: The Kilometer-Scale Danish Regional Atmospheric Reanalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DANish regional atmospheric ReAnalysis (DANRA) is a novel high-resolution (2.5 km) reanalysis dataset covering Denmark and its surrounding regions over a 34-year period (1990-2023). Denmark's complex coastline, with over 400 islands and an extensive 7,400 km coastline, means that most municipalities experience mixed land-sea variability. This complexity requires a regional climate reanalysis that can resolve fine-scale coastal and inland features, as well as their impact on climate variability. DANRA is based on the HARMONIE-AROME Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and assimilates a comprehensive set of observations, with a particular focus on Denmark. Compared to global reanalyses such as the ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5), DANRA demonstrates superior performance in representing essential climate variables, including near-surface weather parameters during both extreme and ordinary conditions. We illustrate these improvements in the representation of several extreme weather cases over Denmark, such as the December 1999 hurricane-force storm, the July 2022 national temperature record, and the August 2007 cloudburst in South Jutland. DANRA is made to support climate adaptation, impact modelling, and the training of next-generation data-driven atmospheric forecasting models. DANRA is distributed as Zarr dataset freely accessible from an object store, maximizing its usability for climate adaptation, impact modelling, and data-driven research.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Workflows in Climate Modeling: Design Patterns and Insights from Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has been increasingly applied in climate modeling on system emulation acceleration, data-driven parameter inference, forecasting, and knowledge discovery, addressing challenges such as physical consistency, multi-scale coupling, data sparsity, robust generalization, and integration with scientific workflows. This paper analyzes a series of case studies from applied machine learning research in climate modeling, with a focus on design choices and workflow structure. Rather than reviewing technical details, we aim to synthesize workflow design patterns across diverse projects in ML-enabled climate modeling: from surrogate modeling, ML parameterization, probabilistic programming, to simulation-based inference, and physics-informed transfer learning. We unpack how these workflows are grounded in physical knowledge, informed by simulation data, and designed to integrate observations. We aim to offer a framework for ensuring rigor in scientific machine learning through more transparent model development, critical evaluation, informed adaptation, and reproducibility, and to contribute to lowering the barrier for interdisciplinary collaboration at the interface of data science and climate modeling.</description>

      <title>AgentCaster: Reasoning-Guided Tornado Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a growing need to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex, high-impact, real-world tasks to assess their true readiness as reasoning agents. To address this gap, we introduce AgentCaster, a contamination-free framework employing multimodal LLMs end-to-end for the challenging, long-horizon task of tornado forecasting. Within AgentCaster, models interpret heterogeneous spatiotemporal data from a high-resolution convection-allowing forecast archive. We assess model performance over a 40-day period featuring diverse historical data, spanning several major tornado outbreaks and including over 500 tornado reports. Each day, models query interactively from a pool of 3,625 forecast maps and 40,125 forecast soundings for a forecast horizon of 12-36 hours. Probabilistic tornado-risk polygon predictions are verified against ground truths derived from geometric comparisons across disjoint risk bands in projected coordinate space. To quantify accuracy, we propose domain-specific TornadoBench and TornadoHallucination metrics, with TornadoBench highly challenging for both LLMs and domain expert human forecasters. Notably, human experts significantly outperform state-of-the-art models, which demonstrate a strong tendency to hallucinate and overpredict risk intensity, struggle with precise geographic placement, and exhibit poor spatiotemporal reasoning in complex, dynamically evolving systems. AgentCaster aims to advance research on improving LLM agents for challenging reasoning tasks in critical domains.</description>

      <title>Effect of a Fine-Scale Layered Structure of the Atmosphere on Infrasound Signals from Fragmenting Meteoroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of a fine-scale (FS) layered structure in the atmosphere on the propagation of infrasound signals generated by fragmenting meteoroids. Using a pseudo-differential parabolic equation (PPE) approach, we model broadband acoustic signals from point sources at altitudes of 35-100 km. The presence of FS fluctuations in the stratosphere (37-45 km) and the lower thermosphere (100-120 km) modifies ray trajectories, causing multiple arrivals and prolonged signal durations at ground stations. In particular, meteoroids fragmenting at 80-100 km can produce two distinct thermospheric arrivals beyond 150km range, while meteoroids descending to 50 km or below yield weak, long-lived arrivals within the acoustic shadow zone via antiguiding propagation and diffraction. Comparison with observed infrasound data confirms that FS-layered inhomogeneities can account for multi-arrival "N-waves," broadening potential interpretations of meteoroid signals. The results also apply to other atmospheric-entry objects, such as sample return capsules, emphasizing how FS structure impacts shock wave propagation. Our findings advance understanding of wavefield evolution in a layered atmosphere and have broad relevance for global infrasound monitoring of diverse phenomena (e.g., re-entry capsules, rocket launches, and large-scale explosions).</description>

      <title>Incorporating Multivariate Consistency in ML-Based Weather Forecasting with Latent-space Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven machine learning (ML) models have recently shown promise in surpassing traditional physics-based approaches for weather forecasting, leading to a so-called second revolution in weather forecasting. However, most ML-based forecast models treat reanalysis as the truth and are trained under variable-specific loss weighting, ignoring their physical coupling and spatial structure. Over long time horizons, the forecasts become blurry and physically unrealistic under rollout training. To address this, we reinterpret model training as a weak-constraint four-dimensional variational data assimilation (WC-4DVar) problem, treating reanalysis data as imperfect observations. This allows the loss function to incorporate reanalysis error covariance and capture multivariate dependencies. In practice, we compute the loss in a latent space learned by an autoencoder (AE), where the reanalysis error covariance becomes approximately diagonal, thus avoiding the need to explicitly model it in the high-dimensional model space. We show that rollout training with latent-space constraints improves long-term forecast skill and better preserves fine-scale structures and physical realism compared to training with model-space loss. Finally, we extend this framework to accommodate heterogeneous data sources, enabling the forecast model to be trained jointly on reanalysis and multi-source observations within a unified theoretical formulation.</description>

      <title>Zephyrus: An Agentic Framework for Weather Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models for weather science are pre-trained on vast amounts of structured numerical data and outperform traditional weather forecasting systems. However, these models lack language-based reasoning capabilities, limiting their utility in interactive scientific workflows. Large language models (LLMs) excel at understanding and generating text but cannot reason about high-dimensional meteorological datasets. We bridge this gap by building a novel agentic framework for weather science. Our framework includes a Python code-based environment for agents (ZephyrusWorld) to interact with weather data, featuring tools like an interface to WeatherBench 2 dataset, geoquerying for geographical masks from natural language, weather forecasting, and climate simulation capabilities. We design Zephyrus, a multi-turn LLM-based weather agent that iteratively analyzes weather datasets, observes results, and refines its approach through conversational feedback loops. We accompany the agent with a new benchmark, ZephyrusBench, with a scalable data generation pipeline that constructs diverse question-answer pairs across weather-related tasks, from basic lookups to advanced forecasting, extreme event detection, and counterfactual reasoning. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the strong performance of Zephyrus agents over text-only baselines, outperforming them by up to 35 percentage points in correctness. However, on harder tasks, Zephyrus performs similarly to text-only baselines, highlighting the challenging nature of our benchmark and suggesting promising directions for future work.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and improving wave and non-wave stress parametrisations for oceanic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12845v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whenever oceanic currents flow over rough topography, there is an associated stress that acts to modify the flow. In the deep ocean, this stress is predominantly a form drag due to pressure differentials across topography, caused by the formation of internal waves and other baroclinic motions: processes that act on such small scales most global ocean models cannot resolve. Despite the need to incorporate this stress into ocean models, existing parametrisations are limited in their applicability. For instance, most parametrisations are only suitable for small-scale topography and are either for periodic or steady flows, but rarely a combination thereof. Here we summarise some of the most widely used parametrisations and evaluate the accuracy of a carefully selected subset using hundreds of idealised two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations spanning a wide parameter space. We focus on the case of an isolated Gaussian hill as an idealised representation of a seamount. In cases where the parametrisations prove to be inaccurate, we use our data to suggest improved formulations. Our results thus provide a starting point for a comprehensive parameterisation of topographic stresses in ocean models where fine scale topography is unresolved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01823v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a tutorial about uncertainty quantification (UQ) for those who have no background but are interested in learning more in this area. It exploits many very simple examples, which are understandable to undergraduates, to present the ideas of UQ. Topics include characterizing uncertainties using information theory, UQ in linear and nonlinear dynamical systems, UQ via data assimilation, the role of uncertainty in diagnostics, and UQ in advancing efficient modeling. The surprisingly simple examples in each topic explain why and how UQ is essential. Both MATLAB and Python codes are made available for these simple examples.</description>
