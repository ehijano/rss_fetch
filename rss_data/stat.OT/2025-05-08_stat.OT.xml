      <title>Developing Assessment Methods for Evaluating Learning Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research aims to investigate the gender-based learning experiences of engineering students enrolled in the Probability and Statistics course, focusing on the four different assessment methods employed namely direct conceptual learning (DCL), symposium, applied deployment and collaborative learning. The study encompasses 299 engineering students, comprising 90 females and 209 males. Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA), is used to gain deeper insights into the complex interplay between assessment methods and their influence on student learning. The results of the statistical analysis reveal that there are significant differences in the learning outcomes between female and male engineering students in the assessment methods of direct conceptual learning, symposium, and applied deployment. The findings suggest that there is no significant difference in the learning outcomes between female and male engineering students in the collaborative learning assessment method. The graphical representation visually confirms the significant differences in direct conceptual learning, symposium, and applied deployment, while illustrating no significant difference in collaborative learning between female and male engineering students.</description>
