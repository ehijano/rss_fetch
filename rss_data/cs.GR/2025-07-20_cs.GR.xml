      <title>StructInbet: Integrating Explicit Structural Guidance into Inbetween Frame Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose StructInbet, an inbetweening system designed to generate controllable transitions over explicit structural guidance. StructInbet introduces two key contributions. First, we propose explicit structural guidance to the inbetweening problem to reduce the ambiguity inherent in pixel trajectories. Second, we adopt a temporal attention mechanism that incorporates visual identity from both the preceding and succeeding keyframes, ensuring consistency in character appearance.</description>

      <title>DLSF: Dual-Layer Synergistic Fusion for High-Fidelity Image Syn-thesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, Stable Diffusion (SD) has emerged as a state-of-the-art framework for high-fidelity im-age synthesis. However, existing SD models suffer from suboptimal feature aggregation, leading to in-complete semantic alignment and loss of fine-grained details, especially in highly textured and complex scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual-latent integration framework that en-hances feature interactions between the base latent and refined latent representations. Our approach em-ploys a feature concatenation strategy followed by an adaptive fusion module, which can be instantiated as either (i) an Adaptive Global Fusion (AGF) for hier-archical feature harmonization, or (ii) a Dynamic Spatial Fusion (DSF) for spatially-aware refinement. This design enables more effective cross-latent com-munication, preserving both global coherence and local texture fidelity.

      <title>Lab-Scale Gantry Crane Digital Twin Exemplar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research topic of digital twins has attracted a large amount of interest over the past decade. However, publicly available exemplars remain scarce. In the interest of open and reproducible science, in this exemplar paper we present a lab-scale gantry crane and its digital twin. The exemplar comprises both the physical and digital side of the twin system. The physical side consists of the physical crane and its controller. The digital side covers the CAD models and kinematic model of the crane, and provides services for optimal control, historical data logging, data visualization and continuous validation. We used this setup as use case in several previous publications where its functionality was validated. It is publicly available and only relies on other freely available and commonly used software, this way we hope it can be used for future research or education on the topic of digital twins.</description>

      <title>TexGS-VolVis: Expressive Scene Editing for Volume Visualization via Textured Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in volume visualization (VolVis) focus on extracting insights from 3D volumetric data by generating visually compelling renderings that reveal complex internal structures. Existing VolVis approaches have explored non-photorealistic rendering techniques to enhance the clarity, expressiveness, and informativeness of visual communication. While effective, these methods often rely on complex predefined rules and are limited to transferring a single style, restricting their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we advocate the representation of VolVis scenes using differentiable Gaussian primitives combined with pretrained large models to enable arbitrary style transfer and real-time rendering. However, conventional 3D Gaussian primitives tightly couple geometry and appearance, leading to suboptimal stylization results. To address this, we introduce TexGS-VolVis, a textured Gaussian splatting framework for VolVis. TexGS-VolVis employs 2D Gaussian primitives, extending each Gaussian with additional texture and shading attributes, resulting in higher-quality, geometry-consistent stylization and enhanced lighting control during inference. Despite these improvements, achieving flexible and controllable scene editing remains challenging. To further enhance stylization, we develop image- and text-driven non-photorealistic scene editing tailored for TexGS-VolVis and 2D-lift-3D segmentation to enable partial editing with fine-grained control. We evaluate TexGS-VolVis both qualitatively and quantitatively across various volume rendering scenes, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in terms of efficiency, visual quality, and editing flexibility.</description>

      <title>Neural-GASh: A CGA-based neural radiance prediction pipeline for real-time shading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Neural-GASh, a novel real-time shading pipeline for 3D meshes, that leverages a neural radiance field architecture to perform image-based rendering (IBR) using Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA)-encoded vertex information as input. Unlike traditional Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT) methods, that require expensive offline precomputations, our learned model directly consumes CGA-based representations of vertex positions and normals, enabling dynamic scene shading without precomputation. Integrated seamlessly into the Unity engine, Neural-GASh facilitates accurate shading of animated and deformed 3D meshes - capabilities essential for dynamic, interactive environments. The shading of the scene is implemented within Unity, where rotation of scene lights in terms of Spherical Harmonics is also performed optimally using CGA. This neural field approach is designed to deliver fast and efficient light transport simulation across diverse platforms, including mobile and VR, while preserving high rendering quality. Additionally, we evaluate our method on scenes generated via 3D Gaussian splats, further demonstrating the flexibility and robustness of Neural-GASh in diverse scenarios. Performance is evaluated in comparison to conventional PRT, demonstrating competitive rendering speeds even with complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Managing level of detail through peripheral degradation: Effects on search performance with a head-mounted display</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two user studies were performed to evaluate the effect of level-of-detail (LOD) degradation in the periphery of head-mounted displays on visual search performance. In the first study, spatial detail was degraded by reducing resolution. In the second study, detail was degraded in the color domain by using grayscale in the periphery. In each study, 10 subjects were given a complex search task that required users to indicate whether or not a target object was present among distracters. Subjects used several different displays varying in the amount of detail presented. Frame rate, object location, subject input method, and order of display use were all controlled. The primary dependent measures were search time on correctly performed trials and the percentage of all trials correctly performed. Results indicated that peripheral LOD degradation can be used to reduce color or spatial visual complexity by almost half in some search tasks with out significantly reducing performance.</description>

      <title>Flexible 3D Cage-based Deformation via Green Coordinates on B\'{e}zier Patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14068v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cage-based deformation is a fundamental problem in geometry processing, where a cage, a user-specified boundary of a region, is used to deform the ambient space of a given mesh. Traditional 3D cages are typically composed of triangles and quads. While quads can represent non-planar regions when their four corners are not coplanar, they form ruled surfaces with straight isoparametric curves, which limits their ability to handle curved and high-curvature deformations. In this work, we extend the cage for curved boundaries using B\'{e}zier patches, enabling flexible and high-curvature deformations with only a few control points. The higher-order structure of the B\'{e}zier patch also allows for the creation of a more compact and precise curved cage for the input model. Based on Green's third identity, we derive the Green coordinates for the B\'{e}zier cage, achieving shape-preserving deformation with smooth surface boundaries. These coordinates are defined based on the vertex positions and normals of the B\'{e}zier control net. Given that the coordinates are approximately calculated through the Riemann summation, we propose a global projection technique to ensure that the coordinates accurately conform to the linear reproduction property. Experimental results show that our method achieves high performance in handling curved and high-curvature deformations.</description>

      <title>GaVS: 3D-Grounded Video Stabilization via Temporally-Consistent Local Reconstruction and Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video stabilization is pivotal for video processing, as it removes unwanted shakiness while preserving the original user motion intent. Existing approaches, depending on the domain they operate, suffer from several issues (e.g. geometric distortions, excessive cropping, poor generalization) that degrade the user experience. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{GaVS}, a novel 3D-grounded approach that reformulates video stabilization as a temporally-consistent `local reconstruction and rendering' paradigm. Given 3D camera poses, we augment a reconstruction model to predict Gaussian Splatting primitives, and finetune it at test-time, with multi-view dynamics-aware photometric supervision and cross-frame regularization, to produce temporally-consistent local reconstructions. The model are then used to render each stabilized frame. We utilize a scene extrapolation module to avoid frame cropping. Our method is evaluated on a repurposed dataset, instilled with 3D-grounded information, covering samples with diverse camera motions and scene dynamics. Quantitatively, our method is competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art 2D and 2.5D approaches in terms of conventional task metrics and new geometry consistency. Qualitatively, our method produces noticeably better results compared to alternatives, validated by the user study.</description>

      <title>Shape Adaptation for 3D Hairstyle Retargeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is demanding to author an existing hairstyle for novel characters in games and VR applications. However, it is a non-trivial task for artists due to the complicated hair geometries and spatial interactions to preserve. In this paper, we present an automatic shape adaptation method to retarget 3D hairstyles. We formulate the adaptation process as a constrained optimization problem, where all the shape properties and spatial relationships are converted into individual objectives and constraints. To make such an optimization on high-resolution hairstyles tractable, we adopt a multi-scale strategy to compute the target positions of the hair strands in a coarse-to-fine manner. The global solving for the inter-strands coupling is restricted to the coarse level, and the solving for fine details is made local and parallel. In addition, we present a novel hairline edit tool to allow for user customization during retargeting. We achieve it by solving physics-based deformations of an embedded membrane to redistribute the hair roots with minimal distortion. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through quantitative and qualitative experiments on various hairstyles and characters.</description>

      <title>Eye-tracked Virtual Reality: A Comprehensive Survey on Methods and Privacy Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The latest developments in computer hardware, sensor technologies, and artificial intelligence can make virtual reality (VR) and virtual spaces an important part of human everyday life. Eye tracking offers not only a hands-free way of interaction but also the possibility of a deeper understanding of human visual attention and cognitive processes in VR. Despite these possibilities, eye-tracking data also reveals users' privacy-sensitive attributes when combined with the information about the presented stimulus. To address all these possibilities and potential privacy issues, in this survey, we first cover major works in eye tracking, VR, and privacy areas between 2012 and 2022. While eye tracking in the VR part covers the complete pipeline of eye-tracking methodology from pupil detection and gaze estimation to offline use of the data and analyses, as for privacy and security, we focus on eye-based authentication as well as computational methods to preserve the privacy of individuals and their eye-tracking data in VR. Later, considering all of these, we draw three main directions for the research community by focusing on privacy challenges. In summary, this survey provides an extensive literature review of the utmost possibilities with eye tracking in VR and the privacy implications of those possibilities.</description>

      <title>AIvaluateXR: An Evaluation Framework for on-Device AI in XR with Benchmarking Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) on extended reality (XR) devices has great potential to advance the field of human-AI interaction. In the case of direct, on-device model inference, selecting the appropriate model and device for specific tasks remains challenging. In this paper, we present AIvaluateXR, a comprehensive evaluation framework for benchmarking LLMs running on XR devices. To demonstrate the framework, we deploy 17 selected LLMs across four XR platforms: Magic Leap 2, Meta Quest 3, Vivo X100s Pro, and Apple Vision Pro, and conduct an extensive evaluation. Our experimental setup measures four key metrics: performance consistency, processing speed, memory usage, and battery consumption. For each of the 68 model-device pairs, we assess performance under varying string lengths, batch sizes, and thread counts, analyzing the trade-offs for real-time XR applications. We propose a unified evaluation method based on the 3D Pareto Optimality theory to select the optimal device-model pairs from quality and speed objectives. Additionally, we compare the efficiency of on-device LLMs with client-server and cloud-based setups, and evaluate their accuracy on two interactive tasks. We believe our findings offer valuable insight to guide future optimization efforts for LLM deployment on XR devices. Our evaluation method can be used as standard groundwork for further research and development in this emerging field.
