      <title>Critical States of Fermions with ${\mathbb{Z}}_2$ Flux Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by many contemporary problems in condensed matter physics where matter particles experience random gauge fields, we investigate the physics of fermions on a square lattice with $\pi$-flux (that realizes Dirac fermions at low energies), subjected to flux disorder arising from a random ${\mathbb{Z}}_2$ gauge field that results from the presence of flux defects (plaquettes with zero flux). At half-filling, where the system possesses BDI symmetry, we show that a new class of critical phases is realized, with the states at zero energy showing a multifractal character. The multifractal properties depend on the concentration $\mathfrak{c}$ of the $\pi$-flux defects and spatial correlations between the flux defects. These states are characterized by the singularity spectrum, Lyapunov exponents, and transport properties. For any concentration of flux defects, we find that the multi-fractal spectrum shows termination, but $\textit{not freezing}$. We characterize this class of critical states by uncovering a relation between the conductivity and the Lyapunov exponent, which is satisfied by the states irrespective of the concentration or the local correlations between the flux defects. We demonstrate that renormalization group methods, based on perturbing the Dirac point, fail to capture this new class of critical states. This work not only offers new challenges to theory, but is also likely to be useful in understanding a variety of problems where fermions interact with discrete gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Neuromodulation via Krotov-Hopfield Improves Accuracy and Robustness of RBMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In biological systems, neuromodulation tunes synaptic plasticity based on the internal state of the organism, complementing stimulus-driven Hebbian learning. The algorithm recently proposed by Krotov and Hopfield \cite{krotov_2019} can be utilized to mirror this process in artificial neural networks, where its built-in intra-layer competition and selective inhibition of synaptic updates offer a cost-effective remedy for the lack of lateral connections through a simplified attention mechanism. We demonstrate that KH-modulated RBMs outperform standard (shallow) RBMs in both reconstruction and classification tasks, offering a superior trade-off between generalization performance and model size, with the additional benefit of robustness to weight initialization as well as to overfitting during training.</description>

      <title>Temperature chaos may emerge many thermodynamic states in spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a large-scale simulation of the three-dimensional and mean-field spin glasses down to a very low but finite temperature. We extrapolate pertinent observables, e.g., the disorder-averaged central weight to zero temperature, finding that many thermodynamic states at a finite temperature and two ground states at zero temperature are fully compatible. While the disorder-averaged central weight monotonically decreases with decreasing temperature, this is far from true for individual samples. This motivates us to link this behaviour with the well-known temperature chaos. At an observing temperature, a sample may or may not have pure state coexistence depending on whether it is undergoing temperature chaos, which is a random process. Therefore, temperature chaos is likely responsible for the emergence of many pure states, providing a natural and intuitive explanation for the coexistence of expensive domain-wall excitations and many pure states at the disorder-averaged level.</description>

      <title>Design Principles for Realizable Discrete Surface Embeddings in Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isometric embedding of surfaces in three-dimensional space is fundamental to various physical systems, from elastic sheets to programmable materials. While continuous surfaces typically admit unique solutions under suitable boundary conditions, their discrete counterparts-represented as networks of vertices connected by edges-can exhibit multiple distinct embeddings for identical edge lengths. We present a systematic approach to constructing discrete meshes that yield a controlled number of embeddings. By analyzing the relationship between mesh connectivity and embedding multiplicity through rigidity theory, we develop criteria for designing meshes that minimize solution multiplicity. We demonstrate computational methods based on local matrix operations and trilateration techniques, enabling practical implementation for meshes with approximately a thousand vertices. Our analysis provides both theoretical bounds on the number of possible embeddings based on B\'ezout's theorem and practical guidelines for mesh construction in physical applications. Through numerical simulations, we show that this approach achieves comparable accuracy to traditional minimization methods while offering computational advantages through sequential computation. Importantly, we demonstrate that in cases where a unique smooth solution exists, local fluctuations in reconstructed shapes derived from the computational grid can serve as indicators of insufficient geometric constraints. This work bridges the gap between discrete and continuous embedding problems, providing insights for applications in 4D printing, mechanical meta-materials, and deployable structures.</description>

      <title>Interplay of localization and topology in disordered dimerized array of Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg tweezer arrays provide a platform for realizing spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with long-range tunnelings decaying according to power-law with the distance. We numerically investigate the effects of positional disorder and dimerization on the properties of excited states in such a one-dimensional system. Our model allows for the continuous tuning of dimerization patterns and disorder strength. We identify different distinct ergodicity-breaking regimes within the parameter space constrained by our geometry. Notably, one of these regimes exhibits a unique feature in which non-trivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT) properties of the ground state extend to a noticeable fraction of states across the entire spectrum. This interplay between localization and SPT makes the system particularly interesting, as localization should help with stabilization of topological excitations, while SPT states contribute to an additional delocalization. Other regions of parameters correspond to more standard nonergodic dynamics resembling many-body localization.</description>

      <title>Operator Spreading, Duality, and the Noisy Long-Range FKPP Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operator spreading provides a new characterization of quantum chaos beyond the semi-classical limit. There are two complementary views of how the characteristic size of an operator, also known as the butterfly light cone, grows under chaotic quantum time evolution: A discrete stochastic population dynamics or a stochastic reaction-diffusion equation in the continuum. When the interaction decays as a power function of distance, the discrete population dynamics model features superlinear butterfly light cones with stretched exponential or power-law scaling. Its continuum counterpart, a noisy long-range Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscunov (FKPP) equation, remains less understood. We use a mathematical duality to demonstrate their equivalence through an intermediate model, which replaces the hard local population limit by an equilibrium population. Through an algorithm with no finite size effect, we demonstrate numerically remarkable agreements in their light cone scalings.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Learning -- L2 Phase Transitions in Deep and Shallow Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When neural networks (NNs) are subject to L2 regularization, increasing the regularization strength beyond a certain threshold pushes the model into an under-parameterization regime. This transition manifests as a first-order phase transition in single-hidden-layer NNs and a second-order phase transition in NNs with two or more hidden layers. This paper establishes a unified framework for such transitions by integrating the Ricci curvature of the loss landscape with regularizer-driven deep learning. First, we show that a curvature change-point separates the model-accuracy regimes in the onset of learning and that it is identical to the critical point of the phase transition driven by regularization. Second, we show that for more complex data sets additional phase transitions exist between model accuracies, and that they are again identical to curvature change points in the error landscape. Third, by studying the MNIST data set using a Variational Autoencoder, we demonstrate that the curvature change points identify phase transitions in model accuracy outside the L2 setting. Our framework also offers practical insights for optimizing model performance across various architectures and datasets. By linking geometric features of the error landscape to observable phase transitions, our work paves the way for more informed regularization strategies and potentially new methods for probing the intrinsic structure of neural networks beyond the L2 context.</description>

      <title>Ultraslow Growth of Domains in a Random-Field System With Correlated Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study domain growth kinetics in a random-field system in the presence of a spatially correlated disorder $h_{i}(\vec r)$ after an instantaneous quench at a finite temperature $T$ from a random initial state corresponding to $T=\infty$. The correlated disorder field $h_{i}(\vec r)$ arises due to the presence of magnetic impurities, decaying spatially in a power-law fashion. We use Glauber spin-flip dynamics to simulate the kinetics at the microscopic level. The system evolves via the formation of ordered magnetic domains. We characterize the morphology of domains using the equal-time correlation function $C(r,t)$ and structure factor $S(k,t)$. In the large-$k$ limit, $S(k, t)$ obeys Porod's law: $S(k, t)\sim k^{-(d+1)}$. The average domain size $L(t)$ asymptotically follows \textit{double logarithmic growth behavior}.</description>

      <title>Estimating critical disorder strength of an AAH system via thermal response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model provides a paradigmatic platform to study localization phenomena, where a transition from a conducting to an insulating phase occurs at a critical disorder strength equal to twice the nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude, $2t$. While this transition has been explored extensively through various probes, here we propose a fundamentally new approach based on thermal response. Specifically, we demonstrate that the electronic specific heat exhibits a distinctive signature across the transition, directly reflecting the anomalous evolution of the density of states with disorder strength. Our findings, supported by numerical analysis, establish specific heat measurement as a powerful and sensitive probe for detecting the critical point. This thermal characterization opens a new avenue for exploring disorder-induced phase transitions and paves the way for experimental realization in engineered quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Learning curves theory for hierarchically compositional data with power-law distributed features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theories suggest that Neural Scaling Laws arise whenever the task is linearly decomposed into power-law distributed units. Alternatively, scaling laws also emerge when data exhibit a hierarchically compositional structure, as is thought to occur in language and images. To unify these views, we consider classification and next-token prediction tasks based on probabilistic context-free grammars -- probabilistic models that generate data via a hierarchy of production rules. For classification, we show that having power-law distributed production rules results in a power-law learning curve with an exponent depending on the rules' distribution and a large multiplicative constant that depends on the hierarchical structure. By contrast, for next-token prediction, the distribution of production rules controls the local details of the learning curve, but not the exponent describing the large-scale behaviour.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws and Representation Learning in Simple Hierarchical Languages: Transformers vs. Convolutional Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do neural language models acquire a language's structure when trained for next-token prediction? We address this question by deriving theoretical scaling laws for neural network performance on synthetic datasets generated by the Random Hierarchy Model (RHM) -- an ensemble of probabilistic context-free grammars designed to capture the hierarchical structure of natural language while remaining analytically tractable. Previously, we developed a theory of representation learning based on data correlations that explains how deep learning models capture the hierarchical structure of the data sequentially, one layer at a time. Here, we extend our theoretical framework to account for architectural differences. In particular, we predict and empirically validate that convolutional networks, whose structure aligns with that of the generative process through locality and weight sharing, enjoy a faster scaling of performance compared to transformer models, which rely on global self-attention mechanisms. This finding clarifies the architectural biases underlying neural scaling laws and highlights how representation learning is shaped by the interaction between model architecture and the statistical properties of data.</description>

      <title>Majorana edge modes in one-dimensional Kitaev chain with staggered $p$-wave superconducting pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of one-dimensional Kitaev chain with staggered $p$-wave superconducting pairing. We find three physical regimes in this model by tuning the $p$-wave pairing and the chemical potential of the system. In the topologically nontrivial phase, there are two Majorana zero modes localized at the opposite ends of the lattice, which are characterized and protected by nonzero topological invariants. More interestingly, we also find a regime where the system can hold four unprotected nonzero-energy edge modes in the trivial phase, which is analogous to a weak topological phase. The third regime is also trivial but holds no edge modes. The emergence of zero- and nonzero-energy edge modes in the system are analyzed by transforming the lattice model into a ladder consisting of Majorana fermions, where the competition between intra- and inter-leg couplings leads to the rich phase diagram. We further investigate the properties of edge modes under the influences of dissipation, which is represented by introducing a imaginary part in the chemical potential. Our work unveils the exotic properties induced by the staggered $p$-wave pairing and provides a new platform for further exploration of Majorana edge modes.</description>

      <title>Analytic theory of dropout regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dropout is a regularization technique widely used in training artificial neural networks to mitigate overfitting. It consists of dynamically deactivating subsets of the network during training to promote more robust representations. Despite its widespread adoption, dropout probabilities are often selected heuristically, and theoretical explanations of its success remain sparse. Here, we analytically study dropout in two-layer neural networks trained with online stochastic gradient descent. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive a set of ordinary differential equations that fully characterize the evolution of the network during training and capture the effects of dropout. We obtain a number of exact results describing the generalization error and the optimal dropout probability at short, intermediate, and long training times. Our analysis shows that dropout reduces detrimental correlations between hidden nodes, mitigates the impact of label noise, and that the optimal dropout probability increases with the level of noise in the data. Our results are validated by extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Mixed state deep thermalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the mixed state projected ensemble (MSPE), a collection of mixed states describing a local region of a quantum many-body system, conditioned upon measurements of the complementary region which are incomplete. This constitutes a generalization of the pure state projected ensemble in which measurements are assumed ideal and complete, and which has been shown to tend towards limiting pure state distributions depending only on symmetries of the system, thus representing a new kind of universality in quantum equilibration dubbed deep thermalization. We study the MSPE generated by solvable (1+1)d dual-unitary quantum circuit evolution, and identify the limiting mixed state distributions which emerge at late times depending on the size of the incomplete measurement, which we assume to be lossy, finding that they correspond to certain random density matrix ensembles known in the literature. We also derive the rate of the emergence of such universality. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum information properties of the states composing the ensemble, specifically their capacity to teleport quantum information between the ends of the system. The teleportation fidelity is upper bounded by the quantum conditional entropy, which we find exhibits a sharp transition from zero to maximal when the number of measurements lost matches of that the number of degrees of freedom to be teleported. Our results initiate the first investigation of deep thermalization for mixed state ensembles, which are relevant for present-day quantum simulation experiments wherein measurements are typically not perfect, and also amount to a physical and natural way of sampling from hitherto abstract random density matrix ensembles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review a class of energy landscape analysis method that uses the Ising model and takes multivariate time series data as input. The method allows one to capture dynamics of the data as trajectories of a ball from one basin to a different basin to yet another, constrained on the energy landscape specified by the estimated Ising model. While this energy landscape analysis has mostly been applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the brain for historical reasons, there are emerging applications outside fMRI data and neuroscience. To inform such applications in various research fields, this review paper provides a detailed tutorial on each step of the analysis, terminologies, concepts underlying the method, and validation, as well as recent developments of extended and related methods.</description>

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a powerful framework for real-time information processing, characterized by its high computational ability and quick learning, with applications ranging from machine learning to biological systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that the memory capacity of a reservoir recurrent neural network scales sublinearly with the number of readout neurons. To elucidate this phenomenon, we develop a theoretical framework for analytically deriving memory capacity, attributing the decaying growth of memory capacity to neuronal correlations. In addition, numerical simulations reveal that once memory capacity becomes sublinear, increasing the number of readout neurons successively enables nonlinear processing at progressively higher polynomial orders. Furthermore, our theoretical framework suggests that neuronal correlations govern not only memory capacity but also the sequential growth of nonlinear computational capabilities. Our findings establish a foundation for designing scalable and cost-effective reservoir computing, providing novel insights into the interplay among neuronal correlations, linear memory, and nonlinear processing.</description>

      <title>Observation of disorder-induced boundary localization</title>

Abstract: Bloch wavefunctions in crystals experience localization within the bulk when disorder is introduced, a phenomenon commonly known as Anderson localization. This effect is considered universal, being applicable to all types of waves, quantum or classical. However, the interaction between disorder and topology -- a concept that has profoundly transformed many branches of physics -- necessitates revisiting the original Anderson localization picture. For instance, in the recently discovered topological Anderson insulator, the introduction of disorder induces topological boundary states that can resist localization due to protection from line-gap topology. While line-gap topology applies to both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian systems uniquely exhibit point-gap topology, which has no Hermitian counterparts and leads to the non-Hermitian skin effect. Here, we experimentally demonstrate disorder-induced point-gap topology in a non-Hermitian acoustic crystal. This crystal, with non-Hermitian disorder in nearest-neighbor couplings, exhibits the non-Hermitian skin effect, where all eigenstates localize at a boundary. Interestingly, the boundary where localization occurs -- either the left or right -- depends on the strength of the disorder. As the disorder strength increases, the direction of boundary localization can be reversed. Additionally, we observe a ``bipolar" skin effect, where boundary localization occurs at both the left and right boundaries when disorder is introduced in next-nearest-neighbor couplings. These findings experimentally reveal a non-Hermitian mechanism of disorder-induced localization that goes beyond the conventional framework of Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>Normal weak eigenstate thermalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization has been numerically shown to occur for few-body observables in a wide range of nonintegrable models. For intensive sums of few-body observables, a weaker version of eigenstate thermalization known as weak eigenstate thermalization has been proved to occur in general. Here, we unveil a stricter weak eigenstate thermalization phenomenon that occurs in quadratic models exhibiting quantum chaos in the single-particle sector (quantum-chaotic quadratic models) and in integrable interacting models. In such models, we argue that few-body observables that have a properly defined system-size independent norm are guaranteed to exhibit at least a polynomially vanishing variance (over the entire many-body energy spectrum) of the diagonal matrix elements, a phenomenon we dub normal weak eigenstate thermalization. We prove that normal weak eigenstate thermalization is a consequence of single-particle eigenstate thermalization, i.e., it can be viewed as a manifestation of quantum chaos at the single-particle level. We report numerical evidence of normal weak eigenstate thermalization for quantum-chaotic quadratic models such as the three-dimensional Anderson model in the delocalized regime and the power-law random banded matrix model, as well as for the integrable interacting spin-1/2 XYZ and XXZ models.</description>

      <title>Observable Measurement-Induced Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the main postulates of quantum mechanics is that measurements destroy quantum coherence (wave function collapse). Recently it was discovered that in a many-body system dilute local measurements still preserve some coherence across the entire system. As the measurement density is increased, a phase transition occurs that is characterized by the disentanglement of different parts of the system. Unfortunately, this transition is impossible to observe experimentally for macroscopic systems because it requires an exponentially costly full tomography of the many-body wave function or a comparison with the simulation on an oracle classical computer. In this work we report the discovery of another measurement-induced phase transition that can be observed experimentally if quantum dynamics can be reversed. On one side of this phase transition the quantum information encoded in some part of the Hilbert space is fully recovered after the time inversion. On the other side, all quantum information is corrupted. This transition also manifests itself as the change in the behavior of the probability to observe the same measurement outcome in the process that consists of identical blocks repeated many times. In each block the unitary evolution is followed by the measurement. On one side of the transition the probability decreases exponentially with the number of repetitions, on the other it tends to a constant as the number of repetitions is increased. We confirm the existence of the proposed phase transition through numerical simulations of realistic quantum circuits and analytical calculations using an effective random-matrix theory model.</description>

      <title>Anderson transition symmetries at the band-edge of a correlated tin monolayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between Anderson localization and Coulomb repulsion reveals deep connections to superconductivity and many-body localization in quantum systems. In this study, we investigate a tin monolayer on silicon, a material known for its Mott and antiferromagnetic behavior, as it undergoes a metal-insulator transition near a band edge. By analyzing spatial correlations of the local density of states (LDOS) using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we precisely identify the mobility edge and determine its critical exponent as $\nu$ = 0.75 $\pm$ 0.1. We show that both the LDOS distribution functions and the multifractal spectra obey two exact symmetry relations, which are based on the Weyl group symmetry of nonlinear sigma-models. These symmetries hold across the entire transition, from extended to strongly localized states, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Overall, using tunneling spectroscopy maps on a model tin monolayer in combination with numerical models, we connect the localization patterns of disordered electronic systems with their Hamiltonian symmetry class.</description>
