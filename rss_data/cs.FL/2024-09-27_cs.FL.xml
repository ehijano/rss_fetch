      <title>Formal verification of higher dimensional quantum protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal methods have been a successful approach for modelling and verifying the correctness of complex technologies like microprocessor chip design, biological systems and others. This is the main motivation of developing quantum formal techniques which is to describe and analyse quantum information processing systems. Our previous work demonstrates the possibility of using a quantum process calculus called Communicating Quantum Processes (CQP) to model and describe higher dimensional quantum systems. By developing the theory to generalise the fundamental gates and Bell states, we have modelled quantum qudit protocols like teleportation and superdense coding in CQP. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of CQP to analyse higher dimensional quantum protocols. The main idea is to define two processes, one modelling the real protocol and the other expressing a specification, and prove that they are behaviourally equivalent. This is a work-in-progress and we present our preliminary results in extending the theory of behavioural equivalence in CQP to verify higher dimensional quantum protocols using qudits.</description>

      <title>Dynamic direct access of MSO query evaluation over strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of evaluating a Monadic Second Order (MSO) query over strings under updates in the setting of direct access. We present an algorithm that, given an MSO query with first-order free variables represented by an unambiguous variable-set automaton $\mathcal{A}$ with state set $Q$ and variables $X$ and a string $s$, computes a data structure in time $\mathcal{O}(|Q|^\omega\cdot |X|^2 \cdot |s|)$ and, then, given an index $i$ retrieves, using the data structure, the $i$-th output of the evaluation of $\mathcal{A}$ over $s$ in time $\mathcal{O}(|Q|^\omega \cdot |X|^3 \cdot \log(|s|)^2)$ where $\omega$ is the exponent for matrix multiplication. Ours is the first efficient direct access algorithm for MSO query evaluation over strings; such algorithms so far had only been studied for first-order queries and conjunctive queries over relational data.
  Our algorithm gives the answers in lexicographic order where, in contrast to the setting of conjunctive queries, the order between variables can be freely chosen by the user without degrading the runtime. Moreover, our data structure can be updated efficiently after changes to the input string, allowing more powerful updates than in the enumeration literature, e.g.~efficient deletion of substrings, concatenation and splitting of strings, and cut-and-paste operations. Our approach combines a matrix representation of MSO queries and a novel data structure for dynamic word problems over semi-groups which yields an overall algorithm that is elegant and easy to formulate.</description>

      <title>Verifying Randomized Consensus Protocols with Common Coins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomized fault-tolerant consensus protocols with common coins are widely used in cloud computing and blockchain platforms. Due to their fundamental role, it is vital to guarantee their correctness. Threshold automata is a formal model designed for the verification of fault-tolerant consensus protocols. It has recently been extended to probabilistic threshold automata (PTAs) to verify randomized fault-tolerant consensus protocols. Nevertheless, PTA can only model randomized consensus protocols with local coins.
  In this work, we extend PTA to verify randomized fault-tolerant consensus protocols with common coins. Our main idea is to add a process to simulate the common coin (the so-called common-coin process). Although the addition of the common-coin process destroys the symmetry and poses technical challenges, we show how PTA can be adapted to overcome the challenges. We apply our approach to verify the agreement, validity and almost-sure termination properties of 8 randomized consensus protocols with common coins.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Abstractions for Control Systems via Random Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the intersection of dynamical systems, control theory, and formal methods lies the construction of symbolic abstractions: these typically represent simpler, finite-state models whose behavior mimics that of an underlying concrete system but are easier to analyse. Building an abstraction usually requires an accurate knowledge of the underlying model: this knowledge may be costly to gather, especially in real-life applications. We aim to bridge this gap by building abstractions based on sampling finite length trajectories. To refine a controller built for the abstraction to one for the concrete system, we newly define a notion of probabilistic alternating simulation, and provide Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) guarantees that the constructed abstraction includes all behaviors of the concrete system and that it is suitable for control design, for arbitrarily long time horizons, leveraging scenario theory. Our method is then tested on several numerical benchmarks.</description>
