      <title>Minimal dissipation with active baths in weakly driven processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although vastly studied, white noise is just an ideal case of heat baths, which limits us from real-world scenarios. Understanding the underlying thermodynamics of active heat baths is therefore a demanding task, mainly in optimal control. This work investigates such a scenario for finite-time weakly driven processes, observing how the relaxation function changes from the passive to the active case. In particular, we show that the relaxation time modifies according to the active heat bath, bringing the system far from the passive heat bath case from the non-equilibrium point of view. Optimal protocols to minimize the average work and its fluctuation are immediately derived from such observation. Conditions on the kernel are determined to guarantee that the active system also obeys the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Brownian motions subject to harmonic traps with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck baths exemplify our results.</description>

      <title>1D fluids with repulsive nearest-neighbour interactions: Low-temperature anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A limited number of 2D and 3D materials under a constant pressure contract in volume upon heating isobarically; this anomalous phenomenon is known as the negative thermal expansion (NTE). In this paper, the NTE anomaly is observed in 1D fluids of classical particles interacting pairwisely with two competing length scales: the hard-core diameter $a$ and the finite range $a'&gt;a$ of a soft repulsive potential component. If $a'\le 2a$, the pair interactions reduce themselves to nearest neighbours which permits a closed-form solution of thermodynamics in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble characterized by temperature $T$ and pressure $p$. We focus on the equation of state (EoS) which relates the average distance between particles (reciprocal density) $l$ to $T$ and $p\ge 0$. The EoS is expressible explicitly in terms of elementary or special functions for specific, already known and new, cases like the square shoulder, the linear and quadratic ramps as well as certain types of logarithmic interaction potentials. The emphasis is put on low-$T$ anomalies of the EoS. Firstly, the equidistant ground state as the function of the pressure can exhibit, at some ``compressibility'' pressures, a jump in chain spacing from $a'$ to $a$. Secondly, the analytical structure of the low-$T$ expansion of $l(T,p)$ depends on ranges of $p$-values. Thirdly, the presence of the NTE anomaly depends very much on the shape of the core-softened potential.</description>

      <title>Learning to reset in target search problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Target search problems are central to a wide range of fields, from biological foraging to the optimization algorithms. Recently, the ability to reset the search has been shown to significantly improve the searcher's efficiency. However, the optimal resetting strategy depends on the specific properties of the search problem and can often be challenging to determine. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework to train agents capable of optimizing their search efficiency in environments by learning how to reset. First, we validate the approach in a well-established benchmark: the Brownian search with resetting. There, RL agents consistently recover strategies closely resembling the sharp resetting distribution, known to be optimal in this scenario. We then extend the framework by allowing agents to control not only when to reset, but also their spatial dynamics through turning actions. In this more complex setting, the agents discover strategies that adapt both resetting and turning to the properties of the environment, outperforming the proposed benchmarks. These results demonstrate how reinforcement learning can serve both as an optimization tool and a mechanism for uncovering new, interpretable strategies in stochastic search processes with resetting.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Heat Baths, Coarse-Graining and Irreversibility: A Microscopic Dynamical Entropy from Classical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hamiltonian evolution of an isolated classical system is reversible, yet the second law of thermodynamics states that its entropy can only increase. This has confounded attempts to identify a `Microscopic Dynamical Entropy' (MDE), by which we mean an entropy computable from the system's evolving phase-space density $\rho(t)$, that equates {\em quantitatively} to its thermodynamic entropy $S^{\rm th}(t)$, both within and beyond equilibrium. Specifically, under Hamiltonian dynamics the Gibbs entropy of $\rho$ is conserved in time; those of coarse-grained approximants to $\rho$ show a second law but remain quantitatively unrelated to heat flow. Moreover coarse-graining generally destroys the Hamiltonian evolution, giving paradoxical predictions when $\rho(t)$ exactly rewinds, as it does after velocity-reversal. Here we derive the MDE for an isolated system XY in which subsystem Y acts as a heat bath for subsystem X. We allow $\rho_{XY}(t)$ to evolve without coarse-graining, but compute its entropy by disregarding the detailed structure of $\rho_{Y|X}$. The Gibbs entropy of the resulting phase-space density $\tilde\rho_{XY}(t)$ comprises the MDE for the purposes of both classical and stochastic thermodynamics. The MDE obeys the second law whenever $\rho_X$ evolves independently of the details of Y, yet correctly rewinds after velocity-reversal of the full XY system.</description>

      <title>Exact Results for the Ericson Transition in Stochastic Quantum Scattering and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At lower energies, the resonances in scattering experiments are often isolated. The crucial parameter is the ratio of average resonance width and average mean level spacing. Towards larger energies, this parameter grows, because the resonances overlap. Eventually the cross-section becomes a random function and the scattering matrix elements follow a universal Gaussian distribution. For more than sixty years, this Ericson transition awaits a concise analytical treatment. We provide a complete solution within the Heidelberg approach which provides a full-fledged model of the scattering process. As a side result, we obtain explicit formulae for the moments of the distributions. We compare with microwave experiments.</description>

      <title>Towards Markov-State Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments, in particular on biological systems, typically probe lower-dimensional observables which are projections of high-dimensional dynamics. In order to infer consistent models capturing the relevant dynamics of the system, it is important to detect and account for the memory in the dynamics. We develop a method to infer the presence of hidden states and transition pathways based on observable transition probabilities conditioned on history sequences for projected (i.e. observed) dynamics of Markov processes. Histograms conditioned on histories reveal information on the transition probabilities of hidden paths locally between any specific pair of observed states. The convergence rate of these histograms towards a stationary distribution provides a local quantification of the duration of memory, which reflects how distinct microscopic paths projecting onto the same observed transition decorrelate in path space. This provides insight about the hidden topology of microscopic paths in a holography-like fashion. The method can be used to test for the local Markov property of observables. The information extracted is also helpful in inferring relevant hidden transitions which are not captured by a Markov-state model.</description>

      <title>A geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A standard description of superfluid helim-4 is based on the concept of two components (superfluid and normal), which leads to the so called two-fluid models. However, as there are no two kinds of atoms in helium-4, the two components can not be separated. Superfluid helium-4 is not a mixture of two components, being rather a single fluid with two motions. Here, we present a geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4, which is based on the Hamiltonian formulation of fluid mechanics. The model is derived from the kinetic theory of excitations and average particle motions. It can be simplified to the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) two-fluid model, where it removes one fitting parameter from the HVBK model, but it also gives extra terms beyond HVBK. Actually, we show that the two-fluid models are problematic in case of higher normal velocities, where the splitting of total momentum to the superfluid and normal component becomes impossible. Finally, we show how vortex line density may be added to the state variables. The one-component model can be seen as a generalization of the two-fluid models that is geometrically consistent, fully compressible, with non-zero superfluid vorticity, and compatible with classical experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity in gravity, quantum field theory, and quantum information science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum complexity quantifies the difficulty of preparing a state, or implementing a unitary, using limited resources. Over the past decade, quantum-complexity research has surged. Applications range from quantum computation to condensed matter and quantum gravity. Different communities apply different tools to quantum complexity, as well as define complexity differently. This review bridges the disciplines' approaches. We cover multiple definitions of complexity, as well as their key properties and applications. In quantum information, random quantum circuits proved to be an invaluable tool in extracting properties of the complexity growth of discrete quantum circuits. In quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT), complexity is defined geometrically through geodesics. Complexity can be defined also in terms of state or operator spreading and tensor-network concepts. In addition to reviewing these approaches, we outline applications to simple quantum systems, quantum many-body models and QFTs, including conformal field theories (CFTs). Finally, we detail the relationship between complexity and gravitational observables within the anti-de Sitter-space (AdS)/CFT correspondence. This review thereby integrates recent quantum-complexity advances across fields.</description>

      <title>Symmetry classification correspondence between quadratic Lindbladians and their steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry classification is crucial in understanding universal properties of quantum matter. Recently, the scope of symmetry classification has been extended to open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation. However, the classification of Lindbladians and steady states remains largely separate. Because the former requires the non-Hermitian classification framework, while the latter relies on the classification scheme for Hermitian matrices. In this paper we build connections between symmetry classes of quadratic Lindbladian and its steady state, despite their different classification frameworks. We classify the full matrix representation of generic quadratic Lindbladians with particle conservation, showing they fall into 27 non-Hermitian symmetry classes. Among these, 22 classes lead to an infinite-temperature steady state. The remaining five classes have one-to-one correspondence with five steady-state Hermitian symmetry classes. Numerical simulations of random Lindbladian dynamics confirm the convergence to the correct steady-state symmetry classes at long time.</description>

      <title>A theory of ecological invasions and its implications for eco-evolutionary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the outcomes of species invasions is a central goal of ecology, a task made especially challenging due to ecological feedbacks. To address this, we develop a general theory of ecological invasions applicable to a wide variety of ecological models: including Lotka-Volterra models, consumer resource models, and models with cross feeding. Importantly, our framework remains valid even when invading evolved (non-random) communities and accounts for invasion-driven species extinctions. We derive analytical expressions relating invasion fitness to invader abundance, shifts in the community, and extinction probabilities. These results can be understood through a new quantity we term ``dressed invasion fitness'', which augments the traditional notion of invasion fitness by incorporating ecological feedbacks. We apply our theory to analyze short-term evolutionary dynamics through a series of invasions by mutants whose traits are correlated with an existing parent. We demonstrate that, generically, mutants and parents can coexist, often by driving the extinction of low-abundance species. We validate theoretical predictions against experimental datasets spanning ecosystems from plants to microbial protists. Our work highlights the central role of ecological feedbacks in shaping community responses to invasions and mutations, suggesting that parent-mutant coexistence is widespread in eco-evolutionary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Resonant optical bistability in support of enhanced Rydberg atom sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio frequency antennas based on highly excited Rydberg atom vapors can in principle reach sensitivities beyond those of any conventional wire antenna, especially at lower frequencies where very long wires are needed to accommodate the growing wavelength. Conventional Rydberg sensors are based on individual atom response, with increased signal resolution relying on the $O(10^3)$ electric dipole moment enhancement, scaling as the square of the Rydberg state principal quantum number $N \sim 50$. However, despite more than thirty years of steady advances, beyond-classical signal sensitivity has yet to be demonstrated. More recently, the optical bistability effect, a many body nonequilibrium phase transition occurring at somewhat higher vapor densities, has been exploited for an order of magnitude or more increased sensitivity for some setups through tuning into the critical region. However, the results fall significantly short of those using more advanced ``conventional'' Rydberg sensor setups -- which achieve even greater enhancement by exploiting resonant interaction between a pair of nearby Rydberg levels. This paper seeks to \emph{combine} the many body and resonant enhancement effects by extending the bistable phase analysis to include a pair of resonant Rydberg levels, supported by an exact treatment of the atom velocity thermal average. A dynamic linear response formalism is developed as well to explore the tradeoff between measurement sensitivity and finite bandwidth signals. We demonstrate regions of the phase diagram which could be exploited for record breaking, beyond-classical sensitivity. Of course, only a limited number of vapor parameters are under full experimental control, and experiments will be needed to quantitatively constrain the effective mean field interaction parameters appearing in the theory, and thereby define the accessible regions of the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Quantum Correlations within the double Caldeira-Leggett formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the effects of decoherence and squeezing on the dynamics of various kinds of quantum features--local quantum coherence, local entropy, EPR correlations, and entanglement--in the high-temperature limit of the double Caldeira-Leggett model, focusing on initially squeezed states. We compare two scenarios: (1) particles interacting with distinct environments and (2) particles coupled to a common environment. Our analysis reveals that common environments better preserve local coherence over time, whereas distinct environments accelerate decoherence. Temperature enhances decoherence and suppresses coherence revivals, while squeezing affects transient dynamics but not long-term coherence saturation. Local entropy increases with temperature and squeezing, though their underlying physical mechanisms differ. EPR correlations degrade due to environmental interactions, with squeezing initially enhancing them but failing to prevent their eventual loss. Entanglement exhibits distinct behaviors: in separate environments, it undergoes sudden death, whereas in common environments, it experiences a dark period whose duration shortens with stronger squeezing. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of how decoherence and squeezing influence quantum correlations in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Growth Laws and Universality in 2-TIPS: Microscopic and Coarse grained approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two temperature induced phase separation(2-TIPS) is a phenomenon observed in mixtures of active and passive particles modeled by scalar activity where the temperature of the particle is proportional to its activity. The binary mixture of 'hot' and 'cold' particles phase separate when the relative temperature difference between hot and cold particles defined as activity $\chi$ exceeds a density dependent critical value. The study of kinetics in 2-TIPS, a non-equilibrium phase separation, is of fundamental importance in statistical physics. In this paper, we investigate 2-TIPS kinetics using molecular dynamics (MD) and coarse-grained (CG) modeling in 3D and 2D. The coarse-grained model couples two passive Model B equations for hot and cold particles, with coupling terms emulating the energy transfer between them by raising the temperature of cold particles and lowering that of hot particles, a key observation from the MD simulations. MD simulations reveal that at high densities, phase separation begins immediately after the quench, forming bi-continuous domains rich in hot or cold particles, similar to spinodal decomposition in passive systems. These interconnected domains are also observed in the coarse-grained model for the mixture's critical composition. Both MD and CG models show dynamic scaling of the correlation function, indicating self-similar domain growth. Regardless of dimensionality, both methods report algebraic growth in domain length with a growth exponent of $1/3$, known as the Lifshitz-Slyozov exponent, widely observed in passive systems. Our results demonstrate that the universality of phase separation kinetics observed in passive systems also extends to the non-equilibrium binary mixture undergoing 2-TIPS.</description>

      <title>Singular Value Decomposition and Its Blind Spot for Quantum Chaos in Non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of chaos and complexity in non-Hermitian quantum systems poses significant challenges due to the emergence of complex eigenvalues in their spectra. Recently, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method was proposed to address these challenges. In this work, we identify two critical shortcomings of the SVD approach when analyzing Krylov complexity and spectral statistics in non-Hermitian settings. First, we demonstrate that SVD fails to correctly reproduce the Hermitian limit for systems with non-positive definite spectra, exemplified by a variant of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Second, and more fundamentally, Krylov complexity and spectral statistics derived via SVD cannot distinguish chaotic from integrable non-Hermitian dynamics, leading to results that conflict with complex spacing ratio analysis. Our findings reveal that SVD is inadequate for probing quantum chaos in non-Hermitian systems, and we advocate employing more robust methods, such as the bi-Lanczos algorithm, for future research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Bosonized 1D quantum systems through enhanced Event-Chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design an enhanced Event-Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to study 1D quantum dissipative systems, using their bosonized representation. Expressing the bosonized Hamiltonian as a path integral over a scalar field enables the application of Monte Carlo algorithms developed for classical systems. Specifically, we focus on a dissipative XXZ spin chain, exhibiting critical slowing down, minima degeneracy and long-range interactions. Addressing all three bottlenecks, we design an algorithm that combines local persistent Event-Chain Monte Carlo moves with global cluster moves, in a O(1)-complexity implementation. Through systematic performance analysis, we show that such an algorithm outperforms traditional Metropolis algorithms by more than a magnitude factor and is competitive with current state-of-the-art Quantum Monte Carlo algorithms. We then use this approach to determine the dissipative spin chain's phase diagram, thereby reinforcing prior analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Helicity modulus in the bilayer XY model by worm algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behaviour of the helicity modulus has been frequently employed to investigate the onset of the topological order characterizing the low-temperature phase of the two-dimensional XY-model. We here present how the analysis based on the use of this key quantity can be applied to the study of the properties of coupled layers. To this aim, we first discuss how to extend the popular worm algorithm to a layered sample, and in particular to the evaluation of the longitudinal helicity, that we introduce taking care of the fact that the virtual twist representing the elastic deformation one applies to properly define the helicity modulus can act on a single layer or on all of them. We then apply the method to investigate the bilayer XY-model, showing how the helicity modulus can be used to determine the phase diagram of the model as a function of temperature and inter-layer coupling strength</description>

      <title>Stroboscopic measurements in Markov networks: Exact generator reconstruction vs. thermodynamic inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major goal of stochastic thermodynamics is to estimate the inevitable dissipation that accompanies particular observable phenomena in an otherwise not fully accessible system. Quantitative results are often formulated as lower bounds on the total entropy production, which capture the part of the total dissipation that can be determined based on the available data alone. In this work, we discuss the case of a continuous-time dynamics on a Markov network that is observed stroboscopically, i.e., at discrete points in time in regular intervals. We compare the standard approach of deriving a lower bound on the entropy production rate in the steady state to the less common method of reconstructing the generator from the observed propagators by taking the matrix logarithm. Provided that the timescale of the stroboscopic measurements is smaller than a critical value that can be determined from the available data, this latter method is able to recover all thermodynamic quantities like entropy production or cycle affinities and is therefore superior to the usual approach of deriving lower bounds. Beyond the critical value, we still obtain tight upper and lower bounds on these quantities that improve on extant methods. We conclude the comparison with numerical illustrations and a discussion of the requirements and limitations of both methods.</description>

      <title>Arresting Quantum Chaos Dynamically in Transmon Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ergodic quantum many-body systems evolving under unitary time dynamics typically lose memory of their initial state via information scrambling. Here we consider a paradigmatic translationally invariant many-body Hamiltonian of interacting bosons -- a Josephson junction array in the transmon regime -- in the presence of a strong Floquet drive. Generically, such a time-dependent drive is expected to heat the system to an effectively infinite temperature, featureless state in the late-time limit. However, using numerical exact-diagonalization we find evidence of special ratios of the drive amplitude and frequency where the system develops {\it emergent} conservation laws, and {\it approximate} integrability. Remarkably, at these same set of points, the Lyapunov exponent associated with the semi-classical dynamics for the coupled many-body equations of motion drops by orders of magnitude, arresting the growth of chaos. We supplement our numerical results with an analytical Floquet-Magnus expansion that includes higher-order corrections, and capture the slow dynamics that controls decay away from exact freezing.</description>

      <title>Deep thermalization under charge-conserving quantum dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: "Deep thermalization" describes the emergence of universal wavefunction distributions in quantum many-body dynamics, appearing on a local subsystem upon measurement of its environment. In this work, we study in detail the effect of continuous internal symmetries and associated conservation laws on deep thermalization. Concretely, we consider quantum spin systems with a $U(1)$ symmetry associated with the conservation of magnetization (or `charge'), and analyze how the choice of initial states (specifically, their degree of charge fluctuations) and the choice of measurement basis (specifically, whether or not it can reveal information about the local charge density) determine the ensuing universal wavefunction distributions. We put forth a universal ansatz for the limiting form of the projected ensemble, motivated by maximum-entropy principles rooted in statistical physics and quantum information theory. This limiting form depends on a polynomial amount of data on the initial state and measurement basis, a `coarse-graining' that is an essential feature of bona fide thermodynamic ensembles. We support our ansatz with three complementary approaches: (i) a rigorous proof in the simplest case of no charge fluctuations in either the initial state or the measurement basis; (ii) analytical calculations using a `replica limit' approach, applicable when charge fluctuations are allowed in either the input state or the measurement basis but not both; (iii) extensive numerical simulations of finite-sized systems in the most general case. Our findings demonstrate a rich interplay between symmetries and the information extracted by measurements, which allows deep thermalization to exhibit a range of universal behaviors far beyond regular thermalization.</description>

      <title>Thermalization rates and quantum Ruelle-Pollicott resonances: insights from operator hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In thermalizing many-body quantum systems without conservation laws such as ergodic Floquet and random unitary circuits, local expectation values are predicted to decay to their equilibrium values exponentially quickly. In this work we derive a relationship between said exponential decay rate $\overline{g}$ and the operator spreading properties of a local unitary evolution. A hydrodynamical picture for operator spreading allows us to argue that, for random unitary circuits, $\overline{g}$ is encoded by the leading eigenvalue of a dynamical map obtained by enriching unitary dynamics with dissipation, in the limit of weak dissipation. We argue that the size of the eigenvalue does not depend on the details of this weak dissipation (given mild assumptions on properties of the ergodic dynamics), so long as it only suppresses large operators significantly. Our calculations are based on analytical results for random unitary circuits, but we argue that similar results hold for ergodic Floquet systems. These conjectures are in accordance with existing results which numerically obtain quantum many-body analogues of classical Ruelle-Pollicott resonances [T. Prosen J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 35 L737 (2002), T. Mori, arXiv:2311.10304] by studying unitary evolutions subject to weak dissipation.</description>

      <title>Majorana fermions solve the tetrahedron equations as well as higher simplex equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Yang-Baxter equations define quantum integrable models. The tetrahedron and higher simplex equations are multi-dimensional generalizations. Finding the solutions of these equations is a formidable task. In this work we develop a systematic method - constructing higher simplex operators [solutions of corresponding simplex equations] from lower simplex ones. We call it lifting. By starting from solutions of Yang-Baxter equations we can construct solutions of the tetrahedron equation and simplex equation in any dimension. We then generalize this by starting from a solution of any lower simplex equation and lifting it [construct solution] to another simplex equation in higher dimension. This process introduces several constraints among the different lower simplex operators that are lifted to form the higher simplex operators. We show that braided Yang-Baxter operators [solutions of Yang-Baxter equations independent of spectral parameters] constructed using Majorana fermions satisfy these constraints, thus solving the higher simplex equations. As a consequence these solutions help us understand the action of an higher simplex operator on Majorana fermions. Apart from these we show that solutions constructed using Dirac (complex) fermions and Clifford algebras also satisfy these constraints. Furthermore it is observed that the Clifford solutions give rise to positive Boltzmann weights resulting in the possibility of physical statistical mechanics models in higher dimensions. Finally we also show that anti-Yang-Baxter operators [solutions of Yang-Baxter-like equations with a negative sign on the right hand side] can also be lifted to higher simplex solutions.</description>

      <title>Exact Replica Symmetric solution for transverse field Hopfield model under finite Trotter size</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the quantum Hopfield model in which an extensive number of patterns are embedded in the presence of a uniform transverse field. This analysis employs the replica method under the replica symmetric ansatz on the Suzuki-Trotter representation of the model, while keeping the number of Trotter slices $M$ finite. The statistical properties of the quantum Hopfield model in imaginary time are reduced to an effective $M$-spin long-range classical Ising model, which can be extensively studied using a dedicated Monte Carlo algorithm. This approach contrasts with the commonly applied static approximation, which ignores the imaginary time dependency of the order parameters, but allows $M \to \infty$ to be taken analytically. During the analysis, we introduce an exact but fundamentally weaker static relation, referred to as the quasi-static relation. We present the phase diagram of the model with respect to the transverse field strength and the number of embedded patterns, indicating a small but quantitative difference from previous results obtained using the static approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As quantum analogs of the classical Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, quantum dynamical entropies have emerged as important tools to characterize complex quantum dynamics. In particular, Alicki-Fannes-Lindblad (AFL) entropy, which quantifies the information production of a coherent quantum system subjected to repeated measurement, has received considerable attention as a potential diagnostic for quantum chaos. Despite this interest, the precise behavior of quantum dynamical entropy in the presence of symmetry has seen little study. In this work, we establish rigorous inequalities of the AFL entropy for arbitrary unitary dynamics (single-particle and many-body) in the presence of various types of symmetry. Our theorems encompass three cases: Abelian symmetry, an anticommuting unitary, and non-Abelian symmetries. We motivate our main results with numerical simulations of the perturbed quantum cat maps. Our findings highlight the role of symmetry in quantum dynamics under measurements, and our framework is easily adaptable for study of symmetry in other probes of quantum chaos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find nonequilibrium phase transitions accompanied by multiple (nested) hysteresis behaviors in superconductors coupled to baths under a time-periodic light driving. The transitions are demonstrated with a full phase diagram in the domain of the driving amplitude and frequency by means of the Floquet many-body theory. In the weak driving regime with a frequency smaller than half of the superconducting gap, excited quasiparticles are accumulated at the far edges of the bands, realizing a distribution reminiscent of the Eliashberg effect, which suddenly becomes unstable in the strong driving regime due to multi-photon-assisted tunneling across the gap mediated by the in-gap Floquet sidebands. We also show that superconductivity is enhanced in the weak driving regime without effective cooling, which is attributed to the modulation of the spectrum due to Floquet sidebands.</description>
