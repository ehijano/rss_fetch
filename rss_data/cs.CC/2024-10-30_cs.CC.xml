      <title>Small Shadow Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of partitioning the unit cube $[0,1]^n$ into $c$ parts so that each $d$-dimensional axis-parallel projection has small volume.
  This natural combinatorial/geometric question was first studied by Kopparty and Nagargoje [KN23] as a reformulation of the problem of determining the achievable parameters for seedless multimergers -- which extract randomness from `$d$-where' random sources (generalizing somewhere random sources). This question is closely related to influences of variables and is about a partition analogue of Shearer's lemma.
  Our main result answers a question of [KN23]: for $d = n-1$, we show that for $c$ even as large as $2^{o(n)}$, it is possible to partition $[0,1]^n$ into $c$ parts so that every $n-1$-dimensional axis-parallel projection has volume at most $(1/c) ( 1 + o(1) )$. Previously, this was shown by [KN23] for $c$ up to $O(\sqrt{n})$. The construction of our partition is related to influences of functions, and we present a clean geometric/combinatorial conjecture about this partitioning problem that would imply the KKL theorem on influences of Boolean functions.</description>

      <title>Sum-of-squares lower bounds for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA) is the statistical task of finding a non-Gaussian direction in a high-dimensional dataset. Specifically, given i.i.d.\ samples from a distribution $P^A_{v}$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ that behaves like a known distribution $A$ in a hidden direction $v$ and like a standard Gaussian in the orthogonal complement, the goal is to approximate the hidden direction. The standard formulation posits that the first $k-1$ moments of $A$ match those of the standard Gaussian and the $k$-th moment differs. Under mild assumptions, this problem has sample complexity $O(n)$. On the other hand, all known efficient algorithms require $\Omega(n^{k/2})$ samples. Prior work developed sharp Statistical Query and low-degree testing lower bounds suggesting an information-computation tradeoff for this problem.
  Here we study the complexity of NGCA in the Sum-of-Squares (SoS) framework. Our main contribution is the first super-constant degree SoS lower bound for NGCA. Specifically, we show that if the non-Gaussian distribution $A$ matches the first $(k-1)$ moments of $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ and satisfies other mild conditions, then with fewer than $n^{(1 - \varepsilon)k/2}$ many samples from the normal distribution, with high probability, degree $(\log n)^{{1\over 2}-o_n(1)}$ SoS fails to refute the existence of such a direction $v$. Our result significantly strengthens prior work by establishing a super-polynomial information-computation tradeoff against a broader family of algorithms. As corollaries, we obtain SoS lower bounds for several problems in robust statistics and the learning of mixture models.
  Our SoS lower bound proof introduces a novel technique, that we believe may be of broader interest, and a number of refinements over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Maximum Partial List H-Coloring on P_5-free graphs in polynomial time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we show that Maximum Partial List H-Coloring is polynomial-time solvable on P_5-free graphs for every fixed graph H. In particular, this implies that Maximum k-Colorable Subgraph is polynomial-time solvable on P_5-free graphs. This answers an open question from Agrawal, Lima, Lokshtanov, Saurabh &amp; Sharma [SODA 2024]. This also improves the $n^{\omega(G)}$-time algorithm for Maximum Partial H-Coloring by Chudnovsky, King, Pilipczuk, Rz\k{a}\.{z}ewski &amp; Spirkl [SIDMA 2021] to polynomial-time algorithm.</description>

      <title>Classical Algorithms for Constant Approximation of the Ground State Energy of Local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct classical algorithms computing an approximation of the ground state energy of an arbitrary $k$-local Hamiltonian acting on $n$ qubits.
  We first consider the setting where a good ``guiding state'' is available, which is the main setting where quantum algorithms are expected to achieve an exponential speedup over classical methods. We show that a constant approximation of the ground state energy can be computed classically in $\mathrm{poly}\left(1/\chi,n\right)$ time and $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ space, where $\chi$ denotes the overlap between the guiding state and the ground state (as in prior works in dequantization, we assume sample-and-query access to the guiding state). This gives a significant improvement over the recent classical algorithm by Gharibian and Le Gall (SICOMP 2023), and matches (up a to polynomial overhead) both the time and space complexities of quantum algorithms for constant approximation of the ground state energy. We also obtain classical algorithms for higher-precision approximation.
  For the setting where no guided state is given (i.e., the standard version of the local Hamiltonian problem), we obtain a classical algorithm computing a constant approximation of the ground state energy in $2^{O(n)}$ time and $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ space. To our knowledge, before this work it was unknown how to classically achieve these bounds simultaneously, even for constant approximation. We also discuss complexity-theoretic aspects of our results and their implications for the quantum PCP conjecture.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic methods of finite discrete structures. Graph clique problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The monography presents a new algorithm for finding the clique of maximal length in a nonseparable graph. The algorithm is based on the properties of the representation of a clique as a subset of the set of cycles with a length of three, the ring sum of which is an empty set. As a result of selecting the cycles of the length of three, two vectors are formed: the vector of cycles passing through the edges and the vector of cycles passing through the vertices. The numerical values of the components of these vectors determine the weights of the vertices and edges. The iterative process of constructing the set of vectors of cycles passing through the edges allows identifying the main vector of cycles passing through the edges. In turn, the construction of the main vector allows finding the clicks of the graph. The computational complexity of the presented algorithm is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Ideal Membership Problem for Boolean Minority and Dual Discriminator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the polynomial Ideal Membership Problem (IMP) for ideals encoding combinatorial problems that are instances of CSPs over a finite language. In this paper, the input polynomial $f$ has degree at most $d=O(1)$ (we call this problem IMP$_d$). We bridge the gap in \cite{MonaldoMastrolilli2019} by proving that the IMP$_d$ for Boolean combinatorial ideals whose constraints are closed under the minority polymorphism can be solved in polynomial time. This completes the identification of the tractability for the Boolean IMP$_d$. We also prove that the proof of membership for the IMP$_d$ for problems constrained by the dual discriminator polymorphism over any finite domain can be found in polynomial time. Our results can be used in applications such as Nullstellensatz and Sum-of-Squares proofs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show an improved inverse theorem for the Gowers-$3$ norm of $n$-qubit quantum states $|\psi\rangle$ which states that: for every $\gamma\geq 0$, if the $\textsf{Gowers}(|\psi \rangle,3)^8 \geq \gamma$ then the stabilizer fidelity of $|\psi\rangle$ is at least $\gamma^C$ for some constant $C&gt;1$. This implies a constant-sample polynomial-time tolerant testing algorithm for stabilizer states which accepts if an unknown state is $\varepsilon_1$-close to a stabilizer state in fidelity and rejects when $|\psi\rangle$ is $\varepsilon_2 \leq \varepsilon_1^C$-far from all stabilizer states, promised one of them is the case.</description>

      <title>I/O complexity and pebble games with partial computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing data movements during program executions is essential for achieving high performance in modern computing systems. This has been classically modeled with the Red-Blue Pebble Game and its variants. In the existing models, it is typically assumed that the number of red pebbles, i.e., the size of the fast memory, is larger than the maximum in-degree in the computational graph (e.g. an arithmetic circuit). This assumption can be restrictive for many real applications, especially when dealing with "big data" in Machine Learning and Scientific Computing. In this work we study a generalization of the original Red-Blue Pebble Game to allow arbitrary in-degrees, that can be larger than the size of the fast memory. The objective is to minimize the I/O operations by allowing the computation of partial results in the fast memory. We show that this variant of the problem is NP-complete, even for the special case where the computational graph consists of a single level, and only two words fit in the fast memory. Approximation algorithms for a couple of special cases are also outlined.</description>

      <title>The CSP Dichotomy, the Axiom of Choice, and Cyclic Polymorphisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) in an infinite context. We show that the dichotomy between easy and hard problems -- established already in the finite case -- presents itself as the strength of the corresponding De Bruijin-Erd\H{o}s-type compactness theorem over ZF. More precisely, if $\mathcal{D}$ is a structure, let $K_\mathcal{D}$ stand for the following statement: for every structure $\mathcal{X}$ if every finite substructure of $\mathcal{X}$ admits a solution to $\mathcal{D}$, then so does $\mathcal{X}$. We prove that if $\mathcal{D}$ admits no cyclic polymorphism, and thus it is NP-complete by the CSP Dichotomy Theorem, then $K_\mathcal{D}$ is equivalent to the Boolean Prime Ideal Theorem (BPI) over ZF. Conversely, we also show that if $\mathcal{D}$ admits a cyclic polymorphism, and thus it is in P, then $K_\mathcal{D}$ is strictly weaker than BPI.</description>

      <title>Finding $d$-Cuts in Graphs of Bounded Diameter, Graphs of Bounded Radius and $H$-Free Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $d$-Cut problem is to decide if a graph has an edge cut such that each vertex has at most $d$ neighbours at the opposite side of the cut. If $d=1$, we obtain the intensively studied Matching Cut problem. The $d$-Cut problem has been studied as well, but a systematic study for special graph classes was lacking. We initiate such a study and consider classes of bounded diameter, bounded radius and $H$-free graphs. We prove that for all $d\geq 2$, $d$-Cut is polynomial-time solvable for graphs of diameter $2$, $(P_3+P_4)$-free graphs and $P_5$-free graphs. These results extend known results for $d=1$. However, we also prove several NP-hardness results for $d$-Cut that contrast known polynomial-time results for $d=1$. Our results lead to full dichotomies for bounded diameter and bounded radius and to almost-complete dichotomies for $H$-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Finding Maximum Common Contractions Between Phylogenetic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we lay the groundwork on the comparison of phylogenetic networks based on edge contractions and expansions as edit operations, as originally proposed by Robinson and Foulds to compare trees. We prove that these operations connect the space of all phylogenetic networks on the same set of leaves, even if we forbid contractions that create cycles. This allows to define an operational distance on this space, as the minimum number of contractions and expansions required to transform one network into another. We highlight the difference between this distance and the computation of the maximum common contraction between two networks. Given its ability to outline a common structure between them, which can provide valuable biological insights, we study the algorithmic aspects of the latter. We first prove that computing a maximum common contraction between two networks is NP-hard, even when the maximum degree, the size of the common contraction, or the number of leaves is bounded. We also provide lower bounds to the problem based on the Exponential-Time Hypothesis. Nonetheless, we do provide a polynomial-time algorithm for weakly-galled networks, a generalization of galled trees.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fast Implementation of Functional Bootstrapping and Private Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical privacy-preserving computation techniques safeguard sensitive data in cloud computing, but often suffer from low computational efficiency. In this paper, we show that employing a single quantum server can significantly enhance both the efficiency and security of privacy-preserving computation.
  We propose an efficient quantum algorithm for functional bootstrapping of large-precision plaintexts, reducing the time complexity from exponential to polynomial in plaintext-size compared to classical algorithms. To support general functional bootstrapping, we design a fast quantum private information retrieval (PIR) protocol with logarithmic query time. The security relies on the learning with errors (LWE) problem with polynomial modulus, providing stronger security than classical ``exponentially fast'' PIR protocol based on ring-LWE with super-polynomial modulus.
  Technically, we extend a key classical homomorphic operation, known as blind rotation, to the quantum setting through encrypted conditional rotation. Underlying our extension are insights for the quantum extension of polynomial-based cryptographic tools that may gain dramatic speedups.</description>
