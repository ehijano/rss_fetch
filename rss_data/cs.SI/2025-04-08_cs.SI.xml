      <title>Fast Maximization of Current Flow Group Closeness Centrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Derived from effective resistances, the current flow closeness centrality (CFCC) for a group of nodes measures the importance of node groups in an undirected graph with $n$ nodes. Given the widespread applications of identifying crucial nodes, we investigate the problem of maximizing CFCC for a node group $S$ subject to the cardinality constraint $|S|=k\ll n$. Despite the proven NP-hardness of this problem, we propose two novel greedy algorithms for its solution. Our algorithms are based on spanning forest sampling and Schur complement, which exhibit nearly linear time complexities and achieve an approximation factor of $1-\frac{k}{k-1}\frac{1}{\mathrm{e}}-\epsilon$ for any $0&lt;\epsilon&lt;1$. Extensive experiments on real-world graphs illustrate that our algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art method in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, scaling to graphs with millions of nodes.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Diffusion Model for Collaborative Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, diffusion-based recommendation methods have achieved impressive results. However, existing approaches predominantly treat each user's historical interactions as independent training samples, overlooking the potential of higher-order collaborative signals between users and items. Such signals, which encapsulate richer and more nuanced relationships, can be naturally captured using graph-based data structures. To address this limitation, we extend diffusion-based recommendation methods to the graph domain by directly modeling user-item bipartite graphs with diffusion models. This enables better modeling of the higher-order connectivity inherent in complex interaction dynamics. However, this extension introduces two primary challenges: (1) Noise Heterogeneity, where interactions are influenced by various forms of continuous and discrete noise, and (2) Relation Explosion, referring to the high computational costs of processing large-scale graphs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Graph-based Diffusion Model for Collaborative Filtering (GDMCF). To address noise heterogeneity, we introduce a multi-level noise corruption mechanism that integrates both continuous and discrete noise, effectively simulating real-world interaction complexities. To mitigate relation explosion, we design a user-active guided diffusion process that selectively focuses on the most meaningful edges and active users, reducing inference costs while preserving the graph's topological integrity. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that GDMCF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing higher-order collaborative signals and improving recommendation performance.</description>

      <title>Utility-aware Social Network Anonymization using Genetic Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social networks may contain privacy-sensitive information about individuals. The objective of the network anonymization problem is to alter a given social network dataset such that the number of anonymous nodes in the social graph is maximized. Here, a node is anonymous if it does not have a unique surrounding network structure. At the same time, the aim is to ensure data utility, i.e., preserve topological network properties and retain good performance on downstream network analysis tasks. We propose two versions of a genetic algorithm tailored to this problem: one generic GA and a uniqueness-aware GA (UGA). The latter aims to target edges more effectively during mutation by avoiding edges connected to already anonymous nodes. After hyperparameter tuning, we compare the two GAs against two existing baseline algorithms on several real-world network datasets. Results show that the proposed genetic algorithms manage to anonymize on average 14 times more nodes than the best baseline algorithm. Additionally, data utility experiments demonstrate how the UGA requires fewer edge deletions, and how our GAs and the baselines retain performance on downstream tasks equally well. Overall, our results suggest that genetic algorithms are a promising approach for finding solutions to the network anonymization problem.</description>

      <title>Building a Village: A Multi-stakeholder Approach to Open Innovation and Shared Governance to Promote Youth Online Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SIGCHI and Social Computing research communities have been at the forefront of online safety efforts for youth, ranging from understanding the serious risks youth face online to developing evidence-based interventions for risk protection. Yet, to bring these efforts to bear, we must partner with practitioners, such as industry stakeholders who know how to bring such technologies to market, and youth service providers who work directly with youth. Therefore, we interviewed 33 stakeholders in the space of youth online safety, including industry professionals (n=12), youth service providers (n=11), and researchers (n=10) to understand where their visions toward working together to protect youth online converged and surfaced tensions, as well as how we might reconcile conflicting viewpoints to move forward as one community with synergistic expertise on how to change the current sociotechnical landscape for youth online safety. Overall, we found that non-partisan leadership is necessary to chart actionable, equitable goals to facilitate collaboration between stakeholders, combat feelings of isolation, and foster trust between the stakeholder groups. Based on these findings, we recommend the use of open-innovation methods with their inherent transparency, federated governance models, and clear but inclusive leadership structures to promote collaboration between youth online safety stakeholders. We propose the creation of an open-innovation organization that unifies the diverse voices in youth online safety to develop open-standards and evidence-based design patterns that centralize otherwise fragmented efforts that have fallen short of the goal of effective technological solutions that keep youth safe online.</description>

      <title>Collaboration and Controversy Among Experts: Rumor Early Detection by Tuning a Comment Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, social media platforms have been key in spreading rumors, leading to significant negative impacts. To counter this, the community has developed various Rumor Detection (RD) algorithms to automatically identify them using user comments as evidence. However, these RD methods often fail in the early stages of rumor propagation when only limited user comments are available, leading the community to focus on a more challenging topic named Rumor Early Detection (RED). Typically, existing RED methods learn from limited semantics in early comments. However, our preliminary experiment reveals that the RED models always perform best when the number of training and test comments is consistent and extensive. This inspires us to address the RED issue by generating more human-like comments to support this hypothesis. To implement this idea, we tune a comment generator by simulating expert collaboration and controversy and propose a new RED framework named CAMERED. Specifically, we integrate a mixture-of-expert structure into a generative language model and present a novel routing network for expert collaboration. Additionally, we synthesize a knowledgeable dataset and design an adversarial learning strategy to align the style of generated comments with real-world comments. We further integrate generated and original comments with a mutual controversy fusion module. Experimental results show that CAMERED outperforms state-of-the-art RED baseline models and generation methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Social Cybersecurity: Techniques for Attack Detection, Evaluations, Challenges, and Future Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's digital era, the Internet, especially social media platforms, plays a significant role in shaping public opinions, attitudes, and beliefs. Unfortunately, the credibility of scientific information sources is often undermined by the spread of misinformation through various means, including technology-driven tools like bots, cyborgs, trolls, sock-puppets, and deep fakes. This manipulation of public discourse serves antagonistic business agendas and compromises civil society. In response to this challenge, a new scientific discipline has emerged: social cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>Crowdsourcing-Based Knowledge Graph Construction for Drug Side Effects Using Large Language Models with an Application on Semaglutide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04346v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media is a rich source of real-world data that captures valuable patient experience information for pharmacovigilance. However, mining data from unstructured and noisy social media content remains a challenging task. We present a systematic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract medication side effects from social media and organize them into a knowledge graph (KG). We apply this framework to semaglutide for weight loss using data from Reddit. Using the constructed knowledge graph, we perform comprehensive analyses to investigate reported side effects across different semaglutide brands over time. These findings are further validated through comparison with adverse events reported in the FAERS database, providing important patient-centered insights into semaglutide's side effects that complement its safety profile and current knowledge base of semaglutide for both healthcare professionals and patients. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of using LLMs to transform social media data into structured KGs for pharmacovigilance.</description>

      <title>The Disruption Index Measures Displacement Between a Paper and Its Most Cited Reference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Initially developed to capture technical innovation and later adapted to identify scientific breakthroughs, the Disruption Index (D-index) offers the first quantitative framework for analyzing transformative research. Despite its promise, prior studies have struggled to clarify its theoretical foundations, raising concerns about potential bias. Here, we show that-contrary to the common belief that the D-index measures absolute innovation-it captures relative innovation: a paper's ability to displace its most-cited reference. In this way, the D-index reflects scientific progress as the replacement of older answers with newer ones to the same fundamental question-much like light bulbs replacing candles. We support this insight through mathematical analysis, expert surveys, and large-scale bibliometric evidence. To facilitate replication, validation, and broader use, we release a dataset of D-index values for 49 million journal articles (1800-2024) based on OpenAlex.</description>

      <title>Team Size and Its Negative Impact on the Disruption Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As science transitions from the age of lone geniuses to an era of collaborative teams, the question of whether large teams can sustain the creativity of individuals and continue driving innovation has become increasingly important. Our previous research first revealed a negative relationship between team size and the Disruption Index-a network-based metric of innovation-by analyzing 65 million projects across papers, patents, and software over half a century. This work has sparked lively debates within the scientific community about the robustness of the Disruption Index in capturing the impact of team size on innovation. Here, we present additional evidence that the negative link between team size and disruption holds, even when accounting for factors such as reference length, citation impact, and historical time. We further show how a narrow 5-year window for measuring disruption can misrepresent this relationship as positive, underestimating the long-term disruptive potential of small teams. Like "sleeping beauties," small teams need a decade or more to see their transformative contributions to science.</description>

      <title>Risk-Prone and Risk-Averse Behavior in Natural Emergencies: An Appraisal Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Individuals who shared actionable information during Hurricane Sandy were significantly more likely to exhibit risk-prone behavior, as measured by a novel Risk Behavior Quotient (RBQ). Using a dataset of 36595 geo-located tweets from 774 users in the New York area, we found that a higher proportion of actional tweets predicted increased exposure to physical even if overall users ultimately moved toward lower-risk zones. This counterintuitive finding suggests that proactivity, manifested in sharing crisis relevant content, correlates with greater exposure to risk, possibly due to increased mobility or engagement in hazardous areas. In contrast, a greater number of social media peers was associated with reduced risk exposure. This study builds on appraisal theory, which frames risk-related decisions as outcomes of cognitively mediated emotional and rational evaluations. We extend this theory to digital crisis behavior, distinguishing between emotional and actional appraisals expressed via social media. Tweets were categorized using sentiment analysis and semantic classification, enabling the isolation of affective and behavioral signals. Our methodology combines natural language processing with spatial vector analysis to estimate individual movement paths and risk exposure based on evacuation and flooding maps. The resulting RBQ captures both direction and intensity of risk behavior, allowing us to model how online communication reflects and predicts real-world risk engagement during natural disasters.</description>

      <title>Link Prediction with Physics-Inspired Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The message-passing mechanism underlying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is not naturally suited for heterophilic datasets, where adjacent nodes often have different labels. Most solutions to this problem remain confined to the task of node classification. In this article, we focus on the valuable task of link prediction under heterophily, an interesting problem for recommendation systems, social network analysis, and other applications. GNNs like GRAFF have improved node classification under heterophily by incorporating physics biases in the architecture. Similarly, we propose GRAFF-LP, an extension of GRAFF for link prediction. We show that GRAFF-LP effectively discriminates existing from non-existing edges by learning implicitly to separate the edge gradients. Based on this information, we propose a new readout function inspired by physics. Remarkably, this new function not only enhances the performance of GRAFF-LP but also improves that of other baseline models, leading us to reconsider how every link prediction experiment has been conducted so far. Finally, we provide evidence that even simple GNNs did not experience greater difficulty in predicting heterophilic links compared to homophilic ones. This leads us to believe in the necessity for heterophily measures specifically tailored for link prediction, distinct from those used in node classification. The code for reproducing our experiments is available at this URL https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Link_Prediction_with_PIGNN_IJCNN-F03F/.</description>

      <title>On Word-of-Mouth and Private-Prior Sequential Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social learning provides a fundamental framework in economics and social sciences for studying interactions among rational agents who observe each other's actions but lack direct access to individual beliefs. This paper investigates a specific social learning paradigm known as Word-of-Mouth (WoM), where a series of agents seeks to estimate the state of a dynamical system. The first agent receives noisy measurements of the state, while each subsequent agent relies solely on a degraded version of her predecessor's estimate. A defining feature of WoM is that the final agent's belief is publicly broadcast and adopted by all agents, in place of their own. We analyze this setting both theoretically and through numerical simulations, showing that some agents benefit from using the public belief broadcast by the last agent, while others suffer from performance deterioration.</description>
