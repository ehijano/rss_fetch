      <title>Concentric bubbles concentrating in finite time for the energy critical wave maps equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the energy critical Wave Maps equation from $\mathbb{R}^{2+1}$ to $\mathbb{S}^2$ and restricted to the co-rotational setting with co-rotation index $k = 2$ admits finite time blow up solutions of finite energy on $(0, t_0]\times \mathbb{R}^2$, $t_0&gt;0$, and concentrating two concentric bubble profiles at the frequency scales $\lambda_1(t) = e^{\alpha(t)},\,\alpha(t)\sim \big|\log t\big|^{\beta+1}$, as well as $\lambda_2(t) = t^{-1}\cdot \big|\log t\big|^{\beta}$. The parameter $\beta&gt;\frac32$ can be chosen arbitrarily. This shows that soliton resolution scenarios with finite time blow up and $N = 2$ collapsing profiles, i. e. bubble trees, do occur for this equation.</description>

      <title>Partial regularity in nonlocal systems I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solutions to nonlinear integro-differential systems are regular outside a negligible closed subset whose Hausdorff dimension can be explicitly bounded from above. This subset can be characterized using quantitative, universal energy thresholds for nonlocal excess functionals. The analysis is carried out via the use of nonlinear potentials and allows to derive fine properties of solutions under sharp assumptions on data and kernel coefficients.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov stability and uniqueness problems for Hamilton-Jacobi equations without monotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the evolutionary Hamilton-Jacobi equation
  \begin{align*}
  w_t(x,t)+H(x,Dw(x,t),w(x,t))=0, \quad(x,t)\in M\times [0,+\infty),
  \end{align*}
  where $M$ is a compact manifold, $H:T^*M\times R\to R$, $H=H(x,p,u)$ satisfies Tonelli conditions in $p$ and the Lipschitz condition in $u$.
  This work mainly concerns with the Lyapunov stability (including asymptotic stability, and instability) and uniqueness of stationary viscosity solutions of the equation. A criterion for stability and a criterion for instability are given. We do not utilize auxiliary functions and thus our method is different from the classical Lyapunov's direct method.
  We also prove several uniqueness results for stationary viscosity solutions. The Hamiltonian $H$ has no concrete form and it may be non-monotonic in the argument $u$, where the situation is more complicated than the monotonic case. Several simple but nontrivial examples are provided, including the following equation on the unit circle
  \[
  w_t(x,t)+\frac{1}{2}w^2_x(x,t)-a\cdot w_x(x,t)+(\sin x+b)\cdot w(x,t)=0,\quad x\in \mathbf{S},
  \]
  where $a$, $b\in R$ are parameters. We analyze the stability, and instability of the stationary solution $w=0$ when parameters vary, and show that $w=0$ is the unique stationary solution when $a=0$, $b&gt;1$ and $a\neq0$, $b\geqslant 1$.
  The sign of the integral of $\frac{\partial H}{\partial u}$ with respect to the Mather measure of the contact Hamiltonian system generated by $H$ plays an essential role in the proofs of aforementioned results. For this reason, we first develop the Mather and weak KAM theories for contact Hamiltonian systems in this non-monotonic setting. A decomposition theorem of the Ma\~n\'e set is the main result of this part.</description>

      <title>On principal eigenvalues of linear time-periodic parabolic systems: symmetric mutation case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with the effect of the spatio-temporal heterogeneity on the principal eigenvalue of some linear time-periodic parabolic system. Various asymptotic behaviors of the principal eigenvalue and its monotonicity, as a function of the diffusion rate and frequency, are first derived. In particular, some singular behaviors of the principal eigenvalues are observed when both diffusion rate and frequency approach zero, with some scalar time-periodic Hamilton-Jacobi equation as the limiting equation. Furthermore, we completely classify the topological structures of the level sets for the principal eigenvalues in the plane of frequency and diffusion rate. Our results not only generalize most of the findings in [S. Liu and Y. Lou, J. Funct. Anal., 282 (2022), 109338] for scalar periodic-parabolic operators, but also reveal more rich global information, for time-periodic parabolic systems, on the dependence of the principal eigenvalues upon the spatio-temporal heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Kinetic-fluid boundary layers and acoustic limit for the Boltzmann equation with general Maxwell reflection boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the acoustic limit from the Boltzmann equation with hard sphere collisions and the Maxwell reflection boundary condition. Our construction of solutions include the interior fluid part and Knudsen-viscous coupled boundary layers. The main novelty is that the accommodation coefficient is in the full range $0&lt;\alpha\leq 1$. The previous works in the context of classical solutions only considered the simplest specular reflection boundary condition, i.e. $\alpha=0$. The mechanism of the derivation of fluid boundary conditions in the case $\alpha=O(1)$ is quite different with the cases $\alpha=0$ or $\alpha=o(1)$. This rigorously justifies the corresponding formal analysis in Sone's books \cite{sone2002kinetic,sone2007molecular}. In particular, this is a smooth solution analogue of \cite{jiang2010remarks}, in which the renormalized solution was considered and the boundary layers were not visible.</description>

      <title>Compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier approximation for the Boltzmann equation in bounded domains: from specular reflection to Navier-slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We justify the compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier approximation for the Boltzmann equation in general bounded domains. When the Boltzmann equation is imposed with the specular-reflection boundary condition (i.e. the accommodation coefficient $\alpha=0$), the complete Navier-slip boundary condition for the compressible Navier-Stokes system is derived. For this case, the boundary layers do not appear in the first-order Chapman-Enskog expansion. For the remainder term, we employ the $L^2\mbox{-}L^6\mbox{-}L^\infty$ framework to obtain the uniform in Knudsen number estimates.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann boundary layer equation with Maxwell reflection boundary condition and applications to fluid limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Knudsen layer equation in half-space, arising from the hydrodynamic limit of the Boltzmann equation to fluid dynamics. We consider the Maxwell reflection boundary condition with accommodation coefficient $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$. We restrict our attention to hard sphere collisions with angular cutoff, proving the existence, uniqueness, and asymptotic behavior of the solution in $L^{\infty}_{x,v}$. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of our theorem to the hydrodynamic limit through a specific example. In this expample, we derive the boundary conditions of the fluid equations using our theorem and the symmetric properties of the Knudsen layer equation for $\alpha\in(0,1]$ and $\alpha=O(1)$. These derivations differs significantly from the cases of specular and almost specular reflection. This explicitly characterizes the {\em vanishing sources set} defined in \cite{jiang2024knudsenboundarylayerequations}</description>

      <title>A class of moving boundary problems with an exponential source term</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates a class of moving boundary problems related to a nonlinear evolution equation featuring an exponential source term. We establish a connection to Stefan-type problems, for different boundary conditions at the fixed face, through the application of a reciprocal transformation alongside the Cole-Hopf transformation. For specific cases, we derive explicit similarity solutions in parametric form. This innovative approach enhances our understanding of the underlying dynamics and offers valuable insights into the behavior of these systems.</description>

      <title>A CR structure with blowing up solutions to the CR Yamabe problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a CR structure on $S^3$ such that the set of solutions to the CR Yamabe problem is not compact and admits a blowing-up sequence. Such CR structure is built deforming the standard CR structure of $S^3$ in the direction of the Rossi sphere CR structure on small balls, and the existence of the blowing-up sequence of solutions is proved through the Lyapunov-Schmidt method.</description>

      <title>Connecting SPDE to SGMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) derived from the Fokker-Planck equation associated with Score-based Generative Models. We modify the standard Fokker-Planck equation to better represent practical SGMs and introduce noise to mitigate potential discretization issues. The primary goal is to prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions for this SPDE. This aspect requires careful consideration due to the time-dependent operator and unbounded domain. To overcome these hurdles, we employ a variational approach and introduce a novel space inspired by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operators. By demonstrating that this space and its subspace satisfy the necessary assumptions, they establish the existence of a solution for the given SPDE.</description>

      <title>A geometric characterization of potential Navier-Stokes singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a local suitable weak solution to the Navier-Stokes equations, we prove that if the vorticity vectors belong to a double cone in regions of high vorticity magnitude, then the solution is regular. Roughly speaking this implies that, near a potential singularity, the directions of vorticity cannot avoid any great circle on the unit sphere. Our method, based on the control of local vorticity fluxes, is inspired by the classical Kelvin-Helmholtz law for ideal fluids and the Type I regularity theory for axisymmetric Navier-Stokes solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13080v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of an initial product state in a system of almost-bosonic-extended-anyons in the large-particle limit. We show that the dynamics of this system can be well approximated, in finite time, by a product state evolving under the effective Chern--Simons--Schr\"odinger equation. Furthermore, we provide a convergence rate for the approximation in terms of the radius $R = (\log N)^{\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon}$ of the extended anyons. These results establish a rigorous connection between the microscopic dynamics of almost-bosonic-anyon gases and the emergent macroscopic behavior described by the Chern--Simons--Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Is Stochastic Gradient Descent Effective? A PDE Perspective on Machine Learning processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the behaviour of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD), a widely used method in supervised learning for optimizing neural network weights via a minimization of non-convex loss functions. Since the pioneering work of E, Li and Tai (2017), the underlying structure of such processes can be understood via parabolic PDEs of Fokker-Planck type, which are at the core of our analysis. Even if Fokker-Planck equations have a long history and a extensive literature, almost nothing is known when the potential is non-convex or when the diffusion matrix is degenerate, and this is the main difficulty that we face in our analysis.
  We identify two different regimes: in the initial phase of SGD, the loss function drives the weights to concentrate around the nearest local minimum. We refer to this phase as the drift regime and we provide quantitative estimates on this concentration phenomenon. Next, we introduce the diffusion regime, where stochastic fluctuations help the learning process to escape suboptimal local minima. We analyze the Mean Exit Time (MET) and prove upper and lower bounds of the MET. Finally, we address the asymptotic convergence of SGD, for a non-convex cost function and a degenerate diffusion matrix, that do not allow to use the standard approaches, and require new techniques. For this purpose, we exploit two different methods: duality and entropy methods.
  We provide new results about the dynamics and effectiveness of SGD, offering a deep connection between stochastic optimization and PDE theory, and some answers and insights to basic questions in the Machine Learning processes: How long does SGD take to escape from a bad minimum? Do neural network parameters converge using SGD? How do parameters evolve in the first stage of training with SGD?</description>

      <title>Analytical and Numerical Study of a Convection-Diffusion-Reaction-Source Problem in Multilayered Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a thermal energy transfer problem in a one-dimensional multilayer body is theoretically analyzed, considering diffusion, advection, internal heat generation or loss linearly dependent on temperature in each layer, as well as heat generation due to external sources. Additionally, the thermal contact resistance at the interfaces between each pair of materials is taken into account. The problem is mathematically modeled, and explicit analytical solutions are derived using Fourier techniques. A convergent finite difference scheme is also formulated to simulate specific cases. The solution is consistent with previous results. A numerical example is provided, demonstrating the coherence between the obtained results and the physical behavior of the problem. This work was recently published for a two-layer body; the generalization to m-layer bodies allows for conclusions that enhance the theoretical understanding of heat transfer in multilayer materials and may contribute to improving the thermal design of multilayer engineering systems.</description>

Abstract: Biharmonic and conformal biharmonic maps are two fourth-order generalizations of the well-studied notion of harmonic maps in Riemannian geometry. In this article we consider maps into the Euclidean sphere and investigate a geometric algorithm that aims at rendering a given harmonic map either biharmonic or conformally biharmonic.
  For biharmonic maps we find that in the case of a closed domain the maximum principle imposes strong restrictions on our approach, whereas there is more flexibility when we have a non-compact domain and we highlight this difference by a number of examples.
  Concerning conformal biharmonic maps we show that our algorithm produces explicit critical points for maps between spheres. Moreover, it turns out that we do not get strong restrictions as we obtain for biharmonic maps, such that our algorithm might produce additional conformal biharmonic maps between spheres beyond the ones found in this article.</description>

      <title>$p$-Energy forms on fractals: recent progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we survey recent progress on self-similar $p$-energy forms on self-similar fractals, where $p\in(1,\infty)$. While for $p=2$ the notion of such forms coincides with that of self-similar Dirichlet forms and there have been plenty of studies on them since the late 1980s, studies on the case of $p\in(1,\infty)\setminus\{2\}$ was initiated much later in 2004 by Herman, Peirone and Strichartz [Potential Anal. 20 (2004), 125--148] and Strichartz and Wong [Nonlinearity 17 (2004), 595--616] and no essential progress on this case had been made since then until a few years ago. The recent progress by Kigami, Shimizu, Cao--Gu--Qiu and Murugan--Shimizu has established the existence of such $p$-energy forms on general post-critically finite (p.-c.f.) self-similar sets and on large classes of low-dimensional infinitely ramified self-similar sets, and the authors have proved further detailed properties of these forms and associated $p$-harmonic functions, mainly for p.-c.f. self-similar sets. This article is devoted to a review of these results, focusing on the most recent developments by the authors and illustrating them in the simplest non-trivial setting of the two-dimensional standard Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1909.08713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a homogenization theorem for quadratic convolution energies defined in perforated domains. The corresponding limit is a Dirichlet-type quadratic energy, whose integrand is defined by a non-local cell-problem formula. The proof relies on an extension theorem from perforated domains belonging to a wide class containing compact periodic perforations.</description>

      <title>Existence and Uniqueness for the SQG Vortex-Wave System when the Vorticity is Constant near the Point-Vortex</title>

Abstract: This article studies the vortex-wave system for the Surface Quasi-Geostrophic equation with parameter 0 &lt; s &lt; 1. We obtained local existence of classical solutions in H^4 under the standard ''plateau hypothesis'', H^2-stability of the solutions, and a blow-up criterion. In the sub-critical case s &gt; 1/2 we established global existence of weak solutions. For the critical case s = 1/2, we introduced a weaker notion of solution (V-weak solutions) to give a meaning to the equation and prove global existence.</description>

      <title>Poroelastic plate model obtained by simultaneous homogenization and dimension reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16220v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the starting point of our analysis is a coupled system of linear elasticity and Stokes equation. We consider two small parameters: the thickness $h$ of the thin plate and the pore scale $\varepsilon(h)$ which depends on $h$. We will focus specifically on the case when the pore size is comparatively small relative to the thickness of the plate. The main goal here is derive a model of a poroelastic plate, starting from the $3D$ problem as $h$ goes to zero, using simultaneous homogenization and dimension reduction techniques. The obtained model generalizes the poroelastic plate model derived by A. Mikeli\'c et. al. in 2015 using dimension reduction techniques from $3D$ Biot's equations in the sense that it also covers the case of contacts of poroelastic and (poro)elastic plate as well as the evolution equation with inertial term.</description>

      <title>A variational perspective on the dissipative Hamiltonian structure of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation describes the evolution of the probability density of the position and velocity of particles under the influence of external confinement, interaction, friction, and stochastic force. It is well-known that this equation can be formally seen as a dissipative Hamiltonian system in the Wasserstein space of probability measures. In order to better understand this geometric formalism, we introduce a time-discrete variational scheme, solutions of which converge to the solution of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation as time step vanishes; in particular, this provides a new proof of the existence of a weak solution to the equation. The variational scheme combines the symplectic Euler scheme and the (degenerate) implicit steepest descent, and updates the probability density at each iteration first in the velocity variable then in the position variable.
  The algorithm leverages the geometric structure of the equation, and has several desirable properties. Energy functionals involved in each variational problem are geodesically-convex, which implies the unique solvability of the problem. Furthermore, the correct dissipation of the Hamiltonian is observed at the discrete level up to higher order errors controlled by the second moments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study degenerate quasilinear elliptic equations on Riemannian manifolds and obtain several Liouville theorems. Notably, we provide rigorous proof asserting the nonexistence of positive solutions to the subcritical Lane-Emden-Fowler equations over complete Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. These findings serve as a significant generalization of Gidas and Spruck's pivotal work (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 34, 525-598, 1981) which focused on the semilinear case, as well as Serrin and Zou's contributions (Acta Math. 189, 79-142, 2002) within the context of Euclidean geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations on $\mathbb{R}^2$ close to the Poiseuille flow with viscosity $0&lt; \nu &lt; 1$. For the linearized problem, we prove that when the $x$-frequency satisfy $|k| \ge \nu^{-\frac{1}{3}}$, the perturbation decays on a time-scale proportional to $\nu^{-\frac{1}{2}}|k|^{-\frac{1}{2}}$. Since it decays faster than the heat equation, this phenomenon is referred to as enhanced dissipation. Then we concern the non-linear equations. We show that if the initial perturbation $\omega_{in}$ is of size at most $\nu^\frac{7}{12}$ in an anisotropic Sobolev space, then it remains so for all time.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^{N+1}$ with a connected $C^{2,\epsilon}$ ($\epsilon\in(0,1)$) boundary. We show that, if the following overdetermined elliptic problem \begin{equation} -\Delta u=\alpha u\,\, \text{in}\,\,\Omega, \,\, u=0\,\,\text{on}\,\, \partial\Omega,\,\,\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} =c\,\,\text{on}\,\,\partial\Omega\nonumber \end{equation} has a nontrivial solution, then $\Omega$ is a ball, which is exactly the affirmative answer to the Berenstein conjecture. Similarly, we show that, if $\Omega$ has a Lipschitz connected boundary and the following overdetermined elliptic problem \begin{equation} -\Delta u=\alpha u\,\, \text{in}\,\,\Omega, \,\, \frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=0\,\,\text{on}\,\, \partial\Omega,\,\,u =c\,\,\text{on}\,\,\partial\Omega\nonumber \end{equation} has a nontrivial solution, then $\Omega$ is also a ball, which is exactly the affirmative answer to the Schiffer conjecture.</description>

      <title>The role of mutants in the spatio-temporal progression of inflammatory bowel disease: three classes of permanent form travelling waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite its high prevalence and impact on the lives of those affected, a complete understanding of the cause of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is lacking. In this paper, we investigate a novel mechanism which proposes that mutant epithelial cells are significant to the progression of IBD since they promote inflammation and are resistant to death. We develop a simple model encapsulating the propagation of mutant epithelial cells and immune cells which results from interactions with the intestinal barrier and bacteria. Motivated by the slow growth of mutant epithelial cells, and relatively slow response rate of the adaptive immune system, we combine geometric singular perturbation theory with matched asymptotic expansions to determine the one-dimensional slow invariant manifold that characterises the leading order dynamics at all times beyond a passive initial adjustment phase. The dynamics on this manifold are controlled by a bifurcation parameter, $\sigma$, which depends on the ratio of growth to decay rates of all components except mutants and determines three distinct classes of permanent-form travelling waves that describe the propagation of mutant epithelial and immune cells. These are obtained from scalar reaction-diffusion equations with the reaction being (i) a bistable nonlinearity with a cut-off, (ii) a cubic Fisher nonlinearity and (iii) a KPP or Fisher nonlinearity. Our results suggest that mutant epithelial cells are critical to the progression of IBD. However, their effect on the speed of progression is subdominant.</description>

      <title>Regularity and structure of non-planar $p$-elasticae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove regularity and structure results for $p$-elasticae in $\mathbb{R}^n$, with arbitrary $p\in (1,\infty)$ and $n\geq2$. Planar $p$-elasticae are already classified and known to lose regularity. In this paper, we show that every non-planar $p$-elastica is analytic and three-dimensional, with the only exception of flat-core solutions of arbitrary dimensions. Subsequently, we classify pinned $p$-elasticae in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and, as an application, establish a Li-Yau type inequality for the $p$-bending energy of closed curves in $\mathbb{R}^n$. This extends previous works for $p=2$ and $n\geq2$ as well as for $p\in (1,\infty)$ and $n=2$.</description>

Abstract: With the smooth action of a connected compact Lie group G, we realize the G-invariant Thom-Smale complex in an analytic way using the G-invariant Witten instanton complex. Both complexes are associated to a specific Morse-Bott function on a closed oriented G-manifold. This result includes the influence from the horizontal direction around the critical set, generalizing the strict Morse case.</description>

      <title>Dual Cone Gradient Descent for Training Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a prominent approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by minimizing a combined loss function that incorporates both boundary loss and PDE residual loss. Despite their remarkable empirical performance in various scientific computing tasks, PINNs often fail to generate reasonable solutions, and such pathological behaviors remain difficult to explain and resolve. In this paper, we identify that PINNs can be adversely trained when gradients of each loss function exhibit a significant imbalance in their magnitudes and present a negative inner product value. To address these issues, we propose a novel optimization framework, Dual Cone Gradient Descent (DCGD), which adjusts the direction of the updated gradient to ensure it falls within a dual cone region. This region is defined as a set of vectors where the inner products with both the gradients of the PDE residual loss and the boundary loss are non-negative. Theoretically, we analyze the convergence properties of DCGD algorithms in a non-convex setting. On a variety of benchmark equations, we demonstrate that DCGD outperforms other optimization algorithms in terms of various evaluation metrics. In particular, DCGD achieves superior predictive accuracy and enhances the stability of training for failure modes of PINNs and complex PDEs, compared to existing optimally tuned models. Moreover, DCGD can be further improved by combining it with popular strategies for PINNs, including learning rate annealing and the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK).</description>
