      <title>Asymmetry in galaxy spin directions: a fully reproducible experiment using HSC data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymmetry in the large-scale distribution of the directions towards spiral galaxies rotate has been observed by multiple telescopes, all show a consistent asymmetry in the distribution of galaxy spin directions as observed from Earth. Here, galaxies with redshift from HSC DR3 are annotated by their direction of rotation, and their distribution is analyzed. The results show that galaxies that rotate in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way as observed from Earth are significantly more prevalent compared to galaxies that rotate in the same direction relative to the Milky Way. The asymmetry also forms a dipole axis that becomes stronger when the redshift gets higher. These results are aligned with observations from virtually all premier digital sky surveys, as well as space telescopes such as HST and JWST. That shows that the distribution of galaxy spin directions as observed from Earth is not symmetric, and has a possible link to the rotational velocity of the Milky Way. The experiment is provided with data, code, and a full protocol that allows to easily reproduce the results in a transparent manner. That practice is used to overcome the ``reproducibility crisis" in science.</description>

      <title>A novel approach to cosmological non-linearities as an effective fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a two parameters extension of the flat $\Lambda$CDM model to capture the impact of matter inhomogeneities on the background evolution of the Universe. Non virialized but non-linearly evolving overdense and underdense regions, whose abundance is quantified using the Press-Schechter formalism, are collectively described by two effective perfect fluids $\rho_{\rm{c}},\rho_{\rm{v}}$ with non vanishing equation of state parameters $w_{\rm{c,v}}\neq 0$. These fluids are coupled to the pressureless dust, akin to an interacting DM-DE scenario. The resulting phenomenology is very rich, and could potentially address a number of inconsistencies of the standard model, including a simultaneous resolution of the Hubble and $\sigma_8$ tensions. To assess the viability of the model, we set initial conditions compatible to the Planck 2018 best fit $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and fit its additional parameters using SN~Ia observations from DESY5 and a sample of uncorrelated $f\sigma_8$ measurements. Our findings show that backreaction effects from the cosmic web could restore the concordance between early and late Universe cosmological probes.</description>

      <title>The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2: Second Data Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the second data release of the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2 (MaDCoWS2). We expand from the equatorial first data release to most of the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey area, covering a total area of 6498 deg^2. The catalog consists of 133,036 S/N $\geq5$ galaxy cluster candidates at $0.1\leq z \leq2$, including 6790 candidates at z &gt; 1.5. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify spurious detections, and include CNN-based cluster probabilities in the final catalog. We also compare the MaDCoWS2 sample with literature catalogs in the same area. The larger sample provides robust results that are consistent with our first data release. At S/N $\geq5$, we rediscover 59-91% of clusters in existing catalogs that lie in the unmasked area of MC2. The median positional offsets are under 250 kpc, and the standard deviation of the redshifts is 0.031(1+z). We fit a redshift-dependent power law to the relation between MaDCoWS2 S/N and observables from existing catalogs. Over the redshift ranges where the surveys overlap with MaDCoWS2, the lowest scatter is found between S/N and observables from optical/infrared surveys. We also assess the performance of our method using a mock light cone measuring purity and completeness as a function of cluster mass. The purity is above 90%, and we estimate the 50% completeness threshold at a virial mass of log(M/M$_\odot$)$\approx14.3$. The completeness estimate is uncertain due to the small number of massive halos in the light cone, but consistent with the recovery fraction found by comparing to other cluster catalogs.</description>

      <title>A spinodal decomposition model for the large-scale structure of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tremendous efforts placed in understanding the structure and galaxy formation in the universe have led to major improvements in our models for the universe. Particular the computational simulations that solve its non-linear growth have painted a clearer picture of the processes behind the enormous scale and shape of the structures observed experimentally. Inspired by porous structure of polymer membranes prepared using phase-inversion, we have taken a fresh-approach to understand how the universe got its present structure. We present the results of a finite-element method based simulation to predict large-scale structure formation in the universe. The novel method applies the Cahn-Hilliard model of spinodal decomposition of a binary mixture to predict the dynamics of matter and dark-energy distribution in the universe. The results closely match the various surveys of matter distribution in the universe and can prove to be an important step towards decreasing the computational resources required for future simulations.</description>

      <title>Galactic and extragalactic probe of dark matter with LISA's binary black holes near their galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming LISA mission will be able to detect gravitational waves from galactic and extragalactic compact binaries. Here, we report on LISA's capability to probe dark matter around these binaries if the latter constitute black holes. By analyzing the variation in the chirp mass of the binary, we show that depending on the black hole masses, LISA should be able to probe their surrounding dark matter to a luminosity distance of $\approx 1$ Gpc if such binaries are observed within the inner $\approx 10$ pc of their galactic center for particle-like dark matter or near the galactic solitonic core for wave-like dark matter. In the case a null result is recorded during the course of observation of \emph{well-localized} binaries, one can still rule out certain parameter spaces of dark matter as being the dominant contributor to the matter budget of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Simulation-Based Inference for Cosmological Initial Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing cosmological initial conditions (ICs) from late-time observations is a difficult task, which relies on the use of computationally expensive simulators alongside sophisticated statistical methods to navigate multi-million dimensional parameter spaces. We present a simple method for Bayesian field reconstruction based on modeling the posterior distribution of the initial matter density field to be diagonal Gaussian in Fourier space, with its covariance and the mean estimator being the trainable parts of the algorithm. Training and sampling are extremely fast (training: $\sim 1 \, \mathrm{h}$ on a GPU, sampling: $\lesssim 3 \, \mathrm{s}$ for 1000 samples at resolution $128^3$), and our method supports industry-standard (non-differentiable) $N$-body simulators. We verify the fidelity of the obtained IC samples in terms of summary statistics.</description>

      <title>On the spatial distribution of the Large-Scale structure: An Unsupervised search for Parity Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use machine learning methods to search for parity violations in the Large-Scale Structure (LSS) of the Universe, motivated by recent claims of chirality detection using the 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF), which would suggest new physics during the epoch of inflation. This work seeks to reproduce these claims using methods originating from high energy collider analyses. Our machine learning methods optimise some underlying parity odd function of the data, and use it to evaluate the parity odd fraction. We demonstrate the effectiveness and suitability of these methods and then apply them to the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) catalogue. No parity violation is detected at any significance.</description>

      <title>Correcting for Selection Biases in the Determination of the Hubble Constant from Time-Delay Cosmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time delays in lensed quasars now provide a $H_0$ estimate comparable in precision to the local distance ladder. The primary source of systematic uncertainty in $H_0$ from time delay cosmography is the mass-sheet transform (MST). The TDCOSMO collaboration inferred that a mass sheet is present such that the inferred Hubble constant decreases by 8$\%$. However, that result is limited by the assumption that the density profiles of galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-quasar lenses are the same. In this work, we use a composite star plus dark matter mass profile for the deflector population and model the selection function for galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-quasar lenses. We find that a power-law density profile with an MST is a good approximation to a two-component mass profile around the Einstein radius, but require a mass sheet parameter, $\lambda_\mathrm{int}$, of 0.95$^{+0.06}_{-0.08}$ for SLACS like galaxy-galaxy lenses and 0.87$^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$ for quadruply-imaged quasars. For individual systems, $\lambda_\mathrm{int}$ is strongly correlated with the ratio of the half-light radius and Einstein radius of the lens. By propagating these results through the TDCOSMO we find that $H_0$ is lowered by $\sim$3\%. Using the velocity dispersions from SLACS IX and our fiducial model for selection biases we infer H$_0 = 66\pm4 \mathrm{(stat)} \pm 1 \mathrm{(model \: sys)} \pm 2 \mathrm{(measurement \: sys)} \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for the TDCOSMO plus SLACS dataset. The first residual systematic error is due to plausible alternative choices in modelling the selection function, the second is an estimate of the remaining systematic error in the measurement of velocity dispersions for SLACS lenses. Accurate time delay cosmography requires accurate velocity dispersion measurements and accurate calibration of selection biases.</description>

      <title>Testing early physics solutions to the Hubble tension with CMB data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One approach to reconciling local measurements of a high expansion rate with observations of acoustic oscillations in the CMB and galaxy clustering (the "Hubble tension") is to introduce additional contributions to the $\Lambda$CDM model that are relevant before recombination. While numerous possibilities exist, none are currently well-motivated or preferred by data. However, future CMB experiments, which will measure acoustic peaks to much smaller scales and resolve polarization signals with higher signal-to-noise over large sky areas, should detect almost any such modification at high significance.
  We propose a model-agnostic method to capture most relevant possible deviations from $\Lambda$CDM due to additional non-interacting components, while remaining sufficiently constraining to enable detection across various scenarios. The phenomenological model uses a fluid model with four parameters governing additional density contributions that peak at different redshifts, and two sound speed parameters. We forecast possible constraints with Simons Observatory, explore parameter degeneracies that arise in $\Lambda$CDM, and demonstrate that this method could detect a range of specific models. Which of the new parameters gets excited can indicate the nature of any new physics, while the generality of the model allows for testing with future data in a way that should not be plagued by a posteriori choices or publication bias.
  When testing our model with Planck data, we find good consistency with the $\Lambda$CDM model, but the data also allows for large Hubble parameter, especially if the sound speed of an additional component is not too different to that of radiation.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Shimmering: the Gravitational Wave Signal of Time-Resolved Cosmic Shear Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach for detecting gravitational waves through their influence on the shape of resolved astronomical objects. This method, complementary to pulsar timing arrays and astrometric techniques, explores the time-dependent distortions caused by gravitational waves on the shapes of celestial bodies, such as galaxies or any resolved extended object. By developing a formalism based on that adopted in the analysis of weak lensing effects, we derive the response functions for gravitational wave-induced distortions and compute their angular correlation functions. Our results highlight the sensitivity of these distortions to the lowest frequencies of the gravitational wave spectrum and demonstrate how they produce distinct angular correlation signatures, including null and polarisation-sensitive correlations. These findings pave the way for future high-resolution surveys to exploit this novel observable, potentially offering new insights into the stochastic gravitational wave background and cosmological models.</description>

      <title>The abundance and nature of high-redshift quiescent galaxies from JADES spectroscopy and the FLAMINGO simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use NIRSpec/MSA spectroscopy and NIRCam imaging to study a sample of 18 massive ($\log\; M_{*}/M_{\odot} \gt 10\;$dex), central quiescent galaxies at $2\leq z \leq 5$ in the GOODS fields, to investigate their number density, star-formation histories, quenching timescales, and incidence of AGN. The depth of our data reaches $\log M_*/M_\odot \approx 9\;$dex, yet the least-massive central quiescent galaxy found has $\log M_*/M_\odot \gt 10\;$dex, suggesting that quenching is regulated by a physical quantity that scales with $M_*$. With spectroscopy as benchmark, we assess the completeness and purity of photometric samples, finding number densities 10 times higher than predicted by galaxy formation models, confirming earlier photometric studies. We compare our number densities to predictions from FLAMINGO, the largest-box full-hydro simulation suite to date. We rule out cosmic variance at the 3-$\sigma$ level, providing spectroscopic confirmation that galaxy formation models do not match observations at $z&gt;3$. Using FLAMINGO, we find that the vast majority of quiescent galaxies' stars formed in situ, with these galaxies not having undergone multiple major dry mergers. This is in agreement with the compact observed size of these systems and suggests that major mergers are not a viable channel for quenching most massive galaxies. Several of our observed galaxies are particularly old, with four galaxies displaying 4000-\r{A} breaks; full-spectrum fitting infers formation and quenching redshifts of $z\geq8$ and $z\geq6$. Using all available AGN tracers, we find that 8 massive quiescent galaxies host AGN, including in old systems. This suggests a high duty cycle of AGN and a continued trickle of gas to fuel accretion.</description>

      <title>Experimental targets for dark photon dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight dark photon dark matter features distinctive cosmological and astrophysical signatures and is also supported by a burgeoning direct-detection program searching for its kinetic mixing with the ordinary photon over a wide mass range. Dark photons, however, cannot necessarily constitute the dark matter in all of this parameter space. In minimal models where the dark photon mass arises from a dark Higgs mechanism, early Universe dynamics can easily breach the regime of validity of the low-energy effective theory for a massive vector field. In the process, the dark sector can collapse into a cosmic string network, precluding dark photons as viable dark matter. We establish the general conditions under which dark photon production avoids significant backreaction on the dark Higgs and identify regions of parameter space that naturally circumvent these constraints. After surveying implications for known dark photon production mechanisms, we propose novel models that set well-motivated experimental targets across much of the accessible parameter space. We also discuss complementary cosmological and astrophysical signatures that can probe the dark sector physics responsible for dark photon production.</description>

      <title>SMILES: Discovery of Higher Ionizing Photon Production Efficiency in Overdense Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topology of reionization and the environments where galaxies efficiently produce ionizing photons are key open questions. For the first time, we investigate the correlation between ionizing photon production efficiency, $\xi_{\rm ion}$, and galaxy overdensity, $\log(1+\delta)$. We analyze the ionizing properties of 93 galaxies between $0.7 &lt; z &lt; 6.9$ using JWST NIRSpec medium-resolution spectra from the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES) program. Among these, 67 galaxies have H$\alpha$ coverage, spanning $0.7 &lt; z &lt; 3.7$. The galaxy overdensity, $\log(1+\delta)$, is measured using the JADES photometric catalog, which covers the SMILES footprint. For the subset with H$\alpha$ coverage, we find that $\log\xi_{\rm ion}$ is positively correlated with $\log(1+\delta)$, with a slope of $0.94_{-0.46}^{+0.46}$. Additionally, the mean $\xi_{\rm ion}$ for galaxies in overdense regions ($\log(1+\delta) &gt; 0.1$) is 2.43 times that of galaxies in lower density regions ($\log(1+\delta) &lt; 0.1$). This strong correlation is found to be independent of redshift evolution. Furthermore, our results confirm the robust correlations between $\xi_{\rm ion}$ and the rest-frame equivalent widths of the [O III] or H$\alpha$ emission lines. Our results suggest that galaxies in high-density regions are efficient producers of ionizing photons.</description>

Abstract: The first few cycles of JWST have identified an overabundance of UV-bright galaxies and a general excess of UV luminosity density at $z\gtrsim10$ compared to expectations from most (pre-JWST) theoretical models. Moreover, some of the brightest high-redshift spectroscopically confirmed galaxies exhibit peculiar chemical abundance patterns, most notably extremely high N/O ratios. Since N/O has been empirically shown to scale strongly with He/H, as expected for hot hydrogen burning, these same bright high-redshift galaxies are likely also helium-enhanced. Under simplistic assumptions for stellar evolution, the bolometric luminosity of a star scales as $L\propto (4-\frac{9}{2}Y+\frac{5}{4}Y^{2})^{-1}$ -- hence a higher He/H leads to brighter stars. In this Letter, we evolve a series of MESA models to the zero-age main-sequence and highlight that the helium enhancements at the levels measured and inferred for high-redshift galaxies can boost the 1500 $\mathring{\rm A}$ UV luminosity by up to $\sim50\%$, while simultaneously increasing the stellar effective temperature. The combination of helium enhancements with nebular continuum emission expected for intense bursts of star formation have the potential to help reduce the tension between JWST observations and certain galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>The Maximal Gravitational Wave Signal from Asteroid-Mass Primordial Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes can be the entirety of the dark matter in a broad, approximately five-orders-of-magnitude-wide mass range, the ``asteroid mass range'', between $10^{-16}\ M_{\rm Sun}$ -- where constraints originate from evaporation -- and $10^{-11}\ M_{\rm Sun}$ -- from microlensing. A direct detection in this mass range is very challenging with any known observational or experimental methods. Here we point out that, unlike previously asserted in the literature, a transient gravitational wave signal from the inspiral phase of light black hole mergers is in principle detectable with current and future high-frequency gravitational wave detectors, including but not limited to ADMX. The largest detection rates are associated with binaries from non-monochromatic mass functions in early-formed three-body systems.</description>

      <title>Lyman-$\alpha$ limit on axion-like cold dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using low redshift data on astrophysical reionization, we report new Lyman-$\alpha$ limit on axion-like particle (ALP) as cold dark matter in ALP mass range of $m_{a}\sim 30-1000$ eV. Compared to the Leo T and soft-X ray bound, this limit is so far the most stringent in the ALP mass range of $m_{a}\sim 375-425$ eV and complementary in the ALP mass range otherwise. Combing these limits, we show new exclusion limits on $m_a$ for the ALP DM from either misalignment or freeze-in mechanism.</description>

      <title>The impact of the local stellar radiation on the formation and evolution of dwarfs in and near Milky Way analogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the effect of local stellar radiation on the formation and evolution of the dwarf galaxies near the Milk Way(MW) analogues. Using five simulations from the Auriga project, both with and without local stellar radiation, we find that the local stellar radiation, as a pre-reionization source, is quite effective to photoionize and heat the gas around the proto-MW analogues. As a result, the formation of surrounding dwarf galaxies in dark matter halos with halo masses below approximately $10^{9.5}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ are significantly suppressed. After the reionization, the intensity of the local stellar radiation eventually becomes comparable to that of UVB, consequently the impact of local stellar radiation on the surrounding dwarf galaxy formation decreases with decreasing redshift, and almost vanishes after redshift $z=4$. At present day, the bright satellite population in the simulations with and without local stellar radiation is nearly identical. While our simulation have no enough resolution to resolve the fainest satellite galaxies which are most prone to the local stellar radiation, we use accreted galaxy mass function to assess the impact, and find that the reduction in the faintest satellite is around $13$ percent in case of the local stellar radiation, a factor not negligible to constrain dark matter models using the precise abundance of MW satellite galaxies.</description>

Abstract: Measurements of the luminosity distance of propagating gravitational waves can provide invaluable information on the geometry and content of our Universe. Due to the clustering of cosmic structures, in realistic situations we need to average the luminosity distance of events coming from patches inside a volume. In this work we evaluate, in a gauge-invariant and fully-relativistic treatment, the impact of cosmological perturbations on such averaging process. We find that clustering, lensing and peculiar velocity effects impact estimates for future detectors such as Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, the Big Bang Observer and DECIGO. The signal-to-noise ratio of the angular power spectrum of the average luminosity distance over all the redshift bins is 17 in the case of binary black holes detected by Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We also provide fitting formulas for the corrections to the average luminosity distance due to general relativistic effects.</description>

      <title>The Glow of Axion Quark Nugget Dark Matter: (I) Large Scale Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion quark nuggets (AQNs) are hypothetical objects with a mass greater than a few grams and sub-micrometer size, formed during the quark-hadron transition. Originating from the axion field, they offer a possible resolution of the similarity between visible and dark components of the Universe. These composite objects behave as cold dark matter, interacting with ordinary matter and resulting in pervasive electromagnetic radiation throughout the Universe. This work aims to predict the electromagnetic signature in large-scale structures from the AQN-baryon interaction, accounting for thermal and non-thermal radiations. We use Magneticum hydrodynamical simulations to describe the distribution and dynamics of gas and dark matter at cosmological scales. We calculate the electromagnetic signature from radio, starting at $\nu \sim$ 1 GHz, up to a few keV X-ray energies. We find that the AQNs signature is characterized by monopole and fluctuation signals. The amplitude of both signals strongly depends on the average AQN mass and the ionization level of the baryonic environment. We identify a most optimistic scenario with a signal often near the sensitivity limit of existing instruments, such as FIRAS and the South Pole Telescope for high-resolution. Fluctuations in the Extra-galactic Background Light caused by the AQN can be tested with space-based imagers Euclid and James Webb Space Telescope. We also identify a minimal configuration, still out of reach of existing instruments, but future experiments might be able to pose constraints on the AQN model. We conclude that this is a viable dark matter model, which does not violate the canons of cosmology, nor existing observations. The best chances for testing this model reside in 1) ultra-deep IR and optical surveys, 2) spectral distorsions of the CMB and 3) low-frequency (1 GHz &lt; $\nu $ &lt; 100 GHz) and high-resolution ($\ell &gt; 10^4$) observations.</description>

      <title>SKYSURF VI: The Impact of Thermal Variations of HST on Background Light Estimates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SKYSURF project constrained extragalactic background light (EBL) and diffuse light with the vast archive of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. Thermal emission from HST itself introduces an additional uncertain background and hinders accurate measurement of the diffuse light level. Here, we use archival WFC3/IR engineering data to investigate and model changes in the temperature of various components in HST's optical path as a function of time (solar cycle) and time of the year (Earth-Sun distance). We also specifically investigate changes in temperature with HST's orbital phase and time since Earth occultation. We investigate possible correlations between HST component temperature and year, and temperature and month. The thermal background changes by less than one Kelvin in the WFC3 pick-off mirror, one of the most important contributors to the thermal background. We model these data to describe the impact that orbital phase, year, and time of year have on the HST and WFC3 component temperatures, and use this to derive the impact on the thermal dark signal and the resulting diffuse light measurements. Based on this improved modeling, we provide new upper limits on the level of diffuse light of 21 nW m-2 sr-1, 32 nW m-2 sr-1, and 25 nW m-2 sr-1 for F125W, F140W, and F160W. Additionally, by accounting for all known sources of measurement uncertainty, we report lower limits on the level of diffuse light of 12 nW m-2 sr-1, 20 nW m-2 sr-1, and 2 nW m-2 sr-1 for F125W, F140W, and F160W.</description>

      <title>Testing the phenomenological interacting dark energy model with gamma-ray bursts and Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we utilize recent observational data from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and Pantheon+ supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) sample to explore the interacting dark energy (IDE) model in a phenomenological scenario. Results from GRBs alone, SNe Ia and GRBs+SNe Ia indicate that the energy is transferred from dark energy to dark matter and the coincidence problem is alleviated. The value of $H_0$ from GRBs+SNe Ia in the IDE scenario shows agreement with the SH0ES measurement. Considering the age estimate of the quasar APM 08279+5255 at $z = 3.91$, we find that the phenomenological IDE scenario can predict a cosmic age greater than that of the $\Lambda$CDM model, thus the cosmic age problem can be alleviated.</description>

      <title>Bending the web: exploring the impact of modified gravity on the density field and halo properties within the cosmic web</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the impact of different Modified Gravity (MG) models on the large-scale structures (LSS) properties in relation to the cosmic web (CW), using N-body simulations of f(R) and nDGP models. We analyse the impact of the MG effect on the density field through density distribution and clustering statistics, and assess its influence on halo properties by examining the halo mass function and spin. We find that the PDF of dark matter density fields shift towards lower densities for stronger variants of f(R) and nDGP. Additionally, when segregated into CW environments, the stronger variants show a higher mean density in knots, and a lower mean density in voids compared to LCDM. For higher-order clustering statistics relative to LCDM, the scale-dependent f(R) variants exhibit a greater non-monotonic deviation as a function of scale when segregated into environments, compared to nDGP. Additionally, the halo mass function separated into CW environments shows a similar behaviour, introducing complex trends as a function of mass for f(R) and nDGP models. We also report up to a 15% enhancement in the angular momentum of halos in f(R) gravity models compared to LCDM, with similar differences when considering environmental segregation. We demonstrate that this difference in the spin arises largely due to different tidal torquing across the various MG models. Therefore, studying higher-order statistics of the cosmological fields and halo properties separated into CW components probes the additional physics contained within the MG models. We conclude that considering the effect of CW in MG studies increases the constraining power of these LSS statistics, and can further aid the distinction between the cosmologies that have an identical expansion history to the standard LCDM but differing underlying physics, such as the MG models presented in this work.</description>

      <title>Implications of feedback solutions to the $S_8$ tension for the baryon fractions of galaxy groups and clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent large-scale structure (LSS) surveys have revealed a persistent tension in the value of $S_8$ compared to predictions from the standard cosmological model. This tension may suggest the need for new physics beyond the standard model, but an accurate characterisation of baryonic effects is essential to avoid biases. Although some studies indicate that baryonic effects are too small to resolve this tension, others propose that more aggressive feedback mechanisms could reconcile differences between cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements and low-redshift LSS observations. In this paper, we investigate the role of baryonic effects in alleviating the $S_8$ tension. We extend the SP(k) model (Salcido et al. 2023), which was trained on hundreds of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to map the suppression of the matter power spectrum to the baryon fraction in groups and clusters, to predict the required baryon fraction for a given $P(k)$ suppression. We then compare predictions from recent cosmic shear (weak lensing) analyses with the latest baryon budget measurements from X-ray and weak gravitational lensing studies. Our findings show that studies marginalising over baryonic effects while fixing cosmological parameters to a Planck-like cosmology predict strong $P(k)$ suppression and baryon fractions that are much lower than existing low-redshift baryon budget estimates of galaxy groups and clusters. Conversely, most studies that marginalise over both cosmological parameters and baryonic effects imply baryon fractions that are consistent with observations but lower values of $S_8$ than inferred from the CMB. Unless the observed baryon fractions are biased high by a factor of several, these results suggest that a mechanism beyond baryonic physics alone is required to modify or slow down the growth of structure in the universe in order to resolve the $S_8$ tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While photons and gravitons do not interact significantly, photons can be converted to gravitons in a background magnetic field -- a phenomenon known as the Gertsenshtein effect. In this paper, we investigate whether chiral electromagnetic (EM) waves can be converted to chiral gravitational waves (GW) in the presence of primordial magnetic fields during the radiation-dominated epoch of the early universe. We consider two situations wherein chirality is either present in the propagating EM waves or it exists in the background magnetic field. Our analysis shows that while the conversion probability increases with stronger magnetic fields, it remains insensitive to the chiral nature of the background magnetic field. Consequently, the net chirality parameter is independent of the chirality of the background field in both cases. Finally, we demonstrate that the present-day energy density of the produced chiral GWs peaks at a frequency of $\sim 100$ GHz, and the corresponding characteristic strain will be highly sensitive to current and future missions designed to detect high-frequency GWs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study axion-photon couplings in compactifications of type IIB string theory. We find that these couplings are systematically suppressed compared to the inverse axion periodicity, as a result of two effects. First, couplings to the QED theta angle are suppressed for axion mass eigenstates that are light compared to the mass scale set by stringy instantons on the cycle supporting QED. Second, in compactifications with many axions the intersection matrix is sparse, making kinetic mixing weak. We study the resulting phenomenology in an ensemble of $200{,}000$ toy models constructed from the Kreuzer-Skarke database up to the maximum Hodge number $h^{1,1}=491$. We examine freeze-in production and decay of thermal axions, birefringence of the cosmic microwave background, X-ray spectrum oscillations, and constraints on the QCD axion from supernovae. We conclude that compactifications in this corner of the landscape involve many invisible axions, as well as a handful that may be detectable via photon couplings.</description>

Abstract: We forecast high-frequency gravitational wave (GW) from preheating hosting gravitational dark matter (GDM) as the indirect probe of such GDM. We use proper lattice simulations to handle resonance, and to solve GW equation of motion with the resonance induced scalar field excitations as source term. Our numerical results show that Higgs scalar excitations in Higgs preheating model give rise to magnitudes of GW energy density spectra of order $10^{-10}$ at frequencies $10-10^{3}$ MHz depending on the GDM mass, whereas inflaton fluctuation excitations in inflaton self-resonant preheating model yield magnitudes of GW energy density spectrum up to $10^{-9}~(10^{-11})$ at frequencies near $30~(2)$ MHz for the index $n=4~(6)$ with respect to the GDM mass of $1.04~(2.66)\times 10^{14}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Detecting a Gravitational-Wave Background from Inflation with Null Energy Condition Violation: Prospects for Taiji</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08375v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The null energy condition (NEC) is a fundamental principle in general relativity, and its violation could leave discernible signatures in gravitational waves (GWs). A violation of the NEC during the primordial era would imprint a blue-tilted spectrum on the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nanohertz frequencies, potentially accounting for the recently detected signal by pulsar timing arrays. Remarkably, models of NEC violation during inflation also predict a nearly scale-invariant GW spectrum in the millihertz frequency range, which could be detectable by upcoming space-based GW detectors such as Taiji. The observation of this distinctive spectrum would provide compelling evidence for new physics beyond the standard cosmological paradigm. In this study, we explore Taiji's ability to detect an SGWB arising from NEC violation during inflation, considering various foregrounds and noise sources, including an extragalactic foreground from binary black hole mergers throughout the universe, a galactic foreground from white dwarf binaries, and the intrinsic noise of the Taiji detector. Employing comprehensive Bayesian parameter estimation techniques to analyze simulated Taiji data, we demonstrate a remarkable precision improvement of three orders of magnitude compared to the NANOGrav 15-year data set for measuring the tensor power spectrum amplitude, $P_{T,2}$, during the second inflationary stage. This substantial enhancement in measurement capabilities underscores Taiji's potential as a powerful probe for investigating the NEC violation in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave spectrum from expanding string loops on domain walls: Implication for nanohertz pulsar timing array signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically calculate the spectrum of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by expanding string loops on domain walls in the scenario where domain walls decay by nucleation of string loops. By introducing macroscopic parameters characterizing the nucleation of the loops, the stochastic GW spectrum is derived in a way that is independent of the details of particle physics models. In contrast to GWs emitted from bubble collisions of the false vacuum decay, the string loops do radiate GWs even when they are perfectly circular before their collisions, resulting in that more and more contribution to the spectrum comes from the smaller and smaller loops compared to the typical size of the collided loops. Consequently, the spectrum is linearly proportional to the frequency at the high-frequency region, which is peculiar to this GW source. Furthermore, the results are compared with the recent nano-Hertz pulsar timing array signal, as well as the projected sensitivity curves of future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Universal properties of the evolution of the Universe in modified loop quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically study the evolution of the Universe in the framework of a modified loop quantum cosmological model (mLQC-I) with various inflationary potentials, including chaotic, Starobinsky, generalized Starobinsky, polynomials of the first and second kinds, generalized T- models and natural inflation. In all these models, the big bang singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce, and the evolution of the Universe both before and after the bounce is universal and weakly depends on the inflationary potentials, as long as the evolution is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton at the bounce. In particular, the evolution in the pre-bounce region can be universally divided into three different phases: pre-bouncing, pre-transition, and pre-de Sitter. The pre-bouncing phase occurs immediately before the quantum bounce, during which the evolution of the Universe is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton. Thus, the equation of state of the inflaton is about one, w = 1. Soon, the inflation potential takes over, so w rapidly falls from one to negative one. This pre-transition phase is very short and quickly turns into the pre-de Sitter phase, whereby the effective cosmological constant with a Planck size takes over and dominates the rest of the contracting phase. In the entire pre-bounce regime, the evolution of the expansion factor and the inflaton can be approximated by analytical solutions, which are universal and independent of the inflation potentials.</description>

      <title>Calibrating and standardizing the Tip of the Red Giant Branch in the Small Magellanic Cloud using small-amplitude red giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19375v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the absolute calibration of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using small amplitude red giant stars (SARGs) classified by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). We show that all stars near the SMC's TRGB are SARGs. Distinguishing older and younger RGs near the Tip according to two period-luminosity sequences labeled A and B, we show many similarities among SARG populations of the LMC and the SMC, along with notable differences. Specifically, SMC SARGs have shorter periods due to lower metallicity and smaller amplitudes due to younger ages than LMC SARGs. We discover two period-color relations near the TRGB that span all A- and B-sequence stars in the OGLE-III footprints of the SMC and LMC, and we investigate using periods instead of color for TRGB standardization. Using variability derived information only, we trace the SMC's age and metallicity gradients and show the core to be populated by younger, more metal rich RGs. The B-sequence yields the brightest and most accurate calibration ($M_{\mathrm{F814W,syn}} = -4.057 \pm 0.019 (\mathrm{stat.}) \pm 0.029 (\mathrm{syst.})$ mag), which we use to measure the distance modulus difference between the Clouds and investigate metallicity effects. Distance measurements not informed by variability should employ the SARGs-based calibration based on all stars near the tip ($M_{\mathrm{F814W,syn}} = -4.024 \pm 0.041 (\mathrm{stat.}) \pm 0.029 (\mathrm{syst.})$ mag). Our work highlights the impact of RG population diversity on TRGB distance measurements. Further study is needed unravel these effects and improve TRGB standardization.</description>

      <title>A photo-z cautionary tale: Redshift confirmation of COSBO-7 at z=2.625</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photometric redshifts are widely used in studies of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs), but catastrophic photo-$z$ failure can undermine all redshift-dependent results. Here we report the spectroscopic redshift confirmation of COSBO-7, a strongly lensed DSFG in the COSMOS-PRIMER field. Recently, a photometric redshift solution of $z\gtrsim7.0$ was reported for COSBO-7 based on ten bands of {\it James Webb} Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam and MIRI imaging data. This $z$ value was favored by four independent spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes, and the result provided an appealing candidate for the most distant massive DSFG known to date. This photo-$z$ solution was also supported by a single line detection in Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) Band 3 consistent with CO(7-6) at $z=7.46$. However, our new ALMA observations robustly detect two lines in Band 6 identified as CO(7-6) and [CI](2-1) at $z_{\rm spec}=2.625$, and thus the Band 3 line as CO(3-2). These three robust line detections decidedly place COSBO-7 at $z=2.625$, refuting the photo-$z$ solution. We derive physical parameters by fitting near-infrared(NIR)-to-millimeter(mm) photometry and lens modeling, revealing that COSBO-7 is a main sequence galaxy. We examine possible reasons for this photo-$z$ failure and attribute it to (1) the likely underestimation of photometric uncertainties at 0.9\,$\mu$m and 1.15 \,$\mu$m; and (2) the lack of photometry at wavelengths beyond 20\,$\mu$m. Notably, we recover a bona fide $z_{\rm phot}\sim 2.3$ by including the existing MIPS $24\,\mu$m photometry, demonstrating the critical importance of mid-infrared (MIR) data in bolstering photo-$z$ measurements. This work highlights a common challenge in modeling the SEDs of DSFGs, and provides a cautionary tale regarding the reliability of photometric redshifts as well as pseudo-spectroscopic redshifts based on single line detection.</description>

      <title>Dark Photon Dark Matter and Low-Frequency Gravitational Wave Detection with Gaia-like Astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrometric surveys offer us a method to search for elusive cosmic signatures, such as ultralight dark photon dark matter and gravitational waves, by observing the deflection to the apparent positions of the stars. The detection capabilities of such surveys rapidly decrease at low frequencies, because the signals become hardly distinguishable from the background motion of stars. In this work, we find that the background motion can be well described by a linear model over time, based on which we propose a linear background subtraction scheme. Compared to the conventional quadratic subtraction, the advantage of linear subtraction emerges within the frequency range below $6 \times 10^{-9}~{\rm Hz}$. Taking dark photons with purely gravitational interactions, dark photons with additional $U(1)_{B}$ or $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge interactions, and low-frequency gravitational waves as examples, we illustrate that the linear subtraction scheme can result in an enhancement of more than one order of magnitude in the exclusion limits of Gaia-like experiments in the low-frequency range.</description>

      <title>A try for dark energy in quantum field theory: The vacuum energy of neutrino field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we try to interpret the origin of dark energy in quantum field theory (QFT). The vacuum energy of a field in QFT is a quartic-divergence input, and its physical contribution to dark energy is calculated in the UV-free scheme. There is a mass-energy window that the active vacuum energy of neutrino fields can naturally meet the observation of dark energy density, and a neutrino with a typical mass $\sim$ 10 meV is expected. The normal hierarchical spectrum of neutrinos is preferred by naturalness, and the neutrino mass window set by dark energy is about 6.3 meV $\lesssim m_1 \lesssim$ 16.3 meV, 10.7 meV $\lesssim m_2 \lesssim$ 18.4 meV, 50.5 meV $\lesssim m_3 \lesssim$ 52.7 meV.</description>
