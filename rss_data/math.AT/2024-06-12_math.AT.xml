      <title>Higher structures on homology groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We dualise the classical fact that an operad with multiplication leads to cohomology groups which form a Gerstenhaber algebra to the context of cooperads: as a result, a cooperad with comultiplication induces a homology theory that is endowed with the structure of a Gerstenhaber coalgebra, that is, it comes with a graded cocommutative coproduct which is compatible with a coantisymmetric cobracket in a dual Leibniz sense. As an application, one obtains Gerstenhaber coalgebra structures on Tor groups over bialgebras or Hopf algebras, as well as on Hochschild homology for Frobenius algebras.</description>

      <title>Topological Expressivity of ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11130v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the expressivity of ReLU neural networks in the setting of a binary classification problem from a topological perspective. Recently, empirical studies showed that neural networks operate by changing topology, transforming a topologically complicated data set into a topologically simpler one as it passes through the layers. This topological simplification has been measured by Betti numbers, which are algebraic invariants of a topological space. We use the same measure to establish lower and upper bounds on the topological simplification a ReLU neural network can achieve with a given architecture. We therefore contribute to a better understanding of the expressivity of ReLU neural networks in the context of binary classification problems by shedding light on their ability to capture the underlying topological structure of the data. In particular the results show that deep ReLU neural networks are exponentially more powerful than shallow ones in terms of topological simplification. This provides a mathematically rigorous explanation why deeper networks are better equipped to handle complex and topologically rich data sets.</description>

      <title>D-GRIL: End-to-End Topological Learning with 2-parameter Persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end topological learning using 1-parameter persistence is well-known. We show that the framework can be enhanced using 2-parameter persistence by adopting a recently introduced 2-parameter persistence based vectorization technique called GRIL. We establish a theoretical foundation of differentiating GRIL producing D-GRIL. We show that D-GRIL can be used to learn a bifiltration function on standard benchmark graph datasets. Further, we exhibit that this framework can be applied in the context of bio-activity prediction in drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Differentiability and Optimization of Multiparameter Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-valued functions on geometric data -- such as node attributes on a graph -- can be optimized using descriptors from persistent homology, allowing the user to incorporate topological terms in the loss function. When optimizing a single real-valued function (the one-parameter setting), there is a canonical choice of descriptor for persistent homology: the barcode. The operation mapping a real-valued function to its barcode is differentiable almost everywhere, and the convergence of gradient descent for losses using barcodes is relatively well understood. When optimizing a vector-valued function (the multiparameter setting), there is no unique choice of descriptor for multiparameter persistent homology, and many distinct descriptors have been proposed. This calls for the development of a general framework for differentiability and optimization that applies to a wide range of multiparameter homological descriptors. In this article, we develop such a framework and show that it encompasses well-known descriptors of different flavors, such as signed barcodes and the multiparameter persistence landscape. We complement the theory with numerical experiments supporting the idea that optimizing multiparameter homological descriptors can lead to improved performances compared to optimizing one-parameter descriptors, even when using the simplest and most efficiently computable multiparameter descriptors.</description>

      <title>Cancellation for $(G,n)$-complexes and the Swan finiteness obstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.01664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous work, we related homotopy types of finite $(G,n)$-complexes when $G$ has periodic cohomology to projective $\mathbb{Z} G$-modules representing the Swan finiteness obstruction. We use this to determine when $X \vee S^n \simeq Y \vee S^n$ implies $X \simeq Y$ for finite $(G,n)$-complexes $X$ and $Y$, and give lower bounds on the number of homotopically distinct pairs when this fails. The proof involves constructing projective $\mathbb{Z} G$-modules as lifts of locally free modules over orders in products of quaternion algebras, whose existence follows from the Eichler mass formula. In the case $n=2$, difficulties arise which lead to a new approach to finding a counterexample to Wall's D2 problem.</description>

      <title>Homotopy types of topological stacks of categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.02778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note extends Quillen's Theorem A to a large class of categories internal to topological spaces. This allows us to show that under a mild condition a fully faithful and essentially surjective functor between such topological categories induces a homotopy equivalence of classifying spaces. It follows from this that we can associate a 2-functorial homotopy type to a wide class of topological stacks of categories, taking values in the 2-category of spaces, continuous maps and homotopy classes of homotopies of maps. This generalises work of Noohi and Ebert on the homotopy types of topological stacks of groupoids under the restriction to the site with numerable open covers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14801v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a Quillen equivalence between the Kan-Quillen model structure and a model structure, derived from a cubical model of homotopy type theory, on the category of cartesian cubical sets with one connection. We thereby identify a second model structure which both constructively models homotopy type theory and presents infinity-groupoids, the first example being the equivariant cartesian model of Awodey-Cavallo-Coquand-Riehl-Sattler.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Patchkoria--Pstr\k{a}gowski's version of Franke's algebraicity theorem, we prove that the category of $K_p(n)$-local spectra is exotically equivalent to the category of derived $I_n$-complete periodic comodules over the Adams Hopf algebroid $(E_*, E_*E)$ for large primes. This gives a finite prime result analogous to the asymptotic algebraicity for $\mathrm{Sp}_{K_p(n)}$ of Barthel--Schlank--Stapleton.</description>

      <title>Mapping class group of manifolds which look like $3$-dimensional complete intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.08054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we compute the mapping class group of closed simply-connected 6-manifolds $M$ which look like complete intersections, i.~e.~ $H_2(M;\mathbb Z) \cong \mathbb Z $ and $x^3 \ne 0$ where $x \in H^2(M; \mathbb Z)$ is a generator. We determine some algebraic properties of the mapping class group; for example we compute its abelianization and its center. We show that modulo the center the mapping class group is residually finite and virtually torsion-free. We also study low dimensional homology groups. The results are very similar to the computation of the mapping class group of Riemann surfaces. We give generators of the mapping class group, and generators and relations for the subgroup acting trivially on $\pi_{3}(M)$.</description>

      <title>Volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces with cone points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces with geodesic, cusp and cone boundary components. We compute the volumes in some new cases, in particular when there exists a large cone angle. This allows us to give geometric meaning to Mirzakhani's polynomials under substitution of imaginary valued boundary lengths, corresponding to hyperbolic cone angles, and to study the behaviour of the volume under the $2\pi$ limit of a cone angle.</description>

      <title>Quiver algebras and their representations for arbitrary quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quiver Yangians were originally defined for the quiver and superpotential from string theory on general toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, and serve as BPS algebras of these systems. Their characters reproduce the unrefined BPS indices, which correspond to classical Donaldson-Thomas (DT) invariants. We generalize this construction in two directions. First, we show that this definition extends to arbitrary quivers with potentials. Second, we explain how to define the characters to incorporate the refined BPS indices, which correspond to motivic DT invariants. We focus on two main classes of quivers: the BPS quivers of 4D $N=2$ theories and the quivers from the knot-quiver correspondence. The entire construction allows for straightforward generalizations to trigonometric, elliptic, and generalized cohomologies.</description>
