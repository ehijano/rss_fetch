      <title>Chaos and the Emergence of the Cosmological Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct algebras of diff-invariant observables in a global de Sitter universe with two observers and a free scalar QFT in two dimensions. We work in the strict $G_N \rightarrow 0$ limit, but allow the observers to have an order one mass in cosmic units. The observers are fully quantized. In the limit when the observers have infinite mass and are localized along geodesics at the North and South poles, it was shown in previous work \cite{CLPW} that their algebras are mutually commuting type II$_1$ factors. Away from this limit, we show that the algebras fail to commute and that they are type I non-factors. Physically, this is because the observers' trajectories are uncertain and state-dependent, and they may come into causal contact. We compute out-of-time-ordered correlators along an observer's worldline, and observe a Lyapunov exponent given by $\frac{4 \pi}{\beta_{\text{dS}}}$, as a result of observer recoil and de Sitter expansion. This should be contrasted with results from AdS gravity, and exceeds the chaos bound associated with the de Sitter temperature by a factor of two. We also discuss how the cosmological horizon emerges in the large mass limit and comment on implications for de Sitter holography.</description>

      <title>Chaos in unorientable JT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the late time limit of the spectral form factor (SFF) in unorientable JT gravity agrees with universal random matrix theory up to genus one in the topological expansion, establishing a key signature of quantum chaos for the time-reversal symmetric case. The loop equations for an orthogonal matrix model with spectral curve $y(z) \propto \sin(2\pi z)$ are used to compute the moduli space volume of unorientable surfaces. The divergences of the unorientable volumes are regularized by first regularizing the resolvents of the orthogonal matrix model. Using properties of the volumes, we streamline the loop equations to allow computation of the volumes that were previously inaccessible. The method can efficiently extract the part of the volume that contributes in the late time limit of the SFF. In this limit, the SFF becomes finite and independent of regularization.</description>

      <title>Emergent field theories from neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a duality relation between Hamiltonian systems and neural network-based learning systems. We show that the Hamilton-Jacobi equations for position and momentum variables correspond to the equations governing the activation dynamics of non-trainable variables and the learning dynamics of trainable variables. The duality is then applied to model various field theories using the activation and learning dynamics of neural networks. For Klein-Gordon fields, the corresponding weight tensor is symmetric, while for Dirac fields, the weight tensor must contain an anti-symmetric tensor factor. The dynamical components of the weight and bias tensors correspond, respectively, to the temporal and spatial components of the gauge field.</description>

      <title>Spinning bodies in general relativity from bosonic worldline oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Worldline quantum field theory (WQFT) has proven itself a powerful tool for classical two-body scattering calculations in general relativity. In this paper we develop a new worldline action involving bosonic oscillators, which enables the use of the WQFT formalism to describe massive compact bodies to all orders in their spins. Inspired by bosonic string theory in the tensionless limit, we augment traditional trajectory variables with bosonic oscillators capturing the spin dependence. We show its equivalence to the covariant phase space description of a spinning body in curved space and clarify the role of the spin-supplementary condition in a Hamiltonian treatment. Higher-spin Hamiltonians are classified to linear and quadratic order in curvature. Finally, perturbative computations at 1PM order for arbitrary powers and orientations of spin and at 2PM up to quartic spin order are performed, recovering results from the literature.</description>

      <title>Embedded structure in quantum theory, functional operator and multiverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a wider theoretical framework that has quantum field theory built-in, taking the fact that quantum mechanics is reconstructed from quantum field theory as a hint. We formulate a quantum theory with an embedded structure by introducing functional operators, and we find that it could describe the level II multiverse. Topics related to a beginning of the universe such as inflation, the third quantization and the landscape are discussed in our formulation.</description>

      <title>Inflationary constraints on the moduli-dependent species scale in modular invariant theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a broad class of modular inflation models predicts the emergence of new physics within an energy range of approximately $10^{15}\, \mathrm{GeV}$ to $10^{17} \, \mathrm{GeV}$. This prediction arises by comparing the moduli-dependent species scale with observational constraints on inflation. Specifically, we illustrate this within the context of $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$-modular inflation models by re-expressing inflationary observables in terms of the species scale. We further discuss the implications of this approach for generic Calabi-Yau threefolds, showing that this reformulation allows us to directly constrain the fundamental parameters related to the geometry of extra dimensions, specifically the second Chern numbers.</description>

      <title>Flat limit of AdS/CFT from AdS geodesics: scattering amplitudes and antipodal matching of Li\'enard-Wiechert fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08540v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the flat limit of AdS/CFT from the point of view of geodesics in AdS. We show that the flat space scattering amplitudes can be constructed from operator insertions where the geodesics of the particles corresponding to the operators hit the conformal boundary of AdS. Further, we compute the Li\'enard-Wiechert solutions in AdS by boosting a static charge using AdS isometries and show that the solutions are antipodally matched between two regions, separated by a global time difference of $\Delta\tau=\pi$. Going to the boundary of AdS along null geodesics, in the flat limit, this antipodal matching leads to the flat space antipodal matching near spatial infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the 2nd integrated correlators of ${\cal N}=4$, $D=4$ super Yang-Mills theory, especially those which can be associated with ${\cal N}=1^*$ mass-deformed theories. We provide an analytic derivation of the integrals at supergravity tree level, which has not been available so far. Our result agrees with the previous results from the study of BPS solutions in the dual supergravity models.</description>

      <title>The special case of slow-roll attractors in de Sitter: Non-Markovian noise and evolution of entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the evolution of the reduced density matrix of inflationary perturbations, coupled to a heavy entropic field via the leading-order term within the Effective Field Theory of Inflation, for two nearly de Sitter backgrounds. We perform a full quantum treatment of the open system and derive a Fokker-Planck equation to describe decoherence and the entanglement structure of the adiabatic perturbations. We find that exotic phenomena, such as recoherence and transient negative growth of entanglement entropy, appearing for the attractor solution, are absent for the non-attractor background. We comment on the relationship of these to the non-Markovian nature of the system. Finally, we generalise to the case where a few e-folds of ultra-slow roll evolution are sandwiched between phases of slow-roll inflation to find its (memory) effects on the curvature perturbation.</description>

      <title>String theory in twistor space and minimal tension holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence where both bulk and boundary theories are tractable are hard to come by, but the minimal tension string on $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$ is one notable example. In this paper, we discuss how one can construct sigma models on twistor space, with a particular focus on applying these techniques to the aforementioned string theory. We derive novel incidence relations, which allow us to understand to what extent the minimal tension string encodes information about the bulk. We identify vertex operators in terms of bulk twistor variables and a map from twistor space to spacetime is presented. We also demonstrate the presence of a partially broken global supersymmetry algebra in the minimal tension string and we argue that this implies that there exists an $\mathcal{N} = 2$ formulation of the theory. The implications of this are studied and we demonstrate the presence of an additional constraint on physical states.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that topological operators for continuous symmetries written in terms of currents need regularization, which effectively gives them a small but finite width. The regulated operator is a finite tension object which fluctuates. In the zero-width limit these fluctuations freeze, recovering the properties of a topological operator. When gravity is turned on, the zero-width limit becomes ill-defined, thereby prohibiting the existence of topological operators.</description>

      <title>Local Operator Algebras of Charged States in Gauge Theory and Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powerful techniques have been developed in quantum field theory that employ algebras of local operators, yet local operators cannot create physical charged states in gauge theory or physical nonzero-energy states in perturbative quantum gravity. A common method to obtain physical operators out of local ones is to dress the latter using appropriate Wilson lines. This procedure destroys locality, it must be done case by case for each charged operator in the algebra, and it rapidly becomes cumbersome, particularly in perturbative quantum gravity.
  In this paper we present an alternative approach to the definition of physical charged operators: we define an automorphism that maps an algebra of local charged operators into a (non-local) algebra of physical charged operators. The automorphism is described by a formally unitary intertwiner mapping the exact BRS operator associated to the gauge symmetry into its quadratic part.
  The existence of an automorphism between local operators and the physical ones, describing charged states, allows to retain many of the results derived in local operator algebras and extend them to the physical-but-nonlocal algebra of charged operators as we discuss in some simple applications of our construction. We also discuss a formal construction of physical states and possible obstructions to it.</description>

      <title>Charged Binaries in Gravitational Tides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation low-frequency interferometers are expected to detect binary systems near supermassive black holes, where tidal effects can alter significantly the motion of the binary. This motivates a broader investigation of how external gravitational fields influence the dynamics of physical systems. In this work, we consider a charged black hole binary system subject to a gravitational tide. We first construct a stationary gravitational tide acting on a dyonic Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and, focusing on the extreme mass-ratio limit, we analyze the motion of a test particle. By calculating the secular Hamiltonian of the test particle, we obtain the ISCO and light ring tidal shifts in terms of explicit functions of the parameters of the binary. Our results show that tidal corrections are suppressed as the charge of the black hole increases, but they persist in the extremal limit yielding a finite contribution. This work paves the way towards studying tidal effects on other charged systems, such as topological stars.</description>

      <title>The $J_1$-$J_2$ spin chain and the $O(3)$ non-linear sigma model at $\theta = \pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are two competing pictures for how the $O(3)$ non-linear sigma model (NLSM) with a topological theta term renormalises to the $\mathfrak{\hat{su}}(2)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model. In the Affleck-Haldane picture, an `extension field' parametrises the correlated fluctuations of the couplings and extends the target space from $S^2$ to $S^3$; recently, however, Zirnbauer has advanced a competing picture where the extension field is frozen out and the infrared theory is more naturally thought of as a compact free boson dual to $\mathfrak{\hat{su}}(2)_1$. We show that the $J_1$-$J_2$ spin chain evinces a phase transition between these pictures -- corresponding to whether the dimer field that parametrises local singlet order is part of a joint $O(4)$ N\'eel-singlet order parameter or appears as a separate gapped mode. For the $O(3)$ NLSM itself, this analysis supports the Zirnbauer picture.</description>

      <title>From $G_2$ to $SO(8)$: Emergence and reminiscence of supersymmetry and triality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a (1+1)-dimension continuum model of 4-component fermions incorporating the exceptional Lie group symmetry $G_2$. Four gapped and five gapless phases are identified via the one-loop renormalization group analysis. The gapped phases are controlled by four different stable $SO(8)$ Gross-Neveu fixed points, among which three exhibit an emergent triality, while the rest one possesses the self-triality, i.e., invariant under the triality mapping. The gapless phases include three $SO(7)$ critical ones, a $G_2$ critical one, and a Luttinger liquid. Three $SO(7)$ critical phases correspond to different $SO(7)$ Gross-Neveu fixed points connected by the triality relation similar to the gapped SO(8) case. The $G_2$ critical phase is controlled by an unstable fixed point described by a direct product of the Ising and tricritical Ising conformal field theories with the central charges $c=\frac{1}{2}$ and $c=\frac{7}{10}$, respectively, while the latter one is known to possess spacetime supersymmetry. In the lattice realization with a Hubbard-type interaction, the triality is broken into the duality between two $SO(7)$ symmetries and the supersymmetric $G_2$ critical phase exhibits the degeneracy between bosonic and fermionic states, which are reminiscences of the continuum model.</description>

      <title>(2+1) Lorentzian quantum cosmology from spin-foams: chances and obstacles for semi-classicality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08109v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an effective cosmological spin-foam model for a (2+1) dimensional spatially flat universe, discretized on a hypercubical lattice, containing both space- and time-like regions. Our starting point is the recently proposed coherent state spin-foam model for (2+1) Lorentzian quantum gravity. The full amplitude is assumed to factorize into single vertex amplitudes with boundary data corresponding to Lorentzian 3-frusta. A stationary phase approximation is performed at each vertex individually, where the inverse square root of the Hessian determinant serves as a measure for the effective path integral. Additionally, a massive scalar field is coupled to the geometry, and we show that its mass renders the partition function convergent. For a single 3-frustum with time-like struts, we compute the expectation value of the bulk strut length and show that it generically agrees with the classical solutions and that it is a discontinuous function of the scalar field mass. Allowing the struts to be space-like introduces causality violations, which drive the expectation values away from the classical solutions due to the lack of an exponential suppression of these configurations. This is a direct consequence of the semi-classical amplitude only containing the real part of deficit angles, in contrast with the Lorentzian Regge action used in effective spin-foams. We give an outlook on how to evaluate the partition function on an extended discretization including a bulk spatial slice. This serves as a foundation for future investigations of physically interesting scenarios such as a quantum bounce or the viability of massive scalar field clocks. Our results demonstrate that the effective path integral in the causally regular sector serves as a viable quantum cosmology model, but that the agreement of expectation values with classical solutions is tightly bound to the path integral measure.</description>

      <title>Black-hole evaporation for cosmological observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, evaporation of a black hole immersed in a de Sitter environment is considered. Vaidya-de Sitter spacetime is used to model the process in a scenario of accelerated expansion of the Universe. The role of observers is highlighted in the development and Hayward thermodynamics for non stationary geometries is employed in the description of the compact objects. The results of the proposed dynamical model are compared with the usual description based on stationary geometries, focusing on primordial black holes (PBHs). It is found how the timescale of evaporation depends on the choice of a cosmological observer. It may differ substantially from the treatment based on stationary models for black holes. In particular, the standard assertion that there is a fixed initial mass just below $10^{15} \, \text{g} \sim 10^{-18} M_\odot$ for the PBHs which are ending their evaporation process today is imprecise, even when possible quantum corrections at the late stages are not considered. Deviations from this prediction appear when the evaporation is measured with respect to the cosmological time.</description>

      <title>Impact of background field localization on vacuum polarization effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim at insights about how localization of the background field impacts nonlinear quantum vacuum signatures probed by photons in purely magnetic, electric and crossed fields. The starting point of our study are the one-loop results for the Heisenberg-Euler effective Lagrangian and the photon polarization tensor in quantum electrodynamics (QED) evaluated in a uniform constant electromagnetic field. As is well known and often employed, especially in the weak-field limit, within certain restrictions these results also allow for the reliable analysis of vacuum polarization effects in slowly varying background fields. Here, our main interest is in manifestly non-perturbative effects. To this end, we make use of the fact that for the particular case of background field inhomogeneities of Lorentzian shape with $0\leq d\leq3$ inhomogeneous directions analytical insights are possible. We study the scaling of conventional nonlinear QED signatures, such as probe-photon polarization flip and probe-photon induced electron-positron pair production, with relevant parameters. Special attention is put on the $d$ dependence of the considered effects.</description>

      <title>Two types of quantum chaos: testing the limits of the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are two types of quantum chaos: eigenbasis chaos and spectral chaos. The first type controls the early-time physics, e.g. the thermal relaxation and the sensitivity of the system to initial conditions. It can be traced back to the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), a statistical hypothesis about the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian. The second type concerns very late-time physics, e.g. the ramp of the Spectral Form Factor. It can be traced back to Random Matrix Universality (RMU), a statistical hypothesis about the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. The Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit (BGS) conjecture asserts a direct relationship between the two types of chaos for quantum systems with a chaotic semiclassical limit. The BGS conjecture is challenged by the Poissonian Hamiltonian ensembles, which can be used to model any quantum system displaying RMU. In this paper, we start by analyzing further aspects of such ensembles. On general and numerical grounds, we argue that these ensembles can have chaotic semiclassical limits. We then study the Poissonian ensemble associated with the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. While the distribution of couplings peaks around the original SYK model, the Poissonian ensemble is not $k$-local. This suggests that the link between ETH and RMU requires of physical $k$-locality as an assumption. We test this hypothesis by modifying the couplings of the SYK Hamiltonian via the Metropolis algorithm, rewarding directions in the space of couplings that do not display RMU. The numerics converge to a $k$-local Hamiltonian with eigenbasis chaos but without spectral chaos. We finally comment on ways out and corollaries of our results.</description>

      <title>A Simple Model of Superconductors: Insights from Free Fermion and Boson Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductors at temperatures below the critical temperature $T_c$ can be modeled as a mixture of Fermi and Bose gases, where the Fermi gas consists of conduction electrons and the Bose gas comprises Cooper pairs. This simple model enables the computation of the temperature dependence of $2 r(T) / N$, where $N$ is the total number of conduction electrons and $r(T)$ is the number of Cooper pairs at temperature $T$. Analyzing $2 r(T) / N$ across various superconductors may provide significant insights into the mechanisms behind high-temperature superconductivity, especially regarding coherence in Cooper pairs.</description>

      <title>Translating current ALP photon coupling strength bounds to the Randall-Sundrum model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we look at the current bounds on the coupling strength of axion-like particles (ALPs) with two photons in the context of the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. We relate the coupling strength to the compactification radius that governs the size of the extra dimension in the RS warped geometry model and show how the current bounds on the ALP can be used to derive appropriate constraints on the size of the extra fifth dimension in the RS model. We show that the resulting constraints fail to resolve the gauge hierarchy problem for light/ultralight ALPs and require a massive ALP of at least $m_{a} \gtrsim 0.1$ [GeV] to be relevant in the context of the hierarchy problem when the gauge field is in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Chaotic-Integrable Transition for Disordered Orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have drawn connections between the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and the multi-orbit Hatsugei-Kohmoto model, emphasizing their similarities and differences regarding chaotic behaviors. The features of the spectral form factor, such as the dip-ramp-plateau structure and the adjacent gap ratio, indicate chaos in the disordered orbital Hatsugei-Kohmoto model. One significant conclusion is that the plateau value of the out-of-time-order correlator, whether in the Hatsugei-Kohmoto model, Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with two- or four-body interactions, or a disorder-free Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, does not effectively differentiate between integrable and chaotic phases in many-body systems. This observation suggests a limitation in using out-of-time-order correlator plateau values as a diagnostic tool for chaos. Our exploration of these ideas provides a deeper understanding of how chaos arises in non-Fermi liquid systems and the tools we use to study it. It opens the door to further questions, particularly about whether there are more effective ways to distinguish between chaotic and integrable phases in these complex systems.</description>

      <title>Shadow analysis of an approximate rotating black hole solution with weakly coupled global monopole charge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the shadow properties of a rotating black hole with a weakly coupled global monopole charge, using a modified Newman-Janis algorithm. This study explores how this charge and rotational effects shape the black hole's shadow, causal structure, and ergoregions, with implications for distinguishing it from Kerr-like solutions. Analysis of null geodesics reveals observable features that may constrain the global monopole charge and weak coupling parameters within nonminimal gravity frameworks. Observational data from M87* and Sgr A* constrain the global monopole charge and coupling constant to $0 \leq \gamma \lesssim 0.036$ and $-0.2 \lesssim \alpha \leq 0$, respectively.</description>

      <title>The impact of large-scale galaxy clustering on the variance of the Hellings-Downs correlation: numerical results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing array experiments have recently found evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background, which induces correlations among pulsar timing residuals described by the Hellings and Downs (HD) curve. Standard calculations of the HD correlation and its variance assume an isotropic background. However, for a background of astrophysical origin, we expect a higher GW spectral density in directions with higher galaxy number densities. In a companion paper, we have developed a theoretical formalism to account for the anisotropies arising from large-scale galaxy clustering, leading to a new contribution to the variance of the HD correlation. In this subsequent work, we provide numerical results for this novel effect. We consider a GW background resulting from mergers of supermassive black hole binaries, and relate the merger number density to the overdensity of galaxies. We find that anisotropies due to large-scale galaxy clustering lead to a standard deviation of the HD correlation at most at percent level, remaining well below the standard contributions to the HD variance. Hence, this kind of anisotropies in the GW source distribution does not represent a substantial contamination to the correlations of timing residuals in present and future PTA surveys. Suitable statistical methods to extract the galaxy clustering signal from PTA data will be investigated in the future.</description>

      <title>Effects of Nontrivial Topology on Neutron Star Rotation and its Potential Observational Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotational irregularities are one of the prominent observational features that most pulsars exhibit. These glitches, which are sudden increases in spin angular velocity, remains an open problem. In this study, we have investigated the potential role of nontrivial topological defects, specifically in the form of Nambu-goto-type CSs, and its connection to spin irregularities. Such CSs which are one-dimensional topological defects may be formed during various symmetry-breaking and phase transition scenarios and can interact with the neutron stars. In this work, we see that the appearance of such topological defects trapped within the core can lead to the coupling of the string tension with the angular velocity, leading to the abrupt rotational changes observed as pulsar glitches. We have further studied how these coupling may generate detectable gravitational waves as a mixture of continuous and burst signals. The evolution of cusps of CSs trapped within neutron stars and the neutron star's mass quadruple moment change due to rotation could produce distinctive gravitational wave signatures, well within the noise cutoff of advLIGO. Our study highlights a potential connection between topological defects, pulsar glitches, and gravitational wave emissions, offering a possible avenue for observationally testing the presence of CSs and their astrophysical effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a theorem of Jackiw and Pi expressing the delicate balance of the spin and the orbital momentum, we systematically classify the flat-space massless Lagrangian quantum field theories that are invariant under the global conformal group SO(D,2). We recover in a uniform way the facts that scalars and spinors are invariant in any dimension, and that gauge p-tensors are invariant only in 2 p + 2 dimensions. This case includes the Maxwell theory in 4 dimensions and the Kalb-Ramond 2-forms theory in 6 dimensions. We then construct two new classes of Lagrangians extending the Avdeev-Chizhov self-dual tensor model to higher dimensions, one class using a symmetric metric and the other a skew metric in internal space. Finally, we prove in the same uniform way that both classes are conformal invariant in any even dimension. In 4 dimensions, these self-dual tensors naturally couple to the chiral Fermions of the standard model.</description>

Abstract: We explore nonequilibrium features of certain operator algebras which appear in quantum gravity. The algebra of observables in a black hole background is a Type $\mathrm{II}_\infty$ von Neumann algebra. We discuss how this algebra can be coupled to the algebra of observable of an infinite reservoir within the canonical ensemble, aiming to induce nonequilibrium dynamics. The resulting dynamics can lead the system towards a nonequilibrium steady state which can be characterized through modular theory. Within this framework we address the definition of entropy production and its relationship to relative entropy, alongside exploring other applications.</description>

      <title>The Open Effective Field Theory of Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our quest to understand the generation of cosmological perturbations, we face two serious obstacles: we do not have direct information about the environment experienced by primordial perturbations during inflation, and our observables are practically limited to correlators of massless fields, heavier fields and derivatives decaying exponentially in the number of e-foldings. The flexible and general framework of open systems has been developed precisely to face similar challenges. Building on previous work, we develop a Schwinger-Keldysh path integral description for an open effective field theory of inflation, describing the possibly dissipative and non-unitary evolution of the Goldstone boson of time translations interacting with an unspecified environment, under the key assumption of locality in space and time. Working in the decoupling limit, we study the linear and interacting theory in de Sitter and derive predictions for the power spectrum and bispectrum that depend on a finite number of effective couplings organised in a derivative expansion. The smoking gun of interactions with the environment is an enhanced but finite bispectrum close to the folded kinematical limit. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by matching our open effective theory to an explicit model. Our construction provides a standard model to simultaneously study phenomenological predictions as well as quantum information aspects of the inflationary dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We introduce new diagnostics of the transition between the ergodic and many-body localization phases, which are based on complexity measures defined via the probability distribution function of the Lanczos coefficients of the tri-diagonalized Hamiltonian. We use these complexity measures to analyze the power-law random banded matrix model as a function of the correlation strength and show that the moments and the entropy of the distribution diagnose the ergodic to many-body transition, as well as the distinctive feature of the phases concerning the memory of the initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Chiral Separation Effect from Holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the chiral separation effect (CSE) in QCD by using the gauge/gravity duality. In QCD, this effect arises from a combination of chiral anomalies and the axial $U(1)$ anomaly. Due to the axial gluon anomaly, the value of the CSE conductivity is not determined by the anomalies of QCD but receives radiative corrections, which leads to nontrivial dependence on temperature and density. To analyze this dependence, we use different variants of V-QCD, a complex holographic model, carefully fitted to QCD data. We find our results for the anomalous CSE conductivity at small chemical potential and nonzero temperature to be in good qualitative agreement with recent results from lattice QCD simulations. We furthermore give predictions for the behavior of the conductivity at finite (vectorial and axial) chemical potentials.</description>

Abstract: Hawking's black hole area theorem provides a geometric realization of the second law of thermodynamics and constrains gravitational processes. In this work we explore a one-parameter extension of this constraint formulated in terms of the monotonicity properties of R\'enyi entropies. We focus on black hole mergers in asymptotically AdS space and determine new restrictions which these R\'enyi second laws impose on the final state. We evaluate the entropic inequalities starting from the thermodynamic ensembles description of black hole geometries, and find that for many situations they set more stringent bounds than those imposed by the area increase theorem.</description>

Abstract: In this note we study nonequilibrium fluctuations in gravitational algebras within de Sitter space. An essential aspect of this study is quantum measurement theory, which allows us to access the dynamical fluctuations of observables via a two-point measurement scheme. Using this formalism, we establish specific fluctuation theorems. Additionally, we demonstrate that quantum channels are represented by subfactors, using the relationship between measurement theory and quantum channels. We also comment on implementing a quantum channel using Jones' theory of subfactors.</description>

      <title>A framework for generalizing toric inequalities for holographic entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conjecture a multi-parameter generalization of the toric inequalities of \cite{Czech:2023xed}. We then extend their proof methods for the generalized toric inequalities in two ways. The first extension constructs the graph corresponding to the toric inequalities and the generalized toric conjectures by tiling the Euclidean space. An entanglement wedge nesting relation then determines the geometric structure of the tiles. In the second extension, we exploit the cyclic nature of the inequalities and conjectures to construct cycle graphs. Then, the graph can be obtained using graph Cartesian products of cycle graphs. In addition, we define a set of knots on the graph by following \cite{Czech:2023xed}. These graphs with knots then imply the validity of their associated inequality. We study the case where the graph can be decomposed into disjoint unions of torii. Under the specific case, we explore and prove the conjectures for some ranges of parameters. We also discuss ways to explore the conjectured inequalities whose corresponding geometries are $d$-dimensional torii $(d&gt;2)$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study infinite dimensional Lie algebras, whose infinite dimensional mutually commuting subalgebras correspond with the symmetry algebra of $2d$ integrable models. These Lie algebras are defined by the set of infinitesimal, nonlinear, and higher derivative symmetry transformations present in theories with a left(right)-moving or (anti)-holomorphic current. We study a large class of such Lagrangian theories. We study the commuting subalgebras of the $2d$ free massless scalar, and find the symmetries of the known integrable models such as sine-Gordon, Liouville, Bullough-Dodd, and Korteweg-de Vries. Along the way, we find several new sequences of commuting charges, which we conjecture are charges of integrable models which are new deformations of a single scalar. After quantizing, the Lie algebra is deformed, and so are their commuting subalgebras.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we relate the growth rate of Krylov complexity in the boundary to the radial momentum of an infalling particle in AdS geometry. We show that in general AdS black hole background, our proposal captures the universal behaviors of Krylov complexity at both initial and late times. Hence it can be generally considered as an approximate dual of the Krylov complexity at least in diverse dimensions. Remarkably, for BTZ black holes, our holographic Krylov complexity perfectly matches with that of CFT$_2$ at finite temperatures.</description>

In the construction, and we define the set of wall for each quiver varieties by the action of the universal $R$-matrix, which is shown to be almost equivalent to that of the $K$-theoretic stable envelope on each interval in $H^2(X,\mathbb{Q})$. We also give the examples of the instanton moduli space $M(n,r)$ and the equivariant Hilbert scheme $\text{Hilb}_{n}([\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_{r}])$ to show the explicit form of the quantum difference operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reanalyse the Pantheon+ supernova catalogue to compare a cosmology with non-FLRW evolution, the timescape cosmology, with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. To this end, we analyse the Pantheon+ for a geometric comparison between the two models. We construct a covariance matrix to be as independent of cosmology as possible, including independence from the FLRW geometry and peculiar velocity with respect to FLRW average evolution. This framework goes far beyond most other definitions of model independence. We introduce new statistics to refine Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) light-curve analysis. In addition to conventional galaxy correlation functions used to define the scale of statistical homogeneity we introduce empirical statistics which enables refined analysis of the distribution biases of SNe Ia light-curve parameters $\beta c$ and $\alpha x_1$. For lower redshifts, the Bayesian analysis highlights important features attributable to the increased number of low-redshift supernovae, the artefacts of model-dependent light-curve fitting and the cosmic structure through which we observe supernovae. This indicates the need for cosmology-independent data reduction to conduct a stronger investigation of the emergence of statistical homogeneity and to compare alternative cosmologies in light of recent challenges to the standard model. Dark energy is generally invoked as a place-holder for new physics. For the first time, we find evidence that the timescape cosmology may provide a better overall fit than $\Lambda$CDM and that its phenomenology may help disentangle other astrophysical puzzles. Our from-first-principles reanalysis of Pantheon+ supports future deeper studies between the interplay of matter and nonlinear spacetime geometry in a data-driven setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissipation is a ubiquitous phenomenon that affects the fate of chaotic quantum many-body dynamics. Here, we show that chaos can be robust against dissipation but can also assist and anomalously enhance relaxation. We compute exactly the dissipative form factor of a generic Floquet quantum circuit with arbitrary on-site dissipation modeled by quantum channels and find that, for long enough times, the system always relaxes with two distinctive regimes characterized by the presence or absence of gap-closing. While the system can sustain a robust ramp for a long (but finite) time interval in the gap-closing regime, relaxation is ``assisted'' by quantum chaos in the regime where the gap remains nonzero. In the latter regime, we prove that, if the thermodynamic limit is taken first, the gap does not close even in the dissipationless limit. We complement our analytical findings with numerical results for quantum qubit circuits.</description>

Abstract: Incorporating first-order QED effects, we explore the shadows of Kerr-Newman black holes with a magnetic charge through the numerical backward ray-tracing method. Our investigation accounts for both the direct influence of the electromagnetic field on light rays and the distortion of the background spacetime metric due to QED corrections. We notice that the area of the shadow increases with the QED effect, mainly due to the fact that the photons move more slowly in the effective medium and become easier to be trapped by the black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct tree-level amplitude for massive particles using on-shell recursion relations based on two classes of momentum shifts: an all-line transverse shift that deforms momentum by its transverse polarization vector, and a massive BCFW-type shift. We illustrate that these shifts allow us to correctly calculate four-point and five-point amplitudes in massive QED, without an ambiguity associated with the contact terms that may arise from a simple ''gluing'' of lower-point on-shell amplitudes. We discuss various aspects and applicability of the two shifts, including the large-z behavior and complexity scaling. We show that there exists a ''good'' all-line transverse shift for all possible little group configurations of the external particles, which can be extended to a broader class of theories with massive particles such as massive QCD and theories with massive spin-1 particles. The massive BCFW-type shift enjoys more simplicity, but a ''good'' shift does not exist for all the spin states due to the specific choice of spin axis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum gravity has been baffling the theoretical physicist for decades now: both for its mathematical obscurity and phenomenological testing. Nevertheless, the new era of precision cosmology presents a promising avenue to test the effects of quantum gravity. In this study, we consider a bottom-up approach. Without resorting to any candidate quantum gravity, we invoke a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) directly into the cosmological Hamiltonian for a universe sourced by a phantom scalar field with potential to study the early epoch of the evolution. This is followed by a systematic analysis of the dynamics, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our qualitative analysis shows that the introduction of GUP significantly alters the existence of fixed points for the potential considered in this contribution. In addition, we confirm the existence of an inflationary epoch and analyze the behavior of relevant cosmological parameters with respect to the strength of GUP distortion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The status of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) response in full Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) has been controversial so far, with previous lattice QCD studies indicating either its strong suppression or vanishing in thermal equilibrium state. We introduce the Euclidean-time correlator of axial charge and electric current as an observable that can be used to study the finite out-of-equilibrium CME response in first-principle lattice QCD simulations with background magnetic field. This observable directly reflects the fact that in the background magnetic field, a state with nonzero axial charge features nonzero electric current. For free fermions, the axial-vector correlator only receives contributions from the Lowest Landau Level, and exhibits a linear dependence on both magnetic field and temperature with a universal coefficient. With an appropriate regularization, non-vanishing axial-vector correlator is compatible with the vanishing of the CME current in thermal equilibrium state with nonzero chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$. We demonstrate that the real-time counterpart of the Euclidean-time axial-vector correlator is intimately related to the real-time form of the axial anomaly equation, which strongly limits possible corrections in full QCD. We present numerical results for the Euclidean-time axial-vector correlator in $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory with $N_f = 2$ light quark flavours, demonstrating reasonable agreement with free fermion result on both sides of the chiral crossover. The proposed methodology should help to answer the question whether the QCD corrections might be responsible for non-observation of CME in heavy-ion collision experiments such as the RHIC isobar run.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07003v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A derivative coupling of an axion like particle (ALP) with a B-L current may lead to the baryon asymmetry of the universe via spontaneous leptogenesis provided a lepton number breaking interaction prevails in thermal equilibrium. Conventionally, such scenario works only for heavy ALPs and high reheating temperature due to the fact that the same lepton number breaking contribution is tied up with neutrino mass generation also. In this work, we propose inert Higgs doublet assisted lepton number violating operator to relieve such tension so as to generate lepton asymmetry (of freeze-in/out type) with a much lower reheating temperature that can accommodate light (sub-GeV) ALPs sensitive to current and future ALP searches.</description>

      <title>Refined cyclic renormalization group in Russian Doll model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Focusing on Bethe-ansatz integrable models, robust to both time-reversal symmetry breaking and disorder, we consider the Russian Doll Model (RDM) for finite system sizes and energy levels. Suggested as a time-reversal-symmetry breaking deformation of Richardson's model, the well-known and simplest model of superconductivity, RDM revealed an unusual cyclic renormalization group (RG) over the system size $N$, where the energy levels repeat themselves, shifted by one after a finite period in $\ln N$, supplemented by a hierarchy of superconducting condensates, with the superconducting gaps following the so-called Efimov (exponential) scaling. The equidistant single-particle spectrum of RDM made the above Efimov scaling and cyclic RG to be asymptotically exact in the wideband limit of the diagonal potential. Here, we generalize this observation in various respects. We find that, beyond the wideband limit, when the entire spectrum is considered, the periodicity of the spectrum is not constant, but appears to be energy-dependent. Moreover, we resolve the apparent paradox of shift in the spectrum by a single level after the RG period, despite the disappearance of a finite fraction of energy levels. We also analyze the effects of disorder in the diagonal potential on the above periodicity and show that it survives only for high energies beyond the energy interval of the disorder amplitude. Our analytic analysis is supported with exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Black Holes with a charged quantum dust core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To understand the nature of the black holes that exist in the Universe, it is also necessary to study what happens to the (quantum) matter that collapses and forms such objects. In this work, we consider a dust ball with an electrically charged central core and study its quantum spectrum by quantising the geodesic equation for individual dust particles in the corresponding Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime. As in the neutral case investigated previously, we find a ground state of the dust ball with the size of a fraction of the outer horizon. Moreover, we determine a self-consistent configuration of layers in the ground state corresponding to an effective mass function that increases linearly with the areal radius and has no inner Cauchy horizon. We then briefly speculate on the possible phenomenological consequences for the endpoint of the gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherence measures for generalized Gaussian wave packets under a Lorentz boost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a single particle, spin-momentum entangled state and measure the effect of relativistic boost on quantum coherence. The effect of the relativistic boost on single-particle generalized Gaussian wave packets is studied. The coherence of the wave function as measured by the boosted observer is studied as a function of the momentum and the boost parameter. Using various formulations of coherence, it is shown that in general the coherence decays with the increase in momentum of the state, as well as the boost applied to it. A more prominent loss of coherence due to relativistic boost is observed for a single particle electron than that of a neutron. The analysis is carried out with generalized Gaussian wave packet of the form $\mathcal{N} p^n \exp(-\frac{p^2}{\sigma^2})$ with $n$ being the ``generalization parameter" and $\mathcal{N}$ denoting the appropriate normalization constant. We also obtain a range for parameter $n$ appearing in the wave packet. The upper bound is found to have a dependence on the mass of the particle and the width of the Gaussian wave packet. We have obtained the Frobenius-norm measure of coherence, $l_1$ and $l_2$ norm measure of coherence, and relative entropy of coherence for a (1+1) and (3+1)-dimensional analysis. Corresponding to each of the cases, we observe that the $l_1$ norm measure of coherence is equal to the Frobenius norm measure of coherence. We have analyzed the scenario for which such a beautiful coincidence can occur. Finally, we have plotted different measures of coherence for the electron as well as the neutron for different values of the width of the wave-function $\sigma$, boost parameter $\beta$, and generalization parameter $n$.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIIa. Microwave background parity violation without parity-violating microphysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model, which assumes statistical isotropy and parity invariance, predicts the absence of correlations between even-parity and odd-parity observables of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Contrary to these predictions, large-angle CMB temperature anomalies generically involve correlations between even-$\ell$ and odd-$\ell$ angular power spectrum $C_\ell$, while recent analyses of CMB polarization have revealed non-zero equal-$\ell$ $EB$ correlations. These findings challenge the conventional understanding, suggesting deviations from statistical isotropy, violations of parity, or both. Cosmic topology, which involves changing only the boundary conditions of space relative to standard cosmology, offers a compelling framework to potentially account for such parity-violating observations. Topology inherently breaks statistical isotropy, and can also break homogeneity and parity, providing a natural paradigm for explaining observations of parity-breaking observables without the need to add parity violation to the underlying microphysics. Our investigation delves into the harmonic space implications of topology for CMB correlations, using as an illustrative example $EB$ correlations generated by tensor perturbations under both parity-preserving and parity-violating scenarios. Consequently, these findings not only challenge the foundational assumptions of the standard cosmological model but also open new avenues for exploring the topological structure of the Universe through CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Momentum shift and on-shell recursion relation for electroweak theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the All-Line Transverse (ALT) shift which we developed for on-shell recursion of amplitudes for particles of any mass. We discuss the validity of the shift for general theories of spin $\leq$ 1, and illustrate the connection between Ward identity and constructibility for massive spin-1 amplitude under the ALT shift. We apply the shift to the electroweak theory, and various four-point scattering amplitudes among electroweak gauge bosons and fermions are constructed. We show explicitly that the four-point gauge boson contact terms in massive electroweak theory automatically arise after recursive construction, independent of UV completion, and they automatically cancel the terms growing as (energy)$^4$ at high energy. We explore UV completion of the electroweak theory that cancels the remaining (energy)$^2$ terms and impose unitarity requirements to constrain additional couplings. The ALT shift framework allows consistent treatment in dealing with contact term ambiguities for renormalizable massive and massless theories, which we show can be useful in studying real-world amplitudes with massive spinors.</description>

      <title>Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture Cannot be Violated in Gedanken Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We innovate a systematic investigation of the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) using gedanken experiments involving black hole perturbations by test particles. We classify various WCCC violation scenarios proposed in recent decades, including Hubeny, mixed, and the latest Sorce-Wald (SW). We provide general formulae in each case, and resolve contradictions in numerous studies. Following SW type, our analysis reveals that WCCC depends on the sign choice of the parameter $W\equiv \big(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\big)_{Q_i; T=0}$ of the extremal black holes. $W &gt; 0$ preserves WCCC and $W &lt; 0$ would indicate potential violation. We show explicitly that $W&gt;0$ for spherically-symmetric and static black holes, and for general case, we argue that it is protected by the black hole no-hair theorem. We also consider asymptotically-(A)dS black holes and argue that there can be no violation either.</description>

      <title>Signatures of topology in generic transport measurements for Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the signatures of the topological properties of the bandstructures for nodal-point semimetals are embedded in the response coefficients, arising in two distinct experimental set-ups, by taking the Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (RSW) semimetal as an example. The first scenario involves the computation of third-rank tensors representing second-order response coefficients, relating the charge/thermal current densities to the combined effects of the gradient of the chemical potential and an external electric field/temperature gradient. On the premises that internode scatterings can be ignored, the relaxation-time approximation leads to a quantized value for the nonvanishing components of each of these nonlinear response tensors, characterizing a single untilted RSW node. Furthermore, the final expressions turn out to be insensitive to the specific values of the chemical potential and the temperature. The second scenario involves computing the magnetoelectric conductivity under the action of collinear electric ($\mathbf E$) and magnetic ($\mathbf B$) fields, representing a planar Hall set-up. In particular, our focus is in bringing out the dependence of the linear-in-$|\mathbf B|$ parts of the conductivity tensor on the intrinsic topological properties of the bandstructure, which are nonvanishing only in the presence of a nonzero tilt in the energy spectrum.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Form Factors of Hadrons from CFT in Momentum Space and the Dilaton in Perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05609v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the hard scattering amplitude of the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of hadrons at one-loop, in relation to their conformal field theory (CFT) description, within the framework of QCD factorization for hard exclusive processes at large momentum transfers. These form factors play an essential role in studying the quark and gluon angular momentum of the hadrons due to their relation to the Mellin moments of the Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) invariant amplitudes. Our analysis is performed using a diffeomorphism invariant approach, applying the formalism of the gravitational effective action and conformal symmetry in momentum space for the discussion of the quark and gluon contributions. The interpolating correlator in the hard scattering of any GFF is the non-Abelian $TJJ$ (stress-energy/gluon/gluon) 3-point function at $O(\alpha_s^2)$, revealing an effective dilaton interaction in the $t$-channel due to the trace anomaly, in the form of a massless anomaly pole in the QCD hard scattering, constrained by a sum rule on its spectral density. We investigate the role of quarks, gauge-fixing and ghost contributions in the reconstruction of the hard scattering amplitude mediated by this interaction, performed in terms of its transverse traceless, longitudinal, and trace decomposition, as identified from CFT in momentum space ($CFT_p$). We present a convenient parameterization of the hard scattering amplitude relevant for future experimental investigations of the DVCS/GFF amplitudes at the Electron-Ion Collider at BNL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the first and second order cosmological perturbation equations in f(R) modified gravity theory and provide the equation of motion of second order scalar induced gravitational waves. We find that the effects of modified gravity not only change the form of the equation of motion of second order scalar induced gravitational waves but also contribute an additional anisotropic stress tensor, composed of first order scalar perturbations, to the source term of the gravitational waves. We calculate the energy density spectrum of second order scalar induced gravitational waves in the HS model. Utilizing current pulsar timing array observational data, we perform a rigorous Bayesian analysis of the parameter space of the HS model.</description>
