      <title>The Singularity Warfare: The metatheoretical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the "Singularity Warfare" concept, arguing that the accelerating pace of technological revolution, driven by artificial intelligence and quantum mechanics, is fundamentally reshaping the nature of conflict. Moving beyond traditional "Newtonian" warfare and current military doctrines, this framework posits that future battlefields will be defined by a merger of physical and abstract domains, where human imagination and algorithmic logic become a unified, actionable reality. Victory will hinge on a unit's ability to maintain cognitive and technological "coherence" while creating "decoherence" in the adversary. The paper synthesizes theories from physics, philosophy, and futurology to provide a metatheoretical framework for understanding this paradigm shift.</description>

      <title>Three More Generalized Friendship Paradoxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized friendship paradoxes occur when, on average, our friends have more of some attribute than us. These paradoxes are relevant to many aspects of human interaction, notably in social science and epidemiology. Here, we derive new theoretical results concerning the inevitability of a paradox arising, using a linear algebra perspective. Following the seminal 1991 work of Scott L.\ Feld, we consider two distinct ways to measure and compare averages, which may be regarded as local and global. For local averaging, we show that a generalized friendship paradox holds for nonbacktracking eigenvector centrality. In this sense, our friends are always more important as us, on average. For global averaging, we define loneliness as the reciprocal of the number of friends and show that for this attribute the generalized friendship paradox always holds in reverse. In this sense, we are always more lonely, on average, than our friends. We also derive a global averaging paradox result for the case where the arithmetic mean is replaced by the geometric mean.</description>

      <title>Understanding Mode Choice Behavior of People with Disabilities: A Case Study in Utah</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the growing recognition of the importance of inclusive transportation policies nationwide, there is still a gap, as the existing transportation models often fail to capture the unique travel behavior of people with disabilities. This research study focuses on understanding the mode choice behavior of individuals with travel-limited disabilities and comparing the group with no such disability. The study identified key factors influencing mode preferences for both groups by utilizing Utah's household travel survey, simulation algorithm and Multinomial Logit model. Explanatory variables include household and socio-demographic attributes, personal, trip characteristics, and built environment variables. The analysis revealed intriguing trends, including a shift towards carpooling among disabled individuals. People with disabilities placed less emphasis on travel time saving. A lower value of travel time for people with disabilities is potentially due to factors like part-time work, reduced transit fare, and no or shared cost for carpooling. Despite a 50% fare reduction for the disabled group, transit accessibility remains a significant barrier in their choice of Transit mode. In downtown areas, people with no disability were found to choose transit compared to driving, whereas disabled people preferred carpooling. Travelers with no driving licenses and disabled people who use transit daily showed complex travel patterns among multiple modes. The study emphasizes the need for accessible and inclusive transportation options, such as improved public transit services, shorter first and last miles in transit, and better connectivity for non-motorized modes, to cater to the unique needs of disabled travelers. The findings of this study have significant policy implications such as an inclusive mode choice modeling framework for creating a more sustainable and inclusive transportation system.</description>

      <title>Simulating Keystroke and Computing the Theoretical Probability of Infinite Monkey Theorem with Markov Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Infinite Monkey Theorem states that if one monkey randomly hits the keys in front of a typewriter keyboard during an infinite amount of time, any works written by William Shakespeare will almost surely be typed out at the end of the total text. Due to the seemingly low chance of typing the exact literature works, our group are motivated to find out the expected time the Hamlet, our target text, being typed out by simulated random typing on a standard keyboard. For finding the answer, 30 users randomly typed characters into a file. Then, the frequency of each characters occurred following the previous character is calculated. This conditional probability is used to build the Markov matrix by considering all 128 times 128 cases. Finally, the expected time we estimated is about 10 to the power of 34 (min), which is surprisingly lower than the theoretical computation, and not achievable at all even in the cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Climate determinism reborn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental determinism in the past followed from the belief that the gods bestowed political power and the best possible weather on the sponsors of early scholars. Although later discredited in academia because of the associations with racism and the lack of support for any monocausal explanation of history, environmental determinism in popular culture has morphed into the unfounded idea of catastrophic climate change. Although a handful of papers in the literature on the economic impact of climate change appear to support this concern, closer inspection reveals severe methodological and conceptual issues with the analyses. Climate policy will not dominate major economies, because politicians will pull back before it does, but small economies may be overwhelmed by the export of carbon credits.</description>

      <title>Manipulating Collective Opinion through Social Network Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms have transformed the dynamics of collective opinion formation, enabling rapid, large-scale interactions while simultaneously exposing online discourse to polarization and manipulation. Traditional models of opinion dynamics often predict convergence to a consensus, yet empirical evidence consistently highlights persistent polarization and radicalization, especially on contentious issues. This paper analytically investigates a mathematical model that captures the complex interplay of polarization, radicalization, and consensus within networked societies. By analyzing the emergence and stability of opinion clusters, we identify critical thresholds marking phase transitions in collective behavior, interpreted via a stability landscape. We further explore network-based interventions to manipulate the collective opinion, revealing that reducing inter-agent interactions can lead to unintended, irreversible shifts in opinion distributions. Our results underscore the dual-edged nature of intervention strategies, offering theoretical insight into the fragility and manipulability of public opinion in digital environments.</description>

      <title>Universalities in the Avalanche Dynamics of Novelties and Non-Novelties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unprecedented events intertwine with the repetition of the past in natural phenomena and human activities. Key statistical patterns, such as Heaps' and Taylor's laws and Zipf's law, have been identified as characterizing the dynamical processes that govern the emergence of novelties and the abundance of repeated elements. Observing these statistical regularities has been pivotal in motivating the search for modeling schemes that can explain them and clarify key mechanisms underlying the appearance of new elements and their subsequent recurrence. In this study, we analyze sequences of novel and non-novel elements, referred to as avalanches, in real-world systems. We show that avalanche statistics provide a complementary characterization of innovation dynamics, extending beyond the three fundamental laws mentioned above. Although arising from collective dynamics, some systems behave as a single instance of a stochastic process. Others, such as natural language, exhibit features that we can only explain by a superposition of different dynamics. This distinction is not apparent when considering Heaps' law alone, while it clearly emerges in the avalanche statistics. By interpreting these empirical observations, we also advance the theoretical understanding of urn-based models that successfully reproduce the observed behaviors associated with Heaps', Zipf's, and Taylor's laws. We derive analytical expressions that accurately describe the probability distributions of avalanches and the Heaps law beyond its asymptotic regime. Building on these results, we derive a scaling relation that we show also holds in real-world systems, indicating a form of universality in the dynamics of novelty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study resilience with real data, it is necessary to group the individual outages recorded by utilities into events in which the outages bunch up and overlap due to extreme weather. We show how to automatically group utility outage data into resilience events based on their time and location. The methods work with both detailed utility outage data and EAGLE-I data.</description>

      <title>Opinion formation at Ising social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the process of opinion formation in an Ising social network of scientific collaborations. The network is undirected. An Ising spin is associated with each network node being oriented up (red) or down (blue). Certain nodes carry fixed, opposite opinions whose influence propagates over the other spins, which are flipped according to the majority-influence opinion of neighbors of a given spin during the asynchronous Monte Carlo process. The amplitude influence of each spin is self-consistently adapted, and a flip occurs only if this majority influence exceeds a certain conviction threshold. All non-fixed spins are initially randomly distributed, with half of them oriented up and half down. Such a system can be viewed as a model of elite influence, coming from the fixed spins, on the opinions of the crowd of non-fixed spins. We show that a phase transition occurs as the amplitude influence of the crowd spins increases: the dominant opinion shifts from that of the elite nodes to a phase in which the crowd spins' opinion becomes dominant and the elite can no longer impose their views.</description>

      <title>Impacts of bridging nodes on the epidemic activation mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bridging nodes, which connect critical components of a network, play an important role in maintaining structural integrity and facilitating communication within the network, representing indirect yet relevant connections. Epidemic triggering mechanisms in networks often involve long-range mutual activation of hubs, mediated by paths composed of low-degree nodes. While low-degree nodes are abundant in networks, their role in bridging central nodes in epidemic activation mechanisms has not been thoroughly analyzed. Starting with a backbone network with a power-law degree distribution, we investigate the role of adding degree-2 bridging nodes that are preferentially attached to hubs. Our findings reveal that bridging nodes can mediate an indirect feedback interaction between hubs that modifies the epidemic localization and activation mechanisms of the epidemic processes with recurrent infections. In particular, the collective activation observed in the presence of waning immunity, which produces a finite epidemic threshold in power-law networks with degree exponent $\gamma&gt;3$, is altered to a localized activation with a vanishing threshold. Our results are supported by the non-backtracking matrix properties that emerge in the recurrent dynamical message-passing theory.</description>

      <title>Regime shifts and transformations in social-ecological systems: Advancing critical frontiers for safe and just futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current research challenges in sustainability science require us to consider nonlinear changes e.g. shifts that do not happen gradually but can be sudden and difficult to predict. Central questions are therefore how we can prevent harmful shifts, promote desirable ones, and better anticipate both. The regime shifts and transformations literature is well-equipped to address these questions. Yet, even though both research streams stem from the same intellectual roots, they have developed along different paths, with limited exchange between the two, missing opportunities for cross- fertilisation. We here review the definitions and history of both research streams to disentangle common grounds and differences. We propose avenues for future research and highlight how stronger integration of both research streams could support the development of more powerful approaches to help us navigate toward safe and just futures.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic dynamics of small groups in crowd flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pedestrians in crowds frequently move as part of small groups, constituting up to 70% of individuals. Dyads (groups of two) are the most frequent. Understanding quantitatively the dynamics of dyads walking in crowds is therefore an essential building block towards a fundamental comprehension of crowd behavior as a whole, and mandatory for accurate crowd dynamics models. Unavoidably, due to the non-deterministic behavior of pedestrians, characterizations of the dynamics must be probabilistic. In this work, we analyze the dynamics of over 6M dyads: a statistical ensemble of unprecedented resolution within a multi-year real-life pedestrian trajectory measurement campaign (21M trajectories, from Eindhoven Station, NL). We provide phenomenological models for dyad behavior in dependence of the surrounding crowds state. We present a thorough collection of fundamental diagrams that probabilistically relate both dyad velocity and formation to the state of the surrounding crowd (density, relative velocity). Depending on the surrounding crowd, dyads adjust interpersonal distance and may shift in formation, possibly turning from abreast states (which favors social interaction) to in-line (which favors navigationing dense crowds). To quantitatively investigate formation changes, we introduce a scalar indicator, which we dub Orientation Log-Odds (OLO), that quantifies the relative log-likelihood of abreast versus in-file formations. Conceptually, the OLO quantifies energy difference of the abreast vs. in-file configuration under a Boltzmann-like assumption. We model how OLO depends on the crowd state, showcasing that its derivative is a product of two velocity-density fundamental diagrams. Together, these results provide a statistically robust, data-driven description of dyad configuration dynamics in real-world crowds, establishing a foundation towards new predictive, group-aware crowd models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents an analytical account of the capacity limits and operational challenges of the main airports in the S\~ao Paulo Macrometropolis. Drawing on international examples, such as London Heathrow, it discusses how large hubs combine high traffic generation with severe physical constraints, highlighting how saturation intensifies delays, operating costs, and pressures for expansion. It analyzes capacity scarcity as a central economic problem, in which runways, aprons, boarding gates, and terminals become critical resources whose use requires administrative and market mechanisms, including slot coordination, prioritization rules, and regulatory incentives. It discusses the limitations imposed by high earthmoving costs, environmental impacts, and expropriation costs, which restrict the physical expansion of central airports such as Congonhas and increase dependence on efficiency gains. Demand projections indicate that the combined capacity of Congonhas, Guarulhos, and Viracopos is likely to be exceeded, even in conservative scenarios, reinforcing the urgency of integrated planning. The effects of regulatory restrictions on Congonhas, the challenges of expanding Guarulhos, and the structural difficulties of Viracopos are evaluated, highlighting the strategic relevance of this multi-airport system for sustaining national connectivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many large metropolitan areas, cars cruising for parking significantly contribute to congestion and pollution. At the same time, parking restrictions are contemplated to encourage the use of greener transport alternatives. We give a short overview of a versatile modelling framework for parking search, which can be solved by both numerical simulations and theoretical developments, and we illustrate its applicability in Lyon, France. Then, we show how this framework can be leveraged to assess the environmental impact of parking restrictions, weighing the antagonistic effects of the thus-induced excess cruising vs. mode shift.</description>

      <title>Collective decision-making with higher-order interactions on $d$-uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how group interactions influence opinion dynamics is fundamental to the study of collective behavior. In this work, we propose and study a model of opinion dynamics on $d$-uniform hypergraphs, where individuals interact through group-based (higher-order) structures rather than simple pairwise connections. Each one of the two opinions $A$ and $B$ is characterized by a quality, $Q_A$ and $Q_B$, and agents update their opinions according to a general mechanism that takes into account the weighted fraction of agents supporting either opinion and the pooling error, $\alpha$, a proxy for the information lost during the interaction. Through bifurcation analysis of the mean-field model, we identify two critical thresholds, $\alpha_{\text{crit}}^{(1)}$ and $\alpha_{\text{crit}}^{(2)}$, which delimit stability regimes for the consensus states. These analytical predictions are validated through extensive agent-based simulations on both random and scale-free hypergraphs. Moreover, the analytical framework demonstrates that the bifurcation structure and critical thresholds are independent of the underlying topology of the higher-order network, depending solely on the parameters $d$, i.e., the size of the interaction groups, and the quality ratio. Finally, we bring to the fore a nontrivial effect: the large sizes of the interaction groups, could drive the system toward the adoption of the worst option.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Neighborhood Design on the Sustainability of US Suburbs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of suburbs in the US has led to significant sustainability challenges; yet, it remains unclear whether these challenges stem from the remoteness of suburbs from city centers or the specific designs used to develop them. This paper examines how Garden City Design (GCD) -- one of the most influential suburban design paradigms since the early 20th century -- impacts the social and environmental outcomes of neighborhoods. I first introduce a composite measure of GCD, derived from street layouts and block configurations, to quantify its nationwide adoption. I use this measure combined with mobility and emissions data to estimate the impact of GCD on neighborhood outcomes using complementary identification strategies, including ordinary least squares (OLS), matching estimators, and an instrumental variables (IV) approach that exploits historical variation in GCD adoption. Results show that GCD leads to worse sustainability outcomes, including increased greenhouse gas emissions, greater social isolation, and higher sedentary behavior. The prevalence of GCD accounts for 27-38% of the adverse effects associated with suburbanization, underscoring the crucial role that neighborhood design plays in shaping urban sustainability.</description>

      <title>Zoo of Centralities: Encyclopedia of Node Metrics in Complex Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05122v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Centrality is a fundamental concept in network science, providing critical insights into the structure and dynamics of complex systems such as social, transportation, biological and financial networks. Despite its extensive use, there is no universally accepted definition of centrality, leading to the development of a vast array of distinct centrality measures. These measures have grown so numerous that they resemble a 'zoo', each representing a unique approach to capturing node importance within a network. However, the increasing number of metrics being developed has led to several challenges, including issues of discoverability, redundancy, naming conflicts, validation and accessibility. This work aims to address these challenges by providing a comprehensive catalog of over 400 centrality measures, along with clear descriptions and references to original sources. While not exhaustive, this compilation represents the most extensive and systematic effort to date in organizing and presenting centrality measures. We also encourage readers to explore and contribute to the Centrality Zoo website at https://centralityzoo.github.io/, which provides an interactive platform for discovering, comparing and implementing centrality measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decades, scientific software has graduated from a hidden side-product to a first-class member of the astrophysics literature. We aim to quantify the activity and impact of software development for astronomy, using a systematic survey. Starting from the Astrophysics Source Code Library and the Journal of Open Source Software, we analyse 3432 public git-based scientific software packages. Paper abstract text analysis suggests seven dominant themes: cosmology, data reduction pipelines, exoplanets, hydrodynamic simulations, radiative transfer spectra simulation, statistical inference and galaxies. We present key individual software contributors, their affiliated institutes and countries of high-impact software in astronomy &amp; astrophysics. We consider the number of citations to papers using the software and the number of person-days from their git repositories, as proxies for impact and complexity, respectively. We find that half of the mapped development is through US-affiliated institutes, and a large number of high-impact projects are led by a single person. Our results indicate that there are currently over 200 people active on any given day to improve software in astronomy.</description>

      <title>AstroMLab 5: Structured Summaries and Concept Extraction for 400,000 Astrophysics Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a dataset of 408,590 astrophysics papers from arXiv (astro-ph), spanning 1992 through July 2025. Each paper has been processed through a multi-stage pipeline to produce: (1) structured summaries organized into six semantic sections (Background, Motivation, Methodology, Results, Interpretation, Implication), and (2) concept extraction yielding 9,999 unique concepts with detailed descriptions. The dataset contains 3.8 million paper-concept associations and includes semantic embeddings for all concepts. Comparison with traditional ADS keywords reveals that the concepts provide denser coverage and more uniform distribution, while analysis of embedding space structure demonstrates that concepts are semantically dispersed within papers-enabling discovery through multiple diverse entry points. Concept vocabulary and embeddings are publicly released at https://github.com/tingyuansen/astro-ph_knowledge_graph.</description>

      <title>Unifying points of interest taxonomies: mapping OpenStreetMap tags to the Foursquare category system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The heterogeneity of Point of Interest (POI) taxonomies is a persistent challenge for the integration of urban datasets and the development of location-based services. OpenStreetMap (OSM) adopts a flexible, community-driven tagging system, while Foursquare (FS) relies on a curated hierarchical structure. Here we present an openly available benchmark and mapping framework that aligns OSM tags with the FS taxonomy. This resource integrates the richness of community-driven OSM data with the hierarchical structure of FS, enabling reproducible and interoperable urban analytics. The dataset is complemented by an evaluation of embedding and LLM-based alignment strategies and a pipeline that supports scalable updates as OSM evolves. Together, these elements provide both a robust reference resource and a practical tool for the community. Our approach is structured around three components: the construction of a manually curated benchmark as a gold standard, the evaluation of pretrained text embedding models for semantic alignment between OSM tags and FS categories, and an LLM-based refinement stage that enhances robustness and adaptability. The proposed methodology provides a scalable and reproducible solution for taxonomy unification, with direct applications to urban analytics, mobility studies, and smart city services.</description>

      <title>Spanning Trees and Redistricting: New Methods for Sampling and Validation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deciding whether a political districting plan was distorted by a hidden agenda, or whether it dilutes the voting power of some group, requires a neutral baseline for comparison. Remarkably, all nine U.S. Supreme Court justices have now signed on to decisions that find that computational methods can provide key evidence. Today, the leading approaches for benchmarking districting plans are based on the use of spanning trees for sampling graph partitions. We present a new *reversible recombination* algorithm and rigorously prove its fundamental properties. Furthermore, we argue for a canonical sampling distribution called the *spanning tree distribution* that is well adapted to redistricting and provides a principled foundation for comparing and validating methods. Together with a highly efficient (and open-source) implementation that can generate and handle large datasets, this work provides the most powerful null model to date for the gerrymandering problem, meeting an urgent democratic challenge with sound scientific methodology.</description>

      <title>Learning about the liveability of cities from young migrants using the combinatiorial Hodge theory approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11166v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In declining and ageing societies, local communities face the `risk of eventual extinction.' In Japan, a population equivalent to that of an entire city is lost every year, representing one of the most severe cases of population decline. Thus, attracting young people has become a policy priority for many local municipalities in Japan, prompting the implementation of numerous initiatives to improve the liveability of affected cities. However, what exactly is a liveable city? To determine this, a concrete measure of liveability is required to serve as a key performance indicator (KPI) for local governments to adopt. In this study, we propose empirical liveability based on people's votes with their feet, following Tiebout's argument (Tiebout,1956), and derive that such liveability can be quantified using the `potential' in the combinatorial Hodge theory, directly calculated from migration data only. As a case study, we measure the empirical liveability of municipalities in Japan for specific populations -- families with small children and women of reproductive age. Then, using the empirical liveability as dependent variables, we perform a regression analysis to identify factors related to liveability. This method is applicable to various datasets on migration, categorized by ethnicity, education, skill level, income and other attributes, and provides valuable statistics for urban planning and policymaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the social determinants of preventive behavior is vital for epidemic modelling and effective policy making. Traditional models emphasize imitation or rational trade-offs, but recent evidence highlights the role of social norms. We develop a behavioral epidemic model of seasonal disease on multilayer networks, where vaccination decisions combine learning from experience with coevolving social norms. The framework distinguishes descriptive norms (what others do) from injunctive norms (what others think ought to be done), while incorporating cognitive dissonance, social projection and logical consistency. Simulations show that norm dynamics yield markedly different vaccination uptake and infection levels compared to considering solely payoff-driven learning. Injunctive norms exert stronger and more persistent effects than descriptive norms. Interventions targeting injunctive expectations improve outcomes, while those on descriptive norms may be weaker or even counterproductive. Norm-based models, once empirically validated, can better capture human behavior and guide strategies for collective action problems even beyond pandemics.</description>

      <title>Graph topology estimation of power grids using pairwise mutual information of time series data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topology of a power grid is estimated using an information theoretic approach. By modeling the grid as a graph and using voltage magnitude data of individual nodes in the grid, the mutual information between pairs of nodes is computed using different approximation methods. Using the well-known Chow-Liu algorithm, a maximum spanning tree based on mutual information is computed to estimate the power grid topology. This manuscript explores the application of this method to different datasets and explores the domain of applicability. The data quality, precision, time windows, frequency and the method for calculating the mutual information are varied to see the effect on the successful reconstruction of the graph and it's leaf nodes. Success is shown for IEEE networks generated with MATPOWER and data generated using GridLAB-D. The algorithm is then cross-validated on IEEE networks.</description>

      <title>Uncovering multi-technology convergence patterns with hypergraphs: Evolution and prediction using patent data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Technology convergence integrates distinct domains to create novel combinations, driving radical innovation that reshapes markets and industries. However, most approaches rely on pairwise networks that cannot capture multi-technology interactions and suffer scale biases from heterogeneous patenting activity. To overcome these gaps, we propose a hypergraph-based framework that directly models multi-technology convergence and identifies statistically significant convergence via a probabilistic null model. Using four decades of USPTO patent data (1984-2023), we construct two hypergraphs: a co-classification-based hypergraph representing explicit inventive convergence and a co-citation-based hypergraph capturing implicit knowledge-flow convergence. Evolution analysis on both hypergraph types reveals a sustained growth in multi-technology and cross-domain convergence, with a marked shift from chemistry-led to computing-led convergence patterns. Building on these insights, we formulate the forecasting of technology convergence as a hyperedge prediction task. We implement random forest classifiers trained on two complementary feature sets derived from both hypergraphs: similarity features capturing structural and semantic similarities among technologies, and intrinsic features representing inherent attributes of technologies. Predictive results demonstrate that co-citation-based features exhibit stronger predictive power than co-classification-based ones, with their combination achieving optimal performance. Explainable AI analyses identify global knowledge-flow reachability and semantic similarity as dominant drivers of convergence, while intrinsic citation and economic values exhibit contrasting associations with convergence probability. This framework bridges evolution analysis and predictive modeling of multi-technology convergence, offering actionable insights for innovation strategy.</description>

      <title>Finite Population Dynamics Resolve the Central Paradox of the Inspection Game</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Inspection Game is the canonical model for the strategic conflict between law enforcement (inspectors) and citizens (potential criminals). Its classical Mixed-Strategy Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) is afflicted by a paradox: the equilibrium crime rate is independent of both the penalty size ($p$) and the crime gain ($g$), undermining the efficacy of deterrence policy. We re-examine this challenge using evolutionary game theory, focusing on the long-term fixation probabilities of strategies in finite, asymmetric population sizes subject to demographic noise. The deterministic limit of our model exhibits stable limit cycles around the MSNE, which coincides with the neutral fixed point of the equilibrium analysis. Crucially, in finite populations, demographic noise drives the system away from this cycle and toward absorbing states. Our results demonstrate that high absolute penalties $p$ are highly effective at suppressing crime by influencing the geometry of the deterministic dynamics, which in turn biases the fixation probability toward the criminal extinction absorbing state, thereby restoring the intuitive role of $p$. Furthermore, we reveal a U-shaped policy landscape where both high penalties and light penalties (where $p \approx g$) are successful suppressors, maximizing criminal risk at intermediate penalty levels. Most critically, we analyze the realistic asymptotic limit of extreme population sizes asymmetry, where inspectors are exceedingly rare. In this limit, the system's dynamic outcome is entirely decoupled from the citizen payoff parameters $p$ and $g$, and is instead determined by the initial frequency of crime relative to the deterrence threshold (the ratio of inspection cost to reward for catching a criminal). This highlights that effective crime suppression requires managing the interaction between deterministic dynamics, demographic noise, and initial conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital network failures stemming from instabilities in measurements of temporal order motivate attention to concurrent events. A century of attempts to resolve the instabilities have never eliminated them. Do concurrent events occur at indeterminate times, or are they better seen as events to which the very concept of temporal order cannot apply? Logical dependencies of messages propagating through digital networks can be represented by marked graphs on which tokens are moved in formal token games. However, available mathematical formulations of these token games invoke "markings" -- global snapshots of the locations of tokens on the graph. The formulation in terms of global snapshots is misleading, because distributed networks are never still: they exhibit concurrent events inexpressible by global snapshots. We reformulate token games used to represent digital networks so as to express concurrency. The trick is to replace global snapshots with "local snapshots." Detached from any central clock, a local snapshot records an action at a node during a play of a token game. Assemblages of local records define acyclic directed graphs that we call history graphs. We show how history graphs represent plays of token games with concurrent motions, and, importantly, how history graphs can represent the history of a network operating while undergoing unpredictable changes.</description>

      <title>Regret, Uncertainty, and Bounded Rationality in Norm-Driven Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces an agent-based model to study how regret, uncertainty, and social norms interact to shape vaccination behavior during epidemics. The model integrates three behavioral mechanisms, anticipated regret, evolving norms, and uncertainty-dependent trust, within a unified learning framework. Grounded in psychology and behavioral economics, it captures how individuals make probabilistic choices influenced by material payoffs, fear, trust, and social approval. Simulations of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered process show that collective outcomes are best when agents display an intermediate level of rationality; they deliberate enough to respond to risk but remain flexible enough to adapt, avoiding the instability of both random and overly rigid decision-making. Regret exerts a dual influence; moderate levels encourage adaptive self-correction, while excessive regret or greed destabilize choices. Uncertainty has a similarly non-linear effect; moderate ambiguity promotes caution, but too much uncertainty disrupts coordination. Social norms restore cooperation by compensating for incomplete information. Personal norms guide behavior when individuals have reliable information and feel confident in their judgments. Injunctive norms-signals of others' approval-become more influential under uncertainty, while descriptive norms, which arise from observing others' actions, provide informational cues that help people decide what to do when direct knowledge is limited. Overall, the model provides a psychologically grounded, computationally explicit account of how emotion, cognition, and social norms govern preventive behavior during epidemics.</description>

      <title>Can Recombination Displace Dominant Scientific Ideas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15959v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combination of diverse, pre-existing knowledge is a common explanation for scientific breakthroughs. However, a paradox exists: while scientific output and the potential for such recombination have grown exponentially, the rate of breakthrough discoveries has not. To explore this paradox, our study examines 41 million scientific articles from 1965 to 2024. We measure two key properties for each paper: atypicality, which quantifies the combination of knowledge from conceptually distant areas, and disruption. We demonstrate that these metrics capture distinct processes. Atypicality is characteristic of work that extends established concepts into new topical areas (a form of cross-topic recombination). Disruption, in contrast, signifies the replacement of a dominant idea within its own topic.</description>

Abstract: A social norm defines what is good and what is bad in social contexts, as well as what to do based on such assessments. A stable social norm should be maintained against errors committed by its players. In addition, individuals may have different probabilities of errors in following the norm, and a social norm would be unstable if it benefited those who do not follow the norm carefully. In this work, we show that Simple Standing, which has been known to resist errors and mutants successfully, actually exhibits threshold behavior. That is, in a population of individuals playing the donation game according to Simple Standing, the residents can suppress the invasion of mutants with higher error proneness only if the residents' own error proneness is sufficiently low. Otherwise, the population will be invaded by mutants that commit assessment errors more frequently, and a series of such invasions will eventually undermine the existing social norm. This study suggests that the stability analysis of a social norm may have a different picture if the probability of error itself is regarded as an individual attribute.</description>
