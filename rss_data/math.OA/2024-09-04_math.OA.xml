      <title>Character Space and Gelfand type representation of locally C^{*}-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we identify a suitable approach to define the character space of a commutative unital locally $C^{\ast}$-algebra via the notion of the inductive limit of topological spaces. Also, we discuss topological properties of the character space. We establish the Gelfand type representation between a commutative unital locally $C^{\ast}$-algebra and the space of all continuous functions defined on its character space. Equivalently, we prove that every commutative unital locally $C^{\ast}$-algebra is identified with the locally $C^{\ast}$-algebra of continuous functions on its character space through the coherent representation of projective limit of $C^{\ast}$-algebras. Finally, we construct a unital locally $C^{\ast}$-algebra generated by a given locally bounded normal operator and show that its character space is homeomorphic to the local spectrum. Further, we define the functional calculus and prove spectral mapping theorem in this framework.</description>

      <title>Quantum graphs, subfactors and tensor categories I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an equivariant theory of graphs with respect to quantum symmetries and present a detailed exposition of various examples. We portray unitary tensor categories as a unifying framework encompassing all finite classical simple graphs, (quantum) Cayley graphs of finite (quantum) groupoids, and all finite-dimensional quantum graphs. We model a quantum set by a finite-index inclusion of C*-algebras and use the quantum Fourier transform to obtain all possible adjacency operators. In particular, we show every finite-index subfactor can be regarded as a complete quantum graph and describe how to find all its subgraphs. As applications, we prove a version of Frucht's Theorem for finite quantum groupoids, and introduce a version of path spaces for quantum graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leavitt path algebras, which are algebras associated to directed graphs, were first introduced about 20 years ago. They have strong connections to such topics as symbolic dynamics, operator algebras, non-commutative geometry, representation theory, and even chip firing. In this article we invite the reader to sneak a peek at these fascinating algebras and their interplay with several seemingly disparate parts of mathematics.</description>

      <title>Tail Bounds for Functions of Weighted Tensor Sums Derived from Random Walks on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents significant advancements in tensor analysis and the study of random walks on manifolds. It introduces new tensor inequalities derived using the Mond-Pecaric method, which enriches the existing mathematical tools for tensor analysis. This method, developed by mathematicians Mond and Pecaric, is a powerful technique for establishing inequalities in linear operators and matrices, using functional analysis and operator theory principles. The paper also proposes novel lower and upper bounds for estimating column sums of transition matrices based on their spectral information, which is critical for understanding random walk behavior. Additionally, it derives bounds for the right tail of weighted tensor sums derived from random walks on manifolds, utilizing the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator over the underlying manifolds and new tensor inequalities to enhance the understanding of these complex mathematical structures.</description>

      <title>Direct Integral and Decompoisitions of Locally Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the concept of direct integral of locally Hilbert spaces by using the notion of locally standard measure space (analogous to standard measure space defined in the classical setup), which we obtain by considering a strictly inductive system of measurable spaces along with a projective system of finite measures. Next, we define a locally Hilbert space given by the direct integral of a family of locally Hilbert spaces. Following that we introduce decomposable locally bounded and diagonalizable locally bounded operators. Further, we show that the class of diagonalizable locally bounded operators is an abelian locally von Neumann algebra, and this can be seen as the commutant of decomposable locally bounded operators. Finally, we discuss the following converse question:
  For a locally Hilbert space $\mathcal{D}$ and an abelian locally von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{M}$, does there exist a locally standard measure space and a family of locally Hilbert spaces such that
  (1) the locally Hilbert space $\mathcal{D}$ is identified with the direct integral of family of locally Hilbert spaces;
  (2) the abelian locally von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{M}$ is identified with the abelian locally von Neumann algebra of all diagonalizable locally bounded operators ?
  We answer this question affirmatively for a certain class of abelian locally von Neumann algebras.</description>

Abstract: Clausen--Scholze introduced the notion of solid spectrum in their condensed mathematics program. We demonstrate that the solidification of algebraic $K$-theory recovers two known constructions: the semitopological $K$-theory of a real (associative) algebra and the topological (aka operator) $K$-theory of a real Banach algebra.</description>

      <title>Non-C*-simple groups admit non-free actions on their Poisson boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a classical result of Kaimanovich and Vershik and independently of Rosenblatt that a non-amenable group admits a non-degenerate symmetric measure such that the Poisson boundary is trivial. Most if not all examples to date of non-free actions of countable groups on their Poisson boundaries had the stabilizers sitting inside the amenable radical. We show that every countable non-C*-simple group admits a symmetric measure of full support with non-trivial stabilizers. For a class of non-C*-simple groups with trivial amenable radical, which is non-empty as was shown by le Boudec, this gives a wealth of examples with non-normal stabilizers.</description>

      <title>The ideal intersection property for essential groupoid C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.03980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterise, in several complementary ways, \'etale groupoids with locally compact Hausdorff space of units whose essential groupoid C*-algebra has the ideal intersection property, assuming that the groupoid is topologically transitive and either Hausdorff or $\sigma$-compact. This leads directly to a characterisation of the simplicity of this C*-algebra which, for Hausdorff groupoids, agrees with the reduced groupoid C*-algebra. Specifically, we prove for topologically transitive groupoids that the ideal intersection property is equivalent to the absence of essentially confined amenable sections of isotropy groups. For topologically transitive groupoids with compact space of units we moreover show that this is equivalent to the uniqueness of equivariant pseudo-expectations. A key technical idea underlying our results is a new notion of groupoid action on C*-algebras including the essential groupoid C*-algebra itself. For minimal groupoids, we further obtain a relative version of Powers averaging property. Examples arise from suitable group representations into simple groupoid \Cstar-algebras. This is illustrated by the example of the quasi-regular representation of Thompson's group $\mathrm{T}$ with respect to Thompson's group $\mathrm{F}$, which satisfies the relative Powers averaging property in the Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_2$.</description>

      <title>Tracial States and $\mathbb{G}$-Invariant States of Discrete Quantum Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05176v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the tracial states and $\mathbb{G}$-invariant states on the reduced $C^*$-algebra $C_r(\widehat{\mathbb{G}})$ of a discrete quantum group $\mathbb{G}$. Here, we denote its dual compact quantum group by $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$. Our main result is that a state on $C_r(\widehat{\mathbb{G}})$ is tracial if and only if it is $\mathbb{G}$-invariant. This generalizes a known fact for unimodular discrete quantum groups and builds upon the work of Kalantar, Kasprzak, Skalski, and Vergnioux. As one consequence of this, we find that $C_r(\widehat{\mathbb{G}})$ is nuclear and admits a tracial state if and only if $\mathbb{G}$ is amenable. This resolves an open problem due to C.-K. Ng and Viselter, and Crann, in the discrete case. As another consequence, we prove that tracial states on $C_r(\widehat{\mathbb{G}})$ "concentrate" on $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}_F$, where $\mathbb{G}_F$ is the cokernel of the Furstenberg boundary. Furthermore, given certain assumptions, we characterize the existence of traces on $C_r(\widehat{\mathbb{G}})$ in terms of whether or not $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}_F$ is Kac type. We also characterize the uniqueness of (idempotent) traces in terms of whether not $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}_F$ is equal to the canonical Kac quotient of $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$. These results rely on the following, of which we give proofs: So\l tan's canonical Kac quotient construction, whether it is applied to the universal or the reduced CQG $C^*$-algebra of $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$ (when the latter admits a trace), yields the maximal Kac type closed quantum subgroup of $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of a differential operator on C*-algebras. This is a noncommutative analogue of a differential operator on a smooth manifold. We show that the common closed domain of all differential operators is closed under smooth functional calculus. As a corollary, we show that Schwartz functions on Connes tangent groupoid are closed under smooth functional calculus.</description>

      <title>Algebraic aspects and functoriality of the set of affiliated operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we aim to provide a satisfactory algebraic description of the set of affiliated operators for von Neumann algebras. Let $\mathscr{M}$ be a von Neumann algebra acting on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, and let $\mathscr{M}_{\text{aff}}$ denote the set of unbounded operators of the form $T = AB^{\dagger}$ for $A, B \in \mathscr{M}$ with $\ker(B)\subseteq\ker(A)$ , where $(\cdot)^{\dagger}$ denotes the Kaufman inverse. We show that $\mathscr{M}_{\text{aff}}$ is closed under product, sum, Kaufman-inverse and adjoint, and has the structure of a right near-semiring; Moreover, the above quotient representation of an operator in $\mathscr{M}_{\text{aff}}$ is essentially unique. The Murray-von Neumann affiliated operators for $\mathscr{M}$ turn out to be precisely the closed operators in $\mathscr{M}_{\text{aff}}$. Let $\Phi$ be a unital normal homomorphism between represented von Neumann algebras $(\mathscr{M}; \mathcal{H})$ and $(\mathscr{N}; \mathcal{K})$. With the help of the quotient representation, we obtain a canonical extension of $\Phi$ to a mapping $\Phi_{\text{aff}} : \mathscr{M}_{\text{aff}} \to \mathscr{N}_{\text{aff}}$ which respects sum, product, Kaufman-inverse, and adjoint. Thus $\mathscr{M}_{\text{aff}}$ is intrinsically associated with $\mathscr{M}$ and transforms functorially as we change representations of $\mathscr{M}$. Furthermore, $\Phi_{\text{aff}}$ preserves operator properties such as being symmetric, or positive, or accretive, or sectorial, or self-adjoint, or normal, and also preserves the Friedrichs and Krein-von Neumann extensions of densely-defined closed positive operators. As a proof of concept, we transfer some well-known results about closed unbounded operators to the setting of closed affiliated operators for properly infinite von Neumann algebras, via `abstract nonsense'.</description>

This involves $C^*$-algebras constructed from categories of paths built from certain nonsimple continued fraction expansions.</description>

Abstract: Let $X_1,\cdots,X_m$ be vector fields satisfying H\"ormander's Lie bracket generating condition on a smooth manifold $M$. We generalise Connes's tangent groupoid, by constructing a completion of the space $M\times M\times \mathbb{R}_+^\times$ using the sub-Riemannian metric. We use our space to calculate all the tangent cones of the sub-Riemannian metric in the sense of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. This generalises a result of Bella\"iche.</description>

      <title>A groupoid approach to the Wodzicki residue and the Kontsevich-Vishik trace</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on the work of Debord and Skandalis, van Erp and Yuncken introduced a groupoid approach to pseudo-differential operators which has various advantages over the classical approach using H\"ormander's symbolic calculus. In a recent work by Couchet and Yuncken, they showed that for pseudo-differential operators of order $-\dim(M)$ acting on a smooth manifold $M$ the Wodzicki residue can be naturally obtained from van Erp and Yuncken's approach. In this short note, we extend their work to pseudo-differential operators of any order. We also give a description of the Kontsevich-Vishik trace.</description>
