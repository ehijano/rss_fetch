      <title>PolyBin3D: A Suite of Optimal and Efficient Power Spectrum and Bispectrum Estimators for Large-Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By measuring, modeling and interpreting cosmological datasets, one can place strong constraints on models of the Universe. Central to this effort are summary statistics such as power spectra and bispectra, which condense the high-dimensional dataset into low-dimensional representations. In this work, we introduce a modern set of estimators for computing such statistics from three-dimensional clustering data, and provide a flexible Python implementation; PolyBin3D. Working in a maximum-likelihood formalism, we derive general estimators for the two- and three-point functions, which yield unbiased spectra regardless of the survey mask, weighting scheme, and presence of holes in the window function. These can be directly compared to theory without the need for mask-convolution. Furthermore, we present a numerical scheme for computing the optimal (minimum-variance) estimators for a given survey, which is shown to reduce error-bars on large-scales. Our Python package includes both general "unwindowed'' estimators and idealized equivalents (appropriate for simulations), each of which are efficiently implemented using fast Fourier transforms and Monte Carlo summation tricks, and additionally supports GPU acceleration. These are extensively validated in this work, with Monte Carlo convergence (relevant for masked data) achieved using only a small number of iterations (typically $&lt;10$ for bispectra). This will allow for fast and unified measurement of two- and three-point functions from current and upcoming survey data.</description>

      <title>Reionization after JWST: a photon budget crisis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations are revealing the first galaxies to be prolific producers of ionizing photons, which we argue gives rise to a tension between different probes of reionization. For hydrogen reionization to proceed there must be enough ionizing photons for all of the hydrogen atoms, including their recombinations. Over the last two decades a consensus has emerged where star-forming galaxies are able to generate these photons, given reasonable values for their number densities, ionizing efficiencies $\xi_{\rm ion}$ (per unit UV luminosity), and escape fractions $f_{\rm esc}$. However, new JWST observations infer high values of $\xi_{\rm ion}$ during reionization and an enhanced abundance of earlier ($z\gtrsim 9$) galaxies, dramatically increasing the number of ionizing photons produced at high $z$. Simultaneously, recent low-$z$ studies predict significant escape fractions for faint reionization-era galaxies. Put together, we show that the galaxies we have directly observed ($M_{\rm UV} &lt; -15$) not only can drive reionization, but would end it too early. That is, our current galaxy observations, taken at face value, imply an excess of ionizing photons and thus a process of reionization in tension with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Considering galaxies down to $M_{\rm UV}\approx -11$, below current observational limits, only worsens this tension, requiring on average $f_{\rm esc}\approx 3\%$, far lower than expected for early galaxies from post-reionization studies. We discuss possible avenues to resolve this photon budget crisis, including missing astrophysical or observational selection effects, as well as enhanced recombinations.</description>

      <title>Hot New Early Dark Energy bridging cosmic gaps: Supercooled phase transition reconciles (stepped) dark radiation solutions to the Hubble tension with BBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple model that can alleviate the $H_0$ tension while remaining consistent with big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). It is based on a dark sector described by a standard Lagrangian featuring a $SU(N)$ gauge symmetry with $N\geq3$ and a massive scalar field with a quartic coupling. The scalar acts as dark Higgs leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking $SU(N)\to SU(N\!-\!1)$ via a first-order phase transition \`a la Coleman-Weinberg. This set-up naturally realizes previously proposed scenarios featuring strongly interacting dark radiation (SIDR) with a mass threshold within hot new early dark energy (NEDE). For a wide range of reasonable model parameters, the phase transition occurs between the BBN and recombination epochs and releases a sufficient amount of latent heat such that the model easily respects bounds on extra radiation during BBN while featuring a sufficient SIDR density around recombination for increasing the value of $H_0$ inferred from the cosmic microwave background. Our model can be summarized as a natural mechanism providing two successive increases in the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom after BBN but before recombination $\Delta N_\mathrm{BBN} \to \Delta N_\mathrm{NEDE} \to \Delta N_\mathrm{IR}$ alleviating the Hubble tension. The first step is related to the phase transition and the second to the dark Higgs becoming non-relativistic. This set-up predicts further signatures, including a stochastic gravitational wave background and features in the matter power spectrum that can be searched for with future pulsar timing and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements.</description>

      <title>Full Modeling and Parameter Compression Methods in configuration space for DESI 2024 and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the contemporary era of high-precision spectroscopic surveys, led by projects like DESI, there is an increasing demand for optimizing the extraction of cosmological information from clustering data. This work conducts a thorough comparison of various methodologies for modeling the full shape of the two-point statistics in configuration space. We investigate the performance of both direct fits (Full-Modeling) and the parameter compression approaches (ShapeFit and Standard). We utilize the ABACUS-SUMMIT simulations, tailored to exceed DESI's precision requirements. Particularly, we fit the two-point statistics of three distinct tracers (LRG, ELG, and QSO), by employing a Gaussian Streaming Model in tandem with Convolution Lagrangian Perturbation Theory and Effective Field Theory. We explore methodological setup variations, including the range of scales, the set of galaxy bias parameters, the inclusion of the hexadecapole, as well as model extensions encompassing varying $n_s$ and allowing for $w_0w_a$CDM dark energy model. Throughout these varied explorations, while precision levels fluctuate and certain configurations exhibit tighter parameter constraints, our pipeline consistently recovers the parameter values of the mocks within $1\sigma$ in all cases for a 1-year DESI volume. Additionally, we compare the performance of configuration space analysis with its Fourier space counterpart using three models: PyBird, FOLPS and velocileptors, presented in companion papers. We find good agreement with the results from all these models.</description>

      <title>Comparing Compressed and Full-modeling Analyses with FOLPS: Implications for DESI 2024 and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) will provide unprecedented information about the large-scale structure of our Universe. In this work, we study the robustness of the theoretical modelling of the power spectrum of FOLPS, a novel effective field theory-based package for evaluating the redshift space power spectrum in the presence of massive neutrinos. We perform this validation by fitting the AbacusSummit high-accuracy $N$-body simulations for Luminous Red Galaxies, Emission Line Galaxies and Quasar tracers, calibrated to describe DESI observations. We quantify the potential systematic error budget of FOLPS, finding that the modelling errors are fully sub-dominant for the DESI statistical precision within the studied range of scales. Additionally, we study two complementary approaches to fit and analyse the power spectrum data, one based on direct Full-Modelling fits and the other on the ShapeFit compression variables, both resulting in very good agreement in precision and accuracy. In each of these approaches, we study a set of potential systematic errors induced by several assumptions, such as the choice of template cosmology, the effect of prior choice in the nuisance parameters of the model, or the range of scales used in the analysis. Furthermore, we show how opening up the parameter space beyond the vanilla $\Lambda$CDM model affects the DESI observables. These studies include the addition of massive neutrinos, spatial curvature, and dark energy equation of state. We also examine how relaxing the usual Cosmic Microwave Background and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis priors on the primordial spectral index and the baryonic matter abundance, respectively, impacts the inference on the rest of the parameters of interest. This paper pathways towards performing a robust and reliable analysis of the shape of the power spectrum of DESI galaxy and quasar clustering using FOLPS.</description>

      <title>A comparison of effective field theory models of redshift space galaxy power spectra for DESI 2024 and future surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In preparation for the next generation of galaxy redshift surveys, and in particular the year-one data release from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we investigate the consistency of a variety of effective field theory models that describe the galaxy-galaxy power spectra in redshift space into the quasi-linear regime using 1-loop perturbation theory. These models are employed in the pipelines \texttt{velocileptors}, \texttt{PyBird}, and \texttt{Folps$\nu$}. While these models have been validated independently, a detailed comparison with consistent choices has not been attempted. After briefly discussing the theoretical differences between the models we describe how to provide a more apples-to-apples comparison between them. We present the results of fitting mock spectra from the \texttt{AbacusSummit} suite of N-body simulations provided in three redshift bins to mimic the types of dark time tracers targeted by the DESI survey. We show that the theories behave similarly and give consistent constraints in both the forward-modeling and ShapeFit compressed fitting approaches. We additionally generate (noiseless) synthetic data from each pipeline to be fit by the others, varying the scale cuts in order to show that the models agree within the range of scales for which we expect 1-loop perturbation theory to be applicable. This work lays the foundation of Full-Shape analysis with DESI Y1 galaxy samples where in the tests we performed, we found no systematic error associated with the modeling of the galaxy redshift space power spectrum for this volume.</description>

      <title>Validating the Galaxy and Quasar Catalog-Level Blinding Scheme for the DESI 2024 analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of precision cosmology, ensuring the integrity of data analysis through blinding techniques is paramount -- a challenge particularly relevant for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). DESI represents a monumental effort to map the cosmic web, with the goal to measure the redshifts of tens of millions of galaxies and quasars. Given the data volume and the impact of the findings, the potential for confirmation bias poses a significant challenge. To address this, we implement and validate a comprehensive blind analysis strategy for DESI Data Release 1 (DR1), tailored to the specific observables DESI is most sensitive to: Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Redshift-Space Distortion (RSD) and primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG). We carry out the blinding at the catalog level, implementing shifts in the redshifts of the observed galaxies to blind for BAO and RSD signals and weights to blind for PNG through a scale-dependent bias. We validate the blinding technique on mocks, as well as on data by applying a second blinding layer to perform a battery of sanity checks. We find that the blinding strategy alters the data vector in a controlled way such that the BAO and RSD analysis choices do not need any modification before and after unblinding. The successful validation of the blinding strategy paves the way for the unblinded DESI DR1 analysis, alongside future blind analyses with DESI and other surveys.</description>

      <title>A comparison between Shapefit compression and Full-Modelling method with PyBird for DESI 2024 and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DESI aims to provide one of the tightest constraints on cosmological parameters by analyzing the clustering of more than thirty million galaxies. However, obtaining such constraints requires special care in validating the analysis methods, and efforts to reduce the computational time required through techniques such as data compression and emulation. In this work, we perform a precision validation of the PyBird power spectrum modelling code with both a traditional, but emulated, Full-Modelling approach and the model-independent Shapefit compression approach. Using cubic simulations, which accurately reproduce the clustering and precision of the DESI survey, we find that the cosmological constraints from Shapefit and Full-Modelling are consistent with each other at the $\sim0.3\sigma$ level. Both Shapefit and Full-Modelling are also consistent with the true $\Lambda$CDM simulation cosmology, even when including the hexadecapole, down to a scale $k_{\mathrm{max}} = 0.20 h \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. For extended models such as the $w$CDM and the $o$CDM models, we find including the hexadecapole can significantly improve the constraints and reduce the systematic errors with the same $k_{\mathrm{max}}$. Furthermore, we also show that the constraints on cosmological parameters with the correlation function evaluated from PyBird down to $s_{\mathrm{min}} = 30 h^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}$ are unbiased, and consistent with the constraints from the power spectrum.</description>

      <title>An analysis of parameter compression and full-modeling techniques with Velocileptors for DESI 2024 and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In anticipation of forthcoming data releases of current and future spectroscopic surveys, we present the validation tests and analysis of systematic effects within \texttt{velocileptors} modeling pipeline when fitting mock data from the \texttt{AbacusSummit} N-body simulations. We compare the constraints obtained from parameter compression methods to the direct fitting (Full-Modeling) approaches of modeling the galaxy power spectra, and show that the ShapeFit extension to the traditional template method is consistent with the Full-Modeling method within the standard $\Lambda$CDM parameter space. We show the dependence on scale cuts when fitting the different redshift bins using the ShapeFit and Full-Modeling methods. We test the ability to jointly fit data from multiple redshift bins as well as joint analysis of the pre-reconstruction power spectrum with the post-reconstruction BAO correlation function signal. We further demonstrate the behavior of the model when opening up the parameter space beyond $\Lambda$CDM and also when combining likelihoods with external datasets, namely the Planck CMB priors. Finally, we describe different parametrization options for the galaxy bias, counterterm, and stochastic parameters, and employ the halo model in order to physically motivate suitable priors that are necessary to ensure the stability of the perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Effects of dynamical friction on perturbations for evolving dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the impact of dynamical friction on cosmological scales and show its influence on the evolution of perturbations. In particular, considering smooth and clustering dark energy models, we describe the role played by friction by selecting two main hierarchical models, \textit{i.e.}, the first where the friction term is proportional to the Hubble rate, whereas the second where friction is induced by the dark energy pressure. The second approach generalises the first and translates the idea that pressure is a general relativistic effect, motivating why friction might arise once barotropic dark energy fluids are considered. The corresponding effects of friction are investigated at the level of linear and nonlinear perturbations, using the formalism of the spherical collapse model. Whilst dynamical friction has very small effects and thus it cannot be excluded \emph{a priori}, dissipative pressure friction leads to a substantial slow down in the evolution of perturbations. This can be particularly inferred within the halo mass function, for which we also employ corrections due to dark energy clustering. To this end, in order to discern detectable deviations from the standard cosmological model, we thus highlight where dissipation effects might play a significant role at large scales.</description>

      <title>Primordial Intermediate and Supermassive Black Hole formation during the electron-positron annihilation epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some of the Intermediate Mass Black Hole (IMBH) candidates observed at the center of galaxies or in globular clusters and some of the Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) seen at the center of many galaxies might be of primordial origin. Indeed, Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) of such mass could have formed when the Universe was $\sim$1-10$^3$ s old, due to the collapse of density fluctuations. In particular, when the Universe was $\sim 1$ s in age, Electron-Positron Annihilation (EPA) took place. We explore the formation of intermediate mass and supermassive PBHs, taking into account the effect of the EPA when the fluctuations have a running-tilt power-law spectrum: when these cross the $10^{-0.5}$-$10^{3.0}$ s Universe horizon they could produce $5\times 10^{3}$ - $5\times 10^{8}M_{\odot}$ PBHs with a density as high as $\sim 10^{10}$/Gpc$^3$. On average, this implies a population of about one thousand PBHs in the Local Group of Galaxies, with the nearest one at about 250 kpc, just under half the distance to the Andromeda galaxy (M31).</description>

      <title>Model-independent way to determine the Hubble constant and the curvature from phase shift of gravitational waves with DECIGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we propose a model-independent method to determine the Hubble constant and curvature simultaneously taking advantage of the possibilities of future space-borne gravitational wave (GW) detector DECIGO in combination with the radio quasars as standard rulers. Similarly to the redshift drift in the electromagnetic domain, accelerating expansion of the Universe causes a characteristic phase correction to the gravitational waveform detectable by DECIGO. Hence, one would be able to extract the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. This could be used to recover distance-redshift relation supported by the data not relying on any specific cosmological model. Assuming the FLRW metric, and using intermediate luminosity radio quasars as standard rulers one achieves an interesting opportunity to directly assess $H_0$ and $\Omega_k$ parameters. To test this method we simulated a set of acceleration parameters achievable by future DECIGO. Based on the existing sample of 120 intermediate-luminosity radio-quasars calibrated as standard rulers, we simulated much bigger samples of such standard rulers possible to obtain with VLBI. In the case of $(N=100)$ of radio quasars, which is the size of currently available sample, the precision of cosmological parameters determined would be $\sigma_{H_0}=2.74$ ${\mathrm{~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}}$ and $\sigma_{\Omega_k}=0.175$. In the optimistic scenario $(N = 1000)$ achievable by VLBI, the precision of $H_{0}$ would be improved to $1\%$, which is comparable to the result of $\sigma_{H_0} =0.54$ ${\mathrm{~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}}$ from \emph{Planck} 2018 TT, TE, EE+lowE+lensing data, and the precision of $\Omega_k$ would be 0.050. Our results demonstrate that such combined analysis, possible in the future, could be helpful to solve the current cosmological issues concerning the Hubble tension and cosmic curvature tension.</description>

      <title>Monge Amp\`ere gravity: from the large deviation principle to cosmological simulations through optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Monge-Amp\`ere gravity (MAG) as an effective theory of cosmological structure formation through optimal transport theory. MAG is based on the Monge-Amp\`ere equation, a nonlinear version of the Poisson equation, that relates the Hessian determinant of the potential to the density field. We explain how MAG emerges from a conditioned system of independent and indistinguishable Brownian particles, through the large deviation principle, in the continuum limit. To numerically explore this highly non-linear theory, we develop a novel N-body simulation method based on semi-discrete optimal transport. Our results obtained from the very first N-body simulation of Monge-Amp\`ere gravity with over 100 millions particles show that on large scales, Monge-Amp\`ere gravity is similar to the Newtonian gravity but favours the formation of anisotropic structures such as filaments. At small scales, MAG has a weaker clustering and is screened in high-density regions. Although here we study the Monge-Amp\`ere gravity as an effective rather than a fundamental theory, our novel highly-performant optimal transport algorithm can be used to run high-resolution simulations of a large class of modified theories of gravity, such as Galileons, in which the equations of motion are second-order and of Monge-Amp\`ere type.</description>

      <title>Distributions and Collision Rates of ALP Stars in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply current analytical knowledge on the characteristic mass and linear evolution of miniclusters down to redshift $z=0$ to the hypothetical minicluster distribution of the Milky Way. Using the mass-radius relation and a core-halo relation for stable soliton solutions composed of axion-like particles (ALPs), we connect the galactic minicluster mass distribution to that of their ALP star cores. We consider different temperature evolutions of the ALP field with masses in the range $10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 10^{-3}\,$eV and infer the abundance and properties of QCD axion- and ALP stars in our galaxy. We re-evaluate detection prospects for collisions of neutron stars with both ALP stars and miniclusters as well as relativistic ALP bursts, so-called Bosenovae. Our analysis shows that the collision rates between miniclusters and neutron stars can become as large as $\sim 10^5\,$yr$^{-1}$ galaxy$^{-1}$, but that the fraction of encounters that can lead to resonance between ALP mass and magnetosphere plasma frequency is generally well below $\sim 1\,$yr$^{-1}$ galaxy$^{-1}$, depending on the ALP model. We confirm previous results that merger rates of ALP stars are extremely small $&lt; 10^{-12}\,$yr$^{-1}$ galaxy$^{-1}$, while their host miniclusters can merge much more frequently, up to $\sim 10^3\,$yr$^{-1}$ galaxy$^{-1}$ for the QCD axion. We find that Bosenovae and parametric resonance are much more likely to lead to observable signatures than neutron star encounters. We also suggest that a combination of accretion and parametric resonance can lead to observable radio lines for a wide range of ALP masses $m_a$ and photon-couplings $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$.</description>

      <title>The expected kinematic matter dipole is robust against source evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements using catalogues of quasars and radio galaxies have shown that the dipole anisotropy in the large-scale distribution of matter is about twice as large as is expected in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, indeed in any cosmology based on the Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. This expectation is based on the kinematic interpretation of the dipole anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background, i.e. as arising due to our local peculiar velocity. The effect of aberration and Doppler boosting on the projected number counts on the sky of cosmologically distant objects in a flux-limited catalogue can then be calculated and confronted with observations. This fundamental consistency test of FLRW models proposed by Ellis &amp; Baldwin (1984) was revisited by Dalang &amp; Bonvin (2022) [arXiv:2111.03616] who argued that redshift evolution of the sources can significantly affect the expected matter dipole. In this note we demonstrate that the Ellis &amp; Baldwin test is in fact robust to such effects, hence the &gt; 5$\sigma$ dipole anomaly uncovered by Secrest et al. (2021, 2022) [arXiv:2009.14826, arXiv:2206.05624] remains an outstanding challenge to the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Prospects of the multi-channel photometric survey telescope in the cosmological application of Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Multi-channel Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto) is a real-time, three-color photometric system designed to capture the color evolution of stars and transients accurately. This telescope system can be crucial in cosmological distance measurements of low-redshift (low-$z$, $z$ $\lesssim 0.1$) Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). To optimize the capabilities of this instrument, we perform a comprehensive simulation study before its official operation is scheduled to start. By considering the impact of atmospheric extinction, weather conditions, and the lunar phase at the observing site involving the instrumental features, we simulate the light curves of SNe Ia obtained by the Mephisto. The best strategy in the case of SN Ia cosmology is to take the image at an exposure time of 130 s with a cadence of 3 days. In this condition, Mephisto can obtain hundreds of high-quality SNe Ia to achieve a distance measurement better than $4.5\%$. Given the on-time spectral classification and monitoring of the Lijiang 2.4 m Telescope at the same observatory, Mephisto, in the whole operation, can significantly enrich the well-calibrated sample of supernovae at low-$z$ and improve the calibration accuracy of high-$z$ SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature renormalization of Standard Model coupled with gravity, and its implications for cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite-temperature one-loop renormalization of the Standard Model, coupled with dynamic metrics, is conducted in this study. The entire analysis is coherently carried out by using the refined background field method, applied in the spirit of the Coleman-Weinberg technique. The general form of the propagator, introduced in our previous work to facilitate Feynman diagram computation in a general curved background, proves useful in the presence of time-dependent temperature. Its utilization allows for the analysis of a FLRW background to essentially reduce to that of a constant finite-T flat spacetime. Notably, this method also provides an effective tool for addressing one of the longstanding problems in QCD, the Linde problem. The implications of our findings for cosmology, particularly the cosmological constant problem and Hubble tension, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting dark sectors in supernovae are fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit supernova (SN) bounds on a hidden sector consisting of millicharged particles $\chi$ and a massless dark photon. Unless the self-coupling is fine-tuned to be small, rather than exiting the SN core as a gas, the particles form a relativistic fluid and subsequent dark QED fireball, streaming out against the drag due to the interaction with matter. Novel bounds due to excessive energy deposition in the mantle of low-energy SNe can be obtained. The cooling bounds from SN~1987A are unexpectedly not affected in the free-streaming regime. The inclusion of $\chi\bar{\chi}\rightarrow \rm SM$ substantially modifies the constraints in the trapping regime, which can only be treated hydrodynamically. Our results can be adapted to generic sub-GeV self-interacting dark sectors.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave lensing in Einstein-aether theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein-aether theory provides a model to test the validity of local Lorentz invariance in gravitational interactions. The speed of gravitational waves as measured from the binary neutron star event GW170817 sets stringent limits on Einstein-aether theory, but only on a combination of the theory's free parameters. For this reason, a significant part of the theory's parameter space remains unconstrained by observations. Motivated by this, we explore the propagation of gravitational waves in Einstein-aether theory over an inhomogeneous background (i.e., gravitational wave lensing) as a potential mechanism to break the degeneracies between the theory's free parameters, and hence enable new constraints on the theory to be obtained. By bringing the field equations into the form of the so-called kinetic matrix and applying a formalism known as the propagation eigenstate framework, we find that the speed of gravitational waves is modified by inhomogeneities in the aether field. However, the modification is common to both gravitational polarizations and vanishes in the limit in which gravitational waves propagate with luminal speed. This lens-dependent gravitational wave speed contrasts with the lens-induced birefringence observed in other theories beyond general relativity, like Horndeski's theory. While the potential to improve tests based on gravitational-wave speed is limited, our formalism sets the basis to fully describe signal propagation over inhomogeneous spacetimes in Einstein-aether theory and other extensions of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of dynamos from autonomous generation of chiral asymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At high energies, the dynamics of a plasma with charged fermions can be described in terms of chiral magnetohydrodynamics. Using direct numerical simulations, we demonstrate that chiral magnetic waves (CMWs) can produce a chiral asymmetry $\mu_5 = \mu_\mathrm{L} - \mu_\mathrm{R}$ from a spatially fluctuating (inhomogeneous) chemical potential $\mu = \mu_\mathrm{L} + \mu_\mathrm{R}$, where $\mu_\mathrm{L}$ and $\mu_\mathrm{R}$ are the chemical potentials of left- and right-handed electrically charged fermions, respectively. If the frequency of the CMW is less than or comparable to the characteristic growth rate of the chiral dynamo instability, the magnetic field can be amplified on small spatial scales. The growth rate of this small-scale chiral dynamo instability is determined by the spatial maximum value of $\mu_5$ fluctuations. Therefore, the magnetic field amplification occurs during periods when $\mu_5$ reaches temporal maxima during the CMW. If the small-scale chiral dynamo instability leads to a magnetic field strength that exceeds a critical value, which depends on the resistivity and the initial value of $\mu$, magnetically-dominated turbulence is produced. Turbulence gives rise to a large-scale dynamo instability, which we find to be caused by the magnetic alpha effect. Our results have consequences for the dynamics of certain high-energy plasmas, such as the early Universe or proto-neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black hole (PBH) formation during cosmic phase transitions and annihilation periods, such as the QCD transition or the $e^+e^-$-annihilation, is thought to be particularly efficient due to a softening of the equation of state. We present a detailed numerical study of PBH formation during the QCD epoch in order to derive an accurate PBH mass function. We also briefly consider PBH formation during the $e^+e^-$-annihilation epoch. Our investigation confirms that, for nearly scale-invariant spectra, PBH abundances on the QCD scale are enhanced by a factor $\sim 10^3$ compared to a purely radiation dominated Universe. For a power spectrum producing an (almost) scale-invariant PBH mass function outside of the transition, we find a peak mass of $M_{\rm pbh}\approx 1.9 M_{\odot}$ with a fraction $f\approx 1.5\times 10^{-2}$ of the PBHs having a mass of $M_{\rm pbh} &gt; 10 M_{\odot}$, possibly contributing to the LIGO-Virgo black hole merger detections. We point out that the physics of PBH formation during the $e^+e^-$-annihilation epoch is more complex as it is very close to the epoch of neutrino decoupling. We argue that neutrinos free-streaming out of overdense regions may actually hinder PBH formation.</description>

Abstract: The superposition of many astrophysical gravitational wave (GW) signals below typical detection thresholds baths detectors in a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). In this work, we present a Fourier space approach to compute the frequency-domain distribution of stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds produced by discrete sources. Expressions for the moment-generating function and the distribution of observed (discrete) Fourier modes are provided. The results are first applied to the signal originating from all the mergers of compact stellar remnants (black holes and neutron stars) in the Universe, which is found to exhibit a $-4$ power-law tail. This tail is verified in the signal-to-noise ratio distribution of GWTC events. The extent to which the subtraction of bright (loud) mergers gaussianizes the resulting confusion noise of unresolved sources is then illustrated. The power-law asymptotic tail for the unsubtracted signal, and an exponentially decaying tail in the case of the SGWB, are also derived analytically. Our results generalize to any background of gravitational waves emanating from discrete, individually coherent, sources.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the steady spherically symmetric accretion in the combined potential of a central black hole and a dark matter halo. For the halo, we consider a Hernquist and an NFW potential and calculate the critical points of the flow. We find that the trans-sonic solution to the centre is not possible without a black hole, whereas two types of trans-sonic solutions are possible in its presence. We also derive the mass accretion rate for a black hole at the centre of a dark matter halo. Our results indicate two phases of accretion. The first is an initial phase with a low accretion rate that depends on the black hole mass, followed by a second phase with a high accretion rate that depends on the halo mass. In the second phase, the black hole mass increases rapidly to supermassive scales, which explains the existence of quasars at redshift $z\ge 6$ and also the recently detected supermassive black holes (SMBHs) by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Further, we calculate the evolution of the Eddington ratio for growing black holes. The accretion is mostly sub-Eddington except for a short super-Eddington episode when the mass accretion rate transitions from low to high. However, during that episode, the black hole mass is likely inadequate to hinder accretion through radiative feedback.</description>

      <title>"SNe Ia twins for life" towards a precise determination of H$_{0}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we present an approach to the measurement of extragalactic distances using twin SNe Ia, taken from the early down to the nebular phase. The approach is purely empirical, although we can give a theoretical background on why the method is reliable. Studying those twins in galaxies where peculiar velocities are relatively unimportant, we can tackle the H$_{0}$ tension problem. Here we apply the method to the determination of the distances to NGC 7250 and NGC 2525, who hosted respectively SN 2013dy and SN 2018gv, twins of two different SNe Ia prototypes: SN 2013aa/ SN 2017cbv and SN2011fe. From the study of the SN 2013aa and SN 2017cbv twin pair, by comparing it with SN 2011fe and applying the difference between the SN 2013aa/2017cbv and the SN 2011fe class, we find as well a good estimate of the distance to NGC 5643. We just have started to measure distances with this method for the samples in Freedman et al. (2019) and Riess et al. (2022). There are differences in measured distances to the same galaxy using Cepheids or TRGBs. In this context of discrepancy, the "twins for life" method is very competitive, as it can provide distance estimates with a modulus error of $\sigma_{\mu}$ $=$ 0.04 mag. Our findings call for a revision of the distance measured with Cepheids in Riess et al. (2022). NGC 7250 and NGC 2525 need better measurements with Cepheids. The Hubble tension can arise from the way in which the local SNe Ia sample is linked to the SNe Ia Hubble flow sample. A good calibration of distances of SNe Ia in the local sample can be provided with this approach.

      <title>Comprehensive Constraints on Dark Radiation Injection After BBN</title>

Abstract: We derive constraints on the injection of free-streaming dark radiation after big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) by considering the decay of a massive hidden sector particle into dark radiation. Such a scenario has the potential to alleviate the Hubble tension by introducing a new energy component to the evolution of the early universe. We employ observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from $\textit{Planck}$ 2018 and the South Pole Telescope (SPT-3G), measurements of the primordial deuterium abundance, Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae data, and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from BOSS DR12 to constrain these decay scenarios. Pre-recombination decays are primarily restricted by observations of the CMB via their impact on the effective number of relativistic species. On the other hand, long-lived decay scenarios in which the massive particle lifetime extends past recombination tend to decrease the late-time matter density inferred from the CMB and are thus subject to constraints from Pantheon+ and BAO. We find that, when marginalizing over lifetimes of $\tau_Y = [10^{-12.08}, 10^{-1.49}]$ Gyr, the decaying particle is limited at $2\sigma$ to only contribute a maximum of $3\%$ of the energy density of the universe. With limits on these decays being so stringent, neither short-lived nor long-lived scenarios are successful at substantially mitigating the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Forecast constraints on the baryonic feedback effect from the future kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The baryonic feedback effect is an important systematic error in the weak lensing (WL) analysis. It contributes partly to the $S_8$ tension in the literature. With the next generations of large scale structure (LSS) and CMB experiments, the high signal-to-noise kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect detection can tightly constrain the baryon distribution in and around dark matter halos, and quantify the baryonic effect in the weak lensing statistics. In this work, we apply the Fisher matrix technique to predict the future kSZ constraints on 3 kSZ-sensitive Baryon Correction Model (BCM) parameters. Our calculations show that, in combination with next generation LSS surveys, the 3rd generation CMB experiments such as AdvACT and Simon Observatory can constrain the matter power spectrum damping $S(k)$ to the precision of $\sigma_S(k)&lt;0.8\%\sqrt{37.8{\rm Gpc}^3h^{-3}/V}$ at $k\lesssim 10h/$Mpc, where $V$ is the overlapped survey volume between the future LSS and CMB surveys. For the 4th generation CMB surveys such as CMB-S4 and CMB-HD, the constraint will be enhanced to $\sigma_S(k)&lt;0.4\%\sqrt{37.8{\rm Gpc}^3h^{-3}/V}$. If extra-observations, e.g. X-ray detection and thermal SZ observation, can effectively fix the gas density profile slope parameter $\delta$, the constraint on $S(k)$ will be further boosted to $\sigma_S(k)&lt;0.3\%\sqrt{37.8{\rm Gpc}^3h^{-3}/V}$ and $\sigma_S(k)&lt;0.1\%\sqrt{37.8{\rm Gpc}^3h^{-3}/V}$ for the 3rd and 4th generation CMB surveys.</description>

      <title>Resistively controlled primordial magnetic turbulence decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fields generated in the early Universe undergo turbulent decay during the radiation-dominated era. The decay is governed by a decay exponent and a decay time. It has been argued that the latter is prolonged by magnetic reconnection, which depends on the microphysical resistivity and viscosity. Turbulence, on the other hand, is not usually expected to be sensitive to microphysical dissipation, which affects only very small scales. We want to test and quantify the reconnection hypothesis in decaying hydromagnetic turbulence. We performed high-resolution numerical simulations with zero net magnetic helicity using the Pencil Code with up to $2048^3$ mesh points and relate the decay time to the Alfv\'en time for different resistivities and viscosities. The decay time is found to be longer than the Alfv\'en time by a factor that increases with increasing Lundquist number to the 1/4 power. The decay exponent is as expected from the conservation of the Hosking integral, but a timescale dependence on resistivity is unusual for developed turbulence and not found for hydrodynamic turbulence. In two dimensions, the Lundquist number dependence is shown to be leveling off above values of $\approx25,000$, independently of the value of the viscosity. Our numerical results suggest that resistivity effects have been overestimated in earlier work. Instead of reconnection, it may be the magnetic helicity density in smaller patches that is responsible for the resistively slow decay. The leveling off at large Lundquist number cannot currently be confirmed in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2: Equatorial First Data Release</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2 (MaDCoWS2) is a new survey designed as the successor of the original MaDCoWS survey. MaDCoWS2 improves upon its predecessor by using deeper optical and infrared data and a more powerful detection algorithm (PZWav). As input to the search, we use grz photometry from DECaLS in combination with W1 and W2 photometry from the CatWISE2020 catalog to derive the photometric redshifts with full redshift probability distribution functions for WISE-selected galaxies. Cluster candidates are then detected using the PZWav algorithm to find three-dimensional galaxy overdensities from the sky positions and photometric redshifts. This paper provides the first MaDCoWS2 data release, covering 1461 (1838 without masking) deg^2 centered on the Hyper-SuprimeCam Subaru Strategic Program equatorial fields. Within this region, we derive a catalog of 22,970 galaxy cluster candidates detected at S/N&gt;5. These clusters span the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;2, including 1312 candidates at z&gt;1.5. We compare MaDCoWS2 to six existing catalogs in the area. We rediscover 60%-92% of the clusters in these surveys at S/N&gt;5. The medians of the absolute redshift offset are &lt;0.02 relative to these surveys, while the standard deviations are less than 0.06. The median offsets between the detection position from MaDCoWS2 and other surveys are less than 0.25 Mpc. We quantify the relation between S/N and gas mass, total mass, luminosity, and richness from other surveys using a redshift-dependent power law relation. We find that the S/N-richness relation exhibits the lowest scatter.</description>

      <title>Local Limit of Nonlocal Gravity: A Teleparallel Extension of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05536v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a general constitutive framework for a teleparallel extension of the general theory of relativity. This approach goes beyond the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) by broadening the analogy with the electrodynamics of media. In particular, the main purpose of this paper is to investigate in detail a local constitutive extension of TEGR that is the local limit of nonlocal gravity (NLG). Within this framework, we study the modified FLRW cosmological models. Of these, the most cogent turns out to be the modified Cartesian flat model which is shown to be inconsistent with the existence of a positive cosmological constant. Moreover, dynamic dark energy and other components of the modified Cartesian flat model evolve differently with the expansion of the universe as compared to the standard flat cosmological model. The observational consequences of the modified Cartesian flat model are briefly explored and it is shown that the model is capable of resolving the H_0 tension.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of matter-type modified gravity theories to general relativity with nonminimal matter interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we first establish that gravity models incorporating matter-related terms, such as $f(\mathcal{L}_{\rm m})$, $f(g_{\mu\nu} T^{\mu\nu})$, and $f(T_{\mu\nu} T^{\mu\nu})$, into the usual matter Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}_{\rm m}$, are equivalent to general relativity with nonminimal matter interactions. Through the redefinition $\mathcal{L}_{\rm m}+f \rightarrow \mathcal{L}_{\rm m}^{\rm tot}$, these models are exactly GR, yet the usual material field $T_{\mu\nu}$ and its accompanying partner, the modification field $T_{\mu\nu}^{\rm mod}$, engage in nonminimal interactions. Specifically, $\nabla^{\mu}T_{\mu\nu}=-Q_{\nu}=-\nabla^{\mu}T_{\mu\nu}^{\rm mod}$, where $Q_{\nu}$ is the interaction kernel that governs the rate of energy transfer. Our focus narrows on the specific model of $f(T_{\mu\nu} T^{\mu\nu})$, known as Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity, where the usual material field $T_{\mu\nu}$ is accompanied by an \textit{energy-momentum squared field} (EMSF), $T_{\mu\nu}^{\rm emsf}$, along with a sui generis nonminimal interaction between them. We demonstrate that a particular $T_{\mu\nu}^{\rm emsf}$ can be introduced by \textit{removing} $\frac{\partial^2 \mathcal{L}_{\rm m}}{\partial g^{\mu\nu} \partial g^{\sigma\epsilon}}$ (the new term emerging in models that incorporate scalars formed from $T_{\mu\nu}$), thanks to the freedom in determining the interaction kernel, but this approach compromises the Lagrangian formulation of EMSG. Additionally, we address the ambiguities regarding the perfect fluid stemming from this new term. We show the proper way of calculating this term for a perfect fluid, revealing that it is indeed non-zero, contrary to common assumption in the literature. Finally, we re-examine cosmological models within the realm of EMSG, offering new insights into the applicability and interpretation of our findings in EMSG and similar theoretical frameworks.</description>

      <title>The abundance of dark matter haloes down to Earth mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Voids-within-Voids-within-Voids (VVV) simulations, a suite of successive nested N-body simulations with extremely high resolution (denoted, from low to high resolution, by L0 to L7), to test the Press-Schechter (PS), Sheth-Tormen (ST), and extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formulae for the halo abundance over the entire mass range, from mini-haloes of $10^{-6}\ \mathrm{M_\odot}$, to cluster haloes of $10^{15}\ \mathrm{M_\odot}$, at different redshifts, from $z=30$ to the present. We find that at $z=0$ and $z=2$, ST best reproduces the results of L0, which has the mean cosmic density (overdensity $\delta=0$), at $10^{11-15} ~\mathrm{M_\odot}$. The higher resolution levels (L1-L7) are biased underdense regions ($\delta&lt;-0.6$). The EPS formalism takes this into account since it gives the mass function of a region conditioned, in this case, on having a given underdensity. EPS provides good matches to these higher levels, with deviations $\lesssim 20\%$, at $10^{-6-12.5} ~\mathrm{M_\odot}$. At $z \sim 7-15$, the ST predictions for L0 and the EPS for L1-L7 show somewhat larger deviations from the simulation results. However, at even higher redshifts, $z \sim 30$, EPS fits the simulations well again. We confirm our results by picking more subvolumes from the L0 simulation, finding that our conclusions depend only weakly on the size and overdensity of the region. The good agreement of EPS with the higher-level simulations implies that PS (or ST) gives an accurate description of the total halo mass function in representative regions of the universe.</description>

      <title>On the tension between the Radial Acceleration Relation and Solar System quadrupole in modified gravity MOND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), postulating a breakdown of Newtonian mechanics at low accelerations, has considerable success at explaining galaxy kinematics. However, the quadrupole of the gravitational field of the Solar System (SS) provides a strong constraint on the way in which Newtonian gravity can be modified. In this paper we assess the extent to which the AQUAL and QUMOND modified gravity formulations of MOND are capable of accounting simultaneously for the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR), the Cassini measurement of the SS quadrupole and the kinematics of wide binaries in the Solar neighbourhood. We achieve this by inferring the location and sharpness of the MOND transition from the SPARC RAR under broad assumptions for the behaviour of the interpolating function and external field effect. We constrain the same quantities from the SS quadrupole, finding that this requires a significantly sharper transition between the deep-MOND and Newtonian regimes than is allowed by the RAR (an 8.7$\sigma$ tension under fiducial model assumptions). This may be relieved somewhat by allowing additional freedom in galaxies' mass-to-light ratios -- which also improves the RAR fit -- and more significantly (to 1.9$\sigma$) by removing galaxies with bulges. For the first time, we also apply to the SPARC RAR fit an AQUAL correction for flattened systems, obtaining similar results. Finally we show that the SS quadrupole constraint implies, to high precision, no deviation from Newtonian gravity in nearby wide binaries, and speculate on possible resolutions of this tension between SS and galaxy data within the MOND paradigm.</description>
