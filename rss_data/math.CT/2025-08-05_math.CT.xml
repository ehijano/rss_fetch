      <title>Dagger categories of relations: the equivalence of dilatory dagger categories and epi-regular independence categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several categories look like categories of relations, but do not fit the established theory of relations in regular categories. They include the category of surjective multivalued functions, the category of injective partial functions, the category of finite probability spaces and stochastic matrices, and the category of Hilbert spaces and linear contractions. To explain these anomalous examples, we develop a parallel theory of relations in epi-regular independence categories. Just as regular categories correspond to tabular allegories, epi-regular independence categories correspond to dilatory dagger categories. The equivalence maps epi-regular independence categories to their associated dagger category of relations, and dilatory dagger categories to their wide subcategory of coisometries.</description>

      <title>Gerstenhaber type structures on Davydov-Yetter cohomology with coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain Gerstenhaber type structures on Davydov-Yetter cohomology with coefficients in half-braidings for a monoidal functor. Our approach uses a formal analogy between half-braidings of a monoidal functor and the entwining of a coalgebra with an algebra. We show that the Davydov-Yetter complex with coefficients carries the structure of a weak comp algebra. In particular, it is equipped with two distinct cup product structures $\cup$ and $\sqcup$ which are related in a manner that replaces graded commutativity. We also introduce a subcomplex of the Davydov-Yetter complex with coefficients whose cohomology forms a Gerstenhaber algebra in the usual sense.</description>

      <title>The derivator of a dg-category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we construct the stable derivator associated to a homotopically complete and cocomplete dg-category by explicitly defining homotopy Kan extensions via suitable weighted homotopy limits and colimits in dg-categories. By restricting the domain of the derivator to finite direct categories, we obtain a well-defined derivator even for pretriangulated dg-categories. This definition enables an explicit description of the derivator associated to a weakly idempotent complete Frobenius exact category, leading to a more direct characterization in terms of Gorenstein projective (equivalently, Gorenstein injective) diagrams.</description>

      <title>Categorical Anomaly Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matching 't Hooft anomalies is a powerful tool for constraining the low-energy dynamics of quantum systems and their allowed renormalization group (RG) flows. For non-invertible (or categorical) symmetries, however, a key challenge has been the lack of a precise framework to characterize and quantify anomalies. We address this by identifying tensor functors between UV and IR symmetry categories as central to capturing these constraints. To this end, we introduce Anomalous Simple Categories (ASCies) as fundamental building blocks of categorical anomalies. A given symmetry category may support multiple ASCies, each encoding distinct anomalous features. These structures naturally arise in the context of the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), where tensor functors correspond to RG-interfaces between UV and IR SymTFTs, and ASCies are realized as particular such interfaces satisfying simple, universal criteria. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through examples involving anomalous 0-form, higher-form, and crucially, non-invertible symmetries in various spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Eilenberg-MacLane Spectrum of \mathbb{F}_1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a very special $\Gamma$-space $X$, repeated application of Segal's delooping functor produces the constituent spaces of the associated connective $\Omega$-spectrum. In particular, by applying this construction to \textit{discrete} very special $\Gamma$-spaces (a.k.a.~Abelian groups), one recovers Eilenberg-MacLane spectra. The delooping functor is entirely formal, however, and can be applied to arbitrary $\Gamma$-spaces without any conditions. Work of Connes and Consani suggests that the ``field with one element'' can be fruitfully realized as a (discrete) $\Gamma$-space (which localizes to the classical sphere spectrum). This note computes Segal's deloopings of this model of $\mathbb{F}_1$. They are $n$-fold simplicial sets whose geometric realizations are the $n$-spheres, equipped with \textit{free partial commutative monoid} structures. Equivalently, they are the (nerves of the) free partial strict $n$-categories with free partial symmetric monoidal structures.</description>

      <title>Cartier integration of infinitesimal 2-braidings via 2-holonomy of the CMKZ 2-connection, I: Hexagonators and the Breen polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper follows on from "Syllepses from 3-shifted Poisson structures and second-order integration of infinitesimal 2-braidings". Given a symmetric strict infinitesimal 2-braiding on a symmetric strict monoidal cochain 2-category, we construct a candidate hexagonator series as a 2-holonomy with respect to the Cirio-Martins-Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (CMKZ) fake flat 2-connection over the configuration space of 3 distinguishable particles on the complex line, $Y_3$. The second-order term of the hexagonator series is computed and found to agree with the "infinitesimal hexagonator" from the aforementioned work. Finally, we assume a coherent totally symmetric strict infinitesimal 2-braiding and prove that the Breen polytope axiom is satisfied by translating it into a 2-loop in $Y_3$.</description>

      <title>The tensor triangular geometry of fully faithful functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the map on Balmer spectra induced by a fully faithful geometric functor is a quotient map whose fibers are connected. This is an analogue of the Zariski Connectedness Theorem in algebraic geometry and it can be applied to a plethora of examples in equivariant and motivic mathematics. We isolate a significant source of examples by introducing the "concentration" of a tt-category at a well-behaved chosen set of compact generators. Various categories of cellular objects arise in this way. In particular, the "unitation" of a tt-category is the concentration at the unit object. We compute the Balmer spectrum of the unitation of the equivariant stable homotopy category as well as related categories arising in equivariant higher algebra. We also apply our results to the study of the comparison map of a tt-category. Among other results, we prove that the comparison map of a connective category is a quotient map with connected fibers. This involves studying the tt-geometry of weight complex functors, which may be of independent interest. We also study the relationship between the comparison map and the affinization of the Balmer spectrum viewed as a locally ringed space. These results provide a layered approach to understanding the spectrum of a given tt-category, by starting with the Zariski spectrum of the endomorphism ring of the unit, and then passing backwards to larger and larger concentrations (through quotient maps with connected fibers). Significant stages along the way include the passage to the unitation and the passage to the concentration at the Picard group.</description>

      <title>The concept of nullity in general spaces and contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00212v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of null sets, or nullity, is present in all discourses of mathematics. The two most familiar notions of nullity are "almost-every" and "almost none". A notion of nullity corresponds to a choice of subsets that one interprets as null or empty. The rationale behind this choice depends on the context, such as Topology or Measure theory. One also expects that the morphisms or transformations within the contexts preserve the nullity structures. Extending this idea, a generalized notion of nullity is presented as a functor between categories. A constructive procedure is presented for by which an existing notion of nullity can be extended functorially to to categories with richer structure. Nullity is thus presented as an arbitrary construct, which can be extended to broader contexts using well defined rules. These rules are succinctly expressed by right and left Kan extensions.</description>

      <title>$\infty$-Dold-Kan correspondence via representation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a purely derivator-theoretical reformulation and proof of a classic result of Happel and Ladkani, showing that it occurs uniformly across stable derivators and it is then independent of coefficients. The resulting equivalence provides a bridge between homotopy theory and representation theory: indeed, our result is a derivator-theoretic version of the $\infty$-Dold-Kan correspondence for bounded chain complexes. Moreover, our equivalence can also be realized as an action of a spectral bimodule in the setting of universal tilting theory developed by Groth and \v{S}\v{t}ov\'i\v{c}ek.</description>

      <title>Categorical probability spaces, ergodic decompositions, and transitions to equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04267v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a category of probability spaces and measure-preserving Markov kernels up to almost sure equality. This category contains, among its isomorphisms, mod-zero isomorphisms of probability spaces. It also gives an isomorphism between the space of values of a random variable and the sigma-algebra that it generates on the outcome space, reflecting the standard mathematical practice of using the two interchangeably, for example when taking conditional expectations.
  We show that a number of constructions and results from classical probability theory, mostly involving notions of equilibrium, can be expressed and proven in terms of this category. In particular: - Given a stochastic dynamical system acting on a standard Borel space, we show that the almost surely invariant sigma-algebra can be obtained as a limit and as a colimit; - In the setting above, the almost surely invariant sigma-algebra gives rise, up to isomorphism of our category, to a standard Borel space; - As a corollary, we give a categorical version of the ergodic decomposition theorem for stochastic actions; - As an example, we show how de Finetti's theorem and the Hewitt-Savage and Kolmogorov zero-one laws fit in this limit-colimit picture.
  This work uses the tools of categorical probability, in particular Markov categories, as well as the theory of dagger categories.</description>
