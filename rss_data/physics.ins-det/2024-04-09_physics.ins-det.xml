      <title>Differential fuzz testing to detect tampering in sensor systems and its application to arms control authentication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In future nuclear arms control treaties, it will be necessary to authenticate the hardware and software components of verification measurement systems, i.e., to ensure these systems are functioning as intended and have not been tampered with by malicious actors. While methods such as source code hashing and static analysis can help verify the integrity of software components, they may not be capable of detecting tampering with environment variables, external libraries, or the firmware and hardware of radiation measurement systems. In this article, we introduce the concept of physical differential fuzz testing as a challenge-response-style tamper indicator that can holistically and simultaneously test all the above components in a cyber-physical system. In essence, we randomly sample (or "fuzz") the untampered system's parameter space, including both normal and off-normal parameter values, and consider the time series of outputs as the baseline signature of the system. Re-running the same input sequence on a untampered system will produce an output sequence consistent with this baseline, while running the same input sequence on a tampered system will produce a modified output sequence and raise an alarm. We then apply this concept to authenticating the radiation measurement equipment in nuclear weapon verification systems and conduct demonstration fuzz testing measurements with a sodium iodide (NaI) gamma ray spectrometer. Because there is Poisson noise in the measured output spectra, we also use a mechanism for comparing inherently noisy or stochastic fuzzing sequences. We show that physical differential fuzz testing can detect two types of tamper attempts, and conclude that it is a promising framework for authenticating future cyber-physical systems in nuclear arms control, safeguards, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Characterising and tackling thermally induced zero-drift in displacement measuring interferometry using temperature-controlled enclosure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our research efforts in displacement measurement interferometry focused on long-term drifts initiated an extended experimental investigation in the interferometric assemblies of our design. We aimed to analyze, characterize and tackle the long-term measurement stability, expressed as the zero-drift, with special attention to the thermal effects. For the experimentation, we developed a thermostatic chamber equipped with an active temperature regulation, array of sensors and control electronics. With either the finely stabilized temperature or with the thermal cycling, we are able to carry out a range of investigations: verification of modified design or prototype interferometers, testing of production pieces, characterization of integrated assemblies and units in terms of the zero drift and the susceptibility to thermal effect - the temperature sensitivity, expressed as $\delta L / \delta T$ in nm.K$^{-1}$.

      <title>Radiation Tolerance of the LHCb Outer Tracker: in the Lab and in the Forward Region at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the detector construction phase between 2004 and 2006, it was discovered that the LHCb Outer Tracker (OT) detector suffered from gain loss after irradiation in the laboratory at moderate intensities. Under irradiation an insulating layer was formed on the anode wire. The aging was caused by contamination of the counting gas due to outgassing of the glue used in construction namely araldite AY103-1. The gain loss was concentrated upstream the gas flow, and at moderate irradiation intensity only. The aging rate was reduced by longterm flushing and by the addition of a few percent of O2 to the gas mixture. Furthermore, applying a large positive high voltage (beyond the amplification regime) has shown to remove the insulating deposits without damaging the wire surface. This paper presents the history of the developments together with the characteristics and the culprit of the aging phenomenon and the resulting detector performance in situ.</description>

      <title>Software and computing for Run 3 of the ATLAS experiment at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ATLAS experiment has developed extensive software and distributed computing systems for Run 3 of the LHC. These systems are described in detail, including software infrastructure and workflows, distributed data and workload management, database infrastructure, and validation. The use of these systems to prepare the data for physics analysis and assess its quality are described, along with the software tools used for data analysis itself. An outlook for the development of these projects towards Run 4 is also provided.</description>

      <title>Direct electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide thin film for aptamer-based selective and highly sensitive detection of Matrix metalloproteinase 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simple and low-cost biosensing solutions are suitable for point-of-care applications aiming to overcome the gap between scientific concepts and technological production. To compete with sensitivity and selectivity of golden standards, such as liquid chromatography, the functionalization of biosensors is continuously optimized to enhance the signal and improve their performance, often leading to complex chemical assay development. In this research, the efforts are made on optimizing the methodology for electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide to produce thin film-modified gold electrodes. Under the employed specific conditions, 20 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) are shown to be optimal for superior electrical activation of graphene oxide into electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO). This platform is further used to develop a matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) biosensor, where specific anti-MMP2 aptamers are utilized as a biorecognition element. MMP-2 is a protein which is typically overexpressed in tumor tissues, with important roles in tumor invasion, metastasis as well as in tumor angiogenesis. Based on impedimetric measurements, we were able to detect as low as 3.32 pg/mL of MMP-2 in PBS with a dynamic range of 10 pg/mL - 10 ng/mL. Besides high specificity, ERGO-based aptasensor showed a potential of reuse due to demonstrated successful signal restoration after experimental detection of MMP-2.</description>
