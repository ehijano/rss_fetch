      <title>Generalised anomalies, QCD$_4$, and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the last decade, the notion of an 't Hooft anomaly has been generalised to the case of discrete symmetries. An interesting instance, discussed by Tanizaki, is the mixed anomaly between the discrete axial symmetry and the flavour and baryonic symmetries in massless QCD$_4$. The goal of this note is to provide a derivation of this anomaly from a top-down holographic dual of QCD$_4$. It is found that the topological couplings in the bulk supergravity dual of the D4-D8 system encode Tanizaki's anomaly, once fluctuations around the bulk gauge fields are turned on. A technical challenge for this computation is the difficulty in maintaining gauge invariance of supergravity theories in the presence of D-branes. To overcome this issue, a compact formulation of the flux sector of (massive) type IIA supergravity in the presence of D8 branes is presented. A crucial ingredient in the analysis is the need for smearing the D8 branes, in order to impose $\tau$-shift invariance on the fluctuation ansatz.</description>

      <title>Magnusian: Relating the Eikonal Phase, the On-Shell Action, and the Scattering Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two fundamentally distinct quantities are both called "eikonal" in present amplitudes literature. The unitarity of the S-matrix ensures it can be written as the exponential of a Hermitian operator. The eikonal generator or Magnusian, which is the classical limit of the expectation value of that operator, generates all scattering observables. The leading order classical behavior of the phase of S-matrix elements is called the eikonal phase, and it coincides with the classical on-shell action. We demonstrate that the eikonal generator (Magnusian) and the eikonal phase (classical on-shell action) are inequivalent and find the exact general relationship between them. That relationship explains the special case of integrable scattering in which the two do coincide up to a Legendre transformation and explains why such a correspondence fails in general when spin or radiation are included.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Dyson approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the solution to the Schwinger-Dyson equations in the simple case of the 0-dimensional $\frac{1}{2}m^2 \phi^2 +\frac{\lambda}{4} \phi^4$ theory with $m^2&gt;0$ and $\lambda \geq 0$. We argue that the truncated Schwinger-Dyson equations are solved by rational approximants to all n-point functions $\langle \phi^{2k} \rangle$, and provide strikingly simple recursive relations for them. These rational approximants are constructed without any reference to ordinary perturbative expansions. They turn out to be Pad\'e approximants for $\langle \phi^2 \rangle$ and for half of the truncations in the case of $\langle \phi^4 \rangle$, but they are not Pad\'e approximants for higher n-point functions. This difference is related to the fact that $\langle \phi^2 \rangle$ and $\langle \phi^4 \rangle$ are Stieltjes functions, while higher n-point functions are not. We prove that as the size of the truncation tends to infinity, these rational approximants converge to the full non-perturbative n-point functions for all positive values of the coupling $\lambda$. Thus, in the example studied in this work, these new rational approximants are much easier to derive than the usual Pad\'e approximants, and when different, they are better suited to approximate the full non-perturbative n-point functions.</description>

      <title>Dual holography as functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between the functional renormalization group (RG) and the dual holography framework in the path integral formulation, highlighting how each can be understood as a manifestation of the other. Rather than employing the conventional functional RG formalism, we consider a functional RG equation for the probability distribution function, where the RG flow is governed by a Fokker-Planck-type equation. The central idea is to reformulate the solution of Fokker-Planck type functional RG equation in a path integral representation. Within the semiclassical approximation, this leads to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation for an effective renormalized on-shell action. We then examine our framework for an Einstein-Hilbert action coupled to a scalar field. Applying standard techniques, we derive a corresponding functional RG equation for the distribution function, where the dual holographic path integral serves as its formal solution. By synthesizing these two perspectives, we propose a generalized dual holography framework in which the RG flow is explicitly incorporated into the bulk effective action. This generalization naturally introduces RG $\beta$-functions and reveals that the RG flow of the distribution function is essentially identical to that of the functional RG equation.</description>

      <title>Hearing the Shape of the Universe: A Personal Journey in Noncommutative Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article surveys the noncommutative-geometric (NCG) approach to fundamental physics, in which geometry is encoded spectrally by a generalized Dirac operator and where dynamics arise from the spectral action. I review historically how the simple idea of marrying a Riemannian manifold to a two point space, progressed to lead to the uniqueness of the Standard Model and beyond. I explain how inner fluctuations of the Dirac operator reconstruct the full gauge-Higgs sector of the Standard Model on an almost-commutative space, fixing representations and hypercharges and naturally accommodating right-handed neutrinos and the see-saw mechanism. On the gravitational side, the heat-kernel expansion of the spectral action yields the cosmological constant, Einstein--Hilbert term, and higher-curvature corrections, with volume-quantized variants clarifying the status of $\Lambda$. I discuss the renormalization-group interpretation of the spectral action as a high-scale boundary condition, phenomenological implications for Higgs stability and neutrino masses. I present generalized Heisenberg equation leading to identify the NCG space at unification. I conclude by emphasizing that NCG provides a unified, testable, and geometrically principled quantum framework, linking matter, gauge fields, and gravity.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of Bounce Solutions at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The seminal work of Coleman, Glaser, and Martin established that, at zero temperature, any non-trivial solution to the equations of motion with the least Euclidean action is $O(D)$-symmetric. This paper extends their foundational analysis to finite temperature. We rigorously prove that for a broad class of scalar potentials, any saddle-point configuration with the least action is necessarily $O(D\!-\!1)$-symmetric and monotonic in the spatial directions. This result provides a firm mathematical justification for the symmetry properties widely assumed in studies of thermal vacuum decay and cosmological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>More on (gauged) WZW models over low-dimensional Lie supergroups and their integrable deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In superdimension $(2|2)$ there are only three non-Abelian Lie superalgebras admitting non-degenerate ad-invariant supersymmetric metric, the well-known Lie superalgebra $gl(1|1)$, and two more, $({\C}^3 + \A)$ and $({\C}_0^5 +{\A})$. After a brief review of the construction of the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models based on the $GL(1|1)$ and $(C^3 + A)$ Lie supergroups, we proceed to construct the WZW model on the $({C}_0^5 +{A})$ Lie supergroup. Unfortunately, this model does not include the super Poisson-Lie symmetry. In the following, three new exact conformal field theories of the WZW type are constructed by gauging an anomaly-free subgroup SO(2) of the Lie supergroups mentioned above. The most interesting indication of this work is that the gauged WZW model on the supercoset $(C^3 + A)/$SO(2) has super Poisson-Lie symmetry; most importantly, its dual model is conformally invariant at the one-loop order, and this is presented here for the first time. Finally, in order to study the Yang-Baxter (YB) deformations of the $({C}_0^5 +{A})$ WZW model we obtain the inequivalent solutions of the (modified) graded classical Yang-Baxter equation ((m)GCYBE) for the $({\C}_0^5 +{\A})$ Lie superalgebra. Then, we classify all possible YB deformations for the $({C}_0^5 +{A})$ and settle also the issue of an one-loop conformality of the deformed backgrounds. The classification results are important, in particular in the Lie supergroup case they are rare, much hard technical work was needed to obtain them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple scheme to express the Mellin transform of $D$-dimensional Euclidean conformal bootstrap equation is presented by relating conformal blocks to a Gauss-Grassmann (GG) system due to Gelfand-Graev, associated to conformal integrals, which, in turn, are generalised hypergeometric functions. Usefulness of the expression for obtaining bounds on the spectrum of fields is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>On consistency conditions for strong SRRT inflation in two-field cosmological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the strong version of the consistency conditions for SRRT inflation in general two-field cosmological models. In the fiducial case, this condition is a geometric PDE which relates the scalar field metric and scalar potential of such models. When supplemented by appropriate boundary conditions, this equation determines the scalar field metric in terms of the scalar potential or the other way around, thereby selecting "fiducial" models for strong SRRT inflation. When the scalar potential is given, the equation can be simplified by fixing the conformal class of the scalar field metric, in which case it locally becomes an equation for the conformal factor of that metric when written in isothermal coordinates. We analyze this equation with standard methods of PDE theory, discuss its quasilinearization near a non-degenerate critical point of the scalar potential and extract natural asymptotic conditions for its solutions near such points.</description>

      <title>Learning the Inverse Ryu--Takayanagi Formula with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the inverse problem of holographic entanglement entropy in AdS$_3$ using a data-driven generative model. Training data consist of randomly generated geometries and their holographic entanglement entropies using the Ryu--Takayanagi formula. After training, the Transformer reconstructs the blackening function within our metric ansatz from previously unseen inputs. The Transformer achieves accurate reconstructions on smooth black hole geometries and extrapolates to horizonless backgrounds. We describe the architecture and data generation process, and we quantify accuracy on both $f(z)$ and the reconstructed $S(\ell)$. Code and evaluation scripts are available at the provided repository.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a framework and explicit construction for the regularized measurement of a large class of spacetime-localized observables in bosonic quantum field theory. The measurements fully satisfy relativistic causality and causal transparency, i.e., avoid unphysical superluminal signaling. We show explicitly how the measurement of time-extended observables back-reacts on itself and induces correlations between other measurements in its causal future. Our framework is fully compositional in spacetime and extends previous results on the measurement of instantaneous observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the spectrum of stationary black hole solutions associated with the first non-trivial member of the Dym family of boundary conditions. The analysis combines the holonomy conditions provided by the Chern-Simons formulation of AdS$_3$ gravity with the periodic solutions of the stationary Dym equation. The resulting spacetimes are characterized by two positive real parameters, two positive integers, and a relative phase, generically describing stationary, non-axisymmetric black holes.</description>

      <title>Comment on CFT in AdS and boundary RG flows: O(1/N) Result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper [JHEP 11 (2020) 118], S. Giombi and H. Khanchandani studied the 1/N expansion of the O(N) model in semi-infinite space within the framework of conformal field theory in anti-de Sitter space. They presented a series expansion for the O(1/N) correction to the boundary anomalous dimension in the case of the ordinary transition. Although they were unable to sum the series or simplify its form analytically, they demonstrated numerically that their result matches our earlier, simple analytic expression given in Prog. Theor. Phys. 70 (1983) 1226. In this paper, we show that their series expansion is in fact exactly equivalent to our original expression. However, since the final formula in eq. (4.57) of their paper, which is expressed in terms of two different 3F2 functions, cannot produce the correct values, we derive the correct formulae involving two 3F2 functions in the Appendices. We comment on the similarity and difference between their analysis and ours in the cases of the ordinary and special transitions, and present full details of deriving the anomalous dimension for all the cases including the extraordinary transition, which were not written in our earlier paper.</description>

      <title>The phase of charged Nariai solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we compute the phase of the one-loop Euclidean path integral around charged Nariai solutions in 4 dimensions, including both metric and gauge field fluctuations. These solutions have a $S^{2} \times S^{2}$ geometry, and a magnetic flux in one of the spheres. For charges smaller than a critical value, the phase matches the result for the uncharged Nariai solution, and for charges bigger than that value, the phase is $i^{3}$. Our analytical calculation in the full 4D geometry matches the result obtained recently within a 2D dilaton gravity reduction. Along the way, we also develop a method of dealing with residue zero modes in the de Donder gauge.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate higher-dimensional Lifshitz-type topological static and stationary solutions of $R^2$-corrected gravity theory using the language of differential forms. We obtain new product manifold solutions of the form $Li_{m}\times \Omega_{(n-m)}$ , where $Li_m$ represents an $m$-dimensional Lifshitz type submanifold and $\Omega_{(n-m)}$ denotes $(n-m)$-dimensional compact constant curvature manifold. In addition, we present hyperscaling Lifshitz solutions for arbitrary Lifshitz parameter $ z $. We also discuss some thermodynamical properties of both static and stationary solutions, including extremal cases.</description>

      <title>From BTZ Perturbations to Schwarzian Modes: A Geometrical and Perturbative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a detailed derivation of the Schwarzian modes in the full geometry of the Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole at finite temperature, establishing the precise conditions under which they emerge from the general solution. In addition, we demonstrate that the same modes can be recovered through a purely geometric Kerr-Schild construction. This equivalent approach offers a new geometric understanding of the Schwarzian sector and highlights the correspondence between perturbative and pure geometric approaches, additionally it provides a connection with double copy and double field theory.</description>

      <title>The algebraic structure of the gradient expansion in linearised classical hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically treat the ambiguities that generically arise in the gradient expansion of any hydrodynamic theory. While these ambiguities do not affect the physical content of the equations, they induce two types of transformations in the space of transport coefficients. The first type is known as the 'frame' transformations, and amounts to field redefinitions. The second type, which we introduce and formalise here, we term the 'on-shell' transformations. This identifies equivalence classes of hydrodynamic theories that provide an equally valid low-energy description of the underlying microscopic theory. We show that in any (classical) theory of hydrodynamics (at arbitrary order in derivatives), the action of such transformations on the dispersion relations and two-point correlation functions is universal. We explicitly construct invariants which can then be matched to a microscopic theory. Among them are, expectedly, the low-momentum expansions of the hydrodynamic modes. The (unphysical) gapped modes can, however, be added or removed at will. Finally, we show that such transformations assign a nilpotent Lie group to every hydrodynamic theory, and discuss the related algebraic properties underlying classical hydrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This perspective deals with real scalar fields in two-dimensional spacetime. We focus on models described by one and two real scalar fields, paying closer attention to kinks and lumps, which are localized structures of current interest in high energy physics and in other areas of nonlinear science. We briefly review some of the main results presented in the literature and then focus on some new issues concerning the compact and long-range behavior of solutions and the presence of geometric constraints, suggesting how they can be used in applications in other areas of nonlinear science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Liouville theorem states that classical time evolution is an incompressible flow in phase space. We investigate two formulations of classical mechanics in which this property is manifested. First, the traditional Hamilton-Jacobi theory provides an in-out formalism. Second, a recent idea employing an exponential representation of time evolution provides an in-in formalism. Through concrete examples, it is demonstrated that the on-shell action in the former and the exponential generator in the latter are disparate objects. Still, a concrete relation between the two is identified in terms of a matching calculation. A strictly classical derivation and formulation of classical scattering theory is provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review a new perspective on higher-spin holography, whereby Vasiliev's 4D higher-spin gravity emerges together with a 3D counterpart, consisting of coloured conformal matter fields coupled to topological conformal higher-spin and colour gauge fields, as two distinct reductions, characterised by dual structure groups, of a common parent model. The latter is given by a non-commutative AKSZ sigma model consisting on-shell of a flat superconnection valued in a fractional-spin extension of Fradkin-Vasiliev's higher-spin algebra. In particular, we highlight an intermediate 4D reduction, referred to fractional-spin gravity, consisting of exotic matter, in the form of coloured singletons, coupled to higher-spin and colour gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Study the nature of dynamical dark energy by measuring the CMB polarization rotation angle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) support the dynamical dark energy. Intriguingly, the data favor a transition of the dark energy equation of state across $w=-1$, a hallmark of the Quintom scenario. In this paper, we consider a different approach to the dynamical nature of dark energy by investigating its interaction with ordinary matters, specifically the Chern-Simons (CS) interaction with photons. In cosmology, this interaction rotates the polarized plane of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons, which induces non-zero polarized TB and EB power spectra. We forecast this measurement with the Ali CMB Polarization Telescope (AliCPT) experiment. We take the best-fit value of the isotropic rotation angle from Planck data as our fiducial input. We project that 11 module-year (modyr) of observations will yield an improved detection sensitivity with a significance $\sim 5\sigma$, given a calibration precision of $0.1^\circ$ in the polarization angle. We also forecast AliCPT's sensitivity to the amplitude of a scale invariant spectrum of the anisotropic polarization rotation field. With $50$~modyr of observations, the large-aperture configuration is expected to reach $\sigma_{A_{\mathrm{CB}}}\sim10^{-2}$, offering a sixfold improvement over the small-aperture design and enabling competitive tests of spatial fluctuations in the dark energy field.</description>

      <title>Relativistic MOND Theory from Modified Entropic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a relativistic extension of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) within the framework of entropic gravity by introducing temperature-dependent corrections to the equipartition law on a holographic screen. Starting from a Debye-like modification of the surface degrees of freedom and employing the Unruh relation between acceleration and temperature, we obtain modified Einstein equations in which the geometric sector acquires explicit thermal corrections. Solving these equations for a static, spherically symmetric spacetime in the weak-field, low-temperature regime yields a corrected metric that smoothly approaches Minkowski space at large radii and naturally contains a characteristic acceleration scale. In the very-low-acceleration regime, the model reproduces MOND-like deviations from Newtonian dynamics while providing a relativistic underpinning for that phenomenology. We confront the theory with rotation-curve data for NGC~3198 and perform a Bayesian parameter inference, comparing our relativistic MOND (RMOND) model with both a baryons-only Newtonian model and a dark-matter halo model. We find that RMOND and the dark-matter model both fit the data significantly better than the baryons-only Newtonian prediction, and that RMOND provides particularly improved agreement at $r\gtrsim 20\,\mathrm{kpc}$. These results suggest that temperature-corrected entropic gravity provides a viable relativistic framework for MOND phenomenology, motivating further observational tests, including gravitational lensing and extended galaxy samples.</description>

      <title>Two-body Dirac equation in DSR: results for fermion-antifermion pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates a modified two-body Dirac equation in (2+1)-dimensional spacetime, inspired by Amelino-Camelia's doubly special relativity (DSR). We begin by deriving a covariant two-body Dirac equation that, in the absence of DSR modifications, reduces to a Bessel-type wave equation. Incorporating corrections from the chosen DSR model modifies this wave equation, yielding solutions consistent with established results in the low-energy regime. We demonstrate that the effects of DSR modifications become particularly pronounced at large relative distances. For a coupled fermion-antifermion pair, we derive the modified binding energy solutions. By accounting for first-order Planck-scale corrections, we show that the fine-structure constant \alpha behaves as an energy-dependent running parameter, given by \(\alpha_{eff(E)}/\alpha \approx 1 - \frac{E}{4E_p}\), where E_p is the Planck energy. Binding energy levels are computed using a first-order approximation of the DSR modifications, and the results are applied to positronium-like systems. Our model reveals that DSR modifications induce shifts in the binding energy levels. To the best of our knowledge, DSR-modified two-body equations have not been previously studied. This model is the first of its kind, opening new avenues for further research in this area.</description>

      <title>Quantum enforcement of strong cosmic censorship</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the trace anomaly of quantum field theory is sufficient to enforce strong cosmic censorship in any stationary spacetime with an inner horizon of nonzero surface gravity. In the two-dimensional dilaton reduction of four-dimensional Einstein--Maxwell theory coupled to $N$ conformal fields, the anomaly-induced Polyakov term yields a finite $\langle T_{vv}\rangle \to \frac{N}{48\pi}\kappa_-^2$ near the Cauchy horizon, while the affine-frame energy grows as $T_{kk}\propto e^{2\kappa_- v}$. The resulting tidal blow-up converts the inner horizon into a null, Tipler--strong singularity. The mechanism is local, universal, and state-independent, and extends to Kerr/Kerr--Newman, $\Lambda&gt;0$, and nonsingular interiors. Thus, the trace anomaly is the minimal quantum ingredient restoring strong cosmic censorship.</description>

Abstract: We describe the variety of square-zero elements in the (2,0) super Poincar\'e algebra in ten dimensions, together with its orbit stratification induced by the action of the spin group and R-symmetry. This provides a classification of all possible twisting supercharges of type IIB supergravity in a flat background. Compared to other varieties of square-zero elements in super Poincar\'e algebras, we find that the orbit structure is more involved and exhibits several novel features. Among other things, we show that there are two distinct orbits of holomorphic twisting supercharges and a number of mixed topological-holomorphic twists.</description>

      <title>Grand Unification Higgs-$\mathcal{R}^2$ Inflation: Complementarity between Proton Decay and CMB Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a predictive $SO(10)$ Grand Unified Theory (GUT) framework for cosmic inflation in the Palatini $\mathcal{R}^2$ formulation of gravity. In this model, a GUT Higgs field both drives inflation and induces intermediate-scale symmetry breaking, thereby linking primordial cosmology, gauge unification, and topological defect formation. A partial inflationary phase of $N_I \sim 10$--$17$ $e$-folds following monopole formation can dilute magnetic monopoles to abundances $Y_M \sim 10^{-35}$--$10^{-27}$. The model yields Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) predictions of $0.955 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.974$, accommodating the tensions between Planck-BICEP ($n_s \approx 0.965$) and Planck+ACT ($n_s \approx 0.971$) via $\phi &lt; M$ and $\phi &gt; M$ branches repectively. The predicted tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \lesssim 8\times10^{-4}$ lies within current observational constraints and is accessible to forthcoming experiments, including the Simons Observatory and LiteBIRD. The resulting correlations between the unification scale $M_U$, the inflationary observables $(n_s, r)$, and proton-decay lifetimes highlight a complementarity between CMB measurements and proton-decay searches, with regions of parameter space testable in forthcoming experiments such as Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) results, we revisit chaotic inflation based on a single complex scalar field with mass term $M^2 |\Phi|^2$, which usually predicts a spectra index $n_s\approx 0.96$ but a too-large tensor to scalar ratio $r\approx 0.16$. With radiative corrections, the potential $M^2 |\Phi|^2 \ln \left( |\Phi|^2/\Lambda^2 \right)$ induces spontaneous symmetry breaking near the scale $\Lambda$, yielding a Pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson which can play the role of a quintessence field, hence radiative inflation and dark energy (RIDE). Including a non-minimal coupling to gravity
  $\xi |\Phi|^2 R^2$ reduces $r$, allowing a good fit of the RIDE model to Planck data. Allowing a small additional quartic coupling correction $\lambda |\Phi|^4$ increases both $n_s$ and $r$, with a good fit to ACT data sets achieved for $\xi \approx 1$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The definition of quantum states in terms of tagged vector spaces is generalized to incorporate the spatiotemporal and spin degrees of freedom. Considering a tagged vector space where the index space is a function space, representing the additional degrees of freedom, we obtained axioms for the tags that include a completeness condition expressed in terms of a functional integral with an abstract functional integration measure. Using these axioms, we derive a generating functional for the moments of this functional integration measure. These moments are then used to evaluate the functional integrals of Gaussian functionals, leading to expressions in accordance with those obtained as generalizations of equivalent integrals over a finite number of integration variables. For a Gaussian functional used as a probability distributions, we show that its moments, obtained with this functional integration measure, satisfy Carleman's condition, indicating that the measure is unique.</description>

      <title>Chiral Anomaly of Kogut-Susskind Fermion in (3+1)-dimensional Hamiltonian formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Kogut-Susskind fermions (also known as staggered fermions) in a $(3+1)$-dimensional Hamiltonian formalism and examine a chiral transformation and its associated chiral anomaly. The Hamiltonian of the massless Kogut-Susskind fermion has symmetry under the shift transformations in each space direction $S_k \, (k=1,2,3)$, and the product of the three shift transformations in particular (the odd shifts in general) may be regarded as a unitary discrete chiral transformation, modulo two-site translations. The hermitian part of the transformation kernel $\Gamma = i S_1 S_2 S_3$ can define an axial charge as $Q_A = (1/2)\sum_x \chi^\dagger(x) \left(\Gamma+\Gamma^\dagger \right)\chi(x)$, which is non-onsite, nonquantized, and commutative with the vector charge, analogous to $\tilde{Q}_A = (1/2) \sum_n ( \chi^\dagger_n \chi_{n+1} + \chi^\dagger_{n+1} \chi_{n} )$ for the $(1+1)$ dimensional Kogut-Susskind fermion. However, our $Q_A$ cannot be expressed in terms of any quantized charges in a generalized Onsager algebra. Although $Q_A$ does not commute with the fermion Hamiltonian in general when coupled to background link gauge fields, we show that they become commutative for a class of $U(1)$ link configurations carrying nontrivial magnetic and electric fields. We then verify numerically that the vacuum expectation value of $Q_A$ satisfies the anomalous conservation law of axial charge in the continuum two-flavor theory under an adiabatic evolution of the link gauge field.</description>

      <title>Flavored QCD axion and Modular invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A four-dimensional effective model with $G_{\rm SM}\times SL(2,\mathbb{Z}) \times U(1)_X$ is proposed in string-derived supergravity framework, where $G_{\rm SM}$ is the Standard Model (SM) gauge group and $U(1)_X$ is gauged. We show $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$- and $U(1)_X$-mixed anomalies should vanish. Anomalies induced by K{\"a}hler transformations match those from gaugino chiral rotations. When SM fermions transform nontrivially under $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$, and with vanishing gaugino contributions, the anomaly-free conditions are powerful enough to determine the quark and lepton flavor structures, set scales for $U(1)_X$ breaking, and ensure the strong CP phase remains unmodified. While the Green-Schwarz coefficient $\delta^{\rm GS}_X$ is generically non-zero, vanishing $U(1)_X$ anomalies cause gauge boson decoupling and $\delta^{\rm GS}_X\rightarrow 0$, yielding a massless global $U(1)_X$ without a Nambu-Goldstone mode. We show that the modulus vacuum expectation value stabilizes near $\langle\tau\rangle \approx i$, where exact $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ ($T$-duality) is spontaneously broken, removing residual modular symmetry. The framework predicts seesaw-generated neutrino masses and flavored axion properties, with all Yukawa coefficients constrained to unit-magnitude complex numbers. Our model reproduces current quark and lepton data, predicts an axion mass $m_a=1.82\times10^{-4}$ eV and photon coupling $|g_{a\gamma\gamma}|=1.75\times10^{-14}\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$, and unlike the ordinary case, suppresses flavor-violating axion couplings to $s,d$ quarks and $\mu,e$ leptons to $\mathcal{O}(\lambda^4)$ (with $\lambda$ the Cabibbo angle). It also yields normal neutrino mass hierarchy consistent with oscillation data, $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay rate, and cosmological and astrophysical measurements.</description>

      <title>Inflationary models in $f(R,T)$ gravity: Constraints from $Planck$, BICEP/$Keck$, and Atacama</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of high-precision cosmological observations has challenged many traditional inflationary models. Data from $Planck$ 2018 along with the BICEP/$Keck$ 2018 result have already ruled out most of the established models by placing tight constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Upcoming missions like LiteBIRD &amp; CMB-S4 are expected to impose an even more stringent bound on $r$ , potentially excluding further models from the viable landscape. In this evolving observational context, modified gravity theories offer a promising way to reconcile inflationary models with data. In this work, we explore several inflationary models, namely mutated hilltop inflation, D-brane inflation, and Woods-Saxon inflation, within the framework of $f(R, T)$ gravity. The cosmological observable parameters, viz. scalar spectral tilt $n_s$, tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and running of scalar spectral index $n_{sk}$ are estimated for the three models, and their trajectories are plotted in the $n_s-r$ plane. The model results are evaluated in light of the $Planck$, BICEP/$Keck$, DESI DR2, and ACT DR6 data. We observe that for a certain model parameter space, these potentials are viable within the current observational bounds.</description>

      <title>The Geometric View of Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent critiques of the semantic conception of scientific theories suggest that a theory is not best formulated as a collection of models satisfying some set of kinematical or dynamical conditions. Thus it has been argued that additional structure on the set of models is required. Furthermore, there are calls for developing a 'theory of theories', where what was formerly a 'theory' is seen as a 'model' within a larger theoretical structure. This paper makes a two-pronged proposal for the "shape" that physical theories should take, based on recent insights on dualities and quasi-dualities in physics. First, I develop a geometric view of theories, according to which a physical theory is a set of models with topological and geometric structure on it. This general view is briefly illustrated in an example from quantum cosmology. Second, I make a more specific proposal for a natural structure that can encompass various 'theories' as its models, with topological and algebraic-geometric structure on them. I call the latter more specific structure a 'model bundle', where the models are in the fibres and there is a moduli space in the base. I illustrate my second proposal in the Seiberg-Witten theory (Seiberg and Witten, 1994a,b), where the moduli space is the complex plane with three punctures, the states and quantities are in the fibres, and the modular group is the structure group that acts on the fibres. This view highlights the important role of quasi-dualities as local transition functions between fibres; dualities are recovered as global transition functions when the bundle is trivial. I discuss some philosophical issues that this geometric view of physical theories opens up, such as its realist interpretation.</description>

      <title>On the Validity of the Background Subtraction Method for Black Hole Thermodynamics in Matter-Coupled Gravity Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The background subtraction method has long served as a practical tool for computing the Euclidean action and thermodynamic quantities of black holes. While its equivalence to the Iyer-Wald formalism is well understood in pure gravity theories, its validity in matter-coupled theories remains less clear and has even been questioned in the literature. In this work, we revisit this issue and demonstrate that the equivalence between the Euclidean action method and the Iyer-Wald formalism persists in matter-coupled scenarios. We apply the resulting formulation to two representative examples of such theories, and in both cases, the Euclidean approach performs smoothly. We further identify situations where the method may encounter subtleties due to the special properties of certain matter fields. Our results clarify when background subtraction remains reliable beyond pure gravity and when additional care is necessary.</description>

      <title>The poltergeist mechanism - Enhancement of scalar-induced gravitational waves with early matter-dominated era -</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves induced by primordial density perturbations provide a powerful probe of the Universe's thermal history, which may include an early matter-dominated (eMD) era predicted by well-motivated particle-physics models. The induced GWs can be significantly enhanced when the Universe undergoes a sudden transition from an eMD era to an era with pressure, such as a radiation or kination era. This enhancement arises from the growth of density perturbations during the eMD era and their rapid oscillations during the era with pressure. This phenomenon is called the poltergeist mechanism. In this review, we explain the essence of the poltergeist mechanism and explore concrete scenarios in which such an enhancement can occur.</description>

Abstract: We consider the transverse momentum ($q_T$) distribution of neutral charged bosons at hadron colliders. We perform the resummation of the logarithmically-enhanced effects due to simultaneous QCD and QED initial-state radiation, up to mixed next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy. We study the impact of such mixed QCD$\otimes$QED resummed contributions on top of pure QCD corrections, finding percent-level effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05815v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the operator algebra of extended conformal defects in more than two spacetime dimensions. Such algebra structure encodes the combined effect of multiple impurities on physical observables at long distances as well as the interactions among the impurities. These features are formalized by a fusion product which we define for a pair of defects, after isolating divergences that capture the effective potential between the defects, which generalizes the usual Casimir energy. We discuss general properties of the corresponding fusion algebra and contrast with the more familiar cases that involve topological defects. We also describe the relation to a different defect setup in the shape of a wedge. We provide explicit examples to illustrate these properties using line defects and interfaces in the Wilson-Fisher CFT and the Gross-Neveu(-Yukawa) CFT and determine the defect fusion data thereof.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Pair Creation in Spin Noncommutative of Coordinates: Volkov Background and Constant Electric Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of vacuum pair creation for Dirac fermions subjected to a Volkov plane wave and a constant electric field within the framework of spin noncommutativity of coordinates. Employing the Schwinger proper-time formalism, we derive the effective action and obtain closed-form expressions for the pair creation probability. Our analysis reveals that, in the presence of a Volkov plane wave background, the pair production probability remains zero-even with spin noncommutativity. In contrast, for a constant electric field in $(1+1)$-dimensional spacetime, the spin-induced noncommutative deformation significantly enhances the pair creation probability. Remarkably, we identify a critical value of the deformation parameter, $\ell = \frac{m}{eE}$, at which the pair creation probability diverges, indicating a potential vacuum instability or a breakdown of the perturbative regime. These findings underscore the nontrivial role of spin noncommutativity in nonperturbative quantum electrodynamics and offer novel insights for future studies in strong-field physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Newton-Cartan geometry to the kinetic theory of gases that includes non-relativistic gravitational effects and the principle of general covariance. Starting with an introduction to the basics of Newton-Cartan geometry, we examine the motion of point particles within this framework, leading to a detailed analysis of kinetic theory and the derivation of conservation equations. The equilibrium distribution function is explored, and the example of a rotating gas in a gravitational field is discussed. Further, we develop covariant hydrodynamic equations and extend our analysis through a gradient expansion approach to assess first-order constitutive relations for rotating gases. Finally, we address the frame-dependence paradox, presenting a novel resolution that addresses apparent discrepancies. Our construction resolves a fifty-year-old debate about the frame-indifferent formulation of kinetic theory. The resolution is presented in a modern, symmetry-based approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a composite defect system where a lower-dimensional defect (sub-defect) is embedded to a higher-dimensional one, and examine renormalization group (RG) flows localized on the defect. A composite defect is constructed in the $(3-\epsilon)$-dimensional free $\text{O}(N)$ vector model with line and surface interactions by triggering localized RG flows to non-trivial IR fixed points. Focusing on the case where the symmetry group $\text{O}(N)$ is broken to a subgroup $\text{O}(m)\times\text{O}(N-m)$ on the line defect, there is an $\text{O}(N)$ symmetric fixed point for all $N$, while two additional $\text{O}(N)$ symmetry breaking ones appear for $N\ge 23$. We also examine a $\mathcal{C}$-theorem for localized RG flows along the sub-defect and show that the $\mathcal{C}$-theorem holds in our model by perturbative calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics requires a hermitian inner product &lt;~,~&gt; -- linear in one variable, antilinear in the other -- while the inner product (~,~) that comes most naturally from Euclidean path integrals is linear in each variable. Here we discuss the relation between the two inner products. In a theory with no time-reversal or reflection symmetry, they differ by an operator that complex conjugates the wavefunction and reverses the orientation of space; in the presence of reflection and time-reversal symmetry, space is unoriented so such an operator cannot be defined, but the time-reversal symmetry T is available instead and plays the same role.</description>

Focusing on self-dual Yang-Mills theory in Bondi coordinates, we demonstrate that imposing the homotopy algebra relations naturally yields the physically consistent fall-off behavior of the fields near $\mathcal{I^+}$. Furthermore, we employ this framework to systematically construct kinematic algebras, uncovering novel infinite families of such algebras that satisfy the Jacobi identity on slices near $\mathcal{I^+}$.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of two one-form topological matter fields minimally coupled to first-order gravity in three-dimensional spacetime using the Dirac Hamiltonian formalism. Working in the full phase space, we systematically identify the complete set of constraints of the system, classify them into first- and second-class, and compute their Poisson bracket algebra. The constraint analysis confirms the absence of physical degrees of freedom, consistent with the system's topological character. Furthermore, we construct the generating functional for gauge transformations and demonstrate that, with appropriate gauge parameter mappings, these transformations recover the full diffeomorphism and Poincar\'e symmetries of the theory. Finally, we explicitly compute the Dirac brackets, establishing the symplectic structure of the reduced phase space.</description>

Abstract: We investigate (-1)-form symmetries using the framework of symmetry topological field theories. Previous studies of (-1)-form symmetries have primarily focused on SymTFTs with topological point operators. Here we examine SymTFTs devoid of point operators, constructed to realize zero-form symmetries of some physical theory. In this context we identify codimension-one defects within the bulk of SymTFT constructed via higher gauging which can be interpreted as the generators of the (-1)-form symmetry of the absolute theory. In addition, we present examples where (-1)-form symmetries exhibit the novel ability to shift the 't Hooft anomalies of the theory.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present two brane-world-type solutions in a two-dimensional (2D) dilaton gravity model with singular space-time backgrounds. By employing a first-order superpotential formalism, we first construct the 2D analogues of the thick brane solution previously given by Gremm and analyze the corresponding linear scalar perturbations. We show that for a model with canonical scalar matter fields, the effective potential of the linear perturbation equation is a singular P\"oschl--Teller~II type, which does not admit bound states. However, for a model with non-canonical scalar fields, the effective potential becomes an exactly solvable P\"oschl--Teller~I potential, which has an infinite tower of normalizable bound states. We also present a second analytic solution inspired by the work of Girardello \emph{et al.}, but with non-canonical scalar field. In this case, the linear perturbation equation is a Schr\"odinger equation with the Eckart potential, which is also exactly solvable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the construction of correlation numbers in super minimal Liouville gravity. In particular, we construct the fundamental physical fields in the Ramond sector and compute the three-point correlation number involving two physical fields in the Ramond sector and one in the NS sector. Furthermore, we establish the relation between Ramond physical fields and the elements of the ground ring. Using the higher equations of motion of super Liouville theory, this relation leads to a new representation of the Ramond physical fields. This formulation enables a direct analytic computation of correlation numbers involving Ramond field insertions. As an application, we demonstrate the method in the simplest case of a three-point correlation function.</description>

      <title>Gravitomagnetism from Temporal Dimensional Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that the Taub-NUT metric can be envisaged as a (3+1) dimensional analog of the Kaluza-Klein (4+1) dimensional metric. After dimensional reduction of the Taub-NUT metric to (3) spatial dimensions, by treating time as the extra curled dimension (since the closed time-like curves can exist in the Taub-NUT framework, such a dimensional reduction is justified), we end up with three dimensional Einstein field equations plus the Maxwell equations for the gravitomagnetic field, which also acts as a source to Einstein field equations. Hence, the Taub-NUT metric unifies gravity and the NUT charge related gavitomagnetism in four dimensions, at the same footing the Kaluza-Klein metric unifies gravity and electromagnetism in five dimensions. We also find an interesting relation between the four dimensional gravitational constant and the Taub-NUT charge. The results are derived from classical field equations in Lorentzian signature.</description>

      <title>Infrared Divergence in QED and the Fluctuation of Electromagnetic Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit infrared divergences in QED using a Fock space formulation and relate them to electromagnetic field fluctuations. We contrast this with both Faddeev--Kulish dressing and Morikawa's stochastic separation: gauge invariance enforces Bloch--Nordieck/Kinoshita--Lee--Nauenberg cancellation via coherent soft phases, whereas stochastic coarse-graining breaks this coherence. Callen--Welton fluctuations (Fluctuation--Dissipation Theorem) are quantum-coherent and do not justify Langevin noise for gauge fields, even in de~Sitter (Maxwell equations remain conformally invariant in four dimensions).</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in Lifshitz-type Dirac Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Krylov complexity in Lifshitz-type Dirac field theories with a generic dynamical critical exponent $z$. By computing the Lanczos coefficients for massless and massive cases, we analyze the growth and saturation behavior of Krylov complexity in different regimes. We incorporate a hard UV cutoff and investigate the effects of lattice discretization, revealing fundamental differences between continuum and lattice models. In the presence of a UV cutoff, Krylov complexity exhibits an initial exponential growth followed by a linear regime, with saturation values of the Lanczos coefficients dictated by the cutoff scale. For the lattice model, we find a fundamental departure from the continuum case: due to the finite Krylov basis, Krylov complexity saturates rather than growing indefinitely. Our findings suggest that Lifshitz scaling influences operator growth and information spreading in quantum systems. We further find that increasing the Lifshitz exponent $z$ suppresses Krylov complexity, entropy, and Lanczos growth in both massless and massive cases, while enhancing K-variance. This trend reverses under a hard UV cutoff, where complexity and entropy increase with $z$. In lattice models, early-time complexity and $b_n$ decay shift with $z$, echoing the continuum behavior of massive and massless regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the ``complexity equals anything" proposal with codimension-one and codimension-zero gravitational observables for multi-horizon black holes, using the Bardeen-AdS class black hole as an example. In particular, we compare the results with the ``complexity equals volume" (CV) proposal and find that the ``complexity equals anything" ($\mathcal{C}_{\text{gen}}$) enables the probing of a more complete black hole interior, that is, all spacetime regions where the blackening factor $f(r)&lt;0$. This is the advantage brought by the flexibility of this holographic complexity conjecture. In addition, we compute the complexity derived from various geometric quantities and show that these constructions can effectively differentiate the distinct interior regions of the black hole.</description>

Abstract: In the critical bosonic string theory, we explicitly evaluate the three point scattering amplitude at tree level, of a photon with two massive higher spins. The massive excitations belong to states of the form $A_{-r_1}^{s_1} A_{-r_2}^{s_2}$ where $A_{-n}$ is a DDF creation operator. Next, we take the infinite ``spin'' limit to arrive at the classical string dynamics. We find a rotating ``floppy'' string lying mostly on a plane which develops a transverse kink.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify new families of duality-invariant theories of electrodynamics. We achieve this in two different ways. On the one hand, we present an algorithm to construct a one-parameter family of exactly duality-invariant theories from a single seed duality-invariant theory. If the seed theory is causal, the theories constructed from this method will also be causal when the parameter is non-negative. On the other hand, we find two additional novel families of duality-invariant theories which include a nonzero term independent of the electromagnetic field. The first of them generalizes Bialynicki-Birula electrodynamics, while the second family of theories features a well-defined Maxwell limit as the term independent of the gauge field strength is sent to zero.</description>

Abstract: We consider a class of two-dimensional dilaton gravity models with linear dilaton vacuum including Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger (CGHS) model as the special case. General thermodynamic properties of black holes in such models are evaluated. We focus on the CGHS model and its modification with regular black holes as empty-space solutions characterized by ever-present finite curvature. We find generalized entanglement entropy blows-up for near-extremal regular black holes considered as remnants. That signalling a possible breakdown of the semiclassical approximation near the endpoint of evaporation. We conjecture that remnants are unstable and decay by quantum fluctuations into horizonless spacetimes. We give an estimate for the decay amplitude by using a semiclassical regularization method and propose a path to mitigate the unitarity loss problem.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Suppression Due to Black Hole Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23729v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the evolution of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional conformal field theory with a holographic dual. Specifically, we are interested in a class of excited states produced by a combination of pure-state (local operator) and mixed-state local quenches. We employ a method that allows us to determine the full time evolution analytically. While a single insertion of a local operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the presence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant bump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the quenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the quenches. This work sheds light on the interesting properties of gravitational scattering involving black holes.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Mass/Charge Relation and Weak No-hair Theorem Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14158v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Einstein gravity minimally coupled to two Maxwell fields and one (real) dilaton scalar. We study the electrically-charged spherically-symmetric and static solutions that are asymptotic to Minkowski spacetime. General solutions are described by four independent parameters: mass $M$, two electric charges $(Q_1,Q_2)$ and the scalar charge $\Sigma$. For black holes, the scalar charge is not independent, but a function of $(M,Q_1,Q_2)$. We provide a set of formulae relating the mass to the charges, which allows us to determine $\Sigma(M,Q_1,Q_2)$ without having to solve the black hole equations. Our results confirm the weaker version of the no-hair theorem conjecture involving one real scalar: it can be turned on in a black hole, but it does not have a continuous independent hairy parameter.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and observational implications of black holes in toroidal geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic and observational implications for the charged torus-like black holes, a class of solutions distinct from the classical Schwarzschild black holes. We explicitly derive the fundamental thermodynamic properties, such as heat capacity, P-V diagram, isothermal compressibility, Helmholtz free energy, and Gibbs free energy, under different entropy models. We find that only the exponential corrected entropy demonstrates multiple phase transitions, which we validate with the Ricci Scalar divergence obtained from the Ruppeiner formalism. This indicates that exponential corrected entropy is more sensitive to BH's microstructure as compared to the Hawking-Bekenstein and R\`{e}nyi entropy models. In addition, we study the sparsity and emission rates of Hawking radiation, demonstrating that exponential correction entropy yields more consistent and stable behavior. In our observational analysis, we graphically demonstrate the behavior of redshift, blueshift, and gravitational shift, and identify specific conditions where the photon sphere radius exceeds the innermost stable circular orbit radius, which depends on the values of parameters such as electric charge and cosmological constant. The novel insight of this work is that despite this violation, our computed redshift, blueshift, and gravitational shifts fall within the range of the observational data of NGC 4258 and UGC 3789.</description>

      <title>Dimensional reduction of the M-theory Chern-Simons term at order $\ell_p^6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dimensional reduction of M-theory couplings at order $\ell_p^6$ is known to produce one-loop $\alpha'^3$ corrections in type IIA string theory. In this paper, we perform the Kaluza-Klein reduction of the M-theory Chern-Simons coupling $t_8\epsilon_{11} A R^4$ at this order. By meticulously accounting for non-gauge-invariant total derivative terms, we derive the complete set of corresponding one-loop, gauge-invariant couplings in the type IIA effective action. Our results not only reproduce the standard Chern-Simons term $t_8\epsilon_{10} B R^4$ which is gauge invariant up to total derivatives, but also unveil a new set of gauge-invariant couplings involving RR and NS-NS field strengths.
  To validate our findings, we test their consistency under string dualities. We dimensionally reduce the derived type IIA couplings on a K3 manifold and show that the resulting one-loop $\alpha'$ corrections in six dimensions transform under S-duality into the dimensional reduction of the tree-level heterotic string Chern-Simons coupling $H_{\mu\nu\alpha} \Omega^{\mu\nu\alpha}$ on $T^4$. This non-trivial agreement provides strong evidence for the correctness of both the M-theory Chern-Simons term and its reduction to type IIA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the aim of looking for signatures of deconfinement, the poles and the spectral function of the Landau-gauge gluon propagator are investigated at one loop, vanishing spatial momentum and finite temperature within the framework of the screened massive expansion of pure Yang-Mills theory and of full QCD. When computed using both temperature-independent parameters optimized by principles of gauge invariance and temperature-dependent parameters obtained by fitting lattice data at zero Matsubara frequency, the propagator is found to have a pair of complex-conjugate poles in its squared complexified frequency variable throughout the considered temperature interval, ranging from $T=0$ to temperatures $T&gt;T_{c}$ of interest to quark-gluon plasma phenomenology. The spectral function is found to violate positivity and not to develop sharp peaks over said temperature interval. In full QCD, a simple model is used for mass generation in the infrared quark sector; the dependence of our results on the quark masses is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The crucial role of hydrodynamic instabilities in soliton field theory is revealed. We demonstrate that the essential of soliton formation mechanism is the sound mode instability induced by thermodynamic instability. This instability triggers phase separation, where new thermal phases are generated to produce solitons. These solitons can be regarded as a coexistence state composed of a matter phase and a vacuum phase, with an interface providing surface tension to maintain dynamical equilibrium. The phase separation mechanism naturally allows the existence of vacuum bubbles, characterized by a vacuum phase surrounded by a matter phase with negative pressure. Furthermore, we show that the soliton interface resembles a fluid membrane, whose interface pressure satisfies a Young-Laplace-type relation, resulting in the emergence of the membrane instability induced by surface tension. In the thin-wall limit, the dispersion relation is analytically derived. This instability triggers topological transition of the interface, splitting a cylindrical interface into multiple spheres with a smaller total surface area. Such results highlight the duality between solitons and fluids, providing a field theory description for hydrodynamics with interfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interior of AdS black holes under finite shear strain in a class of holographic axion models, which are widely used to describe strongly-coupled systems with broken translations. We demonstrate that the shear anisotropy necessarily eliminates the inner Cauchy horizon, such that the deformed black hole approaches a space like singularity. The anisotropic effect induced by the axion fields triggers a collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge at the would-be Cauchy horizon, accompanied by a rapid change in the anisotropy of the spatial geometry. In addition, for a power-law axion potential, sufficiently large shear deformations give rise to a domain wall solution that includes a Lifshitz like scaling geometry near the boundary as well as a near horizon Kasner epoch with the Kasner exponents determined by the powers of the potential. Finally, we find that the interior dynamics of black holes generally enter an era described by an anisotropic Kasner universe at later interior time. Depending on the form of the potential, they either tend to stable Kasner universes, or exhibit an endless alternation of different Kasner epochs toward the singularity.</description>

Abstract: We first streamline the construction of the unique six-dimensional conformal gravity action found by L\"u, Pang and Pope, that admits Einstein metrics as solutions to the field equations. We then prove that there exists a unique eight-dimensional conformal gravity action that admits Einstein metrics as solutions to the field equations, and explicitly build the corresponding action. Finally, we relate these results to Branson's Q-curvature and the Fefferman-Graham obstruction tensor, to conclude that on every even-dimensional space there exists a unique -- up to boundary terms -- conformally-invariant gravity theory that is extremised by Einstein metrics.</description>

      <title>Fermi Surface Bosonization for Non-Fermi Liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14955v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding non-Fermi liquids in dimensions higher than one remains one of the most formidable challenges in modern condensed matter physics. These systems, characterized by an abundance of gapless degrees of freedom and the absence of well-defined quasiparticles, defy conventional analytical frameworks. Inspired by recent work [Delacretaz, Du, Mehta, and Son, Physical Review Research, 4, 033131 (2022)], we present a procedure for bosonizing Fermi surfaces that does not rely on the existence of sharp excitation and is thus directly applicable to non-Fermi liquids. Our method involves parameterizing the generalized fermionic distribution function through a bosonic field that describes frequency-dependent local variations of the chemical potential in momentum space. We propose an effective action that produces the collisionless quantum Boltzmann equation as its equation of motion and can be used for any dimension and Fermi surface of interest. Even at the quadratic order, this action reproduces non-trivial results obtainable only through involved analysis with alternative means. By offering an alternative method directly applicable to studying the low-energy physics of Fermi and non-Fermi liquids, our work potentially stands as an important building block in advancing the comprehension of strange metals and associated phenomena.</description>

      <title>An observational signature for extremal black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider scalar perturbations of the Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m family and the Kerr family. We derive a characteristic expression of the radiation field, at any given unit solid angle of future null infinity, and numerically show that its amplitude gets excited only in the extremal case. Our work, therefore, identifies an observational signature for extremal black holes. Moreover, we show that the source of the excitation is the extremal horizon instability and its magnitude is exactly equal to the conserved horizon charge.</description>

      <title>Roughness and critical force for depinning at 3-loop order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $d$-dimensional elastic manifold at depinning is described by a renormalized field theory, based on the Functional Renormalization Group (FRG). Here we analyze this theory to 3-loop order, equivalent to third order in $\epsilon=4-d$, where $d$ is the internal dimension. The critical exponent reads $\zeta = \frac \epsilon3 + 0.04777 \epsilon^2 -0.068354 \epsilon^3 + {\cal O}(\epsilon^4)$. Using that $\zeta(d=0)=2^-$, we estimate $\zeta(d=1)=1.266(20)$, $\zeta(d=2)=0.752(1)$ and $\zeta(d=3)=0.357(1)$. For Gaussian disorder, the pinning force per site is estimated as $f_{\rm c}= {\cal B} m^{2}\rho_m + f_{\rm c}^0$, where $m^2$ is the strength of the confining potential, $\cal B$ a universal amplitude, $\rho_m$ the correlation length of the disorder, and $f_{\rm c}^0$ a non-universal lattice dependent term. For charge-density waves, we find a mapping to the standard $\phi^4$-theory with $O(n)$ symmetry in the limit of $n\to -2$. This gives $f_{\rm c} = \tilde {\cal A}(d) m^2 \ln (m) + f_{\rm c}^0 $, with $\tilde {\cal A}(d) = -\partial_n \big[\nu(d,n)^{-1}+\eta(d,n)\big]_{n=-2}$, reminiscent of log-CFTs.</description>

      <title>Lattice Models for Phases and Transitions with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05964v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-invertible categorical symmetries have emerged as a powerful tool to uncover new beyond-Landau phases of matter, both gapped and gapless, along with second order phase transitions between them. The general theory of such phases in (1+1)d has been studied using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), also known as topological holography. This has unearthed the infrared (IR) structure of these phases and transitions. In this paper, we describe how the SymTFT information can be converted into an ultraviolet (UV) anyonic chain lattice model realizing, in the IR limit, these phases and transitions. In many cases, the Hilbert space of the anyonic chain is tensor product decomposable and the model can be realized as a quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian. We also describe operators acting on the lattice models that are charged under non-invertible symmetries and act as order parameters for the phases and transitions. In order to fully describe the action of non-invertible symmetries, it is crucial to understand the symmetry twisted sectors of the lattice models, which we describe in detail. Throughout the paper, we illustrate the general concepts using the symmetry category $\mathsf{Rep}(S_3)$ formed by representations of the permutation group $S_3$, but our procedure can be applied to any fusion category symmetry.</description>

      <title>Geometric expansion of fluctuations and average shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08364v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations of observables provide unique insights into the nature of physical systems, and their study stands as a cornerstone of both theoretical and experimental science. Generalized fluctuations, or cumulants, provide information beyond the mean and variance of an observable. In this paper, we develop a systematic method to determine the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of local observables as the region becomes large. Our analysis reveals that the expansion is closely tied to the geometric characteristics of the region and its boundary, with coefficients given by convex moments of the connected correlation function: the latter is integrated against intrinsic volumes of convex polytopes built from the coordinates, which can be interpreted as average shadows. A particular application of our method shows that, in two dimensions, the leading behavior of odd cumulants of conserved quantities is topological, specifically depending on the Euler characteristic of the region. We illustrate these results with the paradigmatic strongly-interacting system of two-dimensional quantum Hall state at filling fraction $1/2$, by performing Monte-Carlo calculations of the skewness (third cumulant) of particle number in the Laughlin state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03557v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Kashaev and the first author defined a sequence $V_n$ of 2-variable
  knot polynomials with integer coefficients, coming from the $R$-matrix of a rank
  2 Nichols algebra, the first polynomial been identified with the Links--Gould
  polynomial. In this note we present the results of the computation of the
  $V_n$-polynomials for $n=1,2,3,4$. This leads to the discovery of emerging patterns,
  including the genus bound for $V_2$ being an equality for all 58 million
  knots with at most $18$ crossings, as well as
  unexpected Conway mutations that seem undetected by the $V_n$-polynomials
  as well as by Heegaard Floer Homology and Khovanov Homology.</description>

      <title>Regulating Sommerfeld resonances for multi-state systems and higher partial waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18168v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-range attractive interactions between dark matter particles can significantly enhance their annihilation, particularly at low velocities. This ``Sommerfeld enhancement'' is typically computed by evaluating the deformation of the two-particle wavefunction due to the long-range potential, while ignoring the physics associated with the annihilation, and then scaling the appropriate annihilation matrix elements by factors that depend on the wavefunction in the limit where the particles approach zero relative separation. It has long been recognized that this approach is a valid approximation only in the limit where the annihilation rate is small, and breaks down in the regime where the enhanced annihilation rate approaches the unitarity bound, in which case ignoring the impact of the annihilation physics on the two-particle wavefunction cannot be justified and leads to apparent violations of unitarity. In the case where the physics relevant to annihilation occurs at a parametrically shorter distance scale (higher energy scale) compared with the long-range potential, we provide a simple prescription for correcting the Sommerfeld enhancement for the effects of the short-range physics, valid for all partial waves and for systems where multiple states are coupled by the long-range potential.</description>

      <title>Mutated hilltop inflation in light of Planck/ACT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, a single field inflationary model driven by a mutated hilltop potential, a subclass of the hilltop models of inflation, is investigated. To constrain the parameter space, we employ the latest $r-n_{\rm s}$ constraints from Planck 2018, BICEP/Keck 2018, and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data, alongside reheating parameters $N_{\rm{re}}$, $T_{\rm{re}}$, and $\omega_{\rm{re}}$, and the model independent bound on the radiation dominated (RD) era $N_{\rm{rd}}$. Furthermore, the relic gravitational wave (GW) spectrum within the sensitivity domains of future GW detectors are analyzed. By combining CMB, reheating, RD era, and GW constraints, we find for the Planck+BK18 data that the inflationary duration is confined to $46 \leq N \leq 56$ (95\% CL) and $48.1 \leq N \leq 56$ (68\% CL). Moreover, the model parameter $\alpha$ is confined to $0.161 \leq \alpha \leq 0.890$ (95\% CL) and $0.217 \leq \alpha \leq 0.815$ (68\% CL). Inclusion of the ACT data further tighten the constraints to $54 \leq N \leq 56$ (95\% CL) and $0.29 \leq \alpha \leq 0.62$ (95\% CL), thereby enhancing the precision and robustness of the model predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11856v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the QCD vacuum, the nucleon form factors receive contributions from the underlying ensemble of topological pseudoparticles, which are sensitive to a finite vacuum angle $\theta$. We use this observation to derive a novel relationship between the Pauli and electric dipole form factors, for light quark flavors. This relationship allows for an explicit derivation of the proton and neutron electric dipole moments induced by a small CP violating $\theta$ angle, in terms of the vacuum topological susceptibity times pertinent magnetic moments. The results compare well with some recent lattice estimates.</description>

Abstract: We present a new rotating black hole solution to the Einstein equations as an extension of the Kerr spacetime. Interestingly, the solution we find may not be uniquely characterized by asymptotic parameters such as mass, angular momentum, and charge, thereby it would be the additional hair. We also analyze in detail how this additional characteristics or this hair affects the thermodynamic properties of the black hole.</description>

      <title>A conservative solution to the Singularity Problem in Classical GR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a conservative approach to the black hole singularity problem that remains within the framework of classical General Relativity (GR) supplemented by semiclassical quantum field theory (QFT). Our construction replaces the singular interior of a black hole with a null characteristic hypersurface that carries the exterior ADM data. The excised singular interior is replaced by a conformally flat bubble manifold. We assume the characteristic data on $\Sigma$ are shear-quiet (vanishing Bondi news and shear to leading order) so that the initial development is conformally flat (Weyl = 0) over an early epoch. We further posit that the ingoing Hawking radiation flux provides statistically isotropic initial conditions on the bubble boundary, seeding a nearly FLRW-like epoch without first undergoing exponential inflation. The overall framework is consistent with the generalized second law of thermodynamics and offers a possible resolution of the singularity problem without invoking a full theory of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Generic deformation channels for critical Fermi surfaces including the impact of collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper constitutes a sequel to our theoretical efforts to determine the nature of generic low-energy deformations of the Fermi surface of a quantum-critical metal, which arises at the stable non-Fermi liquid (NFL) fixed point of a quantum phase transition. The emergent critical Fermi surface, arising right at the Ising-nematic quantum critical point (QCP), is a paradigmatic example where an NFL behaviour is induced by the strong interactions of the fermionic degrees of freedom with those of the bosonic order parameter. It is an artifact of the bosonic modes becoming massless at the QCP, thus undergoing Landau-damping at the level of one-loop self-energy. We resort to the well-tested formalism of the quantum Boltzmann equations (QBEs) for identifying the excitations. While in our earlier works, we have focused on the collisionless regime by neglecting the collision integral and assuming the bosons to be in equilibrium, here we embark on a full analysis. In particular, we take into account the bosonic part of the QBEs as well, which, however, turn out to have no effect on the solutions. Decomposing the master equation into angular-momentum ($\ell$) channels, the emergent modes are of two types: Fermi-surface deformations with discrete spectra and particle-hole excitations forming a continuous band. The long-lived zero-sound mode, which corresponds to $\ell = 0$, is found to be robust against damping effects. Intriguingly, we have an infinite family of discrete modes corresponding to higher-order harmonics of the net deformation.</description>

      <title>A Centrality-independent Framework for Revealing Genuine Higher-Order Cumulants in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel centrality definition-independent method for analyzing higher-order cumulants, specifically addressing the challenge of volume fluctuations that dominate in low-energy heavy-ion collisions. This method reconstructs particle number distributions using the Edgeworth expansion, with parameters optimized via a combination of differential evolution algorithm and Bayesian inference. Its effectiveness is validated using UrQMD model simulations and benchmarked against traditional approaches, including centrality definitions based on particle multiplicity. Our results show that the proposed framework yields cumulant patterns consistent with those obtained using number of participant nucleon ($N_{\text{part}}$) based centrality observables, while eliminating the conventional reliance on centrality determination. This consistency confirms the method's ability to extract genuine physical signals, thereby paving the way for probing the intrinsic thermodynamic properties of the produced medium through event-by-event fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes from EFT of Black Hole Perturbations in Vector-Tensor Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of odd-parity perturbations on a static and spherically symmetric black hole background with a timelike vector field based on the effective field theory (EFT) approach. We derive the quadratic Lagrangian written in terms of two master variables, corresponding to the tensor and vector gravitons, which are coupled in general, while they can be decoupled on a stealth Schwarzschild(-de Sitter) background. For the stealth Schwarzschild background, we find that the quasinormal mode frequencies for both degrees of freedom are obtained from those in general relativity by simple scaling. Nonetheless, due to the fact that the metric perturbation is a non-trivial linear combination of the two degrees of freedom with different QNM spectra, the ringdown gravitational waves may exhibit characteristic modulation that can in principle be a signature of vector-tensor gravity.</description>

      <title>Properties of Pair Plasmas Emerging from Electromagnetic Showers in Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic showers from high-energy electron beams interacting with a target are a promising path to creating pair plasmas in the laboratory. Here, we solve analytically the kinetic equations describing this process. Two regimes are defined by the ratio of the target thickness $L$ to the shower length $L_{\rm{sh}}$, which depends on the electron energy and target composition. For thin targets ($L &lt; L_{\rm{sh}}$), we derive explicit expressions for the spectra of produced photons and pairs, as well as the number of pairs. For thick targets ($L &gt; L_{\rm{sh}}$), we obtain the total pair number and photon spectrum. Analytical results agree well with Geant4 simulations, and it is found that significant pair escape requires $L &lt; L_{\rm{sh}}$. The divergence, density and characteristic dimensions of the escaping pair jets are derived, and a criterion for pair plasma formation is obtained. While current laser wakefield beams are not well adapted, multi-petawatt lasers may provide new electron or photon sources suitable for laboratory pair plasma production.</description>

      <title>Beyond one-loop calculation: Higher-order effects on Gross-Neveu-Yukawa tensorial criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for the SO($N$) symmetric traceless rank-two tensor order parameter coupled to Majorana fermions using the $\epsilon$-expansion around upper critical dimensions of $3+1$ to two loops. Previously we established in the one-loop calculation that the theory does not exhibit a critical fixed point for $N \geq 4$, but that nevertheless the stable fixed point inevitably emerges at a large number of fermion flavors $N_f$. For $N_f &lt; N_{f,c1} \approx N/2$, no critical fixed point exists; for $N_{f,c1} &lt; N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$, a real critical fixed point emerges from the complex plane but fails to satisfy the additional stability conditions necessary for a continuous phase transition; and finally only for $N_f &gt; N_{f,c2} \approx N$, the fixed point satisfies the stability conditions as well. In the present work we compute the $O(\epsilon)$ (two-loop) corrections to the critical flavour numbers $N_{f,c1} $ and $N_{f,c2}$. Most importantly, we observe a sharp decrease in $N_{f,c2}$ from its one-loop value, which brings it closer to the point $N_f =1$ relevant to the standard Gross-Neveu model. Some three-loop results are also presented and discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the Generalized Uncertainty Principle and the Extended Uncertainty Principle in the context of black hole solutions coming from non-local theories of gravity, focusing, specifically, on Infinite Derivative Gravity. We argue that these modifications of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle are effective descriptions arising from the non-local features of gravitational interaction. By comparing the predictions of both the modified uncertainty principles and non-local gravity, we find theoretical constraints on otherwise free parameters as well as universal laws for black hole physics beyond General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Matter-antimatter asymmetry in a rotating universe: Dirac spinors in axisymmetric Bianchi IX cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard $\Lambda$CDM model, based on a highly symmetric FLRW geometry, successfully explains many observations but faces unresolved issues, motivating the exploration of alternative cosmological frameworks. We investigate the influence of spacetime geometry on the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe within the Bianchi IX cosmological model. Motivated by early-universe dynamics, potential contributions to cosmological angular momentum, and the axisymmetric Bianchi IX model's relevance to certain CMB anomalies, we formulate the Dirac field in this background. Starting with a Lagrangian formalism, we derive the Dirac equation and develop the harmonic analysis of spinor fields, extending previous treatments in the Mixmaster universe. We solve the Dirac equations for non-rotating and rotating axisymmetric Bianchi IX spacetimes using a fixed-background approximation. We find that spatial anisotropy induces spin-dependent energy splittings, while global rotation produces particle-antiparticle asymmetries in the energy spectra, effects absent in FLRW models. These results demonstrate that spacetime geometry alone can imprint nontrivial structure on particle spectra, suggesting that geometric effects may contribute to the matter-antimatter asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Sommerfeld Enhancement from Quantum Forces for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum forces are long-range interactions that arise only at the loop level. In this work, we study the Sommerfeld enhancement of dark matter (DM) annihilation cross sections caused by quantum forces. One notable feature of quantum forces is that they are subject to coherent enhancement in the presence of a background of mediator particles, which occurs in many situations in cosmology. We show that this effect has important implications for the Sommerfeld enhancement and DM physics. For the first time, we calculate the Sommerfeld factor induced by quantum forces for both bosonic and fermionic mediators, including the background corrections. We observe several novel features of the Sommerfeld factor that do not exist in the case of the Yukawa potential, such as temperature-induced resonance peaks for massless mediators, and having both enhancement and suppression effects in the same model with different DM masses. As direct applications, we discuss the DM phenomenology affected by the Sommerfeld enhancement from quantum forces, including thermal freeze-out, CMB spectral distortion from DM annihilation, and DM indirect detection. We highlight one particularly interesting effect relevant to indirect detection caused by the Sommerfeld enhancement in a non-thermal background of bosonic mediators in the galaxy, in which case the DM mass is shifted due to the background correction and the effective cross section for DM annihilation can be either enhanced or suppressed. This may be important for DM searches in the Milky Way or its satellite galaxies.</description>

      <title>Effective Pressure of the FRW Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17789v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the effective pressure of the $N$-dimensional FRW(Friedmann-Robertson-Walker) universe in Einstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity, and Lovelock gravity. The effective pressure is defined by $P_{eff}:=-\mathrm{d}E/\mathrm{d}V$, where $E=\rho V$ is the effective energy and $V$ is the volume of the FRW universe inside the apparent horizon. The effective pressure in Einstein gravity is always negative and its absolute value decreases with the horizon radius $R_A$. The effective pressure in Gauss-Bonnet gravity is different with the one in Einstein gravity only when $N\geq6$. In this case, if $\alpha&gt;0$, the effective pressure is always negative, but if $\alpha&lt;0$, it is not always negative and has a minimum. The effective pressure in Lovelock gravity can have multiple zero-points and extreme points. The effective pressure in different dimensions has interesting relations. We also find that under certain condition, the effective pressure is equivalent with the `ordinary' pressure $p$ of the perfect fluid, and this condition do not depend on the specific choice of gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy from LRG1-2 and Low-$z$ SNe Ia Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10514v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present evidence for evolving dark energy using baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2), combined with different Type Ia supernova calibrations (Pantheon$^+$, DES-SN5YR, and Union3) and the CMB compressed likelihood. In our analysis, we examined several dark energy models, including the Logarithmic, Exponential, CPL, BA, JBP, Thawing, Mirage, and GEDE parameterizations. We found that the evidence for evolving dark energy in the DESI measurements is primarily driven by the LRG1 and LRG2 tracers, as their combination yields a preferred value of $\omega_0 &gt; -1$. Further extending our analysis by combining other measurements, we find that all evolving dark energy models favor evolving dark energy scenario characterized by $\omega_0 &gt; -1$, $\omega_a &lt; 0$, and $\omega_0 + \omega_a &lt; -1$ (Quintom-B). Indeed, our results show a departure from the $\Lambda$CDM model at a significance level of up to $3$-$3.6\sigma$, with the DES-SN5YR sample showing the most significant deviation. When we exclude low-$z$ SNe Ia measurements from the DES-SN5YR sample, we find that the preference for evolving dark energy is significantly biased by the low-redshift ($z &lt; 0.01$) supernova sample. The evolution of $\omega(z)$ shows a phantom crossing around $z \sim 0.5$ in most of the dynamical dark energy models, and the evolution of $f_{DE}(z)$ further supports the evolving nature of dark energy. Bayesian analysis of model evidence shows that the inclusion of low-$z$ supernovae data significantly strengthens the support for evolving dark energy models such as JBP and Mirage, while models revert to inconclusive or weak support when low-$z$ data are excluded.</description>

      <title>Stable black holes in lower dimensional $f(\mathbb{Q})$ non-metric gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate exact charged and uncharged black hole solutions in a (2+1)-dimensional spacetime within the framework of quadratic form of $f(\mathbb{Q})$ symmetric teleparallel gravity, where $\mathbb{Q}$ is the non-metricity scalar. By adopting spherical symmetry and considering both vanishing and non-vanishing electromagnetic fields, we derive new classes of black hole solutions and analyze their geometric and physical properties. The study demonstrates that the inclusion of quadratic corrections in the gravitational Lagrangian significantly modifies the structure of solutions, producing deviations from the standard BTZ geometry. Invariants such as curvature and non-metricity scalars are calculated to classify the singularity structure and spacetime behavior. Thermodynamic quantities, including Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity, are computed, showing consistency with the first law of black hole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we examine the geodesic motion of test particles and derive the effective potential to explore the stability of photon orbits. A notable outcome is the identification of weaker black hole singularities in comparison to General Relativity, attributed to the non-metricity corrections. The possibility of multi-horizon configurations is also explored. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the gravitational, thermodynamic, and dynamical features of lower-dimensional black holes in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity and highlights their distinct characteristics with respect to General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Scrambling Without Chaos in Random Free-Fermionic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the role of randomness in the scrambling of quantum information within integrable free-fermionic systems. Considering quadratic Hamiltonians with varying degrees of randomness, we analyze entanglement-based measures to characterize the scrambling structure. We show that the memory effect in the entanglement of disjoint subsystems of Gaussian states vanishes when the local couplings are random, indicating information delocalization. The tripartite mutual information exhibits negative saturation values similar to those in chaotic systems, albeit with a smaller magnitude, revealing weaker scrambling under integrable quadratic dynamics. Despite integrability, spectral analyses reveal that local random models display a spectral-form-factor ramp and a partial crossover in the single-particle level-spacing ratio from Poisson-like to Wigner--Dyson-like behavior within a certain range of random couplings. These results demonstrate that randomness can act as a minimal ingredient for inducing information scrambling in integrable quadratic fermionic models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a unified framework connecting decoherence and quantum complexity. By vectorizing the density matrix into a pure state in a double Hilbert space, a decoherence process is mapped to an imaginary-time evolution. Expanding this evolution in the Krylov space, we find that the $n$-th Krylov basis corresponds to an $n$-error state generated by the decoherence, providing a natural bridge between error proliferation and complexity growth. Using two dephasing quantum channels as concrete examples, we show that the Krylov complexity remains nonsingular for strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SWSSB) crossovers, while it exhibits a singular area-to-volume-law transition for genuine SWSSB phase transitions, intrinsic to mixed states.</description>

      <title>Geometric Solution of Turbulence as Diffusion in Loop Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly nonlinear dynamics, from fluid turbulence to quantum chromodynamics, have long constituted some of the most challenging problems in theoretical physics. This review describes a unified theoretical framework, the loop space calculus, which offers an analytical approach to these problems. The central idea is a shift in perspective from pointwise fields to integrated loop observables, a transformation that recasts the governing nonlinear equations into a universal linear diffusion equation in the space of loops. This framework, supported by recent mathematical analysis, is analytically solvable and yields an exact, parameter-free solution for decaying hydrodynamic turbulence--the Euler ensemble--which is shown to be dual to a solvable string theory. The theory's predictions include: (i) the unification of spatial and temporal scaling laws, which are shown to be governed by two related, infinite spectra of intermittency and decay exponents, respectively, both derived from the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function; (ii) a first-order phase transition in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence; and (iii) the formation of quantized, concentric shells in passive scalar mixing. The theory also predicts log-periodic oscillations in correlation functions, effects not described by standard phenomenology, for which there is now emerging evidence from high-precision turbulence experiments. The appearance of identical mathematical structures as solutions to the turbulent regime of Yang-Mills gradient flow points towards the broad applicability of this approach. The framework also yields a new type of minimal surface that solves the QCD loop equations in the limit of large loops.</description>

      <title>Effective matter sectors from modified entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general formalism linking modified entropy functions directly to a modified spacetime metric and, subsequently, to an effective matter sector of entropic origin. In particular, within the framework of general relativity, starting from the first law of black-hole thermodynamics we establish an explicit correspondence between the entropy derivative and the metric function, which naturally leads to an emergent stress-energy tensor representing an anisotropic effective fluid. This backreaction effect of horizon entropy may resolve possible inconsistencies recently identified in black hole physics with modified entropies. As specific examples, we apply this procedure to a wide class of modified entropies, such as Barrow, Tsallis-Cirto, Renyi, Kaniadakis, logarithmic, power-law, loop-quantum-gravity, and exponential modifications, and we derive the associated effective matter sectors, analyzing their physical properties and energy conditions.</description>
