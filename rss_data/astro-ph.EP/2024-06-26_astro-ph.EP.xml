      <title>Forming Massive Terrestrial Satellites through Binary-Exchange Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of planetary satellites around solid objects in the inner Solar System is small either because they are difficult or unlikely to form, or that they do not survive for astronomical timescales. Here we conduct a pilot study on the possibility of satellite capture from the process of collision-less binary-exchange and show that massive satellites in the range 0.01 - 0.1 Earth masses can be captured by earth-sized terrestrial planets in a way already demonstrated for larger planets both in the Solar System and possibly beyond. In this process, one of the binary objects is ejected, leaving the other object as a satellite in orbit around the planet. We specifically consider satellite capture by an earth in an assortment of hypothetical encounters with large terrestrial binaries at 1 AU around the Sun. In addition, we examine the tidal evolution of captured objects and show that orbit circularization and long-term stability are possible for cases resembling the Earth-Moon system.</description>

      <title>A General-Purpose Transit Simulator for Arbitrary Shaped Objects Orbiting Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a versatile transit simulator aimed at generating light curves for arbitrarily shaped objects transiting stars. Utilizing a Monte Carlo algorithm, it accurately models the stellar flux blocked by these objects, producing precise light curves. The simulator adeptly handles realistic background stars, integrating effects such as tidal distortions and limb darkening, alongside the rotational dynamics of transiting objects of arbitrary geometries. We showcase its wide-ranging utility through successful simulations of light curves for single and multi-planet systems, tidally distorted planets, eclipsing binaries and exocomets. Additionally, our simulator can simulate light curves for hypothetical alien megastructures of any conceivable shape, providing avenues to identify interesting candidates for follow-up studies. We demonstrate applications of the simulator in modeling a Dyson Swarm in construction, Dyson rings and Dyson disks, discussing how tidally locked Dyson disks can be distinguished from planetary light curves.</description>

      <title>Chemical Evolution of Complex Organic Molecules in Turbulent Protoplanetary Disks: Effect of stochastic UV irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the chemical evolution of complex organic molecules (COMs) in turbulent disks using gas-ice chemical reaction network simulations. We trace trajectories of dust particles considering advection, turbulent diffusion, gas drag, and vertical settling, for 10$^6$ yrs in a protoplanetary disk. Then, we solve a gas-ice chemical reaction network along the trajectories and obtain the temporal evolution of molecular abundances. We find that the COM abundances in particles can differ by more than two orders of magnitude even when the UV fluence (i.e., the time integral of UV flux) received by the particles are similar, suggesting that not only the UV fluence but also the time variation of the UV flux does matter for the evolution of COMs in disks. The impact of UV fluence on molecular abundances differs between oxygen-bearing and nitrogen-bearing COMs. While higher UV fluence results in oxygen being locked into CO$_2$, leading to reduced abundances of oxygen-bearing COMs such as CH$_3$OCH$_3$, mild UV exposure can promote their formation by supplying the precursor radicals. On the other hand, nitrogen is not locked up into specific molecules, allowing the formation of nitrogen-bearing COMs, particularly CH$_3$NH$_2$, even for the particle that receives the higher UV fluence. We also find that the final COM abundances are mostly determined by the inherited abundances from the protostellar core when the UV fluence received by dust particles is less than a critical value, while they are set by both the inherited abundances and the chemistry inside the disk at higher UV fluence.</description>

      <title>Revising Properties of Planet-Host Binary Systems. IV. The Radius Distribution of Small Planets in Binary Star Systems is Dependent on Stellar Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small planets ($R_{p} \leq 4 R_{\oplus}$) are divided into rocky super-Earths and gaseous sub-Neptunes separated by a radius gap, but the mechanisms that produce these distinct planet populations remain unclear. Binary stars are the only main-sequence systems with an observable record of the protoplanetary disk lifetime and mass reservoir, and the demographics of planets in binaries may provide insights into planet formation and evolution. To investigate the radius distribution of planets in binary star systems, we observed 207 binary systems hosting 283 confirmed and candidate transiting planets detected by the Kepler mission, then recharacterized the planets while accounting for the observational biases introduced by the secondary star. We found that the population of planets in close binaries ($\rho \leq 100$ au) is significantly different from the planet population in wider binaries ($\rho &gt; 300$ au) or single stars. In contrast to planets around single stars, planets in close binaries appear to have a unimodal radius distribution with a peak near the expected super-Earth peak of $R_{p} \sim 1.3 R_{\oplus}$ and a suppressed population of sub-Neptunes. We conclude that we are observing the direct impact of a reduced disk lifetime, smaller mass reservoir, and possible altered distribution of solids reducing the sub-Neptune formation efficiency. Our results demonstrate the power of binary stars as a laboratory for exploring planet formation and as a controlled experiment of the impact of varied initial conditions on mature planet populations.</description>

      <title>A multi-frequency spaceborne radar perspective of deep convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global numerical weather models are starting to resolve atmospheric moist convection which comes with a critical need for observational constraints. One avenue for such constraints is spaceborne radar which tend to operate at three wavelengths, Ku-, Ka- and W-band. Many studies of deep convection in the past have primarily leveraged Ku-band because it is less affected by attenuation and multiple scattering. However, future spaceborne radar missions might not contain a Ku-band radar and thus considering the view of convection from Ka-band or W-band compared to the Ku-band would be useful. This study examines a coincident dataset between the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission and CloudSat as well as the entire GPM record to compare convective characteristics across various wavelengths within deep convection. We find that W-band reflectivity (Z) tends to maximize near the Ku-band defined echo-top while Ka-band often maximizes 4-5 km below. The height of the maximum Z above the melting level for W-band and Ka-band do not linearly relate to the Ku-band maximum. However, using the full GPM record the Ka-band 30 dBZ echo-tops can be linearly related to the Ku-band 40 dBZ echo-top with an $R^2$ of 0.62 and a root mean squared error of about 1 km. The spatial distribution of echo-tops from Ka-band corresponds well to the Ku-band echo-tops, highlighting regions of relatively large ice water path. This paper suggests that Ka-band only missions, like NASA's Investigation for Convective Updrafts, should be able to characterize global convection in a similar manner to a Ku-band system.</description>

      <title>The California Legacy Survey V. Chromospheric Activity Cycles in Main Sequence Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present optical spectroscopy of 710 solar neighborhood stars collected over twenty years to catalog chromospheric activity and search for stellar activity cycles. The California Legacy Survey stars are amenable to exoplanet detection using precise radial velocities, and we present their Ca II H and K time series as a proxy for stellar and chromospheric activity. Using the HIRES spectrometer at Keck Observatory, we measured stellar flux in the cores of the Ca II H and K lines to determine S-values on the Mt. Wilson scale and the log(R'HK) metric, which is comparable across a wide range of spectral types. From the 710 stars, with 52,372 observations, 285 stars are sufficiently sampled to search for stellar activity cycles with periods of 2-25 years, and 138 stars show stellar cycles of varying length and amplitude. S-values can be used to mitigate stellar activity in the detection and characterization of exoplanets. We use them to probe stellar dynamos and to place the Sun's magnetic activity into context among solar neighborhood stars. Using precise stellar parameters and time-averaged activity measurements, we find tightly constrained cycle periods as a function of stellar temperature between log(R'HK) of -4.7 and -4.9, a range of activity in which nearly every star has a periodic cycle. These observations present the largest sample of spectroscopically determined stellar activity cycles to date.</description>

      <title>Local Spherical Collapsing Box in Athena++: Numerical Implementation and Benchmark Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement a local model for a spherical collapsing/expanding gas cloud into the Athena++ magnetohydrodynamic code. This local model consists of a Cartesian periodic box with time-dependent geometry. We present a series of benchmark test problems, including non-linear solutions and linear perturbations of the local model, confirming the code's desired performance. During a spherical collapse, a horizontal shear flow is amplified, corresponding to angular momentum conservation of zonal flows in the global problem; wave speed and amplitude of sound waves increase in the local frame, due to the reduction in the characteristic length scale of the box, which can lead to an anisotropic effective sound speed in the local box. Our code conserves both mass and momentum to machine precision. This numerical implementation of the local model has potential applications to the study of local physics and hydrodynamic instabilities during protostellar collapse, providing a powerful framework for better understanding the earliest stages of star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the binary nature of HQ Tau: A brown dwarf companion revealed using multi-variate Gaussian process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Both the stellar activity and the accretion processes of young stellar objects can induce variations in their radial velocity (RV). This variation is often modulated on the stellar rotation period and may hide a RV signal from a planetary or even a stellar companion. Aims. The aim of this study is to detect the companion of HQ Tau, the existence of which is suspected based on our previous study of this object. We also aim to derive the orbital elements of the system. Methods. We used multi-variate Gaussian process regression on the RV and the bisector inverse slope of a six-month high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up observation of the system to model the stellar activity. This allowed us to extract the Keplerian RV modulation induced by the suspected companion. Results. Our analysis yields the detection of a $\sim$50 M$_{\rm jup}$ brown dwarf companion orbiting HQ Tau with a $\sim$126 day orbital period. Although this is consistent with the modulation seen on this dataset, it does not fit the measurements from our previous work three years earlier. In order to include these measurements in our analysis, we hypothesise the presence of a third component with orbital elements that are consistent with those of the secondary according to our previous analysis (M$_{\rm B}$ $\sim$48 M$_{\rm jup}$, P$_{\rm orb,B}$ $\sim$126 days), and a $\sim$465 M$_{\rm jup}$ tertiary with a $\sim$767 day orbital period. However, the hypothesis of a single companion with M$_{\rm B}$ $\sim$188 M$_{\rm jup}$ and P$_{\rm orb}$ $\sim$247 days can fit both datasets and cannot be completely excluded at this stage of the analysis. Conclusions. At minima, HQ Tau is a single-lined spectroscopic binary, and several factors indicate that the companion is a brown dwarf and that a third component is responsible for larger RV variation on a longer timescale.</description>

      <title>Fishing for Planets: A Comparative Analysis of EPRV Survey Performance in the Presence of Correlated Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With dedicated exoplanet surveys underway for multiple extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) instruments, the near-future prospects of RV exoplanet science are promising. These surveys' generous time allocations are expected to facilitate the discovery of Earth analogs around bright, nearby Sun-like stars. But survey success will depend critically on the choice of observing strategy, which will determine the survey's ability to mitigate known sources of noise and extract low-amplitude exoplanet signals. Here, we present an analysis of the Fisher information content of simulated EPRV surveys, accounting for the most recent advances in our understanding of stellar variability on both short and long timescales (i.e., oscillations and granulation within individual nights, and activity-induced variations across multiple nights). In this analysis, we capture the correlated nature of stellar variability by parameterizing these signals with Gaussian Process kernels. We describe the underlying simulation framework as well as the physical interpretation of the Fisher information content, and we evaluate the efficacy of EPRV survey strategies that have been presented in the literature. We explore and compare strategies for scheduling observations over various timescales and we make recommendations to optimize survey performance for the detection of Earth-like exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Advanced methods for analyzing in-situ observations of magnetic reconnection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05867v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is ample evidence for magnetic reconnection in the solar system, but it is a nontrivial task to visualize, to determine the proper approaches and frames to study, and in turn to elucidate the physical processes at work in reconnection regions from in-situ measurements of plasma particles and electromagnetic fields. Here an overview is given of a variety of single- and multi-spacecraft data analysis techniques that are key to revealing the context of in-situ observations of magnetic reconnection in space and for detecting and analyzing the diffusion regions where ions and/or electrons are demagnetized. We focus on recent advances in the era of the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission, which has made electron-scale, multi-point measurements of magnetic reconnection in and around Earth's magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>Hunting for Polluted White Dwarfs and Other Treasures with Gaia XP Spectra and Unsupervised Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs) polluted by exoplanetary material provide the unprecedented opportunity to directly observe the interiors of exoplanets. However, spectroscopic surveys are often limited by brightness constraints, and WDs tend to be very faint, making detections of large populations of polluted WDs difficult. In this paper, we aim to increase considerably the number of WDs with multiple metals in their atmospheres. Using 96,134 WDs with Gaia DR3 BP/RP (XP) spectra, we constructed a 2D map using an unsupervised machine learning technique called Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to organize the WDs into identifiable spectral regions. The polluted WDs are among the distinct spectral groups identified in our map. We have shown that this selection method could potentially increase the number of known WDs with 5 or more metal species in their atmospheres by an order of magnitude. Such systems are essential for characterizing exoplanet diversity and geology.</description>
