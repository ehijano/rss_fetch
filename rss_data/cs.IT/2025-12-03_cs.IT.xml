      <title>Weight distributions of simplex codes over finite chain rings and their Gray map images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linear code of length $n$ over a finite chain ring $R$ with residue field $\F_q$ is a $R$-submodule of $R^n$. A $R$-linear code is a code over $\F_q$ (not necessarily linear) which is the generalized Gray map image of a linear code over $R$. These codes can be seen as a generalization of the linear codes over $\Z_{p^s}$ with $p$ prime and $s \geq 1$. In this paper, we present the construction of linear simplex codes over $R$ and their corresponding $R$-linear simplex codes of type $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Moreover, we show the fundamental parameters of these codes, including their minimum Hamming distance, as well as their complete weight distributions. We also study whether these simplex codes are optimal with respect to the Griesmer-type bound.</description>

      <title>Low-Power Double RIS-Assisted Mobile LEO Satellite Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a low-power mobile low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication architecture, employing double reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to enhance energy efficiency and signal performance. With a distance between RISs that satisfies the far-field requirement, this architecture positions one small RIS each in the near-field of the satellite's antenna and the user on the ground. Moreover, we develop a path loss model for the double-RIS communication link, considering the near-field and far-field effects. Further, with the help of dual-stage beamforming, the proposed system maximizes the signal power and minimizes power consumption. Simulation results show that the proposed architecture can reduce the power consumption with 40 dB in the uplink, with a small $0.25^2$ $\text{m}^2$ RIS near the user, to communicate in energy-constrained LEO satellite communication circumstances.</description>

      <title>Entropies associated with orbits of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For certain groups, parabolic subgroups appear as stabilizers of flags of sets or vector spaces. Quotients by these parabolic subgroups represent orbits of flags, and their cardinalities asymptotically reveal entropies (as rates of exponential or superexponential growth). The multiplicative "chain rules" that involve these cardinalities induce, asymptotically, additive analogues for entropies. Many traditional formulas in information theory correspond to quotients of symmetric groups, which are a particular kind of reflection group; in this case, the cardinalities of orbits are given by multinomial coefficients and are asymptotically related to Shannon entropy. One can treat similarly quotients of the general linear groups over a finite field; in this case, the cardinalities of orbits are given by $q$-multinomials and are asymptotically related to the Tsallis 2-entropy. In this contribution, we consider other finite reflection groups as well as the symplectic group as an example of a classical group over a finite field (groups of Lie type). In both cases, the groups are classified by Dynkin diagrams into infinite series of similar groups $A_n$, $B_n$, $C_n$, $D_n$ and a finite number of exceptional ones. The $A_n$ series consists of the symmetric groups (reflection case) and general linear groups (Lie case). Some of the other series, studied here from an information-theoretic perspective for the first time, are linked to new entropic functionals.</description>

      <title>New Constructions of Non-GRS MDS Codes, Recovery and Determination Algorithms for GRS Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method for constructing a class of non-GRS MDS codes. The lengths of these codes can reach up to $\frac{q+3}{2}$ (for finite fields of odd characteristic) and $\frac{q+4}{2}$ (for even characteristic), respectively. Owing to their special structure, we can use the Cauchy matrix method to obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for these codes to be MDS codes and non-GRS MDS codes. Additionally, the inequivalence between these codes and twisted GRS codes is analyzed. Furthermore, we analyze the relationships among several existing classes of codes used for constructing non-GRS MDS codes, propose explicit constructions, and discuss the lengths of non-GRS MDS codes based on these constructions. Finally, we design two efficient algorithms to address two main problems in GRS code research, i.e., determining whether an unknown code $C$ is a GRS code from its generator matrix $G$, and recovering the key vectors $\bm{\alpha}$ and $\bm{v}$ such that $C = \GRS_{n,k}(\bm{\alpha}, \bm{v})$ if $C$ is indeed a GRS code. A computational complexity comparison of the proposed algorithms ($O(nk+n)$) with that of the Sidelnikov-Shestakov attack (exceeding $O(qk^2n+qk^3)$) shows that our methods offer superior computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Age of Information for Constrained Scheduling with Imperfect Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a downlink system where an access point sends the monitored status of multiple sources to multiple users. By jointly accounting for imperfect feedback and constrained transmission rate, which are key limited factors in practical systems, we aim to design scheduling algorithms to optimize the age of information (AoI) over the infinite time horizon. For zero feedback under the generate-at-will traffic, we derive a closed-form lower bound of achievable AoI, which, to the best of our knowledge, reflects the impact of zero feedback for the first time, and propose a policy that achieves this bound in many cases by jointly applying rate splitting and modular arithmetic. For zero feedback under the Bernoulli traffic, we develop a drift-plus-penalty (DPP) policy with a threshold structure based on the theory of Lyapunov optimization and provide a closed-form performance guarantee. Furthermore, we extend the design of this DPP policy to support general imperfect feedback without increasing the online computational complexity. Numerical results verify our theoretical analysis and the AoI advantage of the proposed policies over state-of-the-art policies.</description>

      <title>A Cyclic Shift Embedded Pilot based Channel Estimation for Multi-User MIMO-OTFS systems with fractional delay and Doppler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has been proposed to meet the demand for reliable communication in high-mobility scenarios for future wireless networks. However, in multi-user OTFS systems, conventional embedded pilot schemes require independent pilot allocation for each user, leading to linearly increasing pilot overhead. To address these issues, in this paper, we investigate the uplink channel estimation and pilot design for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-OTFS systems. We propose a multi-dimensional decomposition-based channel estimation algorithm. Specifically, the proposed algorithm first estimates the angles of arrivals (AoAs) via subspace decomposition-based method. A spatial projection matrix, constructed from the estimated AOAs, decouples the received signal by propagation path subspace, effectively mitigating inter-path interference. The remaining fractional delay and Doppler can be obtained by a compressed sensing (CS)-based off-grid channel estimation method. Furthermore, to reduce the pilot overhead in multi-user OTFS systems, this paper proposes a novel cyclic shift embedded pilot (CSEP) structure, which can reuse users through cyclic shift-orthogonality of Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences. Compared with conventional embedded pilot structures, the CSEP structure can save over 30\% of pilot overhead. Finally, an imporved channel estimation method based on the CSEP structure is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that it achieves superior performance in channel estimation. Moreover, the proposed CSEP structure and channel estimation algorithm achieve a favorable balance between computational complexity, estimation accuracy, and bit error rate (BER) performance.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann-Shannon Index: A Geometric-Aware Measure of Clustering Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02397v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Boltzmann-Shannon Index (BSI), a normalized measure for clustered continuous data that captures the interaction between frequency-based and geometry-based probability distributions. Building on ideas from geometric coarse-graining and information theory, the BSI quantifies how well a partition reflects both the population of each cluster and its effective geometric extent. We illustrate its behavior on synthetic Gaussian mixtures, the Iris benchmark, and a high-imbalance resource-allocation scenario, showing that the index provides a coherent assessment even when traditional metrics give incomplete or misleading signals. Moreover, in resource-allocation settings, we demonstrate that BSI not only detects severe density-geometry inconsistency with high sensitivity, but also offers a smooth, optimization-ready objective that naturally favors allocations balancing demographic weight with each group's effective spread in the outcome space, while providing a smooth, gradient-friendly regularizer that can be easily embedded in modern policy-making and algorithmic governance optimization frameworks.</description>

      <title>Optimal Handover Strategies in LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing theoretical analyses of satellite mega-constellations often rely on restrictive assumptions, such as short serving times, or lack tractability when evaluating realistic handover strategies. Motivated by these limitations, this paper develops a general analytical framework for accurately characterising the ergodic capacity of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks under arbitrary handover strategies. Specifically, we model the transmission link as shadowed-Rician fading and introduce the persistent satellite channel, wherein the channel process is governed by an i.i.d. renewal process under mild assumptions of uncoordinated handover decisions and knowledge of satellite ephemeris and fading parameters. Within this framework, we derive the ergodic capacity (persistent capacity) of the persistent satellite channel using renewal theory and establish its relation to the non-persistent capacity studied in prior work. To address computational challenges, we present closed-form upper and lower bounds on persistent capacity. The optimal handover problem is formulated as a non-linear fractional program, obtaining an explicit decision rule via a variant of Dinkelbach's algorithm. We further demonstrate that a simpler handover strategy maximising serving capacity closely approximates the optimal strategy, providing practical insights for designing high-throughput LEO satellite communication systems.</description>

      <title>Artificial Noise Aided Physical Layer Security for Near-Field MIMO with Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the evolution of wireless systems toward large-scale arrays and high-frequency reconfigurable architectures, fluid antenna systems (FAS) operating in the near-field (NF) regime provide new degrees of freedom (DoF) for physical layer security (PLS). This paper proposes an artificial-noise (AN)-aided PLS scheme for NF fluid-antenna multiple-input multiple-output (FA-MIMO) systems, with joint beamforming (BF) and AN design for both compact and large arrays. An alternating-optimization (AO) framework addresses the sparsity-constrained non-convex design by splitting it into a continuous BF/AN joint-design subproblem and a discrete FAS port-selection subproblem. Closed-form fully digital BF/AN solutions are obtained via a generalized spectral water-filling procedure within a block coordinate descent (BCD) surrogate and realized by a hardware-efficient hybrid beamforming (HBF) architecture that embeds AN in the baseband without extra radio-frequency (RF) chains. For FAS port selection, a row-energy based prune--refit rule, aligned with Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) conditions of a group-sparsity surrogate, enables efficient active-port determination. Simulation results confirm that the proposed design exploits the geometry and position-domain DoF of FAS and significantly improves secrecy performance, particularly for non-extremely-large arrays where NF beam focusing alone is inadequate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimization is poised to play a transformative role in the design of next-generation wireless communication systems by addressing key computational and technological challenges. This paper provides an overview of the principles of adiabatic quantum computing, the foundation of quantum optimization, and explores its two primary computational models: quantum annealing and the gate-based quantum approximate optimization algorithm. By highlighting their core features, performance benefits, limitations, and distinctions, we position these methods as promising tools for advancing wireless communication system design. As a case study, we examine the design of passive reconfigurable intelligent surface beamforming with binary phase-shift resolution, supported by experimental results obtained from real-world quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Deep Q-Learning-Driven Power Control for Enhanced Noma User Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-edge users (CEUs) in cellular networks typically suffer from poor channel conditions due to long distances from serving base stations and physical obstructions, resulting in much lower data rates compared to cell-center users (CCUs). This paper proposes an Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-assisted cellular network with intelligent power control to address the performance gap between CEUs and CCUs. Unlike conventional approaches that either deploy UAVs for all users or use no UAV assistance, our model uses a distance-based criterion where only users beyond a reference distance receive UAV relay assistance. Each UAV operates as an amplify-and-forward relay, enabling assisted users to receive signals from both the base station and the UAV simultaneously, thereby achieving diversity gain. To optimize transmission power allocation across base stations, we employ a Deep Q-Network (DQN) learning framework that learns power control policies without requiring accurate channel models. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves a peak average rate of 2.28 bps/Hz at the optimal reference distance of 400m, which represents a 3.6% improvement compared to networks without UAV assistance and 0.9% improvement compared to networks where all users receive UAV support. The results also reveal that UAV altitude and reference distance are critical factors affecting system performance, with lower altitudes providing better performance.</description>

      <title>Digit-Indexed q-ary SEC-DED Codes with Near-Hamming Overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple $q$-ary family of single-error-correcting, double-error-detecting (SEC--DED) linear codes whose parity checks are tied directly to the base-$p$ ($q=p$ prime) digits of the coordinate index. For blocklength $n=p^r$ the construction uses only $r+1$ parity checks -- \emph{near-Hamming} overhead -- and admits an index-based decoder that runs in a single pass with constant-time location and magnitude recovery from the syndromes. Based on the prototype, we develop two extensions: Code A1, which removes specific redundant trits to achieve higher information rate and support variable-length encoding; and Code A2, which incorporates two group-sum checks together with a 3-wise XOR linear independence condition on index subsets, yielding a ternary distance-4 (SEC--TED) variant. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the framework generalizes via $n$-wise XOR linearly independent sets to construct codes with distance $d = n + 1$, notably recovering the ternary Golay code for $n = 5$ -- showing both structural generality and a serendipitous link to optimal classical codes.
  Our contribution is not optimality but \emph{implementational simplicity} and an \emph{array-friendly} structure: the checks are digitwise and global sums, the mapping from syndromes to error location is explicit, and the SEC--TED upgrade is modular. We position the scheme against classical $q$-ary Hamming and SPC/product-code baselines and provide a small comparison of parity overhead, decoding work, and two-error behavior.</description>

      <title>Structural Properties of Entropic Vectors and Stability of the Ingleton Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study constrained versions of the Ingleton inequality in the entropic setting and quantify its stability under small violations of conditional independence. Although the classical Ingleton inequality fails for general entropy profiles, it is known to hold under certain exact independence constraints. We focus on the regime where selected conditional mutual information terms are small (but not zero), and the inequality continues to hold up to controlled error terms. A central technical tool is a structural lemma that materializes part of the mutual information between two random variables, implicitly capturing the effect of infinitely many non-Shannon--type inequalities. This leads to conceptually transparent proofs without explicitly invoking such infinite families. Some of our bounds recover, in a unified way, what can also be deduced from the infinite families of inequalities of Mat\'u\v{s} (2007) and of Dougherty--Freiling--Zeger (2011), while others appear to be new.</description>

      <title>Pseudocodewords of quantum, quasi-cyclic, and spatially-coupled LDPC codes: a fundamental cone perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are near capacity-achieving when paired with iterative decoders, these decoders may not output a codeword due to the existence of pseudocodewords. Thus, pseudocodewords have been studied to give insight into the performance of modern decoders including iterative and linear programming decoders. These pseudocodewords are found to be dependent on the parity-check matrix of the code and the particular decoding algorithm used. In this paper, we consider LP decoding, which has been linked to graph cover decoding, providing functions which capture these pseudocodewords. In particular, we analyze the underlying structure of pseudocodewords from quantum stabilizer codes that arise from LP decoding, quasi-cyclic LDPC codes, and spatially-coupled LDPC codes.</description>

      <title>Hardware Distortion Aware Precoding for ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of hardware impairments on the spectral efficiency of communication systems is well studied, but their effect on sensing performance remains unexplored. In this paper, we analyze the influence of hardware impairments on integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems in cluttered environments. We derive the sensing signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) and show that hardware distortions significantly degrade sensing performance by enhancing clutter-induced noise, which masks target echoes. The isotropic nature of transmit distortion due to multiple stream transmission further complicates clutter suppression. To address this, we propose a distortion- and clutter-aware precoding strategy that minimizes the deviation from the communication-optimized precoder while improving sensing robustness. We also propose an alternative power allocation-based approach that reduces computational complexity. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in overcoming hardware- and clutter-induced limitations, demonstrating significant performance gains over distortion-unaware designs.</description>

      <title>Qudits offer no advantages over dits for sending random messages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the following simple scenario: Alice has one of many possible messages, drawn from a known distribution, and wants to maximize the probability that Bob guesses her message correctly. We prove that if Alice can send only a qudit to Bob, without preshared entanglement, there is never any advantage over sending him a classical dit. This result was previously known only for a uniform distribution.
  We also prove a mixed-state generalization of this result in the form of an upper bound on the success probability of discriminating between mixed quantum states with a single measurement. This bound is based solely on the dimension, probability distribution, and eigenvalues of the states and is sharp among such bounds.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Fairness Aware Multi Task Federated Learning for VR Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02513v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless connectivity promises to unshackle virtual reality (VR) experiences, allowing users to engage from anywhere, anytime. However, delivering seamless, high-quality, real-time VR video wirelessly is challenging due to the stringent quality of experience requirements, low latency constraints, and limited VR device capabilities. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel decentralized multi task fair federated learning (DMTFL) based caching that caches and prefetches each VR user's field of view (FOV) at base stations (BSs) based on the caching strategies tailored to each BS. In federated learning (FL) in its naive form, often biases toward certain users, and a single global model fails to capture the statistical heterogeneity across users and BSs. In contrast, the proposed DMTFL algorithm personalizes content delivery by learning individual caching models at each BS. These models are further optimized to perform well under any target distribution, while providing theoretical guarantees via Rademacher complexity and a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the loss. Using a realistic VR head-tracking dataset, our simulations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DMTFL algorithm compared to baseline algorithms.</description>

      <title>Zero-Forcing MU-MIMO Precoding under Power Amplifier Non-Linearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems, the non-linear behavior of the power amplifiers (PAs) may cause degradation of the linear precoding schemes dealing with interference between user equipments (UEs), e.g., the zero-forcing (ZF) precoder. One way to minimize this effect is to use digital-pre-distortion (DPD) modules to linearize the PAs. However, using perfect DPD modules is costly and it may incur significant power consumption. As an alternative, we consider the problem of characterizing non-linearity-aware ZF (NLA-ZF) precoding schemes, hereby defined as linear precoders that achieve perfect interference cancellation in the presence of PA non-linearity by exploiting knowledge of this non-linear response. We provide initial iterative solutions that allow achieving NLA-ZF (up to adjustable tolerance) in a two-UE downlink MU-MIMO scenario where the base station (BS) has an even number of antennas, and each antenna is connected to a PA exhibiting third-order memory-less non-linear behavior. The proposed approach allows for performance gains in scenarios with significant residual interference.</description>

Abstract: Through this work we introduce an action of the skew polynomial ring $\mathbb{F}_{q}\left[X; \sigma, \delta\right]$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ based on its polynomial valuation and the concept of left skew product of functions. This lead us to explore the construction of a certain subset $\mathcal{T}(X)\subset\mathbb{F}_{q}\left[X; \sigma, \delta\right]$ that allow us to control the non-commutativity of this ring, and exploit this fact in order to build a public key exchange protocol that is secure in Canetti and Krawczyk model.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming and Matching for Ultra-Dense Massive Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) offers substantial spectral-efficiency gains, but scaling to very large antenna arrays with conventional all-digital and hybrid beamforming architectures quickly results in excessively high costs and power consumption. Low-cost, switch-based architectures have recently emerged as a potential alternative. However, prior studies rely on simplified models that ignore (among others) antenna coupling, radiation patterns, and matching losses, resulting in inaccurate performance predictions. In this paper, we use a physically consistent electromagnetic modeling framework to analyze an ultra-dense patch-antenna array architecture that performs joint beamforming and matching using networks of inexpensive RF switches. Our results demonstrate that simple, switch-based beamforming architectures can approach the antenna-gain of all-digital solutions at significantly lower cost and complexity.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Jamming for Autoencoder Distribution Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of adversarial wireless jamming to regularise the latent space of an autoencoder to match a diagonal Gaussian distribution. We consider the minimisation of a mean squared error distortion, where a jammer attempts to disrupt the recovery of a Gaussian source encoded and transmitted over the adversarial channel. A straightforward consequence of existing theoretical results is the fact that the saddle point of a minimax game - involving such an encoder, its corresponding decoder, and an adversarial jammer - consists of diagonal Gaussian noise output by the jammer. We use this result as inspiration for a novel approach to distribution matching in the latent space, utilising jamming as an auxiliary objective to encourage the aggregated latent posterior to match a diagonal Gaussian distribution. Using this new technique, we achieve distribution matching comparable to standard variational autoencoders and to Wasserstein autoencoders. This approach can also be generalised to other latent distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of constructing optimal average-length binary codes under the constraint that each codeword must contain at most $D$ ones, where $D$ is a given input parameter. We provide an $O(n^2D)$-time complexity algorithm for the construction of such codes, where $n$ is the number of codewords. We also describe several scenarios where the need to design these kinds of codes naturally arises. We also provide a Kraft-like inequality for the existence of (optimal) variable-length binary codes, subject to the above-described constraint on the number of 1's in each codeword.</description>

      <title>ORBGRAND Is Exactly Capacity-achieving via Rank Companding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) algorithms, ordered reliability bits GRAND (ORBGRAND) has attracted considerable attention due to its efficient use of soft information and suitability for hardware implementation. It has also been shown that ORBGRAND achieves a rate very close to the capacity of an additive white Gaussian noise channel under antipodal signaling. In this work, it is further established that, for general binary-input memoryless channels under symmetric input distribution, via suitably companding the ranks in ORBGRAND according to the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) of channel reliability, the resulting CDF-ORBGRAND algorithm exactly achieves the mutual information, i.e., the symmetric capacity. This result is then applied to bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) systems to handle high-order input constellations. Via considering the effects of mismatched decoding due to both BICM and ORBGRAND, it is shown that CDF-ORBGRAND is capable of achieving the BICM capacity, which was initially derived in the literature by treating BICM as a set of independent parallel channels.</description>

      <title>Minimax Hypothesis Testing for the Bradley-Terry-Luce Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model is one of the most widely used models for ranking a collection of items or agents based on pairwise comparisons among them. Given $n$ agents, the BTL model endows each agent $i$ with a latent skill score $\alpha_i &gt; 0$ and posits that the probability that agent $i$ is preferred over agent $j$ is $\alpha_i/(\alpha_i + \alpha_j)$. In this work, our objective is to formulate a hypothesis test that determines whether a given pairwise comparison dataset, with $k$ comparisons per pair of agents, originates from an underlying BTL model. We formalize this testing problem in the minimax sense and define the critical threshold of the problem. We then establish upper bounds on the critical threshold for general induced observation graphs (satisfying mild assumptions) and develop lower bounds for complete induced graphs. Our bounds demonstrate that for complete induced graphs, the critical threshold scales as $\Theta((nk)^{-1/2})$ in a minimax sense. In particular, our test statistic for the upper bounds is based on a new approximation we derive for the separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of BTL models. To further assess the performance of our statistical test, we prove upper bounds on the type I and type II probabilities of error. Much of our analysis is conducted within the context of a fixed observation graph structure, where the graph possesses certain ``nice'' properties, such as expansion and bounded principal ratio. Additionally, we derive several auxiliary results, such as bounds on principal ratios of graphs, $\ell^2$-bounds on BTL parameter estimation under model mismatch, stability of rankings under the BTL model, etc. We validate our theoretical results through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets and propose a data-driven permutation testing approach to determine test thresholds.</description>

      <title>Machine Unlearning via Information Theoretic Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05684v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can we effectively remove or ''unlearn'' undesirable information, such as specific features or the influence of individual data points, from a learning outcome while minimizing utility loss and ensuring rigorous guarantees? We introduce a unified mathematical framework based on information-theoretic regularization to address both data point unlearning and feature unlearning. For data point unlearning, we introduce the $\textit{Marginal Unlearning Principle}$, an auditable and provable framework inspired by memory suppression studies in neuroscience. Moreover, we provide formal information-theoretic unlearning definition based on the proposed principle, named marginal unlearning, and provable guarantees on sufficiency and necessity of marginal unlearning to the existing approximate unlearning definitions. We then show the proposed framework provide natural solution to the marginal unlearning problems. For feature unlearning, the framework applies to deep learning with arbitrary training objectives. By combining flexibility in learning objectives with simplicity in regularization design, our approach is highly adaptable and practical for a wide range of machine learning and AI applications. From a mathematical perspective, we provide an unified analytic solution to the optimal feature unlearning problem with a variety of information-theoretic training objectives. Our theoretical analysis reveals intriguing connections between machine unlearning, information theory, optimal transport, and extremal sigma algebras. Numerical simulations support our theoretical finding.</description>

      <title>HeavyWater and SimplexWater: Distortion-Free LLM Watermarks for Low-Entropy Next-Token Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) watermarks enable authentication of text provenance, curb misuse of machine-generated text, and promote trust in AI systems. Current watermarks operate by changing the next-token predictions output by an LLM. The updated (i.e., watermarked) predictions depend on random side information produced, for example, by hashing previously generated tokens. LLM watermarking is particularly challenging in low-entropy generation tasks -- such as coding -- where next-token predictions are near-deterministic. In this paper, we propose an optimization framework for watermark design. Our goal is to understand how to most effectively use random side information in order to maximize the likelihood of watermark detection and minimize the distortion of generated text. Our analysis informs the design of two new watermarks: HeavyWater and SimplexWater. Both watermarks are tunable, gracefully trading-off between detection accuracy and text distortion. They can also be applied to any LLM and are agnostic to side information generation. We examine the performance of HeavyWater and SimplexWater through several benchmarks, demonstrating that they can achieve high watermark detection accuracy with minimal compromise of text generation quality, particularly in the low-entropy regime. Our theoretical analysis also reveals surprising new connections between LLM watermarking and coding theory. The code implementation can be found in https://github.com/DorTsur/HeavyWater_SimplexWater</description>

      <title>A Hands-On Molecular Communication Testbed for Undergraduate Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a hands-on molecular communication (MC) testbed developed for the undergraduate Communication Engineering lab course at the Institute for Communications Technology (IfN), TU~Braunschweig. The goal of the experiment is to provide students with an intuitive and reproducible introduction to MC concepts using a low-cost and accessible fluidic setup. The system employs a background water flow into which three dye colors are injected and symbols are detected by a multi-wavelength photosensor. A zero-forcing--based estimator is used to separate the spectral components and reliably identify the transmitted colors. The experiment is designed to be completed independently by students within a single laboratory session and requires only basic prior knowledge from introductory communication engineering courses. A detailed script accompanies the experiment, guiding students through channel characterization, color detection, pseudoinverse computation, and simple data transmission using on-off keying. In pilot trials, students successfully reproduced the entire communication chain and achieved stable data rates of up to 0.5~bit/s over a 15~cm channel. The proposed testbed demonstrates that fundamental principles of MC can be taught effectively using a compact and inexpensive experimental setup. The experiment will be integrated into an undergraduate lab course.</description>
