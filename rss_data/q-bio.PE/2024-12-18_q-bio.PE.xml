      <title>A model for the dynamics of COVID-19 infection transmission in human with latent delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we have derived a mathematical model for within human dynamics of COVID-19 infection using delay differential equations. The new model considers a 'latent period' and 'the time for immune response' as delay parameters, allowing us to study the effects of time delays in human COVID-19 infection. We have determined the equilibrium points and analyzed their stability. The disease-free equilibrium is stable when the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, is below unity. Stability switch of the endemic equilibrium occurs through Hopf-bifurcation. This study shows that the effect of latent delay is stabilizing whereas immune response delay has a destabilizing nature.</description>

      <title>Prey-taxis vs an external signal: short-wave asymptotic and stability analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two models of predator-prey community with prey-taxis, one relies on Patlak-Keller-Segel law (Lee et al, 2009), the other one employs the Cattaneo model of heat transfer following Dolak and Hillen (2003). Thus, the former one uses the prey density gradient for directing the predators flux, and the latter one -- for directing the vector density of sources of the predators flux. We assume the predators to be also capable of responding to an external signal in the same manner. Additionally, we assume that some scaling makes the dimensionless prey diffusivity and the wavelength of the external signal small quantities of the same order. In the case of Cattaneo's model, we additionally assume the resistivity to varying the predators flux to be as high as the reciprocal of the prey diffusivity. With these assumptions we construct the complete asymptotic expansion of the short-wave solution. We use this asymptotic to examine the effect of the short-wave signal on the formation of spatiotemporal patterns. We do so by comparing the stability of equilibria with no signal to that of the quasi-equilibria, by which we mean the simplest patterns directly forced by the external signal. Historically, such an approach goes back to Kapitza's theory for upside-down pendulum, and it had been already applied to examining other predator-prey systems and/or other limits (Morgulis and Ilin, 2020, Morgulis, 2023). This time the overall conclusion is that the external signal is likely not capable of creating the instability domain in the parametric space from nothing but it can substantially widen the one that is non-empty with no signal. The details, however, essentially depend on the speed at which the external signal propagates and on the system kinetics, at least when the signal amplitude is small</description>

      <title>Using machine learning to inform harvest control rule design in complex fishery settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fishery science, harvest management of size-structured stochastic populations is a long-standing and difficult problem. Rectilinear precautionary policies based on biomass and harvesting reference points have now become a standard approach to this problem. While these standard feedback policies are adapted from analytical or dynamic programming solutions assuming relatively simple ecological dynamics, they are often applied to more complicated ecological settings in the real world. In this paper we explore the problem of designing harvest control rules for partially observed, age-structured, spasmodic fish populations using tools from reinforcement learning (RL) and Bayesian optimization. Our focus is on the case of Walleye fisheries in Alberta, Canada, whose highly variable recruitment dynamics have perplexed managers and ecologists. We optimized and evaluated policies using several complementary performance metrics. The main questions we addressed were: 1. How do standard policies based on reference points perform relative to numerically optimized policies? 2. Can an observation of mean fish weight, in addition to stock biomass, aid policy decisions?</description>

      <title>Structural Cellular Hash Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hash Chemistry, a minimalistic artificial chemistry model of open-ended evolution, has recently been extended to non-spatial and cellular versions. The non-spatial version successfully demonstrated continuous adaptation and unbounded growth of complexity of self-replicating entities, but it did not simulate multiscale ecological interactions among the entities. On the contrary, the cellular version explicitly represented multiscale spatial ecological interactions among evolving patterns, yet it failed to show meaningful adaptive evolution or complexity growth. It remains an open question whether it is possible to create a similar minimalistic evolutionary system that can exhibit all of those desired properties at once within a computationally efficient framework. Here we propose an improved version called Structural Cellular Hash Chemistry (SCHC). In SCHC, individual identities of evolving patterns are explicitly represented and processed as the connected components of the nearest neighbor graph of active cells. The neighborhood connections are established by connecting active cells with other active cells in their Moore neighborhoods in a 2D cellular grid. Evolutionary dynamics in SCHC are simulated via pairwise competitions of two randomly selected patterns, following the approach used in the non-spatial Hash Chemistry. SCHC's computational cost was significantly less than the original and non-spatial versions. Numerical simulations showed that these model modifications achieved spontaneous movement, self-replication and unbounded growth of complexity of spatial evolving patterns, which were clearly visible in space in a highly intuitive manner. Detailed analysis of simulation results showed that there were spatial ecological interactions among self-replicating patterns and their diversity was also substantially promoted in SCHC, neither of which was present in the non-spatial version.</description>
