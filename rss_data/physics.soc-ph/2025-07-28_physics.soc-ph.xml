      <title>Recommendations to overcome language barriers in the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Research Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The report presents a comprehensive set of five recommendations to reduce language barriers within the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Research Ecosystem, promoting greater inclusion of researchers who are speakers of English as an additional language. Recognizing that English linguistic hegemony in science limits participation and productivity, the document proposes multilingual presentation formats, academic writing training, a Virtual Writing Center, language support programs, and writing retreats. Each recommendation is grounded in both pedagogical theory and empirical evidence, with an emphasis on collaborative, socially embedded approaches to scientific writing. The proposed academic writing training integrates constructivist and socio-cultural perspectives, emphasizing genre awareness, rhetorical competence, and reflective practices. The Virtual Writing Center would serve as a permanent infrastructure offering personalized tutoring and peer review support, while the language support programs address ongoing needs through workshops, consultations, and access to language tools. Writing retreats provide immersive environments for focused work and mentorship. The recommendations also encourage ethical use of AI tools for translation and writing assistance, fostering digital literacy alongside linguistic proficiency. Collectively, these initiatives aim to transform language from a barrier into a resource, recognizing multilingualism as an asset in global research collaboration. Rather than offering a one-size-fits-all solution, the document advocates for adaptable, community-driven strategies that can evolve within the diverse institutional and disciplinary contexts of the Rubin Research Ecosystem. By implementing these practices, the Ecosystem could lead efforts to democratize scientific communication and foster a more equitable, multilingual research culture.</description>

      <title>Informal Education is Essential to Physics: Findings of the 2024 JNIPER Summit and Recommendations for Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to reach the full civic and scientific potential of physics, this white paper calls for a culture change in physics to recognize informal physics education (also referred to as public engagement or outreach) as an essential disciplinary practice. That is, engaging in informal physics education (IPE) is part of what it means to ''do physics.'' In June 2024, we hosted a summit with forty-two members of the Joint Network for Informal Physics Education and Research (JNIPER) to discuss concrete steps for fostering this cultural shift in physics. We present key findings from the Summit to motivate this culture change: IPE makes the work of physicists relevant; fosters trust and supports a society where everyone benefits from science and technology advances; serves as a gateway for entering into the physics discipline, and for staying once there; and improves physicists' skills and research. We identify three levers for promoting the culture change: structures supporting IPE; engagement of interested, influential, and/or impacted parties; and integration of research-based IPE practices. Each lever is accompanied by associated recommendations for action directed at individuals, departments and institutions, topical groups such as JNIPER, and funders and (inter)national organizations. Our clarion call is for members and supporters of the IPE community to choose one recommendation per lever to prioritize and to set forth a roadmap for implementation. Together, we can establish IPE as a central physics practice, ultimately leading to a deeper connection between physics and society, strengthening our mutual potential and impact for good.</description>

      <title>Quantifying interdisciplinary synergy in higher STEM education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17841v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a framework to quantify and utilize interdisciplinarity in science and engineering curricula at the university-level higher education. We analyze interdisciplinary relations by standardizing large-scale official educational data in Korea using a cutting-edge large language model and constructing knowledge maps for disciplines of scientific education. We design and evaluate single-field and integrated dual-field curricula by adapting pedagogical theory and utilizing information theory-based metrics. We develop standard curricula for individual disciplines and integrated curricula combining two fields, with their interdisciplinarity quantified by the curriculum synergy score. The results indicate higher interdisciplinarity for combinations within or across closely related fields, especially in engineering fields. Based on the analysis, engineering fields constitute the core structure of our design for curriculum interdisciplinarity, while basic natural science fields are located at peripheral stems to provide fundamental concepts.</description>

      <title>Stationary and Non-Stationary Transition Probabilities in Decision Making: Modeling COVID-19 Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a comparative modeling framework using stationary and non-stationary transition probabilities within a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to assess COVID-19 disease dynamics. Stationary transition probabilities assume constant transition rates, while non-stationary transitions reflect time-dependent behaviors including policy interventions or behavioral changes. We develop a comprehensive compartmental model with transitions based on binomial and multinomial processes. Mathematical models for both stationary and non-stationary transition frameworks are developed and simulated over a 365-day period to emphasize dynamic variations in epidemic outcomes. Our findings highlight the significance of non-stationary modeling in accurately representing the dynamic characteristics of pandemic situations and provide recommendations for optimizing public health interventions under uncertainty. This comparative analysis offers useful information for epidemiological modeling and decision-making in dynamic risk environments.</description>
