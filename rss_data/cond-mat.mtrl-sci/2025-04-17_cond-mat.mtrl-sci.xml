      <title>Best practices in Quantum Monte Carlo for metal catalysis: CO hydrolysis on Pt(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen production as a clean, sustainable replacement for fossil fuels is gathering pace. Research work and prototyping various aspects of hydrogen power is now a priority. Over 90 \% of all chemical manufacture uses a solid catalyst. This work describes catalytic selective hydrogen production optimising reactant structure on a model catalyst. Focus is on O-H bond dissociation in format radicals formed after carbon-monoxide is co-adsorbed with water at Pt(111). Finally, hydrogen gas is given off. Many chemical reactions involve bond-dissociation. This process is often the key to rate-limiting reaction steps at solid surfaces. %This is also true for reactions at solid surfaces, in which the dissociation step is often limiting but facilitated in comparison to gas phase reaction channels. Since bond-breaking is poorly described by Hartree-Fock and DFT methods, our embedded active site approach is used. This work demonstrates Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methodology using a very simple four primitive-cell layer model, oriented to expose Pt (111). QMC is a stochastic approach to solving the Schr{\"o}dinger equation recently came of age for heterogeneous systems involving solids. During hydrolysis of carbon monoxide, initial O-H bond stretch is rate-limiting. This dissociation energy is offset by Pt-H bond formation at the surface. The reactive formate (H-O-C=O) species formed, by initial hydrolysis of CO, also interact with a vicinal Pt. These are subsequently desorbed. They then produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen, with a H-atom dissociated from the formate species and another desorbed at the Pt(111) face.
  Our approach allows a high-level configuration interaction (CI) wave-function to be used, expanded in plane-waves and embedded in the metal lattice exposing its close-packed face. The resulting periodic function is used to guide the QMC calculation.</description>

      <title>An Absorption Correction for Reliable Pair-Distribution Functions from Low Energy X-ray Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the development and testing of a simple absorption correction model for processing x-ray powder diffraction data from Debye-Scherrer geometry laboratory x-ray experiments. This may be used as a pre-processing step before using PDFgetX3 to obtain reliable pair distribution functions (PDFs). The correction was found to depend only on muD, the product of the x-ray attenuation coefficient and capillary diameter. Various experimental and theoretical methods for estimating muD were explored, and the most appropriate muD values for correction were identified for different capillary diameters and x-ray beam sizes. We identify operational ranges of muD where reasonable signal to noise is possible after correction. A user-friendly software package, diffpy.labpdfproc, is presented that can help estimate muD and perform absorption corrections, with a rapid calculation for efficient processing.</description>

      <title>Magnetoresistance in ZrSi$X$ ($X=$ S, Se, Te) nodal-line semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles study of the magnetoresistance in ZrSi$X$ ($X=$ S, Se, Te) topological nodal-line semimetals. Our study demonstrates that all primary features of the experimentally measured magnetoresistance in these materials are captured by our calculations, including the unusual butterfly-shaped anisotropic magnetoresistance. This anisotropic magnetoresistance can be accurately reproduced using the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory without introducing any information on the topological nature of bands or the concepts of topological phase transition. Considering the complex structure of the Fermi surface in these topological materials, we develop a theoretical description explaining the features observed in magnetoresistance measurements. Additionally, the atypical Hall resistance can be interpreted by the same semiclassical approach. Our findings establish magnetotransport as a powerful tool for analyzing the geometry of the Fermi surface, complementing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and quantum oscillation measurements. This approach is demonstrated to be particularly useful for determining the role of non-trivial topology in transport properties.</description>

      <title>Generalized Neumann's Principle as a Unified Framework for Fractional Quantum and Conventional Ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer In$_2$Se$3$ exhibits unexpected in-plane polarization, despite having $C_{3v}$ symmetry, a feature that was traditionally considered forbidden by symmetry. To explain this remarkable behavior, Ji et al. proposed the concept of fractional quantum ferroelectricity (FQFE), in which polarization occurs in fractional multiples of a quantum, and argued that this phenomenon violates Neumann's principle. However, we introduce a generalized form of Neumann's principle and demonstrate that both FQFE and conventional ferroelectricity can be consistently described within this unified theoretical framework.We propose a method, based on the generalized Neumann's principle, for the systematic identification of FQFE materials. This approach is not only more straightforward to apply but also offers a clearer conceptual understanding and deeper physical insight compared to previous methods. Using this method, we determine all symmetry-allowed FQFE cases across the 32 crystallographic point groups.Since practical applications rely on the ability to control polarization, we further show that FQFE can be effectively switched via coupling with conventional polarization. Using HfZnN$_2$ as an illustrative example, we reveal the underlying mechanism of this coupling and outline a strategy to identify other materials with similar switching behavior.</description>

      <title>Observing Nucleation and Crystallization of Rocksalt LiF from Molten State through Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Refined Machine-Learned Force Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium fluoride (LiF) is a critical component for stabilizing lithium metal anode and high-voltage cathodes towards the next-generation high-energy-density lithium batteries.Recent modeling study reported the formation of wurtzite LiF below about 550 K (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 1327-1333), in contrast to experimental observation of rocksalt LiF under ambient conditions. To address this discrepancy, we employ molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a refined machine-learned force field (MLFF), and demonstrate the nucleation and crystallization of rocksalt LiF from the molten phase at temperatures below about 800 K. The rocksalt phase remains stable in LiF nanoparticles. Complementary density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that dispersion interactions are essential for correctly predicting the thermodynamic stability of rocksalt LiF over the wurtzite phase on top of the commonly used PBE functional. Furthermore, we show that inclusion of virial stresses--alongside energies and forces--in the training of MLFFs is crucial for capturing phase nucleation and crystallization of rocksalt LiF under the isothermal-isobaric ensemble. These findings underscore the critical role of dispersion interactions in atomistic simulations of battery materials, where such effects are often non-negligible, and highlight the necessity of incorporating virial stresses during the training of MLFF to enable accurate modeling of solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>High Breakdown Electric Field (&gt; 5 MV/cm) in UWBG AlGaN Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the design and demonstration of ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN-channel metal-insulator heterostructure field effect transistors (HEFTs) for high-power, high-frequency applications. We find that the integration of gate dielectrics and field plates greatly improves the breakdown field in these devices, with state-of-art average breakdown field of 5.3 MV/cm (breakdown voltage &gt; 260 V) with an associated maximum current density of 342 mA/mm, and cut-off frequency of 9.1 GHz. Furthermore, low trap-related impact was observed from minimal gate and drain lag estimated from pulsed I-V characteristics. The reported results provide the potential of UWBG AlGaN HEFTs for the next generation high-power radio frequency applications.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of anisotropic effects in two-dimensional Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ using $\bf{k}$-dependent Green's functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we develop the Green's function apparatus and extend its applicability to the study of microscopic anisotropic effects in real conducting materials. The problem of the previously proposed approaches written in terms of inter-atomic Green's functions is the presence of a spatial sum over all atoms of the crystal, which greatly complicates their application to systems with itinerant electrons. To provide a solution we derived expressions for magnetic torque vector and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions based on $\bf{k}$-dependent Green's functions, which allow numerical evaluations with guaranteed stability of spatial sums over the crystal lattice and moreover with much lower computational cost. Approbation of the approaches on the case of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ monolayer, which is based on first-principles DFT calculations, confirmed the numerical stability and allowed us to reproduce the characteristic length of experimentally observed collective spin excitations in the domain structure of this promising conducting material.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast dynamics of vibronically dressed core-excitons in graphite: a femtosecond RIXS perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates one of the first implementations of time-resolved resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (tr-RIXS), marking a seminal extension of RIXS spectroscopy into the ultrafast time domain. By investigating the ultrafast dynamics of vibronically dressed core excitons in graphite using femtosecond X-ray pulses from a Free Electron Laser, we reveal previously inaccessible insights into the transient coupling between core excitons and specific optical phonon modes. Our approach establishes tr-RIXS as a powerful, transformative tool capable of elucidating the intricate interplay between electronic and lattice dynamics, opening new avenues in ultrafast materials research.</description>

      <title>Model calculations of the strains associated with surface acoustic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnon-phonon coupling has garnered increasing interest in condensed matter physics due to its fertile physics and potential applications in devices with novel functionalities. Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) are commonly employed as a source of coherent acoustic phonons. The strain associated with SAWs couples to magnetization of magnetic materials via magnetoelastic coupling and/or spin-rotation coupling. A typical SAW device is formed on a piezoelectric substrate with anisotropic crystal structure. Since the form of strain depends on the material parameters and structure of the SAW device, it is of vital importance to understand its character. In this paper, we present a comprehensive methodology to numerically calculate the SAW velocity, SAW excitation efficiency, lattice displacement and all strain components associated with SAW. LiNbO$_3$ is used as a prototypical material system. All quantities depend on the SAW propagation direction with respect to the crystalline axis and on the electrical boundary conditions. In contrast to non-piezoelectric isotropic media, we find that all shear strain components can be induced in LiNbO$_3$, with their amplitude and relative phase (with respect to the longitudinal strain) dependent on the propagation direction and the boundary conditions at the LiNbO$_3$ surface. These results offer a robust foundation for analyzing strain-driven magnon-phonon coupling mechanisms and contribute to designing strain-engineered functional magnonic and phononic devices.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent random phase approximation and optimized hybrid functionals for solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random phase approximation (RPA) and the $GW$ approximation share the same total energy functional but RPA is defined on a restricted domain of Green's functions determined by a local Kohn-Sham (KS) potential. In this work, we perform self-consistent RPA calculations by optimizing the local KS potential through the optimized effective potential equation. We study a number of solids (C, Si, BN, LiF, MgO, TiO$_2$), and find in all cases a lowering of the total energy with respect to non-self-consistent RPA. We then propose a variational approach to optimize PBE0-type hybrid functionals based on the minimization of the RPA total energy with respect to the fraction of exact exchange used to generate the input KS orbitals. We show that this scheme leads to hybrid functionals with a KS band structure in close agreement with RPA, and with lattice constants of similar accuracy as within RPA. Finally, we evaluate $G_0W_0$ gaps using RPA and hybrid KS potentials as starting points. Special attention is given to TiO$_2$, which exhibits a strong starting-point dependence.</description>

      <title>Accessing quasi-flat $\textit{f}$-bands to harvest large Berry curvature in NdGaSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bands away from the Fermi energy do not influence the electrical conduction. In typical rare-earth lanthanide compounds, the localized 4$\textit{f}$-electrons have a weak effect on the electrical conduction, limiting their influence on the Berry curvature and, hence, the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. However, a comprehensive study of the magnetic, thermodynamic, and transport properties of single-crystalline NdGaSi, guided by first-principles calculations, reveals a ferromagnetic ground state that induces a splitting of quasi-flat 4$\textit{f}$-electronic bands and positions them near the Fermi energy. The observation of an extraordinarily large intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of 1165 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ implies the direct involvement of localized states in the generation of non-trivial band crossings around the Fermi energy. These results are remarkable when compared to ferrimagnetic NdAlSi, which differs only in a non-magnetic atom (a change in the principal quantum number $\textit{n}$ of the outer $\textit{p}$ orbital) with the same number of valence electrons and does not exhibit any measurable anomalous Hall conductivity.</description>

      <title>A particle-based approach for the prediction of grain microstructures in solidification processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain microstructures are crucial to the mechanical properties, performance, and often lifetime of metallic components. Hence, the prediction of grain microstructures emerging from solidification processes at relevant macroscopic scale is essential to the design or optimization of new alloys and processing conditions. Yet, despite the broad range of multi-scale models proposed so far, all of them suffer from computational limitations, such that advances from computational and algorithm perspectives remain needed. Here, we present a novel approach for tracking crystallographic solidification grain envelopes capable of predicting competitive growth scenarios and columnar-to-equiaxed transitions for stationary grains. The model relies on classical assumptions and equations in use in several broadly used and thoroughly validated approaches (e.g. cellular automata). Yet, our approach defines the grain envelope using Lagrangian particles and tracks their evolution using an algorithm and an implementation relying on scalable libraries and using modern CPU/GPU architectures. The model is used to simulate several benchmarks of increasing complexity, and the results are compared to analytical, experimental, and numerical results from literature for the purpose of model validation. To highlight the applicability to real-world processes and the possibility of coupling the model with existing physics-based simulation tools, the model is also (one-way) coupled with a multiphysics laser-material-interaction model to simulate competitive grain growth during laser beam welding of steel.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the thermodynamics and mechanism behind the lowering of reduction temperatures in oxide mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen-based direct reduction offers a sustainable pathway to decarbonize the metal production industry. However, stable metal oxides, like Cr$_2$O$_3$, are notoriously difficult to reduce, requiring extremely high temperatures (above 1300 $^\circ$C). Herein, we show how reducing mixed oxides can be leveraged to lower hydrogen-based reduction temperatures of stable oxides and produce alloys in a single process. Using a newly developed thermodynamic framework, we predict the precise conditions (oxygen partial pressure, temperature, and oxide composition) needed for co-reduction. We showcase this approach by reducing Cr$_2$O$_3$ mixed with Fe$_2$O$_3$ at 1100 $^\circ$C, significantly lowering reduction temperatures (by $\geq$200 $^\circ$C). Our model and post-reduction atom probe tomography analysis elucidate that the temperature-lowering effect is driven by the lower chemical activity of Cr in the metallic phase. This strategy achieves low-temperature co-reduction of mixed oxides, dramatically reducing energy consumption and CO$_2$ emissions, while unlocking transformative pathways toward sustainable alloy design.</description>

      <title>X-ray linear dichroic orientation tomography: reconstruction of nanoscale three-dimensional orientation fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Properties in crystalline and ordered materials tend to be anisotropic, with their orientation affecting the macroscopic behavior and functionality of materials. The ability to image the orientation of anisotropic material properties in three dimensions (3D) is fundamental for the understanding and functionality-driven development of novel materials. With the development of X ray linear dichroic orientation tomography (XL DOT), it is now possible to non-destructively map three-dimensional (3D) orientation fields in micrometer-sized samples. In this work, we present the iterative, gradient-based reconstruction algorithm behind XL DOT that can be used to map orientations based on linear dichroism in 3D. As linear dichroism can be exhibited by a broad spectrum of materials, XL DOT can be used to map, for example, crystal orientations as well as ferroic alignment, such as ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic order. We demonstrate the robustness of this technique for orientation fields that exhibit smoothly varying and granular configurations, and subsequently identify and discuss optimal geometries for experimental data acquisition and optimal conditions for the reconstruction. We anticipate that this technique will be instrumental in enabling a deeper understanding of the relationship between material structures and their functionality, quantifying, for example, the orientation of charge distributions and magnetic anisotropies at the nanoscale in a wide variety of systems - from functional to energy materials.</description>

      <title>Design Topological Materials by Reinforcement Fine-Tuned Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) and topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) are materials with unconventional electronic properties, making their discovery highly valuable for practical applications. However, such materials, particularly those with a full band gap, remain scarce. Given the limitations of traditional approaches that scan known materials for candidates, we focus on the generation of new topological materials through a generative model. Specifically, we apply reinforcement fine-tuning (ReFT) to a pre-trained generative model, thereby aligning the model's objectives with our material design goals. We demonstrate that ReFT is effective in enhancing the model's ability to generate TIs and TCIs, with minimal compromise on the stability of the generated materials. Using the fine-tuned model, we successfully identify a large number of new topological materials, with Ge$_2$Bi$_2$O$_6$ serving as a representative example--a TI with a full band gap of 0.26 eV, ranking among the largest known in this category.</description>

      <title>Quantitative measurements of transverse thermoelectric generation and cooling performances in SmCo$_5$/Bi$_{0.2}$Sb$_{1.8}$Te$_3$-based artificially tilted multilayer module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse thermoelectric generation and cooling performances in a thermopile module composed of recently developed SmCo$_5$/Bi$_{0.2}$Sb$_{1.8}$Te$_3$ artificially tilted multilayers are evaluated quantitatively. When a large temperature difference of 405 $^\circ$C is applied to the SmCo$_5$/Bi$_{0.2}$Sb$_{1.8}$Te$_3$-based module, the open-circuit voltage and output power reach 0.51 V and 0.80 W, respectively, where the corresponding maximum power density is 0.16 W/cm$^2$. The maximum energy conversion efficiency for our module in this condition is experimentally determined to be 0.92%. Under the cooling operation, the same module exhibits the maximum temperature difference of 9.0 $^\circ$C and heat flow at the cold side of 1.6 W. Although these values are lower than the ideal thermoelectric performance expected from the material parameters due to the imperfections associated with modularization, the systematic investigations reported here clarify a potential of the SmCo$_5$/Bi$_{0.2}$Sb$_{1.8}$Te$_3$ artificially tilted multilayers as thermoelectric generators and cooling devices.</description>

      <title>Fermi surface and magnetic breakdown in PdGa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the electronic structure of the chiral semimetal PdGa by means of the de Haas-van Alphen and Shubnikov-de Haas effect. We find that the Fermi surface of PdGa comprises multiple pockets split by spin-orbit coupling. We compare our experimental findings with the band structure calculated ab initio. We demonstrate that the quantum oscillation spectra can be fully understood by considering nodal plane degeneracies at the Brillouin zone boundary and magnetic breakdown between individual Fermi surface pockets. Expanding traditional analysis methods, we explicitly calculate magnetic breakdown frequencies and cyclotron masses while taking into account that extremal breakdown trajectories may reside away from the planes of the single-band orbits. We further analyze high-frequency contributions arising from breakdown trajectories involving multiple revolutions around the Fermi surface which are distinct from conventional harmonic frequencies. Our results highlight the existence of gaps induced by spin-orbit coupling throughout the band structure of PdGa, the relevance of nodal planes on the Brillouin zone boundary, and the necessity for a comprehensive analysis of magnetic breakdown.</description>

      <title>Chiral crossroads in $\mathrm{Ho_3ScO_6}$: a tale of frustration in maple leaf lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observation of a uniform vector chirality (UVC) magnetic order in the maple-leaf lattice (MLL) realization $\mathrm{Ho_3ScO_6}$ via powder neutron scattering experiments, we investigate the classical antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the maple-leaf lattice. The MLL features three symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor couplings, $J_d$, $J_t$, and $J_h$. Previous studies, primarily focused on the case where $J_t = J_h$, identified a staggered vector chirality (SVC) order. Extending beyond this limit, we demonstrate that the SVC order remains stable across a broad parameter regime. However, we also find that the UVC order cannot emerge from the nearest-neighbor model alone. By introducing a further-neighbor antiferromagnetic interaction, $J_x$, we demonstrate that even a weak $J_x$ can cause a first-order phase transition from SVC to UVC order. Using linear spin wave theory, we compute the dynamical spin structure factor, revealing distinct signatures for SVC and UVC orders that can be probed through inelastic neutron scattering experiments. Additionally, we calculate the specific heat, which exhibits qualitative agreement with the experimental data for $\mathrm{Ho_3ScO_6}$. Our findings provide a minimal framework for understanding $\mathrm{Ho_3ScO_6}$ and related MLL systems, like $\mathrm{MgMn_3O_7.3H_2O}$, suggesting avenues for further experimental and theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Electrical Transport in the Kagome Magnet YbFe$_6$Ge$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) kagome metals offer a unique platform for exploring electron correlation phenomena derived from quantum many-body effects. Here, we report a combined study of electrical magnetotransport and neutron scattering on YbFe$_6$Ge$_6$, where the Fe moments in the 2D kagome layers exhibit an $A$-type collinear antiferromagnetic order below $T_{\rm{N}} \approx 500$ K. Interactions between the Fe ions in the layers and the localized Yb magnetic ions in between reorient the $c$-axis aligned Fe moments to the kagome plane below $T_{\rm{SR}} \approx 63$ K. Our magnetotransport measurements show an intriguing anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that emerges in the spin-reorientated collinear state, accompanied by the closing of the spin anisotropy gap as revealed from inelastic neutron scattering. The gapless spin excitations and the Yb-Fe interaction are able to support a dynamic scalar spin chirality, which explains the observed AHE. Therefore, our study demonstrates spin fluctuations may provide an additional scattering channel for the conduction electrons and give rise to AHE even in a collinear antiferromagnet.</description>

      <title>Multi-qubit nanoscale sensing with entanglement as a resource</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are widely deployed as local magnetic sensors, using coherent, single qubit control to measure both time-averaged fields and noise with nanoscale spatial resolution. Moving beyond single qubits to multi-qubit control enables new sensing modalities such as measuring nonlocal spatiotemporal correlators, or using entangled states to improve measurement sensitivity. Here, we describe protocols to use optically unresolved NV center pairs and nuclear spins as multi-qubit sensors for measuring correlated noise, enabling covariance magnetometry at nanometer length scales. For NV centers that are optically unresolved but have spectrally resolved spin transitions, we implement a phase-cycling protocol that disambiguates magnetic correlations from variance fluctuations by alternating the relative spin orientations of the two NV centers. For NV centers that are both optically and spectrally unresolved, we leverage the presence of a third qubit, a 13C nucleus that is strongly coupled to one of the NV centers, to effect coherent single-NV spin flips and enable a similar phase-cycling protocol. For length scales around 10 nm, we create maximally entangled Bell states through dipole-dipole coupling between two NV centers, and use these entangled states to directly read out the magnetic field correlation, rather than reconstructing it from independent measurements of unentangled NV centers. Importantly, this changes the scaling of sensitivity with readout noise from quadratic to linear. For conventional off-resonant readout of the NV center spin state (for which the readout noise is roughly 30 times the quantum projection limit), this results in a dramatic sensitivity improvement. Finally, we demonstrate methods for the detection of high spatial- and temporal-resolution correlators with pairs of strongly interacting NV centers.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Axion quasiparticle in 2D MnBi$_2$Te$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1978, Wilczek and Weinberg theoretically discovered a new boson-the Axion-which is the coherent oscillation of the $\theta$ field in QCD. Its existence can solve multiple fundamental questions including the strong CP problem of QCD and the dark matter. However, its detection is challenging because it has almost no interaction with existing particles. Similar $\theta$ has been introduced to condensed matter and so far studied as a static, quantized value to characterize topology of materials. But the coherent oscillation of $\theta$ in condensed matter is proposed to lead to new physics directly analogous to the high-energy Axion particle, the dynamical Axion quasiparticle (DAQ). In this paper, we present the direct observation of the DAQ. By combining 2D electronic device with ultrafast pump-probe optics, we manage to measure the magnetoelectric coupling $\theta$ ($\theta\propto\alpha$) of 2D MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ with sub-picosecond time-resolution. This allows us to directly observe the DAQ by seeing a coherent oscillation of $\theta$ at ~44 GHz in real time, which is uniquely induced by the out-of-phase antiferromagnetic magnon. Interestingly, in 2D MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, the DAQ arises from the magnon-induced coherent modulation of Berry curvature. Such ultrafast control of quantum wavefunction can be generalized to manipulate Berry curvature and quantum metric of other materials in ultrafast time-scale. Moreover, the DAQ enables novel quantum physics such as Axion polariton and electric control of ultrafast spin polarization, implying applications in unconventional light-matter interaction and coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics. Beyond condensed matter, the DAQ can serve as a detector of the dark matter Axion particle. We estimate the detection frequency range and sensitivity in the critically-lacking meV regime, contributing to one of the most challenging questions in fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Crystal growth, structure and physical properties of quasi-one-dimensional tellurides Fe$_{4-x}$VTe$_{4-y}$ ($x=1.01$, $y=0.74$) and V$_{4.64}$Te$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new ternary compound Fe$_{4-x}$VTe$_{4-y}$ ($x=1.01$, $y=0.74$) with Ti5Te4-type structure is identified. Fe and V atoms tend to occupy different crystallographic positions and form quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) Fe-V chains along the c-axis. Millimeter-sized single crystal of Fe$_{2.99}$VTe$_{3.26}$ (FVT) with slender-stick shape could be grown by chemical vapor transport method which reflects its quasi-1D crystal structure. Magnetization measurements reveal that FVT orders antiferromagnetically below T$_N$=93 K with strong easy ab-plane magnetic anisotropy. Although a weak glassy-like behavior appears below 10 K, FVT is dominant by long-range antiferromagnetic order in contrast to the spin-glass state in previously reported isostructural Fe$_{5}$Te$_{4}$. We also synthesize V$_{4.64}$Te$_4$ with similar quasi-1D V-chains and find it has weak anomalies at 144 K on both resistivity and susceptibility curves. However, no clear evidence is found for the development of magnetic or charge order. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Curie-Weiss fit reveal that the effective moments for Fe$^{2+}$ and V$^{4+}$ in both compounds have large deviations from the conventional local moment model, which may possibly result from the formation of Fe/V metal-metal bondings. Furthermore the resistivity of both FVT and V$_{4.64}$Te$_4$ exhibits semiconducting-like temperature-dependent behavior but with average values close to typical bad metals, which resembles the transport behavior in the normal state of Fe-based superconductors. These quasi-1D compounds have shown interesting physical properties for future condensed matter physics research.</description>

      <title>Combining the Maximum Overlap Method with Multiwavelets for Core-Ionisation Energy Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a protocol for computing core-ionisation energies for molecules, which is essential for reproducing X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. The electronic structure of both the ground state and the core-ionised states are computed using Multiwavelets and Density-Functional Theory, where the core ionisation energies are computed by virtue of the $\Delta$SCF method. To avoid the collapse of the core-hole state or its delocalisation, we make use of the Maximum Overlap Method, which provides a constraint on the orbital occupation. Combining Multiwavelets with the Maximum Overlap Method allows for the first time an all-electron calculation of core-ionisation energies with Multiwavelets, avoiding known issues connected to the use of Atomic Orbitals (slow convergence with respect to the basis set limit, numerical instabilities of core-hole states for large systems). We show that our results are consistent with previous Multiwavelet calculations which made use of pseudopotentials, and are generally more precise than corresponding Atomic Orbital calculations. We analyse the results in terms of precision compared to both Atomic Orbital calculations and Multiwavelets+pseudopotentials calculations. Moreover, we demonstrate how the protocol can be applied to target molecules of relatively large size. Both closed-shell and open-shell methods have been implemented.</description>

      <title>Crossover in Electronic Specific Heat near Narrow-Sense Type-III Dirac Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions exhibit Dirac cones, which are classified into three types: type-I, type-II, and type-III. In both type-I and type-II cones, the energy dispersion is linear in all momentum directions. Type-I cones are characterized by a non-overtilted structure, where the Dirac point serves as a local minimum (maximum) for the upper (lower) band. In contrast, type-II cones exhibit overtilted dispersions, leading to the coexistence of electron and hole pockets. At the critical tilt, the linear energy dispersion vanishes in one momentum direction, corresponding to a type-III Dirac cone. We further define a special case, termed the "narrow-sense" type-III cone, where not only the linear term but also quadratic and higher-order terms vanish, resulting in a completely flat dispersion along one direction. In this work, we numerically investigate the temperature ($T$) -dependence of the electronic specific heat ($C$), as the Dirac cone is continuously tilted from type-I to narrow-sense type-III. A model with particle-hole symmetry is employed to ensure that the chemical potential ($\mu$) remains temperature independent. Our results reveal a notable crossover in $C$ near narrow-sense type-III, where $C$ changes from $C \propto T^{2}$ below the crossover temperature ($T_{\rm co}$) to $C \propto T^{\frac{1}{2}}$ above $T_{\rm co}$. This crossover is attributed to the energy-dependent structure of the density of states. The present findings suggest a feasible approach for experimentally probing the degree of Dirac cone tilting near the narrow-sense type-III limit.</description>

      <title>Switching of an antiferromagnet controlled by spin canting in a laser-induced hidden phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During laser-induced phase transitions, fast transformations of electronic, atomic, and spin configurations often involve emergence of hidden and metastable phases. Being inaccessible under any other stimuli, such phases are indispensable for unveiling mechanisms and controlling the transitions. We experimentally explore spin kinetics during ultrafast first-order 90$^{\circ}$ spin-reorientation (SR) transition in a canted antiferromagnet Fe$_3$BO$_6$, and reveal that the transition is controlled by the canting between the magnetic sublattices. Laser-induced perturbation of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction results in a change of the intersublattice canting within first picoseconds, bringing Fe$_3$BO$_6$ to a hidden phase. Once this phase emerges, laser-induced heating activates precessional 90$^\circ$ spin switching. Combination of the spin canting and heating controls the final spin configuration comprising coexisting initial and switched phases. Extended phase coexistence range is in a striking contrast to the narrow SR transition in Fe$_3$BO$_6$ induced by conventional heating.</description>

      <title>Giant nematic response of the incommensurate charge density wave in the nickel-pnictide Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Ni$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron nematicity-the breaking of rotational symmetry while preserving translational symmetry-is the quantum analogue of classical nematic liquid crystals. First predicted in 1998, electronic nematicity has been established in a variety of materials, including two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) in magnetic fields, copper-oxide superconductors, and Fe-based superconductors. A long-standing open question is what physical mechanisms drive electronic nematic order. In BaFe$_2$As$_2$ and highly underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+y}$, strong evidence suggests that nematicity arises from vestigial spin-density-wave (SDW) order. However, evidence for nematicity associated with charge-density-wave (CDW) order has been less conclusive, particularly in systems near a superconducting state. Here, we present direct evidence for CDW-driven nematic fluctuations in the pnictide superconductor Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Ni$_2$As$_2$ (BSNA), a Ni-based homologue of Fe-based superconductors that exhibits CDW rather than SDW order. Previous elastoresistance studies have shown that BSNA displays a large nematic susceptibility-linked to a six-fold enhancement of superconductivity-within a region of the phase diagram occupied by an incommensurate CDW. Using x-ray scattering under uniaxial strain, we demonstrate that even minimal strain levels ($\epsilon \sim 10^{-4}$) significantly break the fourfold symmetry of the CDW. Within a Ginzburg-Landau framework, we define a nematic susceptibility based on the asymmetric response of symmetry-related CDW superlattice reflections, showing strong agreement with elastoresistivity measurements. Our study provides the first clear demonstration of a direct link between charge order and a nematic state, offering key insights into the intertwined superconducting phases of these materials.</description>

      <title>Minute-long quantum coherence enabled by electrical depletion of magnetic noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating solid-state spin defects into classical electronic devices can enable new opportunities for quantum information processing that benefit from existing semiconductor technology. We show, through bias control of an isotopically purified silicon carbide (SiC) p-i-n diode, the depletion of not only electrical noise sources but also magnetic noise sources, resulting in record coherences for SiC electron spin qubits. We also uncover complementary improvements to the relaxation times of nuclear spin registers controllable by the defect, and measure diode-enhanced coherences. These improvements lead to record-long nuclear spin Hahn-echo times on the scale of minutes. These results demonstrate the power of materials control and electronic device integration to create highly coherent solid-state quantum network nodes and processors.</description>

      <title>Simulating the anharmonic phonon spectrum in critical systems: self-consistent phonons and temperature-dependent effective potential methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and simulating the thermodynamic and dynamical properties of materials affected by strong ionic anharmonicity is a central challenge in material science. Much interest is in material displaying critical displacive behaviour, such as near a ferroelectric transition, charge-density waves, or in general displacive second-order transitions. In these cases, molecular dynamics suffer from a critical slowdown and emergent long-range fluctuations of the order parameter. Two prominent methods have emerged to solve this issue: Self-consistent renormalization of the phonons like the Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SCHA) and Self-Consistent Phonons (SCP), and methods that fit the potential energy landscape from short molecular dynamics trajectories, like the Temperature-Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP). Despite their widespread use, the limitations of these methods are often overlooked in the proximity of critical points.
  Here, we establish a guiding rule set for the accuracy of each method on critical quantities: free energy for computing the phase diagrams, static correlation functions for inferring phase stability and critical behaviours, and dynamic correlation functions for vibrational spectra and thermal transport. Also, a new TDEP implementation is introduced to fix the calculation of dynamical spectra, restoring the correct perturbative limit violated by the standard TDEP approach.
  Results are benchmarked both against an exact one-dimensional anharmonic potential and two prototypical anharmonic crystals: the ferroelectric PbTe and the metal-halide perovskite CsSnI3.</description>

      <title>SymmCD: Symmetry-Preserving Crystal Generation with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating novel crystalline materials has the potential to lead to advancements in fields such as electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. The defining characteristic of crystals is their symmetry, which plays a central role in determining their physical properties. However, existing crystal generation methods either fail to generate materials that display the symmetries of real-world crystals, or simply replicate the symmetry information from examples in a database. To address this limitation, we propose SymmCD, a novel diffusion-based generative model that explicitly incorporates crystallographic symmetry into the generative process. We decompose crystals into two components and learn their joint distribution through diffusion: 1) the asymmetric unit, the smallest subset of the crystal which can generate the whole crystal through symmetry transformations, and; 2) the symmetry transformations needed to be applied to each atom in the asymmetric unit. We also use a novel and interpretable representation for these transformations, enabling generalization across different crystallographic symmetry groups. We showcase the competitive performance of SymmCD on a subset of the Materials Project, obtaining diverse and valid crystals with realistic symmetries and predicted properties.</description>

      <title>Resistive switching and charge accumulation in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revealed the resistive switching, negative differential resistance and charge accumulation effects in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders sintered by the auto-combustion sol-gel method and annealed at temperatures from 500{\deg}C to 800{\deg}C. The fraction of the orthorhombic phase, determined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), decreases from 91 vol.% to 7 vol.% with an increase in the annealing temperature from 600{\deg}C to 800{\deg}C. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra reveal the great amount of oxygen vacancies in the annealed samples, at that the decrease of the orthorhombic phase fraction (observed with an increase in the annealing temperature) correlates with a decrease in the intensity of EPR spectral lines associated with the oxygen vacancies and impurities. This indicates the participation of oxygen vacancies and other defects in the formation of the orthorhombic phase in the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders. To explain the results of electrophysical measurements, we compare the features of the current-voltage characteristics with the phase composition of the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders and with the peculiarities of their EPR spectra. The analysis allows us to relate the resistive switching and charge accumulation observed in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders with the appearance of the ferroelectric-like polar regions in the orthorhombic phase of the nanoparticles, which agrees with the calculations performed in the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach and density functional theory.</description>

      <title>The effects of disorder in superconducting materials on qubit coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Introducing disorderness in the superconducting materials has been considered promising to enhance the electromagnetic impedance and realize noise-resilient superconducting qubits. Despite a number of pioneering implementations, the understanding of the correlation between the material disorderness and the qubit coherence is still developing. Here, we demonstrate a systematic characterization of fluxonium qubits with the superinductors made from titanium-aluminum-nitride with varied disorderness. From qubit noise spectroscopy, the flux noise and the dielectric loss are extracted as a measure of the coherence properties. Our results reveal that the $1/f$ flux noise dominates the qubit decoherence around the flux-frustration point, strongly correlated with the material disorderness; while the dielectric loss remains low under a wide range of material properties. From the flux-noise amplitudes, the areal density ($\sigma$) of the phenomenological spin defects and material disorderness are found to be approximately correlated by $\sigma \propto \rho_{xx}^3$, or effectively $(k_F l)^{-3}$. This work has provided new insights on the origin of decoherence channels within superconductors, and could serve as a useful guideline for material design and optimization.</description>

      <title>Resonant second harmonic generation in a two-dimensional electron system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear response of a disordered two-dimensional electronic system, lacking inversion symmetry, to an external alternating electric field. The application of an in-plane static magnetic field induces local contributions to the current density that are quadratic in the electric field and linear in the magnetic field. This current oscillates at twice the frequency of the external irradiation and there are two linearly independent vector combinations that contribute to the current density. This particular mechanism coexists with the topological Berry-dipole contribution to the second harmonic of the current density, which can be generated by quantum confinement. Additional nonlocal terms in the current density are possible in the regime away from the normal incidence. The total current exhibits a nonreciprocal character upon reversal of the magnetic field direction. We evaluate the magnitude of this effect by computing its dependence on the strength of spin-orbit coupling and the disorder scattering rate. Importantly, we show that these local second-harmonic contributions can be resonantly excited when the frequency of the external radiation approaches the energy separation between the spin-orbit split bands.</description>

      <title>Infrared Phonon Thermoreflectance in Polar Dielectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate dielectric materials for thermoreflectance-based thermal sensing by extracting key optical parameters using temperature-dependent spectroscopic ellipsometry in the mid-infrared regime. Leveraging optical phonon resonances, we demonstrate that the thermoreflectance coefficients in polar dielectrics rival, and in some cases exceed by an order of magnitude, those observed in commonly used metals that are typically used as temperature transducers in thermoreflectance measurements. We introduce a transducer figure of merit (FOM) that combines pump absorption and probe reflectance modulation at different wavelengths. Our findings reveal that materials such as sapphire and aluminum nitride can outperform metals by up to two orders of magnitude. These results position dielectric materials as compelling candidates for next-generation thermal metrology, broadening the design space for optical thermometry, with strong implications for high-resolution thermal mapping and characterization of layered device structures based on phonon probing.</description>
