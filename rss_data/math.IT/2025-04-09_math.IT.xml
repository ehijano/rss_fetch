      <title>Several new infinite families of NMDS codes with arbitrary dimensions supporting $t$-designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near maximum distance separable (NMDS) codes, where both the code and its dual are almost maximum distance separable, play pivotal roles in combinatorial design theory and cryptographic applications. Despite progress in fixed dimensions (e.g., dimension 4 codes by Ding and Tang \cite{Ding2020}), constructing NMDS codes with arbitrary dimensions supporting $t$-designs ($t\geq 2$) has remained open. In this paper, we construct two infinite families of NMDS codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ for any prime power $q$ with flexible dimensions and determine their weight distributions. Further, two additional families with arbitrary dimensions over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ supporting $2$-designs and $3$-designs, and their weight distributions are obtained. Our results fully generalize prior fixed-dimension works~\cite{DingY2024,Heng2023,Heng20231,Xu2022}, and affirmatively settle the Heng-Wang conjecture \cite{Heng2023} on the existence of NMDS codes with flexible parameters supporting $2$-designs.</description>

      <title>Locally Repairable Convertible Codes: Improved Lower Bound and General Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the convertible code with locally repairable property. We present an improved lower bound on access cost associated with $(r,\delta)$. Then, we provide a general construction of convertible codes with optimal access cost which shows that those codes can be with super-linear length or maximum repairable property. Additionally, employing the known locally repairable codes with super-linear length or maximum repairable property, we provide explicit constructions of convertible codes with super-linear length or maximum repairable property.</description>

      <title>Analog Computing with Microwave Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog computing has been recently revived due to its potential for energy-efficient and highly parallel computations. In this paper, we investigate analog computers that linearly process microwave signals, named microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs), and their applications in signal processing for communications. We model a MiLAC as a multiport microwave network with tunable impedance components, which enables the execution of mathematical operations by reconfiguring the microwave network and applying input signals at its ports. We demonstrate that a MiLAC can efficiently compute the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator, widely used in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications beamforming and detection, with remarkably low computational complexity, unachievable through digital computing. Specifically, the LMMSE estimator can be computed with complexity growing with the square of its input size, rather than the cube, with revolutionary applications to gigantic MIMO beamforming and detection.</description>

      <title>Optimality of Gradient-MUSIC for Spectral Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of spectral estimation is to estimate the frequencies and amplitudes of a nonharmonic Fourier sum given noisy time samples. This paper introduces the Gradient-MUSIC algorithm, which is a novel nonconvex optimization reformulation of the classical MUSIC algorithm. Under the assumption that $m\Delta\geq 8\pi$, where $\pi/m$ is the Nyquist rate and $\Delta$ is the minimum separation of the frequencies normalized to be in $[0,2\pi)$, we provide a thorough geometric analysis of the objective functions generated by the algorithm. Gradient-MUSIC thresholds the objective function on a set that is as coarse as possible and locates a set of suitable initialization for gradient descent. Although the objective function is nonconvex, gradient descent converges exponentially fast to the desired local minima, which are the estimated frequencies of the signal. For deterministic $\ell^p$ perturbations and any $p\in [1,\infty]$, Gradient-MUSIC estimates the frequencies and amplitudes at the minimax optimal rate in terms of the noise level and $m$. For example, if the noise has $\ell^\infty$ norm at most $\epsilon$, then the frequencies and amplitudes are recovered up to error at most $C\epsilon/m$ and $C\epsilon$, respectively, which are optimal in $\epsilon$ and $m$. Aside from logarithmic factors, Gradient-MUSIC is optimal for white noise and matches the rate achieved by nonlinear least squares for various families of nonstationary independent Gaussian noise. Our results show that classical MUSIC is equally optimal, but it requires an expensive search on a thin grid, whereas Gradient-MUSIC is always computationally more efficient, especially for small noise. As a consequence of this paper, for sufficiently well separated frequencies, both Gradient-MUSIC and classical MUSIC are the first provably optimal and computationally tractable algorithms for deterministic $\ell^p$ perturbations.</description>

      <title>Finite Field Multiple Access III: from 2-ary to p-ary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends finite-field multiple-access (FFMA) techniques from binary to general $p$-ary source transmission. We introduce element-assemblage (EA) codes over GF($p^m$), generalizing element-pair (EP) codes, and define two specific types for ternary transmission: orthogonal EA codes and double codeword EA (D-CWEA) codes. A unique sum-pattern mapping (USPM) constraint is proposed for the design of uniquely-decodable CWEA (UD-CWEA) codes, including additive inverse D-CWEA (AI-D-CWEA) and basis decomposition D-CWEA (BD-D-CWEA) codes. Moreover, we extend EP-coding to EA-coding, focusing on non-orthogonal CWEA (NO-CWEA) codes and their USPM constraint in the complex field. Additionally, $p$-ary CWEA codes are constructed using a basis decomposition method, leveraging ternary decomposition for faster convergence and simplified encoder/decoder design. We present a comprehensive performance analysis of the proposed FFMA system from two complementary perspectives: channel capacity and error performance. We demonstrate that equal power allocation (EPA) achieves the theoretical channel capacity bound, while independently developing a rate-driven capacity alignment (CA) theorem based on the capacity-to-rate ratio (CRR) metric for error performance analysis. We then explore the multiuser finite blocklength (FBL) characteristics of FFMA systems. Finally, a comparative analysis of $p$-ary transmission systems against classical binary systems is conducted, revealing that low-order $p$-ary systems (e.g., $p=3$) outperform binary systems at small loading factors, while higher-order systems (e.g., $p=257$) excel at larger loading factors. These findings highlight the potential of $p$-ary systems, although practical implementations may benefit from decomposing $p$-ary systems into ternary systems to manage complexity.</description>

      <title>The Future of IPTV: Security, AI Integration, 5G, and Next-Gen Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13450v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) has transformed the landscape of digital broadcasting by leveraging high-speed internet connectivity to deliver high-quality multimedia content. IPTV provides a dynamic and interactive television experience through managed networks, ensuring superior Quality of Service (QoS) compared to open-network Internet TV. This study explores the technical infrastructure of IPTV, including its network architecture, data compression techniques, and the role of protocols such as IGMP and RTSP. It also examines security challenges, including encryption, digital rights management (DRM), and authentication mechanisms that safeguard IPTV services from unauthorized access and piracy. Moreover, the paper analyzes the distinctions between IPTV and open-network Internet TV, highlighting their respective advantages and limitations in terms of service control, bandwidth optimization, and content security. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in IPTV enhances personalized content recommendations and predictive analytics, leading to improved user engagement and efficient network management. Additionally, emerging technologies such as 5G and cloud-based IPTV services are explored for their potential to further revolutionize the industry. While IPTV presents a robust alternative to traditional broadcasting, challenges such as bandwidth constraints, cybersecurity threats, and regulatory compliance remain significant. The study concludes that IPTV's future success will depend on advancements in network infrastructure, AI-driven optimizations, and strategic regulatory adaptations. As IPTV continues to evolve, hybrid models integrating IPTV and open-network streaming services are expected to enhance content accessibility, security, and overall user experience.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reverse Shannon Theorem Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reverse Shannon theorems concern the use of noiseless channels to simulate noisy ones. This is dual to the usual noisy channel coding problem, where a noisy (classical or quantum) channel is used to simulate a noiseless one. The Quantum Reverse Shannon Theorem is extensively studied by Bennett and co-authors in [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2014]. They present two distinct theorems, each tailored to classical and quantum channel simulations respectively, explaining the fact that these theorems remain incomparable due to the fundamentally different nature of correlations they address. The authors leave as an open question the challenge of formulating a unified theorem that could encompass the principles of both and unify them. We unify these two theorems into a single, comprehensive theorem, extending it to the most general case by considering correlations with a general mixed-state reference system. Furthermore, we unify feedback and non-feedback theorems by simulating a general side information system at the encoder side.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Enabled Large AI Models for CSI Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10629v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool for channel state information (CSI) feedback. While recent research primarily focuses on improving feedback accuracy on a specific dataset through novel architectures, the underlying mechanism of AI-based CSI feedback remains unclear. This study explores the mechanism through analyzing performance across diverse datasets, with findings suggesting that superior feedback performance stems from AI models' strong fitting capabilities and their ability to leverage environmental knowledge. Building on these findings, we propose a prompt enabled large AI model (LAM) for CSI feedback. The LAM employs powerful transformer blocks and is trained on extensive datasets from various scenarios. Meanwhile, the channel distribution (environmental knowledge) -- represented as the mean of channel magnitude in the angular-delay domain -- is incorporated as a prompt within the decoder to further enhance reconstruction quality. Simulation results confirm that the proposed prompt-enabled LAM significantly improves feedback accuracy and generalization performance while reducing data collection requirements in new scenarios.</description>

      <title>Computable and Faithful Lower Bound on Entanglement Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the minimum entanglement needed to prepare quantum states and implement quantum processes is a key challenge in quantum information theory. In this work, we develop computable and faithful lower bounds on the entanglement cost under quantum operations that completely preserve the positivity of partial transpose (PPT operations), by introducing logarithmic $k$-negativity, a generalization of logarithmic negativity. Our bounds are efficiently computable via semidefinite programming and provide non-trivial values for all states that are not PPT, establishing their faithfulness. Notably, we find and affirm the irreversibility of asymptotic entanglement manipulation under PPT operations for full-rank entangled states. Furthermore, we extend our methodology to derive lower bounds on the entanglement cost of both point-to-point and bipartite quantum channels. Our bound demonstrates improvements over previously known computable bounds for a wide range of states and channels. These findings push the boundaries of understanding the structure of entanglement and the fundamental limits of entanglement manipulation.</description>

      <title>Estimation of embedding vectors in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embeddings are a basic initial feature extraction step in many machine learning models, particularly in natural language processing. An embedding attempts to map data tokens to a low-dimensional space where similar tokens are mapped to vectors that are close to one another by some metric in the embedding space. A basic question is how well can such embedding be learned? To study this problem, we consider a simple probability model for discrete data where there is some "true" but unknown embedding where the correlation of random variables is related to the similarity of the embeddings. Under this model, it is shown that the embeddings can be learned by a variant of low-rank approximate message passing (AMP) method. The AMP approach enables precise predictions of the accuracy of the estimation in certain high-dimensional limits. In particular, the methodology provides insight on the relations of key parameters such as the number of samples per value, the frequency of the terms, and the strength of the embedding correlation on the probability distribution. Our theoretical findings are validated by simulations on both synthetic data and real text data.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Relative Representations for Goal-Oriented Semantic Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In future 6G wireless networks, semantic and effectiveness aspects of communications will play a fundamental role, incorporating meaning and relevance into transmissions. However, obstacles arise when devices employ diverse languages, logic, or internal representations, leading to semantic mismatches that might jeopardize understanding. In latent space communication, this challenge manifests as misalignment within high-dimensional representations where deep neural networks encode data. This paper presents a novel framework for goal-oriented semantic communication, leveraging relative representations to mitigate semantic mismatches via latent space alignment. We propose a dynamic optimization strategy that adapts relative representations, communication parameters, and computation resources for energy-efficient, low-latency, goal-oriented semantic communications. Numerical results demonstrate our methodology's effectiveness in mitigating mismatches among devices, while optimizing energy consumption, delay, and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis and Low-Complexity Beamforming Design for Near-Field Physical Layer Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale arrays (XL-arrays) have emerged as a key enabler in achieving the unprecedented performance requirements of future wireless networks, leading to a significant increase in the range of the near-field region. This transition necessitates the spherical wavefront model for characterizing the wireless propagation rather than the far-field planar counterpart, thereby introducing extra degrees of freedom (DoFs) to wireless system design. In this paper, we explore the beam focusing-based physical layer security (PLS) in the near field, where multiple legitimate users and one eavesdropper are situated in the near-field region of the XL-array base station (BS). First, we consider a special case with one legitimate user and one eavesdropper to shed useful insights into near-field PLS. In particular, it is shown that 1) Artificial noise (AN) is crucial to near-field security provisioning, transforming an insecure system to a secure one; 2) AN can yield numerous security gains, which considerably enhances PLS in the near field as compared to the case without AN taken into account. Next, for the general case with multiple legitimate users, we propose an efficient low-complexity approach to design the beamforming with AN to guarantee near-field secure transmission. Specifically, the low-complexity approach is conceived starting by introducing the concept of interference domain to capture the inter-user interference level, followed by a three-step identification framework for designing the beamforming. Finally, numerical results reveal that 1) the PLS enhancement in the near field is pronounced thanks to the additional spatial DoFs; 2) the proposed approach can achieve close performance to that of the computationally-extensive conventional approach yet with a significantly lower computational complexity.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the concept of a sum-rank saturating system and outline its correspondence to a covering properties of a sum-rank metric code. We consider the problem of determining the shortest sum-rank-$\rho$-saturating systems of a fixed dimension, which is equivalent to the covering problem in the sum-rank metric. We obtain upper and lower bounds on this quantity. We also give constructions of saturating systems arising from geometrical structures.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Aided Channel Estimation: Zone-Specific Subspace Prediction and Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective channel estimation in sparse and high-dimensional environments is essential for next-generation wireless systems, particularly in large-scale MIMO deployments. This paper introduces a novel framework that leverages digital twins (DTs) as priors to enable efficient zone-specific subspace-based channel estimation (CE). Subspace-based CE significantly reduces feedback overhead by focusing on the dominant channel components, exploiting sparsity in the angular domain while preserving estimation accuracy. While DT channels may exhibit inaccuracies, their coarse-grained subspaces provide a powerful starting point, reducing the search space and accelerating convergence. The framework employs a two-step clustering process on the Grassmann manifold, combined with reinforcement learning (RL), to iteratively calibrate subspaces and align them with real-world counterparts. Simulations show that digital twins not only enable near-optimal performance but also enhance the accuracy of subspace calibration through RL, highlighting their potential as a step towards learnable digital twins.</description>

      <title>The Cloud and Flock Polynomials of q-Matroids</title>

Abstract: We show that the Whitney function of a q-matroid can be determined from the cloud and flock polynomials associated to the cyclic flats. These polynomials capture information about the corank (resp., nullity) of certain spaces whose cyclic core (resp., closure) is the given cyclic flat. Going one step further, we prove that the Whitney function, and in fact the cloud-flock lattice, are determined by the configuration of the q-matroid, which is the abstract lattice of cyclic flats together with the corank-nullity data. Furthermore, we show that the configuration and cloud-flock lattice behave well under duality and direct sums, whereas the Whitney function does not contain enough information to behave well under taking direct sums. As an aside we show that every configuration of a matroid arises as a configuration of a q-matroid, whereas the converse is not true.</description>
