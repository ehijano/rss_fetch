      <title>Ubiquitous Small-scale EUV Upflow-Like Events above Network Regions Observed by the Solar Orbiter/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal small-scale solar activity in quiet region are suggested to be a potential source of solar wind and the upper solar atmosphere. Here, with the high-resoltion 174 \AA~imaging observations from the Solar Orbiter/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI), we investigate 59 EUV upflow-like events observed in the quiet Sun. Their average apparent (plane-of-sky) velocity, lifetime, and propagation distance are measured as 62 $\speed$, 68.6 s and 3.94 Mm, respectively. These upflow-like events exhibit dynamic characteristics but lack base brightening, featuring a hot front and subsequent cold plasma ejection. 39\% of the EUV upflow-like events exhibit recurrent characteristics. Unprecedented high-resolution 174 \AA~observations reveal that some EUV upflow-like events exhibit blob-like fine structures and multi-strand evolutionary features, and some upflow-like events can cause localized haze-like plasma heating ahead of their spire region during the ejection process. A subset of the EUV upflow-like events covered by the Solar Dynamics Observatory reveals that they appear at the chromospheric networks. Through emission measure analysis, we found that these upflow-like events eject hot plasma of transient region or coronal temperature (an average of $\sim$10$^{5.5}$K). We suggest that EUV upflow-like events may be EUV counterparts of chromospheric spicules and/or transition region network jets, and play a role in heating localized corona above the network regions.</description>

      <title>Precise and efficient modeling of stellar-activity-affected solar spectra using SOAP-GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main obstacles in exoplanet detection when using the radial velocity (RV) technique is the presence of stellar activity signal induced by magnetic regions. In this context, a realistic simulated dataset that can provide photometry and spectroscopic outputs is needed for method development. The goal of this paper is to describe two realistic simulations of solar activity obtained from SOAP-GPU and to compare them with real data obtained from the HARPS-N solar telescope. We describe two different methods of modeling solar activity using SOAP-GPU. The first models the evolution of active regions based on the spot number as a function of time. The second method relies on the extraction of active regions from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) data. The simulated spectral time series generated with the first method shows a long-term RV behavior similar to that seen in the HARPS-N solar observations. The effect of stellar activity induced by stellar rotation is also well modeled with prominent periodicities at the stellar rotation period and its first harmonic. The comparison between the simulated spectral time series generated using SDO images and the HARPS-N solar spectra shows that SOAP-GPU can precisely model the RV time series of the Sun to a precision better than 0.9 m/s. By studying the width and depth variations of each spectral line in the HARPS-N solar and SOAP-GPU data, we find a strong correlation between the observation and the simulation for strong spectral lines, therefore supporting the modeling of the stellar activity effect at the spectral level. These simulated solar spectral time series serve as a useful test bed for evaluating spectral-level stellar activity mitigation techniques.</description>

      <title>Open Superclusters II. Discovery of an Inactive Supercluster Including a New Open Cluster in the Solar Neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and properties of open superclusters within 500 pc of the Sun, with a particular focus on a newly identified OSC, designated HC8. Utilizing Gaia-derived advanced astrometric data and star cluster catalogs, we identify and analyze the member stars of various open clusters (OCs), deriving key parameters such as ages, distances, extinctions, and kinematic properties. Our findings reveal that HC8, a previously unrecognized OSC, encompasses several young clusters, including the newly discovered OC Duvia 1. We provide a detailed examination of HC8's star formation history and its spatial and kinematic characteristics. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the existence of primordial groups and enhances our understanding of the formation and evolution of star clusters in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>The Mira discovery problem -- Observations by David Fabricius in 1596 and 1609 (and by others before?): Positional accuracy, brightness, color index, and period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pulsating variable star Mira (omikron Ceti) was observed by David Fabricius (Frisia) in 1596 and 1609. We review suggested previous detections (e.g. China, Hipparchos). We analyze all Mira records from Fabricius in their historical context. Fabricius measured the separation of Mira to other stars to \pm 1.6-1.7'. From his texts, we derive a brightness (slightly brighter than Hamal) of ca. 1.9 \pm 0.1 mag and a color index B-V \simeq 1.3-1.4 mag (`like Mars') for 1596 Aug 3 (jul.). Mira started to fainten 19 days later and was observed until mid/late Oct. We show why such a red star cannot be followed by the naked eye until ca. 6 mag: For Mira's color at disappearance and altitude from Frisia, the limit is reduced by ca. 1.0 mag. Since Fabricius connected the Mira brightening with the close-by prograde Jupiter, he re-detected it only 12 years later, probably shortly before a relatively bright maximum - discoveries are strongly affected by biases. A Mira period of 330.2 days is consistent with both the oldest data (from Fabricius 1596 to Hevelius 1660) and the most current data (VSX 2004-2023), so that we see no evidence for secular period or phase shifts. (We also present Fabricius' observations of P Cygni in 1602.)</description>

      <title>Current and secular accretion rates of EX Hydrae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an observed accretion rate of $\dot M_1 = (3.86\pm0.60)\times 10^{-11}$ $M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for the white dwarf in the short-period, intermediate polar EX Hya. This result is based upon the accretion-induced $4\pi$-averaged energy flux from 2.45 $\mu$m to 100 keV and the corresponding luminosity at the Gaia distance of 56.77 pc. Our result is in perfect agreement with the theoretical mass transfer rate from the secondary star induced by gravitational radiation (GR) and the spin-up of the white dwarf, $-\dot M_2 = (3.90\pm0.35)\times 10^{-11}$ $M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$; 24% of it is caused by the spin-up. The agreement indicates that mass transfer is conservative. The measured $\dot M_1$ obviates the need for angular momentum loss (AML) by any process other than GR. We complemented this result with an estimate of the mean secular mass transfer rate over $\sim 10^7$ yr by interpreting the non-equilibrium radius of the secondary star in EX Hya based on published evolutionary calculations. This suggests a time-averaged mass transfer rate enhanced over GR by a factor $f_{\mathrm{GR}} \gtrsim 2$. Combined with the present-day lack of such an excess, we suggest that an enhanced secular AML is due to an intermittently active process, such as the proposed frictional motion of the binary in the remnants of nova outbursts. We argue that EX Hya, despite its weakly magnetic nature, has evolved in a very similar way to non-magnetic CVs. We speculate that the discontinuous nature of an enhanced secular AML may similarly apply to the latter.</description>

      <title>Interplay of large-scale drift and turbulence in the heliospheric propagation of solar energetic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gradient and curvature of the Parker spiral interplanetary magnetic field give rise to curvature and gradient guiding centre drifts on cosmic rays. The plasma turbulence present in the interplanetary space is thought to suppress the drifts, however the extent to which they are reduced is not clear. We investigate the reduction of the drifts using a new analytic model of heliospheric turbulence where the dominant 2D component has both the wave vector and the magnetic field vector normal to the Parker spiral, thus fulfilling the main criterion of 2D turbulence. We use full-orbit test particle simulations of energetic protons in the modelled interplanetary turbulence, and analyse the mean drift velocity of the particles in heliolatitude. We release energetic proton populations of 10, 100 and 1000~MeV close to Sun and introduce a new method to assess their drift. We compare the drift in the turbulent heliosphere to drift in a configuration without turbulence, and to theoretical estimates of drift reduction. We find that drifts are reduced by a factor 0.2-0.9 of that expected for the heliospheric configuration without turbulence. This corresponds to a much less efficient suppression than what is predicted by theoretical estimates, particularly at low proton energies. We conclude that guiding centre drifts are a significant factor for the evolution of cosmic ray intensities in the heliosphere including the propagation of solar energetic particles in the inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Radial velocity variability fractions of different types of hot subdwarf stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different types of hot subdwarfs may have different origins, which will cause them to present different radial velocity (RV) variability properties. Only 6$\pm$4% of our single-lined He-rich hot subdwarfs that only show spectroscopic features of hot subdwarfs are found to be RV variable, which is lower than the fraction of single-lined He-poor sdB stars (31$\pm$3%). Single-lined sdB stars with effective temperatures ($T_{\rm eff}$) $\sim$ 25,000 $-$ 33,000 K show an RV-variability fraction of 34$\pm$5%, while lower RV-variability fractions are observed for single-lined sdB stars cooler than about 25,000 K (11$\pm$4%), single-lined sdB/OB stars with $T_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 33,000 $-$ 40,000 K and surface gravities about 5.7 $-$ 6.0 (13$\pm$3%), as well as single-lined sdO/B stars with $T_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 45,000 $-$ 70,000 K (10$\pm$7%). Single-lined hot subdwarfs with $T_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 35,000 $-$ 45,000 K located above the extreme horizontal branch (EHB) show a similar RV-variability fraction of 34$\pm$9% as single-lined sdB stars at about 25,000 $-$ 33,000 K. The largest RV-variability fraction of 51$\pm$8% is found in single-lined hot subdwarfs below the canonical EHB. The detected RV-variability fraction of our composite hot subdwarfs with an infrared excess in their spectral energy distributions is 9$\pm$3%, which is lower than that fraction of single-lined hot subdwarfs. Since the average RV uncertainty we measured in the LAMOST spectra is about 7.0 km/s, the lower detected RV-variability fraction for composite hot subdwarfs is expected because the RV amplitudes associated with long-period systems are lower.</description>

      <title>Components and anisotropy of 3D QFP waves during the early solar eruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of disturbances in the solar atmosphere is inherently three dimensional (3D), yet comprehensive studies on the spatial structure and dynamics of 3D wavefronts are scarce. Here we conduct high resolution 3D numerical simulations to investigate filament eruptions, focusing particularly on the 3D structure and genesis of EUV waves. Our results demonstrate that the EUV wavefront forms a dome like configuration subdivided into three distinct zones. The foremost zone, preceding the flux rope, consists of fast-mode shock waves that heat the adjacent plasma. Adjacent to either side of the flux rope, the second zone contains expansion waves that cool the nearby plasma. The third zone, at the juncture of the first two, exhibits minimal disturbances. This anisotropic structure of the wavefront stems from the configuration and dynamics of the flux rope, which acts as a 3D piston during eruptions :compressing the plasma ahead to generate fast mode shocks and evacuating the plasma behind to induce expansion waves. This dynamic results in the observed anisotropic wavefront.Additionally, with synthetic EUV images from simulation data, the EUV waves are observable in Atmospheric Imaging Assembly 193 and 211 angstrom, which are identified as the fast mode shocks. The detection of EUV waves varies with the observational perspective: the face on view reveals EUV waves from the lower to the higher corona, whereas an edge on view uncovers these waves only in the higher corona.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Massive Stellar Multiplicity in the Field I. Numerical simulations, long-term evolution and final outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the multiplicity of binary, triple and quadruple star systems changes as the systems evolve from the zero-age main-sequence to the Hubble time. We find the change in multiplicity fractions over time for each data set, identify the number of changes to the orbital configuration and the dominant underlying physical mechanism responsible for each configuration change. Finally, we identify key properties of the binaries which survive the evolution.
  We use the stellar evolution population synthesis code Multiple Stellar Evolution (MSE) to follow the evolution of $3 \times 10^4$ of each 1+1 binaries, 2+1 triples, 3+1 quadruples and 2+2 quadruples. The coupled stellar and orbital evolution are computed each iteration. The systems are assumed to be isolated and to have formed in situ. We generate data sets for two different black hole natal kick mean velocity distributions (sigma = 10 km/s and sigma = 50 km/s and with and without the inclusion of stellar fly-bys. Our fiducial model has a mean black hole natal kick velocity if sigma = 10 km/s and includes stellar fly-bys. Each system has at least one star with an initial mass larger than 10 solar masses. All data will be publicly available.
  We find that at the end of the evolution the large majority of systems are single stars in every data set (&gt; 85%). As the number of objects in the initial system increases, so too does the final non-single system fraction. The single fractions of final systems in our fiducial model are 87.8 $\pm$ 0.2 % for the 2 + 2s, 88.8 $\pm$ 0.3 % for the 3 + 1s, 92.3 $\pm$ 0.2 % for the 2 + 1s and 98.9 $\pm$ 0.3 % for the 1 + 1s.</description>

      <title>The IACOB project XIII. Helium enrichment in O-type stars as a tracer of past binary interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is increasing evidence that single-star evolutionary models are inadequate to reproduce all observational properties of massive stars. Binary interaction has emerged as a key factor in the evolution of a significant fraction of massive stars. In this study, we investigate the helium ($Y_{\mathrm He}$) and nitrogen ($\epsilon_{\mathrm N}$) surface abundances in a comprehensive sample of 180 Galactic O-type stars with projected rotational velocities $v\sin(i)\leq150{\mathrm km}\cdot{\mathrm s}^{-1}$. We found a subsample ($\sim20\%$ of the total, and $\sim80\%$ of the stars with $Y_{\mathrm He}\geq0.12$) with a $Y_{\mathrm He}$ and $\epsilon_{\mathrm N}$ combined pattern unexplainable by single-star evolution. We argue that the stars with anomalous surface abundance patterns are binary interaction products.</description>

      <title>Time-delayed gamma-ray signatures of heavy axions from core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy axions that couple to both quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics with masses on the order of MeV - GeV and high-scale decay constants in excess of $\sim$$10^8$ GeV may arise generically in e.g. axiverse constructions. In this work we provide the most sensitive search to-date for the existence of such heavy axions using Fermi-LAT data towards four recent supernovae (SN): Cas A, SN1987A, SN2023ixf, and SN2024ggi. We account for heavy axion production in the proto-neutron-star cores through nuclear and electromagnetic processes and then the subsequent decay of the axions into photons. While previous works have searched for gamma-rays from SN1987A using the Solar Maximum Mission that observed SN1987A during the SN itself, we show that using Fermi Large Area Telescope data provides an approximately five orders of magnitude improvement in flux sensitivity for axions with lifetimes larger than around 10 years. We find no evidence for heavy axions and exclude large regions of previously-unexplored parameter space.</description>

      <title>Quantifying spectroscopic Ca II exocomet transit occurrence in two decades of HARPS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of exocomets has been built around the unmatched number of detections made in the circumstellar disc of the archetypal star Beta Pictoris. An exocomet detection in spectroscopy is identified by variable atomic absorption features in a stellar spectrum, associated with transiting gas in and trailing an exocomet coma. This paper presents the largest spectroscopic search for exocomet transits to date, which overcomes the limitations of biased samples of stars with debris discs, and instead looks through the $\approx$7500 stars in the HARPS archive for signs of exocomets in the CaII doublet (H:396.847nm and K:393.366nm). The search resulted in 155 candidate stars, which after filtering for false positives (e.g. binaries, stellar activity, etc.), were cut down to 22 stars. These 22 stars are classified into Tier1, 2, and 3 exocomet candidates, reflecting the confidence level of their exocomet detection. Our two best candidates (Tier1: Beta Pictoris, HD172555) and four lower confidence candidates (Tier2: Gl1, HIP5158, HD94771, HR1996) are discussed, yielding a detection rate of 0.03% (Tier1 only) and 0.1% (Tier1 &amp; 2) in the HARPS sample. Both Tier1 stars are known exocomet host stars. These two young A-type stars correspond to 0.4% of all A-types in the sample, suggesting that detecting signs of exocomet transits using CaII is more likely around young A-type stars. Reanalysing a past HARPS study, we found no evidence to support the previously claimed four exocomet detections, indicating either that those detections are not robust or that we are only sensitive to the strongest signals.</description>

      <title>Polarized multiwavelength emission from pulsar wind - accretion disk interaction in a transitional millisecond pulsar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) bridge the evolutionary gap between accreting neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries and millisecond radio pulsars. These systems exhibit a unique subluminous X-ray state characterized by the presence of an accretion disk and rapid switches between high and low X-ray emission modes. The high mode features coherent millisecond pulsations spanning from the X-ray to the optical band. We present multiwavelength polarimetric observations of the tMSP PSR J1023+0038 aimed at conclusively identifying the physical mechanism powering its emission in the subluminous X-ray state. During the high mode, we detect polarized emission in the 2-6 keV energy range, with a polarization degree of 12% +/- 3% and a polarization angle of -2deg +/- 9deg (1sigma) measured counterclockwise from the North celestial pole towards East. At optical wavelengths, we find a polarization degree of 1.41% +/- 0.04% and a polarization angle aligned with that in the soft X-rays, suggesting a common physical mechanism operating across these bands. Remarkably, the polarized flux spectrum matches the pulsed emission spectrum from optical to X-rays. The polarization properties differ markedly from those observed in other accreting neutron stars and isolated rotation-powered pulsars and are also inconsistent with an origin in a compact jet. Our results provide direct evidence that the polarized and pulsed emissions both originate from synchrotron radiation at the shock formed where the pulsar wind interacts with the inner regions of the accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Streaming Torque with Turbulent Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast type-I migration of (proto)planets poses a challenging problem for the core accretion formation scenario. We found that the dust-induced ``Streaming Torque (ST)'' may slow down or even reverse the planet migration in \cite{Hou2024}. But in realistic protoplanetary disks, dust diffusion induced by gas turbulence may have important influences on ST. We perform linear analysis to investigate the effects of dust diffusion on ST. The dependence of ST on the dust diffusion may provide better constraints on the turbulence strength and the stopping time $\tau$. We derive the dispersion relation for all the wave modes in the two-fluid system. The dust diffusion will smooth the short-wavelength structure of the the quasi-drift mode and split it into two predominant D-drift modes with opposite directions. The outgoing D-drift mode will contribute to a negative torque on planets, particularly when $\tau \sim 0.1$, which slightly shifts the zero-torque turning point. We explore how ST depends on the regimes of aerodynamic drag, dust mass fraction and disk scale height. We compare the radial wavenumbers of D-drift modes under different formulations of dust diffusion and find qualitative agreement. In all cases, $\tau$ at the zero-torque turning point, which determines the direction of planetary migration, consistently remains on the order of $\sim 0.1$, corresponding to large pebble-sized dust grains. This suggests that rapid dust coagulation can inhibit the inward migration of planets, implying that weak gas turbulence may enhance the survival of protoplanets.</description>

      <title>The April 1, 2471 b.C. eclipse and the end of 4th Egyptian dynasty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On April 1, 2471 bC an impressive, unpredictable phenomenon occurred over the Delta of the Nile: a total solar eclipse, with totality band almost centered on the sacred city of Buto, and with the capital Memphis very close (&gt;95%) to totality. This date is compatible with existing chronologies for the reign of Pharaoh Shepseskaf, who adopted a clamorous symbolic break with respect to the tradition of solarized kings started by Khufu. Indeed his tomb was not built in view from Heliopolis and was not a pyramid, but a kind of unique monument resembling the symbolic shrine at Buto. The aim of the present paper is to investigate in a systematic way the possibility that the origin of this historical break, which marks the end of the 4th dynasty, can be identified precisely in the 2471 bC eclipse, therefore furnishing a new astronomical anchor for the chronology of the Old Kingdom.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Shadow and other Observables away from the Horizon: Extending the Effective Metric Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work we have developed a model-independent, effective description of quantum deformed, spherically symmetric and static black holes in four dimensions. The deformations of the metric are captured by two functions of the physical distance to the horizon, which are provided in the form of self-consistent Taylor series expansions. While this approach efficiently captures physical observables in the immediate vicinity of the horizon, it is expected to encounter problems of convergence at further distances. Therefore, we demonstrate in this paper how to use Pad\'e approximants to extend the range of applicability of this framework. We provide explicit approximations of physical observables that depend on finitely many effective parameters of the deformed black hole geometry, depending on the order of the Pad\'e approximant. By taking the asymptotic limit of this order, we in particular provide a closed-form expression for the black hole shadow of the (fully) deformed geometry, which captures the leading quantum corrections. We illustrate our results for a number of quantum black holes previously proposed in the literature and find that our effective approach provides excellent approximations in all cases.</description>

      <title>FCN4Flare: Fully Convolution Neural Networks for Flare Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar flares offer invaluable insights into stellar magnetic activity and exoplanetary environments. Automated flare detection enables exploiting vast photometric datasets from missions like Kepler. This paper presents FCN4Flare, a deep learning approach using fully convolutional networks (FCN) for precise point-to-point flare prediction regardless of light curve length. Key innovations include the NaN Mask to handle missing data automatedly, and the Mask Dice loss to mitigate severe class imbalance. Experimental results show that FCN4Flare significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving a Dice coefficient of 0.64 compared to the state-of-the-art of 0.12. Applying FCN4Flare to Kepler-LAMOST data, we compile a catalog of 30,285 high-confidence flares across 1426 stars. Flare energies are estimated and stellar/exoplanet properties analyzed, identifying pronounced activity for an M-dwarf hosting a habitable zone planet. This work overcomes limitations of prior flare detection methods via deep learning, enabling new scientific discoveries through analysis of photometric time-series data.

      <title>Y Gem, a symbiotic star outshone by its asymptotic giant branch primary component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A considerable number of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars exhibit UV excess and/or X-ray emission that indicates a binary companion. AGB stars are so bright that they easily outshine their companions. This almost prevents their identification. Y Gem has been known for some decades to be an AGB star that is bright in the far-UV and X-rays, but it is unclear whether its companion is a main-sequence star or a white dwarf (WD) in a symbiotic system (SySt). Our goal is to uncover the true nature of Y Gem, which will help us to study the possible misidentified population of SySts. Multiwavelength IR, optical, UV, and X-ray observations were analyzed to investigate the properties of the stellar components and the accretion process in Y Gem. In particular, an optical spectrum of Y Gem is presented here for the first time, while X-ray data are interpreted by means of reflection models produced by an accretion disk and material in its vicinity. The optical spectrum exhibits the typical sawtooth-shaped features of molecular absorptions in addition to narrow recombination and forbidden emission lines. The emission lines and the analysis of the extinction-corrected UV spectrum suggest a hot component with $T_\mathrm{eff}\approx$60,000 K, $L$=140 L$_{\odot}$, and $R$=0.11 R$_{\odot}$ that very likely is an accreting WD. The late component is found to be an 1.1 M$_\odot$ AGB star with $T_\mathrm{eff}$=3350 K and $R$=240 R$_\odot$. Using IR, optical, UV, and X-ray data, we found that Y Gem is an S-type SySt whose compact component is accreting at an estimated mass-accretion rate of $\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc}=2.3\times10^{-7}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. At this accretion rate, the accreting WD has reached the stable and steady burning phase in which no recurrent events are expected.</description>

      <title>Infrared properties of Planetary Nebulae with PG1159 central stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of 26 PNe with PG1159-type central stars known till date and compare them with the properties of PNe having [WR], $wels$ and hydrogen-rich central stars published earlier. We use archival photometric measurements of $2MASS$ for near-IR analysis and $WISE$ and $IRAS$ data for mid- and far-IR analysis and derive the IR properties of PG1159-PNe. We analyze the IR colour-colour diagrams of PG1159-PNe and compare them with the other three groups of PNe. Similar to the [WR]-PNe, many PG1159-PNe also show large amount of near-IR emission from the hot-dust component but their AGB dust is relatively cooler. We also report here the dust colour temperatures, dust masses, dust-to-gas mass ratios, IR luminosities and IR excess of PG1159-PNe and plot them against their surface H$\beta$ brightness (age) and compare them with the distribution of other groups of PNe. The IR luminosity and dust temperature show strong correlation with surface H$\beta$ brightness, however, the dust-to-gas mass ratio and IR excess do not show any trend. While the mean dust mass has a lower value for PG1159-PNe, in compared to other groups, the average dust-to-gas mass ratio is found to be marginally larger for PG1159-PNe. An analysis of the number distribution of different groups of PNe against surface H$\beta$ brightness shows that a) younger [WR]-, $wels$- and normal-PNe have a similar distribution indicating that they all have evolved from the AGB in a similar way, b) while there is an overlap of surface H$\beta$ brightness between [WR]- and PG1159-PNe, showing an evolutionary connection between them, there exists a significant gap between the values derived for $wels$- and PG1159-PNe.</description>

      <title>Detection of Enhanced Germanium in a New Cool Extreme Helium Star A 980: Insights and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fine abundance analysis of a recently discovered hydrogen-deficient carbon (HdC) star, A 980, is presented. Based on the observed high-resolution optical spectrum, we ascertain that A 980 is a cool extreme helium (EHe) star and not an HdC. Singly-ionized germanium Ge II lines are identified in A 980's optical spectrum. These are the first-ever detections of germanium lines in an EHe's observed spectrum, and provide the first measurements of germanium abundance in an EHe star. The overabundance of germanium in A 980's atmosphere provides us with evidence for the synthesis of germanium in EHe stars. Among the known cool EHe stars, A 980 exhibits a maximum enhancement of the s-process elements based on significant number of transitions. The measured elemental abundances reveal signs of H-burning, He-burning, and specifically the nucleosyntheses of the key elements: Ge, Sr, Y, Zr, and Ba. The nucleosyntheses of these key elements are discussed in light of asymptotic giant branch evolution and the expectation from the accretion of an He white dwarf by a C-O white dwarf or by a neutron star.</description>

      <title>Detached Circumstellar Matter as an Explanation for Slowly-Rising Interacting Type Ibc Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some hydrogen-poor (Type Ibc) supernovae (SNe) are known to have massive circumstellar matter (CSM) that are well detached from the star. Using the open-source code CHIPS, we construct a grid of models of SN Ibc interacting with detached CSM, inspired by a recently proposed scenario of such CSM generated by a mass eruption and feedback process from the leftover star. We find that interaction with detached CSM can produce a slowly rising phase in the light curve seen in some interacting SN Ibc, which is difficult to reproduce by interaction with continuously distributed CSM down to the star. We also show that SNe having double peaks in their light curves with timescales of months (e.g., SN 2022xxf) can be explained by radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni/$^{56}$Co, followed by interaction with detached CSM.</description>

      <title>Irregular Fixation: I. Fixed points and librating orbits of the Brown Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In hierarchical triple systems, the inner binary is slowly perturbed by a distant companion, giving rise to large-scale oscillations in eccentricity and inclination, known as von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) oscillations. Stable systems with a mild hierarchy, where the period ratio is not too small, require an additional corrective term, known as the Brown Hamiltonian, to adequately account for their long-term evolution. Although the Brown Hamiltonian has been used to accurately describe the highly eccentric systems on circulating orbits where the periapse completes a complete revolution, the analysis near its elliptical fixed points had been overlooked. We derive analytically the modified fixed points including the Brown Hamiltonian and analyse its librating orbits (where the periapse motion is limited in range). We compare our result to the direct three-body integrations of millions of orbits and discuss the regimes of validity. We numerically discover the regions of orbital instability, allowed and forbidden librating zones with a complex, fractal, structure. The retrograde orbits, where the mutual inclination is $\iota &gt; 90\ \rm deg$, are more stable and allowed to librate for larger areas of the parameter space. We find numerical fits for the librating-circulating boundary. Finally, we discuss the astrophysical implications for systems of satellites, stars and compact objects. In a companion paper (paper II), we apply our formalism to the orbits of irregular satellites around giant planets.</description>

Abstract: A sub-Earth-mass planet orbiting Barnard's star, designated as Barnard b, has been recently announced. At almost the same time, the first photometric data of Barnard's star by the Transit Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) was released in Sector 80. We explore the possibility of emergent transits of Barnard b in TESS photometry. The detrended 2 min light curve appears to be flat, with a flux root mean square of 0.411 parts per thousand. Attempts of blind and informed transit-curve model inference suggest no evidence of transiting Barnard b, or any other body. This provides a 3$\sigma$ upper bound of 87.9 degrees for the orbital inclination of Barnard b.</description>

      <title>The First JWST View of a 30-Myr-old Protoplanetary Disk Reveals a Late-stage Carbon-rich Phase</title>

Abstract: We present a JWST MIRI/MRS spectrum of the inner disk of WISE J044634.16$-$262756.1B (hereafter J0446B), an old ($\sim$34 Myr) M4.5 star but with hints of ongoing accretion. The spectrum is molecule-rich and dominated by hydrocarbons. We detect 14 molecular species (H$_2$, CH$_3$, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_2$, $^{13}$CCH$_2$, C$_2$H$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, C$_3$H$_4$, C$_4$H$_2$, C$_6$H$_6$, HCN, HC$_3$N, CO$_2$ and $^{13}$CO$_2$) and 2 atomic lines ([Ne II] and [Ar II]), all observed for the first time in a disk at this age. The detection of spatially unresolved H$_2$ and Ne gas strongly supports that J0446B hosts a long-lived primordial disk, rather than a debris disk. The marginal H$_2$O detection and the high C$_2$H$_2$/CO$_2$ column density ratio indicate that the inner disk of J0446B has a very carbon-rich chemistry, with a gas-phase C/O ratio $\gtrsim$2, consistent with what have been found in most primordial disks around similarly low-mass stars. In the absence of significant outer disk dust substructures, inner disks are expected to first become water-rich due to the rapid inward drift of icy pebbles, and evolve into carbon-rich as outer disk gas flows inward on longer timescales. The faint millimeter emission in such low-mass star disks implies that they may have depleted their outer icy pebble reservoir early and already passed the water-rich phase. Models with pebble drift and volatile transport suggest that maintaining a carbon-rich chemistry for tens of Myr likely requires a slowly evolving disk with $\alpha-$viscosity $\lesssim10^{-4}$. This study represents the first detailed characterization of disk gas at $\sim$30 Myr, strongly motivating further studies into the final stages of disk evolution.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we perform 3D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of filamentary molecular clouds. We then generate synthetic observations based on the simulation results. Using these, we investigate how the new polarization data analysis method recently introduced by Doi et al. (2021) reflects the magnetic field structure in turbulent filamentary molecular clouds. Doi et al. (2021) proposed that the $R_{\rm{FWHM}}$, the ratio of the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the polarized intensity ($PI$) to that of the total intensity ($I$) can be used to probe the three-dimensional structure of the magnetic field. We calculate the $R_{\rm{FWHM}}$ from the density and magnetic field structure obtained in the 3D-MHD simulations. We find that the mean and variance of $R_{\rm{FWHM}}$ within a filament are smaller and larger, respectively, with a larger inclination of the magnetic field to the plane-of-sky. We also find that both small-scale ($&lt;0.1~\rm{pc}$) and large-scale ($\gtrsim 0.1~\rm{pc}$) turbulence affect the polarized intensity of the dust thermal emission. We conclude that future extensive observations of $R_{\rm{FWHM}}$ may be able to quantify the inclination of the magnetic field to the plane-of-sky in the filamentary molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>The interdependence between density PDF, CMF and IMF and their relation with Mach number in simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12809</link>

Abstract: The initial mass function (IMF) of stars and the corresponding cloud mass function (CMF), traditionally considered universal, exhibit variations that are influenced by the local environment. Notably, these variations are apparent in the distribution's tail, indicating a possible relationship between local dynamics and mass distribution. Our study is designed to examine how the gas PDF , the IMF and the CMF depend on the local turbulence within the interstellar medium (ISM). We run hydrodynamical simulations on small star-forming sections of the ISM under varying turbulence conditions, characterized by Mach numbers of 1, 3.5, and 10, and with two distinct mean densities. This approach allowed us to observe the effects of different turbulence levels on the formation of stellar and cloud masses. The study demonstrates a clear correlation between the dynamics of the cloud and the IMF. In environments with lower levels of turbulence likely dominated by gravitational collapse, our simulations showed the formation of more massive structures with a powerlaw gas PDF, leading to a top-heavy IMF and CMF. On the other hand environment dominated by turbulence result in a lognormal PDF and a Salpeter-like CMF and IMF. This indicates that the turbulence level is a critical factor in determining the mass distribution within star-forming regions.</description>
