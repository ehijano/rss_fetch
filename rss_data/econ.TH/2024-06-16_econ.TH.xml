      <title>Equilibria and Group Welfare in Vote Trading Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework to study the group dynamics and game-theoretic considerations when voters in a committee are allowed to trade votes. This model represents a significant step forward by considering vote-for-vote trades in a low-information environment where voters do not know the preferences of their trading partners. All voters draw their preference intensities on two issues from a common probability distribution and then consider offering to trade with an anonymous partner. The result is a strategic game between two voters that can be studied analytically. We compute the Nash equilibria for this game and derive several interesting results involving symmetry, group heterogeneity, and more. This framework allows us to determine that trades are typically detrimental to the welfare of the group as a whole, but there are exceptions. We also expand our model to allow all voters to trade votes and derive approximate results for this more general scenario. Finally, we emulate vote trading in real groups by forming simulated committees using real voter preference intensity data and computing the resulting equilibria and associated welfare gains or losses.</description>

      <title>Existence and structure of Nash equilibria for supermodular games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two theorems announced by Topkis about the topological description of sublattices are proved. They are applied to extend some classical results concerning the existence and the order structure of Nash equilibria of certain supermodular games, with some problems in Zhou's proof corrected.</description>

      <title>Embracing the Enemy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an organization with a principal and two agents. All three have a long-run agenda which drives their repeated interactions. The principal can influence the competition for agency by endorsing an agent. Her agenda is more aligned with her ``friend'' than with her ``enemy.'' Even when fully aligned with the friend, the principal embraces the enemy by persistently endorsing him once an initial ``cordon sanitaire'' to exclude the enemy breaks exogenously. A dynamically optimizing principal with extreme agenda either implements the commitment solution or reverts to static Nash. For less extreme principals, losing commitment power has more gradual effects.</description>

      <title>Finding pure Nash equilibria in large random games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09732</link>

Abstract: Best Response Dynamics (BRD) is a class of strategy updating rules to find Pure Nash Equilibria (PNE) in a game. At each step, a player is randomly picked and they switches to a "best response" strategy based on the strategies chosen by others, so that the new strategy profile maximises their payoff. If no such strategy exists, a different player will be chosen randomly. When no player wants to change their strategy anymore, the process reaches a PNE and will not deviate from it. On the other hand, either PNE could not exist, or BRD could be "trapped" within a subgame that has no PNE. We prove that BRD typically converges to PNE when the game has $N$ players, each having two actions. Our results are more general and are described as follows. We study a class of random walks in a random medium on the $N$-dimensional hypercube. The medium is determined by a random game with $N$ players, each with two actions available, and i.i.d. payoffs. The medium contains obstacles that can be of two types. The first type is composed of the PNE of the game, while the other obstacles are known in the literature as traps or sink equilibria. The class of processes we analyze includes BRD, simple random walks on the hypercube, and many other nearest neighbour processes. We prove that, with high probability, these processes reach a PNE before hitting any trap.</description>
