      <title>Probing false vacuum decay on a cold-atom gauge-theory quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of quantum electrodynamics, the decay of false vacuum leads to the production of electron-positron pair, a phenomenon known as the Schwinger effect. In practical experimental scenarios, producing a pair requires an extremely strong electric field, thus suppressing the production rate and making this process very challenging to observe. Here we report an experimental investigation, in a cold-atom quantum simulator, of the effect of the background field on pair production from the infinite-mass vacuum in a $1+1$D $\mathrm{U}(1)$ lattice gauge theory. The ability to tune the background field allows us to study pair production in a large production rate regime. Furthermore, we find that the energy spectrum of the time-evolved observables in the zero mass limit displays excitation peaks analogous to bosonic modes in the Schwinger model. Our work opens the door to quantum-simulation experiments that can controllably tune the production of pairs and manipulate their far-from-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Formations of generalized Wannier-Stark ladders: Theorem and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wannier-Stark ladder (WSL) is a basic concept, supporting periodic oscillation, widely used in many areas of physics. In this paper, we investigate the formations of WSL in generalized systems, including strongly correlated and non-Hermitian systems. We present a theorem on the existence of WSL for a set of general systems that are translationally symmetric before the addition of a linear potential. For a non-Hermitian system, the WSL becomes complex but maintains a real energy level spacing. We illustrate the theorem using 1D extended Bose-Hubbard models with both real and imaginary hopping strengths. It is shown that the Bloch-Zener oscillations of correlated bosons are particularly remarkable under resonant conditions. Numerical simulations for cases with boson numbers $n=2$, $3$, and $4$ are presented. Analytical and numerical results for the time evolution of the $n$-boson-occupied initial state indicate that all evolved states exhibit quasi periodic oscillations, but with different profiles, depending on the Hermiticity and interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Learning complexity gradually in quantum machine learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is an emergent field that continues to draw significant interest for its potential to offer improvements over classical algorithms in certain areas. However, training quantum models remains a challenging task, largely because of the difficulty in establishing an effective inductive bias when solving high-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose a training framework that prioritizes informative data points over the entire training set. This approach draws inspiration from classical techniques such as curriculum learning and hard example mining to introduce an additional inductive bias through the training data itself. By selectively focusing on informative samples, we aim to steer the optimization process toward more favorable regions of the parameter space. This data-centric approach complements existing strategies such as warm-start initialization methods, providing an additional pathway to address performance challenges in quantum machine learning. We provide theoretical insights into the benefits of prioritizing informative data for quantum models, and we validate our methodology with numerical experiments on selected recognition tasks of quantum phases of matter. Our findings indicate that this strategy could be a valuable approach for improving the performance of quantum machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation in a rigidly rotating relativistic boson gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of a free Bose gas under rigid rotation. The aim is to explore the impact of rotation on the thermodynamic quantities associated with BEC, including the Bose-Einstein (BE) transition temperature and condensate fraction. We begin by introducing the rotation in the Lagrangian density of free charged Klein-Gordon fields and determine the corresponding grand canonical partition function at finite temperature, chemical potential, and finite angular velocity. Assuming slow rotation, we derive analytical expressions for the pressure, energy, number, and angular momentum densities of a free Bose gas in nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic limits in terms of the corresponding fugacities. We then focus on the phenomenon of BEC. We calculate the critical temperature of BEC transition and the condensate fraction in a slowly rotating Bose gas including only particles. Our findings indicate that the critical exponent associated with the BE transition in a rotating gas is lower compared to that in a nonrotating Bose gas. We also determine the fugacity in a rotating Bose gas in the aforementioned limits and examine how rotation affects its temperature dependence, both below and above the critical temperature. By analyzing the behavior of heat capacity at these temperatures, we demonstrate that in a nonrelativistic Bose gas, the rotation transforms the nature of the BE phase transition from a continuous to a discontinuous transition. In general, we find that a nonrelativistic Bose gas under rotation behaves similarly to a nonrotating Bose gas in ultrarelativistic limit.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity, Hydrodynamics and Emergent Cosmology: A Collection of Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This collection of perspective pieces captures recent advancements and reflections from a dynamic research community dedicated to bridging quantum gravity, hydrodynamics, and emergent cosmology. It explores four key research areas: (a) the interplay between hydrodynamics and cosmology, including analog gravity systems; (b) phase transitions, continuum limits and emergent geometry in quantum gravity; (c) relational perspectives in gravity and quantum gravity; and (d) the emergence of cosmological models rooted in quantum gravity frameworks. Each contribution presents the distinct perspectives of its respective authors. Additionally, the introduction by the editors proposes an integrative view, suggesting how these thematic units could serve as foundational pillars for a novel theoretical cosmology framework termed "hydrodynamics on superspace".</description>

      <title>Increasing superconducting $T_c$ by layering in the attractive Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The attractive Hubbard model has become a model readily realizable with ultracold atoms on optical lattices. However, the superconducting (superfluid) critical temperatures, $T_c$'s, are still somewhat smaller than the lowest temperatures achieved in experiments. Here we consider two possible routes, generically called layering, to increase $T_c$: a bilayer and a simple cubic lattice, both with tunable hopping, $t_z$, between attractive Hubbard planes. We have performed minus-sign--free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations to calculate response functions such as pairing correlation functions, uniform spin susceptibility, and double occupancy, through which we map out some physical properties. We have found that by a judicious choice of fillings and intensity of on-site attraction, a bilayer can exhibit $T_c$'s between 1.5 and 1.7 times those of the single layer; for the simple-cubic lattice the enhancement can be 30\% larger than the maximum for the single layer. We also check the accuracy of both a BCS-like estimate for $T_c$ in the attractive Hubbard model, as well as of an upper bound for $T_c$ based on the superfluid density.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in a Topological Lattice Model with Strong Repulsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The highly tunable nature of synthetic quantum materials -- both in the solid-state and cold atom contexts -- invites examining which microscopic ingredients aid in the realization of correlated phases of matter such as superconductors. Recent experimental advances in moir\'e materials suggest that unifying the features of the Fermi-Hubbard model and quantum Hall systems creates a fertile ground for the emergence of such phases. Here, we introduce a minimal 2D lattice model that incorporates exactly these features: time-reversal symmetry, band topology, and strong repulsive interactions. By using infinite cylinder density matrix renormalization group methods (cylinder iDMRG), we investigate the ground state phase diagram of this model. We find that it hosts an interaction-induced quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator and demonstrate that weakly hole-doping this state gives rise to a superconductor at a finite circumference, with indications that this behavior persists on larger cylinders. At the aforementioned circumference, the superconducting phase is surprisingly robust to perturbations including additional repulsive interactions in the pairing channel. By developing a technique to probe the superconducting gap function in iDMRG, we phenomenologically characterize the superconductor. Namely, we demonstrate that it is formed from the weak pairing of holes atop the QSH insulator. Furthermore, we determine the pairing symmetry of the superconductor, finding it to be $p$-wave -- reminiscent of the unconventional superconductivity reported in experiments on twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). Motivated by this, we elucidate structural similarities and differences between our model and those of TBG in its chiral limit. Finally, to provide a more direct experimental realization, we detail an implementation of our Hamiltonian in a system of cold fermionic alkaline-earth atoms in an optical lattice.</description>

      <title>Sensing atomic superfluid rotation beyond the standard quantum limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic superfluids formed using Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a ring trap are currently being investigated in the context of superfluid hydrodynamics, quantum sensing and matter-wave interferometry. The characterization of the rotational properties of such superfluids is important, but can presently only be performed by using optical absorption imaging, which completely destroys the condensate. Recent studies have proposed coupling the ring BEC to optical cavity modes carrying orbital angular momentum to make minimally destructive measurements of the condensate rotation. The sensitivity of these proposals, however, is bounded below by the standard quantum limit set by the combination of laser shot noise and radiation pressure noise. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework that exploits the fact that the interaction between the scattered modes of the condensate and the light reduces to effective optomechanical equations of motion. We present a detailed theoretical analysis to demonstrate that the use of squeezed light and backaction evasion techniques allows the angular momentum of the condensate to be sensed with noise well below the standard quantum limit. Our proposal is relevant to atomtronics, quantum sensing and quantum information.</description>

      <title>Quantum Supercritical Crossovers with Dynamical Singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supercriticality, characterized by strong fluctuations and a wealth of phenomena, emerges as an intriguing state beyond the classical liquid-gas critical point. In this study, we extend this notable concept to quantum many-body systems near the quantum critical point, by studying the quantum Ising model and Rydberg atom array through tensor network calculations and scaling analyses. We find two supercritical crossover lines in the quantum phase diagram with universal scaling, $h \propto (g - g_c)^{\beta + \gamma}$, where $g$ ($h$) is the transverse (longitudinal) field, $g_c$ is the critical field, and $\beta, \gamma$ are the related critical exponents. Enclosed by the two crossover lines, there exist supercritical quantum states with universal behaviors in correlations and entanglement. In particular, we reveal a dynamical quantum phase transition occurring when traversing the quantum supercritical crossover line. These dynamical singularities, attributed to the intersection of Lee-Yang-Fisher zero lines with the real-time axis, have no counterpart in classical supercriticality. We propose that the Rydberg atom array offers an ideal platform for studying the quantum supercritical crossovers and measuring the critical exponents. The present work establishes a foundation for exploring quantum supercriticality and related phenomena in correlated many-body systems.</description>
