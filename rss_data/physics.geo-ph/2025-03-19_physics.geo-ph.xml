      <title>Tectonics controls hydration-induced rheological heterogeneities in ultraslow-spread oceanic lithospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At ultraslow, magma-poor spreading ridges, plate divergence is controlled by tectonics, with formation of detachment faults that expose variably serpentinized mantle rocks. Seismicity and the depth of seismic events in these environments are influenced by the degree of serpentinization, yet the nature and extent of deeper alteration remain poorly understood. This study uses a 2D visco-elasto-plastic model with thermodynamic calculations to explore the interaction between tectonics and hydration during ultraslow seafloor spreading. By coupling water availability and lithosphere hydration progress with active deformation, we reveal: (i) a tectonically controlled vertical extent of alteration along detachment faults; (ii) the preservation of amphibole-facies in exhumed serpentinized footwalls; (iii) significant lithospheric scale rheological heterogeneities due to variations in alteration mineral assemblages. We propose that tectonically controlled spatial variations in alteration play a key role in controlling earthquake depth distribution at mid-ocean ridges and associated transform faults and discuss the implications for seismogenesis in subduction zones.</description>

      <title>Investigating the relationship between bolide entry angle and apparent direction of infrasound signal arrivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrasound sensing offers critical capabilities for detecting and geolocating bolide events globally. However, the observed back azimuths, directions from which infrasound signals arrive at stations, often differ from the theoretical expectations based on the bolide's peak brightness location. For objects with shallow entry angles, which traverse longer atmospheric paths, acoustic energy may be emitted from multiple points along the trajectory, leading to substantial variability in back azimuth residuals. This study investigates how the entry angle of energetic bolides affects the back azimuth deviations, independent of extrinsic factors such as atmospheric propagation, station noise, and signal processing methodologies. A theoretical framework, the Bolide Infrasound Back-Azimuth EXplorer Model (BIBEX-M), was developed to compute predicted back azimuths solely from geometric considerations. The model quantifies how these residuals vary as a function of source-to-receiver distance, revealing that bolides entering at shallow angles of 15 degrees can experience average residuals of 12.4 degrees, with deviations reaching up to 155 degrees at distances below 1500 km, and remaining significant even at 10,000 km. In contrast, bolides with steeper entry angles (greater than 60 degrees) show much smaller deviations, typically under 10 degrees at 1000 km and diminishing to less than two degrees beyond 5000 km. These findings attest to the need for careful interpretation when evaluating signal detections and estimating bolide locations. This work is not only pertinent to bolides but also to other high-energy, extended-duration atmospheric phenomena such as space debris and reentry events, where similar geometric considerations can influence infrasound arrival directions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic signals from oceanic tides: new satellite observations and applications</title>

Abstract: Tidal flow of seawater across the Earth's magnetic field induces electric currents and magnetic fields within the ocean and solid Earth. The amplitude and phase of the induced fields depends on electrical properties of both the seawater and the solid Earth, thus can be used as a proxy to study seabed properties or potentially for monitoring long-term trends in the global ocean climatology. This paper presents new global oceanic tidal magnetic field models and their uncertainties for four tidal constituents, including $M_2, N_2, O_1$ and $Q_1$, which was not reliably retrieved previously. Models are obtained through a robust least-squares analysis of magnetic field observations from the \textit{Swarm} and CHAMP satellites using a specially designed data selection scheme. We compare the retrieved magnetic signals with several alternative models reported in the literature. Additionally, we validate them using a series of high-resolution global 3-D electromagnetic simulations and place constraints on the conductivity of sub-oceanic mantle for all tidal constituents, revealing an excellent agreement between all tidal constituents and the oceanic upper mantle structure.</description>

      <title>The Nash-MTL-STCN Method For Prestack Three-Parameter Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) techniques have been widely used in prestack three-parameter inversion to address its ill-posed problems. Among these DL techniques, Multi-task learning (MTL) methods can simultaneously train multiple tasks, thereby enhancing model generalization and predictive performance. However, existing MTL methods typically adopt heuristic or non-heuristic approaches to jointly update the gradient of each task, leading to gradient conflicts between different tasks and reducing inversion accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised temporal convolutional network (STCN) based on Nash equilibrium (Nash-MTL-STCN). Firstly, temporal convolutional networks (TCN) with non-causal convolution and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used as multi-task layers to extract the shared features from partial angle stack seismic data, with CNNs serving as the single-task layer. Subsequently, the feature mechanism is utilized to extract shared features in the multi-task layer through hierarchical processing, and the gradient combination of these shared features is treated as a Nash game for strategy optimization and joint updates. Ultimately, the overall utility of the three-parameter is maximized, and gradient conflicts are alleviated. In addition, to enhance the network's generalization and stability, we have incorporated geophysical forward modeling and low-frequency models into the network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method overcomes the gradient conflict issue of the conventional MTL methods with constant weights (CW) and achieves higher precision than four widely used non-heuristic MTL methods. Further field data experiments also validate the method's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>HypoNet Nankai: Rapid hypocenter determination tool for the Nankai Trough subduction zone using physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate hypocenter determination in the Nankai Trough subduction zone is essential for hazard assessment and advancing our understanding of seismic activity in the region. A handy hypocenter determination tool incorporating a realistic 3D velocity structure, accessible to the scientific community, is beneficial. In this study, we developed HypoNet Nankai, a rapid hypocenter determination tool based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN) emulator (surrogate model) for travel time calculations. This tool leverages a PINN trained to predict P-wave travel times between arbitrary underground sources and surface receivers with a realistic 3D P-wave velocity structure model of the Nankai Trough subduction zone that incorporates marine seismic survey data. The PINN embeds physical laws, namely, the Eikonal equation, directly into the loss function of training and circumvents the need for labeled training data. To address the training challenges posed by small-scale features in the velocity model, we employed a simple domain decomposition approach and Fourier feature embedding. Once trained, the PINN immediately infers the P-wave travel time, enabling rapid hypocenter determination. The data size required to store NNs for travel time calculations is significantly smaller than those of conventional travel-time tables. HypoNet Nankai provides high flexibility for addition of new observation points. We verified HypoNet Nankai by comparing its performance with a widely used grid-based numerical method for forward travel time calculations and synthetic hypocenter determination. In both tests, HypoNet Nankai provided results consistent with those for the conventional method. HypoNet Nankai offers a rapid, accurate, and easy-to-use hypocenter determination method for the Nankai Trough subduction zone, with greater data efficiency and extendibility compared to conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Learning for AVO Inversion with Strong Spatial Feature Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-dimensional convolution is a widely used deep learning technique in prestack amplitude variation with offset (AVO) inversion; however, it lacks lateral continuity. Although two-dimensional convolution improves lateral continuity, due to the sparsity of well-log data, the model only learns weak spatial features and fails to explore the spatial correlations in seismic data fully. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel AVO inversion method based on semi-supervised learning with strong spatial feature constraints (SSFC-SSL). First, two-dimensional predicted values are obtained through the inversion network, and the predicted values at well locations are sparsely represented using well-log labels. Subsequently, a label-annihilation operator is introduced, enabling the predicted values at non-well locations to learn the spatial features of well locations through the neural network. Ultimately, a two-way strong spatial feature mapping between non-well locations and well locations is achieved. Additionally, to reduce the dependence on well-log labels, we combine the semi-supervised learning strategy with a low-frequency model, further enhancing the robustness of the method. Experimental results on both synthetic example and field data demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves lateral continuity and inversion accuracy compared to one- and two-dimensional deep learning techniques.</description>
