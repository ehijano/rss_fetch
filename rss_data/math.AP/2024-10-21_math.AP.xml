      <title>Asymptotic spreading of KPP reactive fronts in heterogeneous shifting environments II: Flux-limited solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the spreading dynamics of the Fisher-KPP equation in a shifting environment, by analyzing the limit of the rate function of the solutions. For environments with a weak monotone condition, it was demonstrated in a previous paper that the rate function converges to the unique Ishii solution of the underlying Hamilton-Jacobi equations. In case the environment does not satisfy the weak monotone condition, we show that the rate function is then characterized by the Hamilton-Jacobi equation with a dynamic junction condition, which depends additionally on the generalized eigenvalue derived from the environmental function. Our results applies to the case when the environment has multiple shifting speeds, and clarify the connection with previous results on nonlocally pulled fronts and forced traveling waves.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of treatment in a free boundary problem modeling multilayered tumor growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optimal control problem of a free boundary PDE model describing the growth of multilayered tumor tissue in vitro. We seek the optimal amount of tumor growth inhibitor that simultaneously minimizes the thickness of the tumor tissue and mitigates side effects. The existence of an optimal control is established, and the uniqueness and characterization of the optimal control are investigated. Numerical simulations are presented for some scenarios, including the steady-state and parabolic cases.</description>

      <title>Long-time Confinement near Special Vortex Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we control the growth of the support of particular solutions to the Euler two-dimensional equations, whose vorticity is concentrated near special vortex crystals. These vortex crystals belong to the classical family of regular polygons with a central vortex, where we choose a particular intensity for the central vortex to have strong stability properties. A special case is the regular pentagon with no central vortex which also satisfies the stability properties required for the long-time confinement to work.</description>

      <title>Thomas-Fermi Limit for the Cubic-quintic Schr\"{o}dinger Energy with Radial Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the cubic-quintic Schr\"{o}dinger energy function with radial trapping potential \begin{gather*}
  \begin{aligned}
  {E}(\varPhi)=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\left(|\nabla \varPhi|^2+V(x)|\varPhi|^2\right)\,dx
  +\frac{\kappa}{4}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}|\varPhi|^4\,dx
  +\frac{1}{6}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}|\varPhi|^6\,dx,
  \end{aligned} \end{gather*} where $d=1,2,3$ and the parameter $\kappa=\pm1$. We mainly focus on the ground state under the mass constraint $\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}|\varPhi|^2\,dx=N$, in the Thomas-Fermi limit where the particle number $N$ tends to $\infty$. In contrast to previous approaches, we utilize an \emph{energy method} to go beyond the classical Thomas-Fermi approximation used in the Gross-Pitaevskii energy functional or Ginzburg-Landau functional. Firstly, we show that the ground state has the limit behaviors as $N\to+\infty$, which corresponds to a Thomas-Fermi limit. The limit profile is given by the Thomas-Fermi minimizer $u^{TF}(x)=\left[\mu^{TF}-C_0|x|^p\right]^{\frac{1}{4}}_{+}$, where $\mu^{TF}$ is a suitable Lagrange multiplier with exact value. Moreover, we obtain a sharp vanishing rate for ground states $\varphi_N$ that $\|\varphi_{N}\|_{L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d)}\sim N^{-\frac{d}{2d+p}}$ as $N\to+\infty$. The gradient squared non-integrable property of the Thomas-Fermi minimizer at the boundary $\partial B(\sqrt[p]{\mu^{TF}/C_0})$, in the vicinity of which the ground state has irregular behavior in the form of a steep \emph{corner layer}. Finally, let $\tau=N^{-\frac{2}{2d+p}}$ ($\to0^+$ as $N\to+\infty$), we prove that $\left\|\tau^{-d/2}\varphi_{N}(\cdot/{\tau})-u^{TF}\right\|_{L^\infty}\leq O\left( \tau^{\sigma-\epsilon}|\ln \tau|^{-\epsilon}\right)$ in $B\left( \sqrt[p]{\mu^{TF}/C_0}-\left( \tau|\ln \tau|\right)^\epsilon\right)$ as $\tau\to0^+$, where $\sigma=\min\{p-\alpha,1\}$ and $0&lt;\epsilon\leq\sigma/2$.</description>

      <title>Partial regularity for degenerate systems of double phase type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study partial regularity for degenerate elliptic systems of double-phase type, where the growth function is given by $H(x,t)=t^p+a(x)t^q$ with $1&lt;p\leq q$ and $a(x)$ a nonnegative $C^{0,\alpha}$-continuous function. Our main result proves that if $\frac{q}{p}\leq 1+\frac{\alpha}{n}$, the gradient of any weak solution is locally H\"older continuous, except on a set of measure zero.</description>

      <title>Hypoellipticity and Higher Order Gaussian Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\mathfrak{M},\rho,\mu)$ be a metric space of homogeneous type, $p_0\in (1,\infty)$, and $T(t):L^{p_0}(\mathfrak{M},\mu)\rightarrow L^{p_0}(\mathfrak{M},\mu)$, $t\geq 0$, a strongly continuous semi-group. We provide sufficient conditions under which $T(t)$ is given by integration against an integral kernel satisfying higher-order Gaussian bounds of the form \[
  \left| K_t(x,y) \right| \leq C \exp\left( -c \left( \frac{\rho(x,y)^{2\kappa}}{t} \right)^{\frac{1}{2\kappa-1}} \right) \mu\left( B(x,\rho(x,y)+t^{1/2\kappa}) \right)^{-1}. \] We also provide conditions for similar bounds on ``derivatives'' of $K_t(x,y)$ and our results are localizable. If $A$ is the generator of $T(t)$ the main hypothesis is that $\partial_t -A$ and $\partial_t-A^{*}$ satisfy a hypoelliptic estimate at every scale, uniformly in the scale. We present applications to subelliptic PDEs.</description>

      <title>Stationary flows for viscous heat-conductive fluid in a perturbed half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the non-isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equation in a perturbed half space with an outflow boundary condition as well as the supersonic condition. This equation models a compressible viscous, heat-conductive, and Newtonian polytropic fluid. We show the unique existence of stationary solutions for the perturbed half-space. The stationary solution constructed in this paper depends on all directions and has multidirectional flow. We also prove the asymptotic stability of this stationary solution.</description>

      <title>Analysis of an asymptotic thermo fluid-dynamic model for parabolic trough power plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parabolic trough power plants transform solar radiative energy into thermal energy which is then typically used to produce electricity.
  We consider a model derived in \cite{BGSP} to describe parabolic trough power plants. In particular, the thermo-fluid dynamics is studied in a single collector pipe where the solar radiation is concentrated. The model is the result of simplifying assumptions and asymptotic processes on the underlying mass, momentum and energy balance equations. { We show existence of solutions for the model. In addition we study the long-time behaviour and the stationary problem.</description>

      <title>Turing chemotactic instability in an HIV model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A ternary reaction-diffusion model for early HIV infection dynamics, incorporating logistic growth of target cells, is introduced. According to in vitro and in vivo studies, random movement of target cells, infected cells, and virions and a chemotactic attraction of target cells by cytokines, are included. The research explores the existence of disease-free and coexistence equilibria, conducting linear stability analyses for homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios. Specifically, conditions for chemotactic-self diffusion instability of the endemic equilibrium are found, indicating that Turing patterns may emerge when the chemotactic effect surpasses a critical threshold. This threshold is lower than in models without logistic growth of target cells, suggesting that the logistic model provides better insights into infection hot spots in the early stages. The location and shape of these patterns, crucial for developing infection control strategies, are investigated using weakly nonlinear analysis and demonstrated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>New Uniqueness Results For A Mean Field Game Of Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to proving the uniqueness of solutions to a certain class of mean field games of controls. In this class, the equilibrium is determined by an aggregate quantity $Q(t)$, e.g. the market price or production, which then determines optimal trajectories for agents. Our approach consists in analyzing the relationship between $Q(t)$ and corresponding optimal trajectories to find conditions under which there is at most one equilibrium. We show that our conditions do not match those prescribed by the Lasry-Lions monotonicity condition, nor even displacement monotonicity, but they do apply to economic models that have been proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>The uniqueness of Poincar\'e type constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $D$ be a smooth divisor on a closed K\"ahler manifold $X$. First, we prove that Poincar\'e type constant scalar curvature K\"ahler (cscK) metric with a singularity at $D$ is unique up to a holomorphic transformation on $X$ that preserves $D$, if there are no nontrivial holomorphic vector fields on $D$. For the general case, we propose a conjecture relating the uniqueness of Poincar\'e type cscK metric to its asymptotic behavior near $D$. We give an affirmative answer to this conjecture for those Poincar\'e type cscK metrics whose asymptotic behavior is invariant under any holomorphic transformation of $X$ that preserve $D$. We also show that this conjecture can be reduced to a fixed point problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06075v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the solution $u_\varepsilon$ to the Navier-Stokes equations in $\mathbb R^3$ perforated by small particles centered at $(\varepsilon \mathbb Z)^3$ with no-slip boundary conditions at the particles. We study the behavior of $u_\varepsilon$ for small $\varepsilon$, depending on the diameter $\varepsilon^\alpha$, $\alpha &gt; 1$, of the particles and the viscosity $\varepsilon^\gamma$, $\gamma &gt; 0$, of the fluid. We prove quantitative convergence results for $u_\varepsilon$ in all regimes when the local Reynolds number at the particles is negligible. Then, the particles approximately exert a linear friction force on the fluid. The obtained effective macroscopic equations depend on the order of magnitude of the collective friction. We obtain a) the Euler-Brinkman equations in the critical regime, b) the Euler equations in the subcritical regime and c) Darcy's law in the supercritical regime.</description>

      <title>Large deformations in terms of stretch and rotation and global solution to the quasi-stationary problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we derive a new model for visco-elasticity with large deformations where the independent variables are the stretch and the rotation tensors which intervene with second gradients terms accounting for physical properties in the principle of virtual power. Another basic feature of our model is that there is conditional compatibility, entering the model as kinematic constraints and depending on the magnitude of an internal force associated to dislocations. Moreover, due to the kinematic constraints, the virtual velocities depend on the solutions of the problem. As a consequence, the variational formulation of the problem and the related mathematical analysis are neither standard nor straightforward. We adopt the strategy to invert the kinematic constraints through Green propagators, obtaining a system of integro-differential coupled equations. As a first mathematical step, we develop the analysis of the model in a simplified setting, i.e. considering the quasi-stationary version of the full system where we neglect inertia. In this context, we prove the existence of a global in time strong solution in three space dimensions for the system, employing techniques from PDEs and convex analysis, thus obtaining a novel breakthrough in the field of three-dimensional finite visco-elasticity described in terms of the stretch and rotation variables. We also study a limit problem, letting the magnitude of the internal force associated to dislocations tend to zero, in which case the deformation becomes incompatible and the equations takes the form of a coupled system of PDEs. For the limit problem we obtain global existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence from data in three space dimensions.</description>

      <title>Flat blow-up solutions for the complex Ginzburg Landau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation $$ \partial_t u = (1 + i \beta) \Delta u + (1 + i \delta) |u|^{p-1}u - \alpha u, \quad \text{where } \beta, \delta, \alpha \in \mathbb{R}. $$ The study focuses on investigating the finite-time blow-up phenomenon, which remains an open question for a broad range of parameters, particularly for \(\beta\) and \(\delta\). Specifically, for a fixed \(\beta \in \mathbb{R}\), the existence of finite-time blow-up solutions for arbitrarily large values of \( |\delta| \) is still unknown. According to a conjecture made by Popp et al. \cite{POPphd98}, when \(\beta = 0\) and \(\delta\) is large, blow-up does not occur for \textit{generic initial data}.
  In this paper, we show that their conjecture is not valid for all types of initial data, by presenting the existence of blow-up solutions for \(\beta = 0\) and any \(\delta \in \mathbb{R}\) with different types of blowup.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary value problem for the stationary Navier--Stokes equations in $n$-dimensional half spaces $\mathbb{R}^n_+= \{ x=(x',x_n)\ ;\ x' \in \mathbb{R}^{n-1}, x_n &gt; 0 \}$ with $n \geq 3$ and prove the well-posedness in the scaling critical Besov spaces. Our approach is to regard the system as an evolution equation for the normal variable $x_n$ and reformulate it as an integral equation. Then, we achieve the goal by making use of the maximal regularity method that has developed in the context of nonstationary analysis in critical Besov spaces. Furthermore, for the case of $n \geq 4$, we find that the asymptotic profile of the solution as $x_n \to \infty$ is given by the $(n-1)$-dimensional stationary Navier--Stokes flow.</description>

      <title>Mean-field limit of non-exchangeable multi-agent systems over hypergraphs with unbounded rank</title>

Abstract: Interacting particle systems are known for their ability to generate large-scale self-organized structures from simple local interaction rules between each agent and its neighbors. In addition to studying their emergent behavior, a main focus of the mathematical community has been concentrated on deriving their large-population limit. In particular, the mean-field limit consists of describing the limit system by its population density in the product space of positions and labels. The strategy to derive such limits is often based on a careful combination of methods ranging from analysis of PDEs and stochastic analysis, to kinetic equations and graph theory. In this article, we focus on a generalization of multi-agent systems that includes higher-order interactions, which has largely captured the attention of the applied community in the last years. In such models, interactions between individuals are no longer assumed to be binary (i.e. between a pair of particles). Instead, individuals are allowed to interact by groups so that a full group jointly generates a non-linear force on any given individual. The underlying graph of connections is  then replaced by a hypergraph, which we assume to be dense, but possibly non uniform and of unbounded rank. For the first time in the literature, we show that when the interaction kernels are regular enough,  then the mean-field limit is determined by a limiting Vlasov-type equation, where the hypergraph limit is encoded by a so-called UR-hypergraphon (unbounded-rank hypergraphon), and where the resulting mean-field force admits infinitely-many orders of interactions.</description>

      <title>On nonlinear Markov processes in the sense of McKean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12424v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study nonlinear time-inhomogeneous Markov processes in the sense of McKean's seminal work [32]. These are given as families of laws $\mathbb{P}_{s,\zeta}$, $s\geq 0$, on path space, where $\zeta$ runs through a set of admissible initial probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this paper, we concentrate on the case where every $\mathbb{P}_{s,\zeta}$ is given as the path law of a solution to a McKean-Vlasov SDE, where the latter is allowed to have merely measurable coefficients, which in particular are not necessarily weakly continuous in the measure variable. Our main result is the identification of general and checkable conditions on such general McKean-Vlasov SDEs, which imply that the path laws of their solutions form a nonlinear Markov process. Our notion of nonlinear Markov property is in McKean's spirit, but more general in order to include processes whose one-dimensional time marginal densities solve a nonlinear parabolic PDE, more precisely, a nonlinear Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation, such as Burgers' equation, the porous media equation and variants thereof with transport-type drift, and also the very recently studied $2D$ vorticity Navier-Stokes equation and the $p$-Laplace equation. In all these cases, the associated McKean-Vlasov SDEs are such that both their diffusion and drift coefficients singularly depend (i.e. Nemytskii-type) on the one-dimensional time marginals of their solutions. We stress that for our main result the nonlinear Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations do not have to be well-posed. Thus, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between solution flows of a large class of nonlinear parabolic PDEs and nonlinear Markov processes.</description>

      <title>Mean Square Temporal error estimates for the 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with transport noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the 2D Navier-Stokes equation with transport noise subject to periodic boundary conditions. Our main result is an error estimate for the time-discretisation showing a convergence rate of order (up to) 1/2. It holds with respect to mean square error convergence, whereas previously such a rate for the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations was only known with respect to convergence in probability. Our result is based on uniform-in-probability estimates for the continuous as well as the time-discrete solution exploiting the particular structure of the noise.
  Eventually, we perform numerical simulations for the corresponding problem on bounded domains with no-slip boundary conditions. They suggest the same convergence rate as proved for the periodic problem hinging sensitively on the compatibility of the data. We also compare the energy profiles with those for corresponding problems with additive or multiplicative It\^o-type noise.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Control for Diffusion Aggregation system with Coulomb Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mean-field control problem for a multi-dimensional diffusion-aggregation system with Coulomb interaction (the so called parabolic elliptic Keller-Segel system) is considered. The existence of optimal control is proved through the $\Gamma$-convergence of the corresponding control problem of the interacting particle system. There are three building blocks in the whole argument. Firstly, for the optimal control problem on the particle level, instead of using classical method for stochastic system, we study directly the control problem of high-dimensional parabolic equation, i.e. the Liouville equation of it. Secondly, we obtain a strong propagation of chaos result for the interacting particle system by combining the convergence in probability and relative entropy method. Due to this strong mean field limit result, we avoid giving compact support requirement for control functions, which has been often used in the literature. Thirdly, because of strong aggregation effect, additional difficulties arise from control function in obtaining the well-posedness theory of the diffusion-aggregation equation, so that the known method cannot be directly applied. Instead, we use a combination of local existence result and bootstrap argument to obtain the global solution in the sub-critical regime.</description>

      <title>Beltrami fields, dispersive electromagnetic waves and gravitational spheromaks from chiral anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14990v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we focus on the backreaction effects due to the chiral anomaly. The chiral anomaly modifies conserved currents, introducing new contributions. For Maxwell gauge fields, this leads to a contribution to the electric current proportional to the background magnetic field, a phenomenon known as the chiral magnetic effect, which is widely discussed in the literature. In the case of gravitational fields, as we demonstrate, the anomaly induces a new contribution to the stress-energy tensor. We analyze the potential manifestations of these modifications in the gravitational field and hydrodynamics in chiral media, and we also comment on backreaction effects in electrodynamics. In each case, we observe the systematic appearance of Beltrami-type fields. In electrodynamics and hydrodynamics, a Beltrami field (e.g., magnetic field or fluid velocity) is a vector parallel to its own curl. We propose a generalization of Beltrami fields for tensorial gravitational perturbations, calling the respective solutions to the gravitational equations gravitational spheromaks by analogy with a similar phenomenon in electrodynamics. In the modified hydrodynamics of chiral media, vorticity asymptotically forms a Beltrami vector field in a generalized Gromeka-Beltrami flow.</description>
