      <title>Polarisation conversion and optical meron topologies in anisotropic epsilon-near-zero metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic metamaterials provide a flexible platform for light manipulation and polarisation management, thanks to their engineered optical properties with exotic dispersion regimes. Here, we exploit the enhanced spin-orbit coupling induced by the strong anisotropy of plasmonic nanorod metamaterials to control the polarisation of vector vortex beams and generate complex field structures with meron topology. Modifying the degree of ellipticity of the input polarisation, we show how the observed meron topology can be additionally manipulated. Flexible control of the state of polarisation of vortex beams is important in optical manipulation, communications, metrology and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Five-dimensional single-shot fluorescence imaging using a polarized Fourier light-field microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-shot fluorescence imaging techniques have gained increasing interest in recent years due to their ability to rapidly capture complex biological data without the need for extensive scanning. In this letter, we introduce polarized Fourier light field microscopy (pFLFM), a novel fluorescence imaging technique that captures five-dimensional information (3D intensity and 2D polarization) in a single snapshot. This technique combines a polarization camera with an FLFM setup, significantly improving data acquisition efficiency. We experimentally validated the pFLFM system using a fluorescent Siemens star, demonstrating consistent resolution and an extended depth of field across various polarizations. Using the 5D imaging capabilities of pFLFM, we imaged plant roots and uncovered unique heterogeneities in cellulose fibril configurations across various root sections. These results not only highlight the potential of pFLFM in biological and environmental sciences, but also represent a significant advancement in the design of single-shot fluorescence imaging systems.</description>

      <title>A photonic integrated processor for multiple parallel computational tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical networks with parallel processing capabilities are significant in advancing high-speed data computing and large-scale data processing by providing ultra-width computational bandwidth. In this paper, we present a photonic integrated processor that can be segmented into multiple functional blocks, to enable compact and reconfigurable matrix operations for multiple parallel computational tasks. Fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform, the photonic integrated processor supports fully reconfigurable optical matrix operations. By segmenting the chip into multiple functional blocks, it enables optical matrix operations of various sizes, offering great flexibility and scalability for parallel computational tasks. Specifically, we utilize this processor to perform optical convolution operations with various kernel sizes, including reconfigurable three-channel 1x1 convolution kernels and 2x2 real-valued convolution kernels, implemented within distinct segmented blocks of the chip. The multichannel optical 1x1 convolution operation is experimentally validated by using the deep residual U-Net, demonstrating precise segmentation of pneumonia lesion region in lung CT images. In addition, the capability of the 2x2 optical convolution operation is also experimentally validated by constructing an optical convolution layer and integrating an electrical fully connected layer, achieving ten-class classification of handwritten digit images. The photonic integrated processor features high scalability and robust parallel computational capability, positioning it a promising candidate for applications in optical neural networks.</description>

      <title>Scalable intensity-based photonic matrix-vector multiplication processor using single-wavelength time-division-multiplexed signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits provide a compact platform for ultrafast and energy-efficient matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) in the optical domain. Recently, schemes based on time-division multiplexing (TDM) have been proposed as scalable approaches for realizing large-scale photonic MVM processors. However, existing demonstrations rely on coherent detection or multiple wavelengths, both of which complicate their operations. In this work, we demonstrate a scalable TDM-based photonic MVM processor that uses only single-wavelength intensity-modulated optical signals, thereby avoiding coherent detection and enabling simplified operations. A 32-channel processor is fabricated on a Si-on-insulator (SOI) platform and used to experimentally perform convolution operations in a convolutional neural network (CNN) for handwritten digit recognition, achieving a classification accuracy of 93.47% for 1500 images.</description>

      <title>Enhanced fidelity in nonlinear structured light by virtual light-based apertures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tailoring the degrees of freedom (DoF) of light for a desired purpose, so-called structured light, has delivered numerous advances over the past decade, ranging from communications and quantum cryptography to optical trapping, and microscopy. The shaping toolkit has traditionally been linear in nature, only recently extended to the nonlinear regime, where input beams overlap in a nonlinear crystal to generate a structured output beam. Here we show how to enhance the fidelity of the structured output by aligning light with light. Using orbital angular momentum modes and difference frequency generation as an example, we demonstrate precise control of the spatial overlap in both the transverse and longitudinal directions using the structure of one mode as a virtual structured (in amplitude and phase) light-based aperture for the other. Our technique can easily be translated to other structured light fields as well as alternative nonlinear processes such as second harmonic generation and sum frequency generation, enabling advancements in communication, imaging, and spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Infrared Metaplasmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic response in metals, defined as the ability to support subwavelength confinement of surface plasmon modes, is typically limited to a narrow frequency range below the metals' plasma frequency. This places severe limitations on the operational wavelengths of plasmonic materials and devices. However, when the volume of a metal film is massively decreased, highly confined quasi-two-dimensional surface plasmon modes can be supported out to wavelengths well beyond the plasma wavelength. While this has, thus far, been achieved using ultra-thin (nm-scale) metals, such films are quite difficult to realize, and suffer from even higher losses than bulk plasmonic films. To extend the plasmonic response to the infrared, here we introduce the concept of metaplasmonics, representing a novel plasmonic modality with a host of appealing properties. By fabricating and characterizing a series of metaplasmonic nanoribbons, we demonstrate large confinement, high quality factors, and large near-field enhancements across a broad wavelength range, extending well beyond the limited bandwidth of traditional plasmonic materials. We demonstrate $35\times$ plasmon wavelength reduction, and our numerical simulations suggest that further wavelength reduction, up to a factor of 150, is achievable using our approach. The demonstration of the metaplasmonics paradigm offers a promising path to fill the near- and mid-infrared technological gap for high quality plasmonic materials, and provides a new material system to study the effects of extreme plasmonic confinement for applications in nonlinear and quantum plasmonics.</description>

      <title>Tightly-confined and long Z-cut lithium niobate waveguide with ultralow-loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium niobate (LN) is a promising material for future complex photonic-electronic circuits, with wide applications in fields like data communications, sensing, optical computation, and quantum optics. There was a great step toward LN photonic integrated circuits (PICs) with the development of dry etching for low-loss LN on insulator (LNOI) waveguides. However, the versatility of the LN waveguide platform for applications like $\chi^3$ nonlinear devices and passive phase sensitive components, has not been fully utilized. The main challenges are the difficulty of making highly confined ultralow-loss waveguides and overcoming the strong material birefringence. Here, we developed a fabrication technology for an ultralow-loss, tightly-confined, dispersion-engineered LN waveguide. We demonstrated an ultra-low propagation loss of 5.8 dB/m in a decimeter-long LN spiral waveguide. We focused on Z-cut LN waveguides with TE mode to avoid the material birefringence. Aiming for $\chi^3$ nonlinear applications, we demonstrated the first all normal-dispersion (ANDi) based coherent octave-spanning supercontinuum frequency comb in integrated LN waveguide. Our ultralow-loss Z-cut LN long waveguide might be useful in on-chip narrow linewidth lasers, optical delay lines, and parametric amplifiers.</description>

      <title>Optical Footprint of Ghost and Leaky Hyperbolic Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating hyperbolic polaritons at infrared frequencies has recently garnered interest as it promises to deliver new functionality for next-generation optical and photonic devices. This study investigates the impact of the crystal's anisotropy orientation on the Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) spectra, more specifically, revealing the optical footprint of elliptical, ghost (GHP) and leaky (LHP) hyperbolic polaritons. Our findings reveal that the ATR spectra of GHPs exhibit a distinct hyperbolic behaviour which is similar to that recently observed using s-SNOM techniques. Similarly, the ATR spectra of LHPs show its clear lenticular behaviour; however, here we are able to discern the effects of large asymmetry due to cross-polarisation conversion when the crystal anisotropy is tilted away from the surface. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by controlling the anisotropy orientation of hyperbolic media it is possible to significantly alter the optical response of these polaritons. Thus, our results provide a foundation for the design of direction-dependent optical devices.</description>

      <title>Absorption loss and Kerr nonlinearity in barium titanate waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because of its exceptionally large Pockels coefficient, barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$) is a promising material for various photonic applications at both room and cryogenic temperatures, including electro-optic modulation, frequency comb generation, and microwave-optical transduction. These applications rely on devices with low optical loss to achieve high efficiency. Material absorption sets a lower limit to optical loss and is thus a crucial property to determine, particularly for integrated photonic devices. Using cavity-enhanced photothermal spectroscopy, we measure the absorption loss of BaTiO$_3$ ridge waveguides at wavelengths near 1550~nm to be $\alpha_{\mathrm{abs}} = 10.9$~{\raisebox{0.5ex}{\tiny$^{+5.8}_{-0.4}$}} dB~m$^{-1}$, well below the propagation losses due to other sources, such as scattering. We simultaneously determine that BaTiO$_3$ has a large Kerr nonlinear refractive index of $n_{\mathrm{2,BaTiO_3}}$ = 1.8 {\raisebox{0.5ex}{\tiny$^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$}} $\times$ 10$^{-18}$ m$^2$ W$^{-1}$. Considering these results, photonic integrated circuits utilizing BaTiO$_3$ have the potential to achieve significantly higher efficiency than demonstrated to date and are especially interesting for applications exploiting the combination of Pockels and Kerr effects.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Enumeration of Three-Dimensional Photonic Crystals Enabled through Deep Learning Assisted Fourier Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) photonic structures enable numerous applications through their unique ability to guide, trap, and manipulate light. Constructing new functional photonic crystals remains a significant challenge since traditional design principles based on band structure calculations require numerous time-consuming computations. Additionally, traditional design is based on enumerated structures making it difficult to find novel functional geometries. Here, we propose an ultra-fast photonic crystal performance prediction method to enable efficient structure optimization of arbitrary 3D photonic crystals even with multiple variable modulation. Our methodology combines Fourier synthesis-enabling the creation of any smooth geometry within a crystallographic space group-with deep learning, which facilitates efficient photonic characterization within the vast parameter space. Over 2 million structures can be explored within 2 hours using a mainstream desktop workstation. The ideal structures with desired band properties, such as large photonic bandgap, specific frequency ranges, etc., could be rapidly discovered. We systematically confirmed the well-documented assumption that the most significant photonic bandgaps are found in minimal surface morphologies, in which the single diamond (dia net) with Fd3m (227) symmetry reigns supreme among known photonic structures, followed by the chiral single gyroid (srs net) with I4132 (214) symmetry. Additionally, a less well-known 3D photonic crystal with lcs topology within Ia3d (230) was rediscovered to exhibit a wide complete photonic bandgap, comparable to the diamond and the gyroid net. Our method not only validates the assumed hierarchy of photonic structures but also lays the foundation for the tailored design of functional materials and offers fresh insights into the advancement of next-generation optical devices and information technology.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Resolved Core Exciton Dynamics in LiF Using Attosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to control absorption by modifying the polarization of light presents an exciting opportunity to experimentally determine the orbital alignment of absorption features. Here, attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate the polarization dependence of core exciton dynamics in LiF thin films at the Li+ K edge. XUV pulses excite electrons from the Li 1s core level into the conduction band, allowing for the formation of a p-orbital-like core exciton, aligned along the XUV light polarization axis. A sub-5 fs near-infrared (NIR) probe pulse then arrives at variable time delays, perturbing the XUV-excited states and allowing the coherence decay of the core exciton to be mapped. The coherence lifetimes are found to be ~2.4 +- 0.4 fs, which is attributed to a phonon-mediated dephasing mechanism as in previous core exciton studies. The differential absorption features are also shown to be sensitive to the relative polarization of the XUV and NIR fields. The parallel NIR probe induces couplings between the initial XUV-excited p-like bright exciton and s-like dark excitons. When crossed pump and probe polarizations are used, the coupling between the bright and dark states is no longer dipole-allowed, and the transient absorption signal associated with the coupling is suppressed by approximately 90%. This interpretation is supported by simulations of a few-level model system, as well as analysis of the calculated band structure. The results indicate that laser polarization can serve as a powerful experimental tool for exploring the orbital alignment of core excitonic states in solid-state materials.</description>

      <title>Deflection of Interferometry Beams due to Transverse Refractive Index Gradient in SST-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Far Infrared interferometry is the main diagnostics method for electron density measurements in medium sized tokamaks. The transverse density gradients of plasma produce refractive effect, and the probing radiation does not propagate along a straight line and gets deflected. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the plasma effect on beam direction to verify if the used wavelength is compatible with the machine geometry. This paper presents the analytical results of refractive bending of THz beam due to transverse density gradients for circular and elliptical cross section plasma. The results from ray tracing integration to calculate refractive bending in D-shaped plasmas are also presented.</description>

Abstract: Coupled optical cavities, which support normal modes, play a critical role in optical filtering, sensing, slow-light generation, and quantum state manipulation. Recent theoretical work has proposed incorporating nonlinear materials into these systems to enable novel quantum technologies. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of squeezing generated in a quantum-enhanced coupled-cavity system, achieving a quantum noise reduction of 3.5 dB at a normal-mode splitting frequency of 7.47 MHz. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the system's loss mechanisms and performance limitations, validating theoretical predictions. Our results underscore the promise of coupled-cavity squeezers for advanced quantum applications, including gravitational wave detection and precision sensing.</description>

      <title>Digital Quantum Simulations of the Non-Resonant Open Tavis-Cummings Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The open Tavis-Cummings model consists of $N$ quantum emitters interacting with a common cavity mode, accounts for losses and decoherence, and is frequently explored for quantum information processing and designing quantum devices. As $N$ increases, it becomes harder to simulate the open Tavis-Cummings model using traditional methods. To address this problem, we implement two quantum algorithms for simulating the dynamics of this model in the inhomogenous, non-resonant regime, with up to three excitations in the cavity. We show that the implemented algorithms have gate complexities that scale polynomially, as $O(N^2)$ and $O(N^3)$. One of these algorithms is the sampling-based wave matrix Lindbladization algorithm, for which we propose two protocols to implement its system-independent fixed interaction, resolving key open questions of [Patel and Wilde, Open Sys. &amp; Info. Dyn., 30:2350014 (2023)]. Furthermore, we benchmark our results against a classical differential equation solver and demonstrate the ability to simulate classically intractable systems.</description>

      <title>Sample Classification using Machine Learning-Assisted Entangled Two-Photon Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entangled two-photon absorption (eTPA) has been recognized as a potentially powerful tool for the implementation of ultra-sensitive spectroscopy. Unfortunately, there exists a general agreement in the quantum optics community that experimental eTPA signals, particularly those obtained from molecular solutions, are extremely weak. Consequently, obtaining spectroscopic information about an arbitrary sample via conventional methods rapidly becomes an unrealistic endeavor. To address this problem, we introduce an experimental scheme that reduces the amount of data needed to identify and classify unknown samples via their electronic structure. Our proposed method makes use of machine learning (ML) to extract information about the number of intermediate levels that participate in the two-photon excitation of the absorbing medium. This is achieved by training artificial neural networks (ANNs) with various eTPA signals where the delay between the absorbed photons is externally controlled. Inspired by multiple experimental studies of eTPA, we consider model systems comprising one to four intermediate levels, whose energies are randomly chosen from four different intermediate-level band gaps, namely: $\Delta\lambda = 10$, $20$, $30$, and $40$ nm. Within these band gaps, and with the goal of testing the efficiency of our artificial intelligence algorithms, we make use of three different wavelength spacing $1$, $0.5$ and $0.1$ nm. We find that for a proper entanglement time between the absorbed photons, classification average efficiencies exceed 99$\%$ for all configurations. Our results demonstrate the potential of artificial neural networks for facilitating the experimental implementation of eTPA spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Steering laser-produced THz radiation in air with superluminal ionization fronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that pulsed THz radiation produced in air by a focused ultrashort laser pulse can be steered to large angles or even in the backward direction with respect to the laser propagation axis. The emission angle is adjusted by the flying focus technique, which determines the speed and direction of the ionization front created by the single-color laser pulse. This easily adjustable THz source, being well separated from the intense laser, opens exciting applications for remote THz spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>End-to-end metasurface design for temperature imaging via broadband Planck-radiation regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for temperature imaging from long-wavelength infrared thermal radiation (e.g. 8-12 $\mu$m) through the end-to-end design of a metasurface-optics frontend and a computational-reconstruction backend. We introduce a new nonlinear reconstruction algorithm, ``Planck regression," that reconstructs the temperature map from a grayscale sensor image, even in the presence of severe chromatic aberration, by exploiting blackbody and optical physics particular to thermal imaging. We combine this algorithm with an end-to-end approach that optimizes a manufacturable, single-layer metasurface to yield the most accurate reconstruction. Our designs demonstrate high-quality, noise-robust reconstructions of arbitrary temperature maps (including completely random images) in simulations of an ultra-compact thermal-imaging device. We also show that Planck regression is much more generalizable to arbitrary images than a straightforward neural-network reconstruction, which requires a large training set of domain-specific images.</description>

      <title>Braided interferometer mesh for robust photonic matrix-vector multiplications with non-ideal components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) are essential for a wide range of applications, particularly in modern machine learning and quantum computing. In photonics, there is growing interest in developing architectures capable of performing linear operations with high speed, low latency, and minimal loss. Traditional interferometric photonic architectures, such as the Clements design, have been extensively used for MVM operations. However, as these architectures scale, improving stability and robustness becomes critical. In this paper, we introduce a novel photonic braid interferometer architecture that outperforms both the Clements and Fldzhyan designs in these aspects. Using numerical simulations, we evaluate the performance of these architectures under ideal conditions and systematically introduce non-idealities such as insertion losses, beam splitter imbalances, and crosstalk. The results demonstrate that the braid architecture offers superior robustness due to its symmetrical design and reduced layer count. Further analysis shows that the braid architecture is particularly advantageous in large-scale implementations, delivering better performance as the size of the interferometer increases. We also assess the footprint and total insertion losses of each architecture. Although waveguide crossings in the braid architecture slightly increase the footprint and insertion loss, recent advances in crossing technology significantly minimize these effects. Our study suggests that the braid architecture is a robust solution for photonic neuromorphic computing, maintaining high fidelity in realistic conditions where imperfections are inevitable.</description>

      <title>Generation of Deep Ultraviolet Optical Vortices via Amplitude and Phase Spiral Zone Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the development and experimental implementation of diffractive optical elements designed to generate optical vortices in the deep ultraviolet range (from 260 to 266 nm). These elements, fabricated using advanced lithographic and etching techniques, facilitate the efficient transformation of Gaussian beams into twisted modes carrying orbital angular momentum. Experimental tests conducted using the laser driver of an RF photoinjector at JINR successfully demonstrate the generation of deep-ultraviolet optical vortices with a topological charge of l = 1. These findings underscore the potential of structured light in the deep ultraviolet range for applications in relativistic electron beam studies and beam manipulation technologies.</description>

      <title>Exploring the boundary of quantum correlations with a time-domain optical processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contextuality is a hallmark feature of the quantum theory that captures its incompatibility with any noncontextual hidden-variable model. The Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger (GHZ)-type paradoxes are proofs of contextuality that reveal this incompatibility with deterministic logical arguments. However, the GHZ-type paradox whose events can be included in the fewest contexts and which brings the strongest nonclassicality remains elusive. Here, we derive a GHZ-type paradox with a context-cover number of three and show this number saturates the lower bound posed by quantum theory. We demonstrate the paradox with a time-domain fiber optical platform and recover the quantum prediction in a 37-dimensional setup based on high-speed modulation, convolution, and homodyne detection of time-multiplexed pulsed coherent light. By proposing and studying a strong form of contextuality in high-dimensional Hilbert space, our results pave the way for the exploration of exotic quantum correlations with time-multiplexed optical systems.</description>

      <title>PyMoosh : a comprehensive numerical toolkit for computing the optical properties of multilayered structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present PyMoosh, a Python-based simulation library designed to provide a comprehensive set of numerical tools allowing to compute essentially all optical characteristics of multilayered structures, ranging from reflectance and transmittance to guided modes and photovoltaic efficiency. PyMoosh is designed not just for research purposes, but also for use-cases in education. To this end, we have invested significant effort in ensuring user-friendliness and simplicity of the interface. PyMoosh has been developed in line with the principles of Open Science and taking into account the fact that multilayered structures are increasingly being used as a testing ground for optimization and deep learning approaches. We provide in this paper the theoretical basis at the core of PyMoosh, an overview of its capabilities, as well as a comparison between the different numerical methods implemented in terms of speed and stability. We are convinced such a versatile tool will be useful for the community in many ways.</description>

      <title>Effect of photoinduced screening on the spectroscopic signature of exciton-phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The light-mediated interaction of fermionic and bosonic excitations governs the optoelectronic properties of condensed matter systems. In photoexcited semiconductors, the coupling of electron-hole pairs (excitons) to coherent optical phonons enables a modulation of the excitonic resonance that is phase-locked to the frequency of the coupled vibrational mode. Moreover, due to the Coulombic nature of excitons, their dynamics are sensitive to transient changes in the screening by the photoexcited carriers. Interestingly, the effect of photoinduced screening on the transient optical signal originating from the exciton dynamics coupled to phonons is not yet established. By means of broadband transient reflectance spectroscopy, we disclose how exciton-phonon coupling manifests in either presence or absence of dynamical screening in a layered semiconductor. Further, we unveil the promoting role of photoinduced screening on these exciton-phonon coupled dynamics as opposed to the case in which the unscreened exciton-exciton repulsion likely dominates the nonequilibrium optical response. These findings set a protocol to look at an excitonic resonance and its fundamental many-body interactions on the ultrafast timescale, and provide new perspectives on the access to nonequilibrium coupled dynamics.</description>

      <title>Differential pumping for kHz operation of a Laser Wakefield accelerator based on a continuously flowing Hydrogen gas jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21309v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laser-Wakefield Accelerators (LWFA) running at kHz repetition rates hold great potential for applications. They typically operate with low-energy, highly compressed laser pulses focused in high-pressure gas targets. Experiments have shown that the best-quality electron beams are achieved using Hydrogen gas targets. However, continuous operation with Hydrogen requires a dedicated pumping system. In this work, we present a method for designing a differential pumping system, which we successfully implemented in our experiments. This enabled the first demonstration of continuous operation of a kHz LWFA using a high-pressure Hydrogen gas jet. The system effectively maintained a pressure below 3e-4 mbar, even with a free-flowing gas jet operating at 140 bar backing pressure. Numerical fluid dynamics and optical simulations were used to guide and validate the system's design.</description>
