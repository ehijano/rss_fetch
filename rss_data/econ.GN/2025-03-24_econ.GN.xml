      <title>Darwinian spreading and quality thinning in even-aged boreal forest stands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16906v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Darwinian spreading of vigor, in addition to quality distribution, is introduced in a tree growth model. The size of any tree, within an even-aged stand, is taken as a measure of an inherited productive capacity, and then combined with quality thinning. For sparse cultivation density, the result is forestry without commercial thinnings; large trees cannot be removed since they are the most productive, neither small trees because the unit price of harvesting would be large. For large cultivation density, thinning from above becomes combined with quality thinning of large trees. Darwinian spreading of growth rate may correlate with quality. Quality thinning may enhance growth rate. Such effects combined, large trees still become removed but quality thinning becomes implemented in almost all diameter classes. At financial maturity, Darwinian spreading treated with quality thinning, the weighted mean breast height diameter is in the vicinity of 20 cm within stands of high planting density, and somewhat higher with low planting density. Quality correlating with Darwinian spreading of growth, and growth rate correlating with observed quality, trees grow bigger, the maturity size becoming closer to 25 cm - bigger than in earlier studies without tree-size - dependency of vigor.</description>

      <title>How to Promote Autonomous Driving with Evolving Technology: Business Strategy and Pricing Decision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, autonomous driving system (ADS) has been widely adopted due to its potential to enhance travel convenience and alleviate traffic congestion, thereby improving the driving experience for consumers and creating lucrative opportunities for manufacturers. With the advancement of data sensing and control technologies, the reliability of ADS and the purchase intentions of consumers are continually evolving, presenting challenges for manufacturers in promotion and pricing decisions. To address this issue, we develop a two-stage game-theoretical model to characterize the decision-making processes of manufacturers and consumers before and after a technology upgrade. Considering the unique structural characteristics of ADS, which consists of driving software and its supporting hardware (SSH), we propose different business strategies for SSH (bundle or unbundle with the vehicle) and driving software (perpetual licensing or subscription) from the manufacturer's perspective. We find that, first, SSH strategies influence the optimal software strategies by changing the consumers' entry barriers to the ADS market. Specifically, for manufacturers with mature ADS technology, the bundle strategy provides consumers with a lower entry barrier by integrating SSH, making the flexible subscription model a dominant strategy; while perpetual licensing outperforms under the unbundle strategy. Second, the software strategies influence the optimal SSH strategy by altering consumers' exit barriers. Perpetual licensing imposes higher exit barriers; when combined with a bundle strategy that lowers entry barriers, it becomes a more advantageous choice for manufacturers with mature ADS technology. In contrast, the subscription strategy allows consumers to easily exit the market, making the bundle strategy advantageous only when a substantial proportion of consumers are compatible with ADS.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Quotient (AIQ): A Novel Framework for Measuring Human-AI Collaborative Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into professional and personal domains, traditional metrics of human intelligence require reconceptualization. This paper introduces the Artificial Intelligence Quotient (AIQ), a novel measurement framework designed to assess an individual's capacity to effectively collaborate with and leverage AI systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). Building upon established cognitive assessment methodologies and contemporary AI interaction research, we present a comprehensive framework for quantifying human-AI collaborative intelligence. This work addresses the growing need for standardized evaluation of AI-augmented cognitive capabilities in educational and professional contexts.</description>

      <title>Users Favor LLM-Generated Content -- Until They Know It's AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how individuals evaluate human and large langue models generated responses to popular questions when the source of the content is either concealed or disclosed. Through a controlled field experiment, participants were presented with a set of questions, each accompanied by a response generated by either a human or an AI. In a randomized design, half of the participants were informed of the response's origin while the other half remained unaware. Our findings indicate that, overall, participants tend to prefer AI-generated responses. However, when the AI origin is revealed, this preference diminishes significantly, suggesting that evaluative judgments are influenced by the disclosure of the response's provenance rather than solely by its quality. These results underscore a bias against AI-generated content, highlighting the societal challenge of improving the perception of AI work in contexts where quality assessments should be paramount.</description>

      <title>AIDetection: A Generative AI Detection Tool for Educators Using Syntactic Matching of Common ASCII Characters As Potential 'AI Traces' Within Users' Internet Browser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a simple JavaScript-based web application designed to assist educators in detecting AI-generated content in student essays and written assignments. Unlike existing AI detection tools that rely on obfuscated machine learning models, AIDetection.info employs a heuristic-based approach to identify common syntactic traces left by generative AI models, such as ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, Gemini, Llama/Meta, Microsoft Copilot, Grammarly AI, and other text-generating models and wrapper applications. The tool scans documents in bulk for potential AI artifacts, as well as AI citations and acknowledgments, and provides a visual summary with downloadable Excel and CSV reports. This article details its methodology, functionalities, limitations, and applications within educational settings.</description>

      <title>From G-Factor to A-Factor: Establishing a Psychometric Framework for AI Literacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research addresses the growing need to measure and understand AI literacy in the context of generative AI technologies. Through three sequential studies involving a total of 517 participants, we establish AI literacy as a coherent, measurable construct with significant implications for education, workforce development, and social equity. Study 1 (N=85) revealed a dominant latent factor - termed the "A-factor" - that accounts for 44.16% of variance across diverse AI interaction tasks. Study 2 (N=286) refined the measurement tool by examining four key dimensions of AI literacy: communication effectiveness, creative idea generation, content evaluation, and step-by-step collaboration, resulting in an 18-item assessment battery. Study 3 (N=146) validated this instrument in a controlled laboratory setting, demonstrating its predictive validity for real-world task performance. Results indicate that AI literacy significantly predicts performance on complex, language-based creative tasks but shows domain specificity in its predictive power. Additionally, regression analyses identified several significant predictors of AI literacy, including cognitive abilities (IQ), educational background, prior AI experience, and training history. The multidimensional nature of AI literacy and its distinct factor structure provide evidence that effective human-AI collaboration requires a combination of general and specialized abilities. These findings contribute to theoretical frameworks of human-AI collaboration while offering practical guidance for developing targeted educational interventions to promote equitable access to the benefits of generative AI technologies.</description>

      <title>Urban Mobility in the Age of Automation: Analyzing Public Attitudes Toward Privately-Owned versus Shared Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transportation systems will be likely transformed by the emergence of automated vehicles (AVs) promising for safe, convenient, and efficient mobility, especially if used in shared systems (shared AV or SAV). However, the potential tendency is observed towards owning AV as a private asset rather than using SAV. This calls for a research on investigating individuals' attitude towards AV in comparison with SAV to recognize the barriers to the public's tendency towards SAV. To do so, the present study proposes a modeling framework based on the theories in behavioral psychology to explain individuals' preference for owning AV over using SAV, built as a latent (subjective) psychometric construct, by three groups of explanatory latent constructs including: (i) desire for searching for benefits, i.e., extrinsic motive manifested in utilitarian beliefs; (ii) tendency towards seeking pleasure and joy, i.e., intrinsic motive reflected in hedonic beliefs; and (iii) attitude towards three configurations of shared mobility, i.e., experience with car and ridesharing, bikesharing, and public transit. Estimated on a sample dataset from the State of California, the findings can shed initial lights on the psychological determinants of the public's attitude towards owning AV versus using SAV, which can furthermore provide policy implications intriguing for policy makers and stakeholders. Of note, the findings reveal the strongest influential factor on preference for AV over SAV as hedonic beliefs reflected in perceived enjoyment. This preference is next affected by utilitarian beliefs, particularly perceived benefit and trust of stranger, followed by attitude towards car and ride sharing.</description>

      <title>Strategic Responses to Technological Change: Evidence from Online Labor Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15262v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this project, we examine how freelancers changed their behavior on an online work platform following the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. We first document that, post-ChatGPT, freelancers bid on fewer jobs and reposition themselves by differentiating their distribution of bids relative to their prior behavior. We disentangle heterogeneity in repositioning across work domains by exploring how exposure to changes in supply or demand underlie repositioning. Decreases in the demand for labor post-ChatGPT lead workers to reposition themselves by withdrawing from the focal market/exiting the platform and changing their horizontal positioning (i.e., work domain), while increases in the supply of labor post-ChatGPT are less likely to lead to changes in volume of activity or horizontal positioning but more likely to result decrease the proportion of bids to high-value jobs, perhaps in response to increased competition. We further show that repositioning is less likely when adjustment costs are higher due to greater skill. Our research contributes to our understanding of how and why workers respond to technological change.</description>

      <title>Quality thinning and value development of boreal trees on spruce-dominated stands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time, quality distribution of trees is introduced in a tree growth model. Consequently, the effects of quality thinning on stand development can be investigated. Quality thinning improves the financial return in all cases studied, but the effect is small. Rotation ages, timber stocks and maturity diameters are not much affected by quality thinning. Bare land valuation neither changes the contribution of the quality thinning. The reason for the small effect apparently lies in the value development of individual trees. The relative value development of small pulpwood trunks is large, since the harvesting expense per volume unit is reduced along with size increment. Such trees are not feasible objects for quality thinning, unless quality correlates with growth rate. Another enhanced stage of value development is when pulpwood trunks turn to sawlog trunks. For large pulpwood trunks, quality thinning is feasible. Existing sawlog content in trees dilutes the effect of quality thinning on the financial return. The results change if the growth rate is positively correlated with quality, quality thinning becoming feasible in all commercial diameter classes.</description>
