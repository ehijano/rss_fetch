      <title>Flapping dynamics of a compliant membrane in a uniform incoming flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theoretical and experimental investigations have revealed that flapping compliant membrane wings can significantly enhance propulsive performance (e.g. Tzezana and Breuer, 2019, J. Fluid Mech., 862, 871-888) and energy harvesting efficiency (e.g. Mathai et al., 2022, J. Fluid Mech., 942, R4) compared to rigid foils. Here, we numerically investigate the effects of the stretching coefficient (or aeroelastic number), $K_S$, the flapping frequency, $St_c$, and the pitching amplitude, $\theta_0$, on the propulsive performance of a compliant membrane undergoing combined heaving and pitching in uniform flow. Distinct optimal values of $K_S$ are identified that respectively maximize thrust and efficiency: thrust can be increased by 200%, and efficiency by 100%, compared to the rigid case. Interestingly, these optima do not occur at resonance but at frequency ratios (flapping to natural) below unity, and this ratio increases with flapping frequency. Using a force decomposition based on the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor $Q$, which measures the relative strength between the rotation and deformation of fluid elements, we show that thrust primarily arises from $Q$-induced and body-acceleration forces. The concave membrane surface can trap the leading-edge vortex (LEV) from the previous half-stroke, generating detrimental $Q$-induced drag. However, moderate concave membrane deformation weakens this LEV and enhances body-acceleration-induced thrust. Thus, the optimal $K_S$ for maximum thrust occurs below resonance, balancing beneficial deformation against excessive drag. Furthermore, by introducing the membrane's deformation into a tangential angle at the leading edge and substituting it into an existing scaling law developed for rigid plates, we obtain predictive estimates for the thrust and power coefficients of the membrane.</description>

      <title>Solutions of the spray flamelet equations in a non-monotonic mixture fraction space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving the spray flamelet equations in composition space is very challenging, which is attributable to the fact that the maximum value of the mixture fraction, $Z_\mathrm{max}$, is a priori unknown in such flames. In this work, an analytical solution for this quantity is proposed, which allows its determination in spray flames subject to imposed quadratic evaporation profiles. It is then illustrated how the proposed approach allows to effectively cover the solution space of the spray flamelet equations. The employed strategy works very well for the considered cases and the generality of the evaporation profile definition provides flexibility for explorations of other parametric choices in the future.</description>

      <title>Energy cascades in rotating and stratified turbulence in anisotropic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of inverse energy cascades has played a central role in the development of turbulence theory, with applications in two-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional flows. We examine the presence or absence of inverse energy cascades in rotating stably stratified flows constrained to anisotropic yet fully three-dimensional domains, in a range of parameters that are relevant for planetary atmospheres. In particular, we focus on regimes with aspect ratios, Rossby, and Froude numbers similar to those found in the Earth's and other planets atmospheres. Our results show that, under certain conditions, inverse energy cascades can indeed emerge from the dry fluid dynamics solely, suggesting that this process can play a role in intermediate-scale atmospheric self-organization processes.</description>

      <title>Design, Simulation, and Fabrication of a Hexagonal Microfluidic Platform for Culturing Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing an organoid computing platform from neurons in vitro demands stable, precisely controlled microenvironments. To address this requirement, we designed, simulated, and fabricated a microfluidic device featuring hexagonal wells ($34.64\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ side length) in a honeycomb array connected by $20\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ channels. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, validated by high mesh quality ($0.934$ orthogonal quality) and robust convergence, confirmed the architecture supports flow regimes ideal for ensuring cell viability. At target flow rates of $0.1$ - $1\,\mathrm{\mu L/min}$, simulations revealed the extrapolated pressure differential across the full $50{,}000\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ device remains within stable operating limits at $177\,\mathrm{kPa}$ (average) and $329\,\mathrm{kPa}$ (maximum). Photolithography successfully produced this architecture, with only minor corner rounding observed at feature interfaces. This work therefore establishes a computationally validated and fabricated platform, paving the way for experimental flow characterization and subsequent neural integration.</description>

      <title>Output-recurrent gated state space model for multiphase flows modeling and uncertainty quantification of exhaust vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an Output-Recurrent Gated State Space Model (OR-GSSM) for complex multiphase flows modeling and uncertainty quantification of exhaust vehicles during motion. By establishing the state-space formulation of the gas-liquid Navier-Stokes equations applying semigroup theory and Galerkin projection, explicitly characterizing the dynamic coupling evolution between the velocity, pressure, and volume fraction fields. A novel Gated State Space Transition (GSST) unit is designed to learn parameterized transition and input matrices with adaptive timescales, enhancing physical interpretability and computational efficiency. The output recursion mechanism aligns with the numerical solution characteristics of state-space equations, mitigating long-term error accumulation and addressing training-inference pattern mismatch issues inherent in teacher forcing and scheduled sampling. Validations on the underwater cone-head and water-exit hemisphere-head vehicles demonstrate that: OR-GSSM outperforms OR-ConvLSTM and OR-ConvGRU baselines in accuracy and computational efficiency through its physics-informed adaptive state-space unit design and parallel matrix operations; The output recursion mechanism ensures more stable training, better generalization, and higher prediction accuracy than teacher forcing and scheduled sampling; OR-GSSM accurately captures the gas-phase expansion, gas-liquid mixing formation, backflow jet generation, bubble shedding, and entire water-exit process, etc, showcasing outstanding modeling capability; Its uncertainty quantification effectively characterizes flow features and uncertainty distributions, validating prediction reliability. The proposed method resolves the accuracy-real-time trade-off in traditional computational fluid dynamics, advancing machine learning for multiphase flow modeling and uncertainty quantification in exhaust vehicles.</description>

      <title>Space-time nonlinear reduced-order modelling for unsteady flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates projection-based Reduced-Order Models (ROMs) formulated in the frequency domain, employing a space-time basis constructed with Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition to efficiently represent dominant spatio-temporal coherent structures. Although frequency domain formulations are well suited to capturing time-periodic solutions, such as unstable periodic orbits, this study focusses on modelling statistically stationary flows by computing long-time solutions that approximate their underlying statistics. In contrast to traditional ROMs based solely on spatial modes, a space-time formulation achieves simultaneous reduction in both space and time. This is accomplished by Galerkin projection of the Navier-Stokes equations onto the basis using a space-time inner product, yielding a quadratic algebraic system of equations in the unknown amplitude coefficients. Solutions of the ROM are obtained by identifying amplitude coefficients that minimise an objective function corresponding to the sum of the squares of the residuals of the algebraic system across all frequencies and modes, quantifying the aggregate violation of momentum conservation within the reduced subspace. A robust gradient-based optimisation algorithm is employed to identify the minima of this objective function. The method is demonstrated for chaotic flow in a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity at $Re=20{,}000$, where solutions with extended temporal periods approximately fifteen times the dominant shear layer time scale are sought. Even without employing closure models to represent the truncated spatio-temporal triadic interactions, multiple ROM solutions are found that successfully reproduce the dominant dynamical flow features and predict the statistical distribution of turbulent quantities with good fidelity, although they tend to overpredict energy at spatio-temporal scales near the truncation boundary.</description>

      <title>SmartFlow: A CFD-solver-agnostic deep reinforcement learning framework for computational fluid dynamics on HPC platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is emerging as a powerful tool for fluid-dynamics research, encompassing active flow control, autonomous navigation, turbulence modeling and discovery of novel numerical schemes. We introduce SmartFlow, a CFD-solver-agnostic framework for both single- and multi-agent DRL algorithms that can easily integrate with MPI-parallel CPU and GPU-accelerated solvers. Built on Relexi and SmartSOD2D, SmartFlow uses the SmartSim infrastructure library and our newly developed SmartRedis-MPI library to enable asynchronous, low-latency, in-memory communication between CFD solvers and Python-based DRL algorithms. SmartFlow leverages PyTorch's Stable-Baselines3 for training, which provides a modular, Gym-like environment API. We demonstrate its versatility via three case studies: single-agent synthetic-jet control for drag reduction in a cylinder flow simulated by the high-order FLEXI solver, multi-agent cylinder wake control using the GPU-accelerated spectral-element code SOD2D, and multi-agent wall-model learning for large-eddy simulation with the finite-difference solver CaLES. SmartFlow's CFD-solver-agnostic design and seamless HPC integration is promising to accelerate RL-driven fluid-mechanics studies.</description>

      <title>Can a convecting magma ocean offer a solution to the puzzling case of core convection in early earth?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convective flow in Earth's iron-rich liquid core drives self-sustained dynamo action, generating Earth's magnetic field, which is strongest among all terrestrial planets of the solar system. Rock records show that this magnetic field has been operative in Earth for at least 3.4 billion years (b.y). However, advanced high pressure experiments have revised the value of the thermal conductivity of the outer core, which implies an age for the inner core of less than 1 b.y., when compositional convection begins. This creates a puzzle, with a gap between the observations of an early magnetic field on Earth and the young inner core. Previous work has suggested that the pre-inner core dynamo could have been generated in a magma ocean (MO) at the base of the mantle; however, the fluid dynamics of this scenario have received little attention. Here we numerically model the non-magnetic rotating flow in a MO above a convectively stable core in a configuration representing the pre-inner core days of Earth's evolution. Simulations here explore the importance of several dimensionless parameters on coupled core-MO convection -- the Rayleigh number, the ocean/core thermal diffusivity ratio, thermal expansion coefficient ratio, viscosity ratio, and layer thickness ratio. It is found that the MO can easily drive a flow of comparable magnitude in the core, and an approximately linear relationship is observed between the ratio of root-mean-square velocities in the core and the ocean, $(u_c^{RMS}/u_o^{RMS})$, and $(\Nu_o-1)$, where $\Nu_o$ is the Nusselt number for the MO, for the $\Nu_o$ of order 1 to 10 considered. Radial and azimuthal components of the core flow are of similar magnitude, so that, with comparable toroidal and poloidal components, we speculate that the MO-driven core flow could drive an early dynamo.</description>

      <title>Contactless indentation of a soft boundary by a rigid particle in shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of a rigid particle above a fluid-fluid interface in shear flow is studied here numerically and analytically as a function of the downward force applied on the particle. It is found here that the particle goes below the equilibrium level of the interface for a strong enough downward force. Such states remain stable under flow, with a fluid film of a well-defined thickness separating the particle from the indented interface. This result contradicts the classical lubrication theory, which predicts an infinitely large downward force being necessary for the particle to approach the equilibrium level of the interface. It is found that the classical lubrication approximation is only valid in a narrow range of shear rates, which shrinks to a point when the particle approaches the equilibrium level of the interface. The gap renormalization model, proposed here, cures this limitation of the classical lubrication theory, showing quantitative agreement with the numerical results when the particle touches the equilibrium level of the interface. It is found that the gap renormalization model provides a quantitative interpretation of the recent experimental results, including the range of particle heights above the interface for which the classical lubrication approximation breaks down.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a Data-Driven Low-Dimensional Model of Turbulent Minimal Pipe Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulation of turbulent flow requires many degrees of freedom to resolve all the relevant times and length scales. However, due to the dissipative nature of the Navier-Stokes equations, the long-term dynamics are expected to lie on a finite-dimensional invariant manifold with fewer degrees of freedom. In this study, we build low-dimensional data-driven models of pressure-driven flow through a circular pipe. We impose the `shift-and-reflect' symmetry to study the system in a minimal computational cell (e.g., smallest domain size that sustains turbulence) at a Reynolds number of 2500. We build these models by using autoencoders to parametrize the manifold coordinates and neural ODEs to describe their time evolution. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) typically require on the order of O(105) degrees of freedom, while our data-driven framework enables the construction of models with fewer than 20 degrees of freedom. Remarkably, these reduced order models effectively capture crucial features of the flow, including the streak breakdown. In short-time tracking, these models accurately track the true trajectory for one Lyapunov time, while at long-times, they successfully capture key aspects of the dynamics such as Reynolds stresses and energy balance. Additionally, we report a library of exact coherent states (ECS) found in the DNS with the aid of these low-dimensional models. This approach leads to the discovery of seventeen previously unknown solutions within the turbulent pipe flow system, notably featuring relative periodic orbits characterized by the longest reported periods for such flow conditions.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Mesh Refinement for Two-Phase Viscoelastic Fluid Mixture Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19974v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiphase flows are an important class of fluid flow and their study facilitates the development of diverse applications in industrial, natural, and biomedical systems. We consider a model that uses a continuum description of both phases in which separate momentum equations are used for each phase along with a co-incompressibility condition on the velocity fields. The resulting system of equations poses numerical challenges due to the presence of multiple non-linear terms and the co-incompressibility condition, and the resulting fluid dynamics motivate the development of an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technique to accurately capture regions of high stresses and large material gradients while keeping computational costs low. We present an accurate, robust, and efficient computational method for simulating multiphase mixtures on adaptive grids, and utilize a multigrid solver to precondition the saddle-point system. We demonstrate that the AMR discretization asymptotically approaches second order accuracy in $L^1$, $L^2$ and $L^\infty$ norms. The solver can accurately resolve sharp gradients in the solution and, with the multigrid preconditioning strategy introduced herein, the linear solver iterations are independent of grid spacing. Our AMR solver offers a major cost savings benefit, providing up to ten fold speedup over a uniform grid in the numerical experiments presented here, with greater speedup possible depending on the problem set-up.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Solid-Fluid Interaction Scheme in Lattice Boltzmann Immiscible Pseudopotential Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22256v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pseudopotential model within the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) framework has emerged as a prominent approach in computational fluid dynamics due to its dual strengths in physical intuitiveness and computational tractability. However, when modeling wettability phenomenon, existing solid-fluid interaction schemes exhibit persistent challenges in multi-component immiscible fluid systems, notably manifested through spurious velocity artifacts and unphysical mass-transfer boundary layers. This study presents an improved interaction scheme that preserves implementation simplicity while effectively mitigating these numerical artifacts. Furthermore, leveraging the enhanced isotropy characteristics of eighth-order discrete schemes, we develop a novel boundary treatment methodology addressing second-layer lattice data reconstruction at complex interfaces. To verify the universality of the proposed optimization scheme, four benchmark scenarios, including static contact angle measurement on cylindrical surface, droplet dynamics through confined geometries, immiscible displacement processes, and co-current flow in microchannels, are simulated to demonstrate the proposed scheme's capability. The results show that the improved scheme can well simulate various complex immiscible multiphase flows.</description>

      <title>Hybrid High-Order formulations with turbulence modelling capabilities for incompressible flow problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Hybrid High-Order (HHO) formulation of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, that is well suited to be employed for the simulation of turbulent flows. The spatial discretization relies on hybrid velocity and pressure spaces and the temporal discretization is based on Explicit Singly Diagonal Implicit Runge-Kutta (ESDIRK) methods. The formulation possesses some attractive features that can be fruitfully exploited when high-fidelity computations are required, namely: pressure-robustness, conservation of mass enforced cell-by-cell up to machine precision, robustness in the inviscid limit, implicit high-order accurate time stepping with local time step adaptation, reduced memory footprint thanks to static condensation of both velocity and pressure, possibility to exploit inherited $p$-multilevel solution strategies to improve performance of iterative solvers. After demonstrating the relevant properties of the scheme in practice, performing challenging 2D and 3D test cases, we consider the simulation of the Taylor--Green Vortex flow problem at Reynolds 1600.</description>

      <title>Effects of strong turbulence for water waves</title>

Abstract: The results of direct numerical simulation of plane-symmetric turbulence of water waves for potential flows within the framework of conformal variables taking into account low-frequency pumping and high-frequency viscous dissipation are presented. In this model, for a wide range of pumping amplitudes, the weak turbulence regime was not detected. It is shown that for typical turbulence parameters, the main effects are the processes of wave breaking, the formation of cusps on wave crests, which make the main contribution to the turbulence spectra with a dependence on frequency and wavenumber with the same exponent equal to $-4$. In this strongly nonlinear regime, the probability density of wave steepness at large deviations has power-law tails responsible for the intermittency of turbulence.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Physics-informed Neural Network: Towards Efficient Learning of High-speed Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study benchmarks hybrid quantum physics-informed neural network (HQPINN) to model high-speed flows, compared against classical physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and fully quantum neural networks (QNNs). The HQPINN architecture integrates a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) with a classical neural network in parallel, trained via a physics-informed loss. Across harmonic, non-harmonic, and transonic benchmarks, HQPINNs demonstrate balanced performance, offering competitive accuracy and stability with reduced parameter cost. Quantum PINNs are highly efficient for harmonic problems achieving the lowest loss with minimal parameters due to their Fourier structure, but struggle to generalize in non-harmonic settings involving shocks and discontinuities. HQPINNs mitigate such artifacts, and with sufficient parameterization, can match the performance of classical models in more complex regimes. Although constrained by current quantum emulation costs and scalability, HQPINNs show promise as general-purpose solvers, offering parameter efficiency with robust fallback behavior, particularly suited for problems where the nature of the solution is not known a-priori.</description>
