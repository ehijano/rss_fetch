      <title>Comparison of inviscid and viscous vortex shedding from translating and rotating plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare an inviscid vortex sheet model with continuous leading-edge shedding with direct Navier-Stokes simulations over a wide range of unsteady plate motions at moderate Reynolds number ($\mathrm{Re} \approx 1000$). Approximately $70$ distinct kinematic configurations are examined, spanning both body-dominated and flow-dominated regimes. In body-dominated motions, where the fluid dynamics are primarily driven by prescribed plate accelerations, the inviscid model accurately reproduces normal force histories and the qualitative structure of the induced vorticity field. In flow-dominated configurations, with quasi-periodic vortex shedding, agreement with force predictions is good but reduced at low angles of attack, reflecting the greater sensitivity of vortex shedding dynamics to physical and computational parameters. The ability of the present formulation to accommodate stable, continuous leading-edge vortex shedding enables uniform comparisons across diverse motions and clarifies the regimes in which inviscid vortex sheet models can be used reliably for force prediction and physical interpretation.</description>

      <title>A Demonstration of a Neural Network as a Bridge Between Galaxy Simulations and Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that the stellar masses of galaxies in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, originally derived via stellar population synthesis modelling, can be accurately predicted using only their absolute magnitudes and colour indices. A central contribution of this work is the demonstration that this long-standing inference problem can be solved using an exceptionally simple machine-learning model: a fully connected, feed-forward artificial neural network with a single hidden layer. The network is trained exclusively on synthetic galaxies generated by the SHARK semi-analytic model and is shown to transfer effectively to real observations. Across nearly 3.5 dex in stellar mass, the predicted values closely track the GAMA SED-derived masses, with a typical scatter of ~0.131 dex. These results demonstrate that complex deep-learning architectures are not a prerequisite for robust stellar mass estimation, and that simulation-trained, lightweight machine-learning models can capture the dominant physical information encoded in broad-band photometry. The method is further applied to 17,006 GAMA galaxies lacking SED-derived masses, with photometric uncertainties propagated through the network to provide corresponding error estimates on the inferred stellar masses. Overall, this work establishes a computationally efficient and conceptually transparent pathway for simulation-to-observation transfer learning in galaxy evolution studies.</description>

      <title>A physics-inspired nonlinear momentum method for gradient descent with applications to inverse photonic design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, a nonlinear momentum method is introduced to enhance the convergence performance of momentum-based gradient optimization algorithms. Classical momentum methods, such as the Heavy Ball method, can be viewed as a dynamical system with quadratic kinetic energy and linear damping. By extending this analogy to non-Newtonian dynamical systems, we construct a Hamiltonian framework for optimization problems. In this framework, nonlinear kinetic energy and nonlinear damping effects naturally emerge. It provides a more flexible and physically interpretable mechanism for optimization algorithms. Specifically, we employ an anharmonic kinetic energy function to capture the inertial effects of accumulated gradient information during the optimization process, while the nonlinear damping mechanism effectively regulates the contribution of momentum during convergence. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method achieves faster convergence compared to classical momentum algorithms, making it particularly suitable for inverse design tasks. Moreover, the Hamiltonian based algorithmic framework may offer physical insights for the development of efficient physics-inspired optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Extracting Many-Body Quantum Resources within One-Body Reduced Density Matrix Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Fisher information (QFI) is a central concept in quantum sciences used to quantify the ultimate precision limit of parameter estimation, detect quantum phase transitions, witness genuine multipartite entanglement, or probe nonlocality. Despite this widespread range of applications, computing the QFI value of quantum many-body systems is, in general, a very demanding task. Here we combine ideas from functional theories and quantum information to develop a novel functional framework for the QFI of fermionic and bosonic ground states. By relying upon the constrained-search approach, we demonstrate that the QFI matricial values can universally be determined by the one-body reduced density matrix (1-RDM), avoiding thus the use of exponentially large wave functions. Furthermore, we show that QFI functionals can be determined from the universal 1-RDM functional by calculating its derivatives with respect to the coupling strengths, becoming thus the generating functional of the QFI. We showcase our approach with the Bose-Hubbard model and present exact analytical and numerical QFI functionals. Our results provide the first connection between the one-body reduced density matrix functional theory and the quantum Fisher information.</description>

      <title>A Nonlocal Orientation Field Phase-Field Model for Misorientation- and Inclination- Dependent Grain Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01688v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to incorporate grain boundary (GB) anisotropy in phase-field modeling by extending the standard partial differential equations formulation to include a nonlocal functional of an orientation field. Regardless of the number of grains in the simulation, the model uses a single orientation field and incorporates grain misorientation and inclination information obtained from sampling the orientation field at optimized locations in the vicinity of the grain boundary. The formalism enables simple and precise tuning of GB energy anisotropy while reducing an extensive fitting procedure. The functional includes an explicit GB anisotropy function to control the GB energy as a function of both misorientation and inclination. The model is validated by reproducing the linear grain growth rate, Wulff shapes with varying misorientations and anisotropic coefficients, and analytical equilibrium dihedral angles at triple junctions. Polycrystalline simulations demonstrate grain growth, coalescence, triple junction behavior, and the influence of anisotropy on grain morphology.</description>

      <title>Ultrastable 2D glasses and packings explained by local centrosymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03770v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the most recent numerical data by Bolton-Lum \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 136, 058201 (2026)], we demonstrate that ideal ultrastable glasses in the athermal limit (or ultrastable ideal 2D disk packings) possess a remarkably high degree of local centrosymmetry. In particular, we find that the inversion-symmetry order parameter for local force transmission introduced in Milkus and Zaccone, [Phys. Rev. 93, 094204 (2016)], is as high as $F_{IS}= 0.84522$, to be compared with $F_{IS}=1$ for perfect centrosymmetric crystals free of defects, and with $F_{IS} \sim 0.3-0.5$ for standard random packings. This observation provides a clear, natural explanation for the ultra-high shear modulus of ideal packings and ideal glasses, because the high centrosymmetry prevents non-affine relaxations which decrease the shear modulus. The same mechanism explains the absence of boson peak-like soft vibrational modes. These results also confirm what was found previous work, i.e. that the bond-orientational order parameter is a very poor correlator for the vibrational and mechanical</description>
