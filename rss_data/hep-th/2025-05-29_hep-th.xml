      <title>Disturbing news about the $d=2+\epsilon$ expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $O(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM) in $d=2+\epsilon$ has long been conjectured to describe the same conformal field theory (CFT) as the Wilson-Fisher (WF) $O(N)$ fixed point obtained from the $\lambda(\phi^2)^2$ model in $d=4-\epsilon$. In this work, we put this conjecture into question, building on the recent observation [Jones (2024)] that the NLSM CFT possesses a protected operator with dimension $N-1$, which is instead absent in the WF $O(N)$ CFT. For $N=3$, we investigate the possibility of lifting this operator via multiplet recombination - the only known mechanism that could resolve this mismatch. We compute the anomalous dimension of the lightest operator that could participate in recombination, and find that it remains too heavy to allow for this scenario. This suggests that the NLSM $O(3)$ fixed point in $d=2+\epsilon$ is not continuously connected to the WF $O(3)$ CFT, and may instead describe an alternative universality class, such as the hedgehog-suppressed critical point, corresponding to the N\'eel-VBS phase transition in $3$D. We also discuss how to generalize this analysis to $N&gt;3$.</description>

      <title>New BPS States from Bosonic/Heterotic Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the recently proposed bosonic/heterotic duality that relates the heterotic superstrings to the noncritical bosonic string. Although the latter is nonsupersymmetric, it can be viewed as pseudo-supersymmetric in that the theory admits a consistent set of Killing spinor equations whose integrability conditions are satisfied by the equations of motion. We construct two classes of the dual pairs of BPS and pseudo-BPS solutions in the respective heterotic and bosonic strings and obtain their explicit Killing spinors. The existence of such dual pairs lends support to the proposed duality.</description>

      <title>Resurgence Analysis of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at large charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fixed point of the three-dimensional NJL model in a double-scaling limit where both the charge $Q$ and the number of fermion flavors $N$ become large with a fixed ratio $q=Q/(2N)$. While a similar analysis has been performed for the bosonic O(N) model, fermionic models pose new challenges. In this work, we systematically explore the CFT spectrum in both the large and small $q$ limits beyond the first few orders, and perform a resurgence analysis. Through this approach, we identify the exponential corrections that relate the convergent small-$q$ expansion to the asymptotic large-$q$ behavior. Our results are suggestive of a geometric interpretation of these results in terms of the worldline of particles moving along the geodesics on the cylinder.</description>

      <title>Ensembles in M-theory and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss that the string/M-theory partition function requires a choice of ensembles, depending on which background fields are held fixed. The background fields correspond to worldvolume couplings in the effective action approach to the superstring, which we extrapolate to the M2-brane. One natural ensemble in this context, which we call the M2-ensemble, corresponds to fixing the value of the M-theory three-form potential. In holographic setups the choice of ensemble is important when comparing to observables in the dual field theory. Indeed, in AdS$_4$ holography the M2-ensemble does not map gravitational observables directly to field theory observables at a fixed rank $N$, but rather to observables in the grand canonical ensemble. We remark that many M2-brane partition functions take a simple form in this ensemble hinting at one-loop exactness. We also discuss how in AdS$_7$ holography, the M2-ensemble does correspond to the canonical ensemble in the field theory, i.e. the (2,0) theory at fixed rank $N$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The canonical quantization of a field theory for spin-$1/2$ massive bosons that satisfy the Klein-Gordon equation is presented. The spin-statistics theorem is evaded by the redefinition of the dual field, rendering the theory pseudo-Hermitian. The Hamiltonian is bounded from below with real eigenvalues, and the theory is consistent with microcausality and invariant under parity, charge conjugation and time reversal.</description>

      <title>Scheme Dependence of the One-Loop Domain Wall Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-loop tension of the domain wall in the 3+1 dimensional $\phi^4$ double-well model was derived long ago using dimensional regularization. The methods used can only be applied to solitons depending on a single dimension. In the past few months, domain wall tensions have been recalculated using spectral methods with Born subtractions and also linearized soliton perturbation theory, both of which may be generalized to arbitrary solitons. It has been shown that the former agrees with the results of Rebhan et al. In the present work, we argue that, if the same renormalization scheme is chosen, both new results agree.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization of holographic baryon in strongly coupled fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin polarization for baryon in a hydrodynamic medium has been extensively studied in the weakly coupled regime using quantum kinetic theory. As a first study of this problem in the strongly coupled regime, we investigate holographically the spectral function of a probe baryon in the fluid-gravity background. This is done by carefully performing gradient expansion of the Dirac equation in the fluid-gravity background. Different contributions in the expansion are understood in terms of density matrices of the probe baryon and the medium. The resulting spectral functions indicate that the holographic baryonic is polarized as responses to fluid acceleration, shear stress and vorticity. The structures of the responses are similar to those found in weakly coupled studies.</description>

      <title>Perfect fluid equations with N=1,2 Schrodinger supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconformal extensions of the perfect fluid equations, which realize $N=1,2$ Schrodinger superalgebra, are constructed within the Hamiltonian formalism. They are built by introducing real (for $N=1$) or complex (for $N=2$) anticommuting field variables as superpartners for the density and velocity of a fluid. The full set of conserved charges associated with the $N=1,2$ Schrodinger superalgebra is constructed. Within the Lagrangian formalism, when the Clebsch decomposition for the velocity vector field is used, the anticommuting variables can be interpreted as potentials parameterizing fluid's vorticity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study massive self-interacting vector field theories with mass added ``by hand".
  We show that the massless limit of the quartic self-interacting vector field theory is not smooth. Pathological behavior of the theory is not limited only at the classical level, even at the quantum level unitarity is violated at the two-loop. Using the Vainshtein mechanism, we show that it fails beyond the strong-coupling scale and hence a massless limit is not smooth even in quantum theory.</description>

      <title>A topological invariant in the context of the loop representation of the massive Kalb-Ramond-Klein-Gordon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the Dirac procedure to quantize the self-dual massive Kalb-Ramond-Klein-Gordon model in $2+1$ dimensional spacetimes. The canonical fields are expressed in terms of $2$-surfaces and signed points, ensuring the automatic realization of the quantum algebra. As the duality rotation preserving the action can be implemented infinitesimally, we derive the conserved quantity that generates the transformation. Given that such a generator is a two dimensional topological quantity, its representation in terms of geometrical operators yields a two dimensional invariant (reminiscent of a projection of Gauss's law in electrodynamics), which encodes the same information of the well-known winding number.</description>

      <title>On dual regime in Yang-Baxter deformed $\mathrm{O}(2N)$ sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a new class of integrable sigma models, which we refer to as the "dual regime" of Yang-Baxter (YB) deformed $\mathrm{O}(2N)$ sigma models. This dual regime manifests itself in the conformal perturbation approach. Namely, it is well known that conventional YB-deformed $\mathrm{O}(N)$ sigma models are described in the UV by a collection of free bosonic fields perturbed by some relevant operators. The holomorphic parts of these operators play the role of screening operators which define certain integrable systems in the free theory. All of these integrable systems depend on a continuous parameter $b$, which parametrizes the central charge, and are known to possess the duality under $b^2\longleftrightarrow -1-b^2$. Although $\mathrm{O}(2N+1)$ integrable systems are self-dual, $\mathrm{O}(2N)$ systems are not. In particular, the $\mathrm{O}(2N)$ integrable systems provide new perturbations of the sigma model type. We identify the corresponding one-loop metric and $B-$field and show that they solve the generalized Ricci flow equation.</description>

      <title>Off-shell form factor: factorization is violated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Sudakov form factor on the Coulomb branch of N=4 sYM, which endows only external states with masses, and implies that the former is off-shell in the traditional sense. Our consideration is performed at three-loop order in the near mass-shell limit. We use a combination of tools to perform required calculations centered around the Method of Regions as the main go-to formalism for the asymptotic expansion of emerging parametric Feynman integrals. Explicit separation of quantum loops in terms of hard, collinear, and ultrasoft modes allows us to explore the factorization properties of this infrared-sensitive quantity. While the hard region is cleanly separated from the rest, the ultrasoft-collinear modes remain intertwined. We exhibit effects of factorization violation explicitly in the momentum space making use of the infrared power counting.</description>

      <title>Comment on "On the bound states of the Schwarzschild black hole" by S. H. V\"olkel: A Reassessment of the Bound-State Analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This comment critically examines the recent proposal by S.~H.~V\"olkel [Phys. Rev. Lett., arXiv:2505.17186], which asserts that the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum of Schwarzschild black holes can be reconstructed from bound states of an inverted Regge--Wheeler potential. We demonstrate that this claim rests on a mathematically invalid spectral mapping and a misapplication of boundary conditions that define QNMs. Through a detailed figure-by-figure analysis, we expose deep inconsistencies in the numerical results and their physical interpretations. The inversion method, inspired by Mashhoon, is shown to fail in capturing the non-Hermitian, complex nature of black hole resonances. We contrast this with the rigorously established asymptotic structure of QNMs derived by Hod and others, concluding that the bound-state framework offers no reliable insight into black hole spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Fractional Quantum Hall Anyons via the Algebraic Topology of Exotic Flux Quanta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall systems (FQH), due to their experimentally observed anyonic topological order, are a main contender for future hardware-implementation of error-protected quantum registers ("topological qbits") subject to error-protected quantum operations ("topological quantum gates"), both plausibly necessary for future quantum computing at useful scale, but both remaining insufficiently understood.
  Here we present a novel non-Lagrangian effective description of FQH anyons, based on previously elusive proper global quantization of effective topological flux in extraordinary non-abelian cohomology theories. This directly translates the system's quantum-observables, -states, -symmetries, and -measurement channels into purely algebro-topological analysis of local systems of Hilbert spaces over the quantized flux moduli spaces.
  Under the hypothesis -- for which we provide a fair bit of evidence -- that the appropriate effective flux quantization of FQH systems is in 2-Cohomotopy theory (a cousin of Hypothesis H in high-energy physics), the results here are rigorously derived and as such might usefully inform laboratory searches for novel anyonic phenomena in FQH systems and hence for topological quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Moduli of stable supermaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the notion of stable supermap from SUSY curves to a fixed target superscheme, and prove that when the target is (super)projective, stable supermaps are parameterized by an algebraic superstack with superschematic and separated diagonal. We characterize the bosonic reduction of this moduli superstack and see that it has a surjective morphism onto the moduli stack of stable maps from spin curves to the bosonic reduction of the target, whose fibers are linear schemes; for this reason, the moduli superstack of stable supermaps is not proper unless such linear schemes reduce to a point. Using Manin-Penkov-Voronov's super Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem we also make a formal computation of the virtual dimension of the moduli superstack, which agrees with the characterization of the bosonic reduction just mentioned and with the dimension formula for the case of bosonic target existing in the literature.</description>

      <title>Ito calculus meets the Hubble tension: Effects of small-scale electron density fluctuations on the CMB anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel formalism to include the effect of electron density fluctuations at ultra small scales (well below the sound horizon at last scattering) on the observed anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We treat the electron field as an independent stochastic variable and obtain the required ensemble-averaged photon Boltzmann equations using Ito calculus. Beyond changes to the average recombination history (which can be incorporated in the standard approach) our work identifies two new effects caused by the clumpiness of the medium. The first is a correction to the Thomson visibility function caused by correlations of the electron fluctuations along the line of sight, leading to an additional broadening of the visibility towards higher redshifts which causes extra damping and smearing of the CMB anisotropies. The second effect is a reduction of the effective scattering rate in the (pre-)recombination era that affects the photon transfer functions in a non-trivial manner. These new effects are subdominant in LCDM but can be significant in cosmologies with an early onset of structure formation (e.g., due to generation of enhanced small-scale power) as suggested by a number of indicators (e.g., the abundance of high redshift galaxies observed by JWST). We discuss the relevance of these new effects to the Hubble tension, finding that corrections which cannot be captured by simple modifications to the average recombination history arise. This highlights how important an understanding of the recombination process is in cosmological inference, and that a coordinated simulation and analysis campaign is required as part of the search for the origin of the various tensions in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases from Subsystem SymTFT of 2-Foliated Exotic Tensor Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), or topological holography, posits a correspondence between symmetries in a $d$-dimensional theory and topological order in a $(d+1)$-dimensional theory. In this work, we extend this framework to subsystem symmetries and develop subsystem SymTFT as a systematic tool to characterize and classify subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases. For $(2+1)$D gapped phases, we introduce a 2-foliated $(3+1)$D exotic tensor gauge theory (which is equivalent to 2-foliated $(3+1)$D BF theory via exotic duality) as the subsystem SymTFT and systematically analyze its topological boundary conditions and linearly rigid subsystem symmetries. Taking subsystem symmetry groups $G = \mathbb{Z}_N$ and $G=\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_M$ as examples, we demonstrate how to recover the classification scheme $\mathcal{C}[G] = H^{2}(G^{\times 2}, U(1)) / \left( H^2(G, U(1)) \right)^3$, which was previously derived by examining topological invariant under linear subsystem-symmetric local unitary transformations in the lattice Hamiltonian formalism. To illustrate the correspondence between field-theoretic and lattice descriptions, we further analyze $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_M$ cluster state models as concrete examples.</description>

      <title>Ageing correlators from local scale-invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For ageing systems with dynamical exponent $\mathpzc{z}=2$ and with the dominant noise coming from the thermal bath, the form of the two-time autocorrelator as well as the time-space form of the single-time correlator are derived from Schr\"odinger-invariance, generalised to non-equilibrium ageing. These findings reproduce the exact results in the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model at $T=0$ and the critical spherical model in $d&gt;2$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Probing nuclear structure in relativistic p-O and O-O collisions at the LHC through the measurement of anisotropic flow coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RHIC and LHC plan to inject $^{16}\rm O$ nuclei with a focus to investigate collectivity and the origin of quark-gluon plasma signatures in small collision systems. $^{16}\rm O$ nuclei is known to possess clusters of $\alpha$-particles ($^{4}\rm He$) inside the nucleus. In this paper, we study the anisotropic flow coefficients such as elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$), which are sensitive to the nuclear geometry of colliding nuclei, for p-O and O-O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=9.61$ TeV and 7 TeV respectively. The study is performed employing a hybrid model encompassing IPGlasma + MUSIC + iSS + UrQMD. The results of the clustered nuclear geometry are compared with those of the Woods-Saxon nuclear profile. Both initial and final state anisotropies are explored. This study is thus one of its first kind, where the study of anisotropic flow coefficients for p-O and O-O collisions is presented using a hybrid hydrodynamics model. We find a small effect of $\alpha$-clustering in p-O, while a significant one for O-O collisions. It is also observed that the magnitude of the effect correlates with the size of the $^{4}$He.</description>

      <title>Model-independent cosmological inference after the DESI DR2 data with improved inverse distance ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from the DESI survey have suggested hints of dynamical dark energy, challenging the standard $\Lambda $CDM model. In this work, we adopt an improved inverse distance ladder approach based on the latest cosmological data to provide a model-independent perspective, employing a global parametrization based on cosmic age (PAge). Our analysis incorporates DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmic chronometer (CC) data, and type Ia supernovae (SNe) observations from either the DESY5 or PantheonPlus datasets. For the DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets, we obtain $H_0 = 67.91 \pm 2.33~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$. This value is consistent with the Planck 2018 result, while shows $2.0 \sigma$ tension with the SH0ES measurement. Furthermore, by mapping specific cosmological models into PAge approximation parameter space $(p_{\mathrm{age}}, \eta)$, our model-independent analysis reveals a notable deviation from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model, as indicated by the DESY5 and DESI DR2 datasets. Finally, DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets provide nearly decisive evidence favoring the PAge model over the standard $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into the expansion history to better understand the deviations from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamics of Dirac fields under the influence of external electromagnetic fields is studied. For perturbations which act only for finite time, the influence of the perturbation can be described by an automorphism which can be unitarily implemented in the GNS representations of KMS states, a result long known for the Fock representation. For time-independent perturbations, however, the time evolution cannot be implemented in typical cases, so the standard methods of quantum statistical mechanics do not apply. Instead we show that a smooth switching on of the external potential allows a comparison of the free and the perturbed time evolution, and approach to equilibrium, a possible existence of non-equilibrium stationary states (NESS) and Araki's relative entropy can be investigated.</description>

      <title>Renormalizing the Quark-Meson-Diquark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the two-flavor Quark-Meson-Diquark (QMD) model by comparing a renormalization approach with a renormalization-group (RG) consistent mean-field formulation based on the functional renormalization group (FRG). The renormalized QMD allows analytical investigations of key quantities such as the zero-temperature diquark gap and the critical temperature for color superconductivity, ultimately reproducing the exact BCS relation in the high-density limit. We carry out the same analysis for different schemes of RG-consistent QMD models. We show that the RG-consistent approach yields a phase diagram and thermodynamic properties qualitatively similar to those of the renormalization model, provided both are embedded within a unified scheme that ensures consistent vacuum properties. In particular, both treatments recover the expected high-density features characterized by the BCS relation and the Stefan-Boltzmann limit. Our results highlight the relevance of renormalization and RG-consistent methods for accurately capturing the thermodynamics of QMD and related effective models with diquark degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate an approach to quantum gravity, called the ring paradigm. Gravity is mediated superluminally, and the graviton is described as a phonon on the grid of matter in the Universe. This theory has very interesting applications to cosmology and would ultimately solve the old problem of the cosmological constant. It further gives new impulses to the scalar field theories because the gravitational ring decays to some phantom field. As is obvious, we radically break the Lorentz invariance, which means that some generalization of the Haag-Lopuszanski-Sohnius theorem in quantum field theory is possible.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on small-scale primordial non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast to the large-scale primordial power spectrum $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$, which are strictly constrained, the small-scale $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ remain less restricted. Considering local-type primordial non-Gaussianity, we study the PBH and SIGW caused by large-amplitude small-scale primordial power spectrum. By analyzing current observational data from PTA, CMB, BAO, and abundance of PBH, and combining them with the SNR analysis of LISA, we rigorously constrain the parameter space of $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$. Furthermore, we examine the effects of different shapes of the primordial power spectrum on these constraints and comprehensively calculate the Bayes factors for various models. Our results indicate that SIGW generated by a monochromatic primordial power spectrum are more likely to dominate current PTA observations, with the corresponding constraint on the primordial non-Gaussian parameter being $-10.0&lt;f_{\mathrm{NL}}&lt;1.2$.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigated the off-shell expansion relation of the Yang-Mills scalar theory. We explicitly showed that the single-trace Berends-Giele currents in the Yang-Mills scalar theory can be decomposed into a term expressed by a linear combination of bi-adjoint scalar Berends-Giele currents and one that vanishes under the on-shell limit. We proved that the bi-adjoint scalar currents, as well as the corresponding coefficients, can be characterized by a graphic approach that was originally studied in Einstein-Yang-Mills expansion. Furthermore, we generalized the decomposition to the multi-trace case through unifying relations and established the connection both in single-trace and multi-trace graphic descriptions. Finally, we established the relations between the Yang-Mills currents and the single-trace Yang-Mills scalar currents choosing special reference orders of the Yang-Mills graphs.</description>

      <title>Holographic complexity and residual entropy of a rotating BTZ black hole within Horndeski gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the holographic complexity and residual entropy of a rotating BTZ black hole within the framework of Horndeski gravity. The investigation is motivated by the need to understand the emission of information from black holes, as encoded by quantum complexity, which persists even at zero temperature. Traditionally, black holes are considered to cease emitting information upon reaching zero temperature, yet our findings suggest a minimum level of information or minimal entropy. This challenges the classical notion of black hole death. Recent studies in the context of Horndeski gravity and the AdS/BCFT correspondence have identified a non-zero minimal entropy at zero temperature. Our work shows that complexity and entropy provide crucial insights into the information emission from black holes, extending beyond their classical death. These findings significantly affect our understanding of black hole thermodynamics and quantum information theory.</description>

First, we modify the auxiliary field method by Erbin and Firat [#Erbin2023] to non-BPZ even sliver frame stubs. We then also show that the construction is consistent at the full quantum level without any additional assumptions. Finally, we apply the method explicitly to the tachyon vacuum and the simplest identity-like solution.</description>

Abstract: We consider Witten's open string field theory in the presence of a non-trivial boundary of spacetime. For the kinetic term, we derive a Gibbons-Hawking-type contribution that has to be added to the action to guarantee a well-defined variational principle. The derivation is done first in a heuristic way and then confirmed by a path integral based approach using the CFT operator formalism. In the last section we discuss the boundary contributions coming from the cubic vertex, although it is problematic to apply consistent boundary conditions on the string field due to the non-locality of the vertex.</description>

      <title>Crossed products and quantum reference frames: on the observer-dependence of gravitational entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A significant step towards a rigorous understanding of perturbative gravitational entropy was recently achieved by a series of works showing that a proper accounting of gauge invariance and observer degrees of freedom converts the Type III algebra of QFT observables in a gravitational subregion to a Type II crossed product, whose entropy reduces to the generalized entropy formula in a semiclassical limit. The observers thus used are also known as quantum reference frames (QRFs); as noted in our companion work [arXiv:2405.00114], using different QRFs result in different algebras, and hence different entropies -- so gravitational entropy is observer-dependent. Here, we provide an in-depth analysis of this phenomenon, with full derivations of many new results. Using the perspective-neutral QRF formalism, we extend previous constructions to allow for arbitrarily many observers, each carrying a clock with possibly degenerate energy spectra. We consider a semiclassical regime characterized by clocks whose energy fluctuations dominate over the fluctuations of the energy of the QFT. Unlike previous works, we allow the clocks and fields to be arbitrarily entangled. At leading order the von Neumann entropy still reduces to the generalized entropy, but linear corrections are typically non-vanishing and quantify the degree of entanglement between the clocks and fields. We also describe an `antisemiclassical' regime as the opposite of the semiclassical one, with suppressed fluctuations of the clock energy; in this regime, we show how the clock may simply be `partially traced' out when evaluating the entropy. Four explicit examples of observer-dependent entropy are then given, involving a gravitational interferometer, degenerate clock superselection, a semiclassical approximation applying to some clocks but not others, and differences between monotonic and periodic clocks.</description>

      <title>The exact Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the scale-factor minisuperspace model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the classical minisuperspace model describing a closed, homogeneous and isotropic Universe, with a positive cosmological constant. Upon canonical quantization, the infinite number of possible operator orderings in the quantum Hamiltonian leads to distinct Wheeler-DeWitt equations for the wavefunction $\psi$ of the Universe. Similarly, ambiguity arises in the path-integral formulation of $\psi$, due to the infinite choices of path-integral measures for the single degree of freedom of the model. For each choice of path-integral measure, we determine the correct operator ordering of the quantum Hamiltonian and derive the exact form of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, including all corrections in $\hbar$. Additionally, we impose Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian to deduce the Hilbert-space measure $\mu$, which appears in the definition of the Hermitian inner product. Remarkably, all quantum predictions can be expressed through the combination $\Psi=\sqrt{\mu}\, \psi$, which satisfies a universal Wheeler-DeWitt equation, independent of the initial path-integral prescription. This result demonstrates that all seemingly distinct quantum theories arising from different quantization schemes of the same classical model are fundamentally equivalent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10691v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically develop a holographic entanglement thread picture that characterizes the entanglement structure of holographic duality. Behind this construction lies a simple philosophy: holographic quantum entanglement can be visualized by thread-like objects. Inspired by tensor network models and the earlier concept of bit threads, we propose rules governing the trajectories of entanglement threads in the holographic bulk. These rules not only carry meaningful interpretations at the level of quantum information theory but also determine that the entanglement threads travel along geodesics in the holographic bulk. This makes kinematic space a tailor-made language for describing holographic entanglement thread configurations. We hope that the holographic entanglement thread method can provide necessary constraints or useful guidance for constructing genuine holographic tensor networks beyond toy models.</description>

      <title>The holographic space-time model of inflation and its predictions for the CMB primordial spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1998 Carlip and Solodukhin independently conjectured the equality between fluctuations in the modular Hamiltonian of black holes and its expectation value. Banks and Zurek's 2021 work generalized this observation to any causal diamonds. We use this observation to calculate the precise normalization of primordial scalar and tensor power spectra in the Holographic Space-time (HST) model of inflation. In previous work Banks and Fischler outlined the general calculation of inflationary power spectra in this model, which we review here. Its conceptual basis is radically different from field theoretic inflation and it has no Transplanckian problems, but its predictions for power spectra will be shown to fit extant data equally well, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio agrees with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{I}$-extremization with baryonic charges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an entropy function for AdS$_4$ BPS black holes in M-theory with general magnetic charges, resolving in particular a long-standing puzzle about baryonic charges. The entropy function is constructed from a gravitational block defined solely in terms of topological data of the internal manifold. We show that the entropy of twisted black holes can always be reformulated as an $\mathcal{I}$-extremization problem -- even in cases where existing large-$N$ field theory computations fail to provide an answer. Furthermore, we correctly reproduce the entropy for a class of known black holes with purely baryonic magnetic charges. Our results offer both a conjecture for the general gravitational block for AdS$_4$ black holes in M-theory and a prediction for the large-$N$ limit of several partition functions whose saddle points have yet to be found.</description>

      <title>Twists of trigonometric sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-twisted trigonometric sigma models, a new class of integrable deformations of the principal chiral model. Starting from 4d Chern-Simons theory on a cylinder, the models are constructed by introducing a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ branch cut running along the non-compact direction. As we pass through the branch cut we apply a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ automorphism to the algebra-valued and group-valued fields of the theory. Two instances of models in this class have appeared in the literature and we explain how these fit into our general construction. We generalise both to the case of $\mathbb{Z}_N$-twistings, and for each we construct two further deformations, leading to four doubly-deformed models.
  Mapping the cylinder to a sphere, a novel feature of the construction is that the branch points are at the simple poles corresponding to the ends of the cylinder. As a result, the untwisted and twisted models have the same number of degrees of freedom. While twisting does not always lead to inequivalent models, we show that if we use the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ outer automorphism of $\mathfrak{g}^{\mathbb{C}} = \mathfrak{sl}(n;\mathbb{C})$ to twist, then the untwisted and twisted models have different symmetries, hence the latter are new integrable sigma models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the holographic renormalization of scalar-torsion gravity in a four-dimensional bulk spacetime with non-minimal derivative coupling. The asymptotic behavior of the static equations leads to an anti-de Sitter geometry for negative cosmological constants, allowing for a holographic interpretation via the AdS/CFT correspondence. The existence of unique solutions throughout the bulk is addressed. We study the effect of the non-minimal coupling parameter on the conformal dimension and the expectation value of the dual scalar operator, showing that the effective bulk mass can be tuned through the non-minimal coupling. Our results provide a formalism for finding non-tachyonic bulk scalar fields which vanish at the boundary.</description>

      <title>Impact of strong magnetic field, baryon chemical potential, and medium anisotropy on polarization and spin alignment of hadrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent observation of global spin polarization of $\Lambda$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$) hyperons and the spin alignment of $\phi$ and $K^{*0}$ vector mesons create remarkable interest in investigating the particle polarization in the relativistic fluid produced in heavy-ion collisions at GeV/TeV energies. Among other sources of spin polarization phenomena, the Debye mass of a medium plays a crucial role in particle polarization. Any modification brought to the effective mass due to the temperature, strong magnetic field ($eB$), baryonic chemical potential ($\mu_{B}$), medium anisotropy ($\xi$), and vorticity, etc., certainly affects the particle spin polarization. In this work, we explore the global hyperon spin polarization and the spin alignment of vector mesons corresponding to the strong magnetic field, baryonic chemical potential, and medium anisotropy. We find that the degree of spin polarization is flavor-dependent for hyperons. Meanwhile, vector meson spin alignment depends on the hadronization mechanisms of initially polarized quarks and anti-quarks. Medium anisotropy significantly changes the degree of spin polarization compared to the magnetic field and baryon chemical potential.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the classical Goddard-Kent-Olive coset construction. We find the formulas for the highest weight vectors in coset decomposition and calculate their norms. We also derive formulas for matrix elements of natural vertex operators between these vectors. This leads to relations on conformal blocks. Due to the AGT correspondence, these relations are equivalent to blowup relations on Nekrasov partition functions with the presence of the surface defect. These relations can be used to prove Kyiv formulas for the Painlev\'e tau-functions (following Nekrasov's method).</description>

      <title>Exploring Faraday rotation signatures and population bounds for primordial magnetic black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes bearing magnetic charges may bypass the constraints imposed by Hawking radiation, thereby enabling reasonable present-day populations, even for masses below $10^{15}\, \mathrm{g} $--a range previously considered improbable. They could, therefore, conceivably contribute to a component of dark matter. We investigate novel Faraday rotation signatures exhibited by primordial magnetic black holes while also establishing new Parker-type bounds on their populations. For the latter, we bound the dark matter fraction from intergalactic magnetic fields in cosmic voids $\left(f_{\text{ DM}} \lesssim 10^{-8}\right)$ and cosmic web filaments $\left(f_{\text{ DM}} \lesssim 10^{-4}\right)$, notably eclipsing previous bounds. Exploring Faraday rotation effects, we discern a pronounced rotation of the polarization angle and the rotation measure values for extremal primordial magnetic black holes with masses $M^{\text{ex.}}_{\text{ BH}} \gtrsim 10^{-6}~ \text{M}_\odot$. This makes them potentially detectable in current observations. A comparative investigation finds that the effects are notably greater than for a neutron star, like a Magnetar, with a similar magnetic field at the surface. Moreover, the polarization angle maps for primordial magnetic black holes exhibit unique features, notably absent in other astrophysical magnetic configurations. In this context, we also introduce a simple integral measure, offering a quantitative measure for their discrimination in many scenarios. These traits potentially suggest a robust avenue for their observational detection and differentiation.</description>

      <title>Geometric expansion of fluctuations and average shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations of observables provide unique insights into the nature of physical systems, and their study stands as a cornerstone of both theoretical and experimental science. Generalized fluctuations, or cumulants, provide information beyond the mean and variance of an observable. In this letter, we develop a systematic method to determine the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of local observables as the region becomes large. Our analysis reveals that the expansion is closely tied to the geometric characteristics of the region and its boundary, with coefficients given by convex moments of the connected correlation function: the latter is integrated against intrinsic volumes of convex polytopes built from the coordinates, which can be interpreted as average shadows. A particular application of our method shows that, in two dimensions, the leading behavior of odd cumulants of conserved quantities is topological, specifically depending on the Euler characteristic of the region. We illustrate these results with the paradigmatic strongly-interacting system of two-dimensional quantum Hall state at filling fraction $1/2$, by performing Monte-Carlo calculations of the skewness (third cumulant) of particle number in the Laughlin state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for embedding a causal set into Minkowski spacetime. The method is similar to a previously presented method, but is simpler and provides better embedding results. The method uses spacetime volumes to define causal set analogs of time coordinates for all elements, and spatial distances for pairs of causally related elements. The spatial distances for causally related pairs are then used to derive spatial distances for spacelike separated pairs by applying the triangle inequality. The result is a matrix of spatial distances for all pairs of elements in the causal set. This distance matrix can be decomposed to give coordinates in Minkowski spacetime. Results are presented showing good quality embeddings into Minkowski spacetime for dimensions d=2,3,4.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20874v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate an investigation into features of vacuum entanglement as probed by accelerated quantum probes in curved spacetime. Focussing specifically on de Sitter (dS) spacetime with curvature $\Lambda$, we obtain several exact results corresponding to different kinematical set-up of the probes. The interaction with the quantum field creates a non-local correlation between initially uncorrelated probes accelerating in different directions. It is well known that a single quantum probe in dS spacetime with uniform acceleration $a$ responds exactly as a quantum probe in Minkowski spacetime with "effective" acceleration $q \equiv\sqrt{a^2+\Lambda}$. However, no such mapping generically exists for the entanglement between probes. Our results suggest that entanglement exhibits independent variations with changes in acceleration and curvature depending on different configurations of detector motion.</description>

      <title>Spherical black hole perturbations in EFT of scalar-tensor gravity with timelike scalar profile</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study linear even-parity perturbations of static and spherically symmetric black holes with a timelike scalar profile by use of the effective field theory (EFT) approach. For illustrative purposes, we consider a simple subclass of the EFT that accommodates ghost condensate, namely the k-essence model along with the so-called scordatura term, and focus on the spherical (monopole) perturbations about an approximately stealth Schwarzschild solution. The scordatura effect is introduced to avoid the strong coupling problem that typically happens in the scalar sector around stealth solutions with a timelike scalar profile. We argue that the scalar perturbation is decoupled from the metric perturbations at the leading order in the scordatura effect under a particular gauge choice. We stress that this is an important step in understanding the dynamics of even-parity perturbations, paving the way towards deriving a set of master equations -- the generalized Zerilli and the scalar-field equations -- for generic multipoles.</description>

      <title>Tidal response of regular black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the tidal deformability of regular black holes (RBHs). Employing different phenomenological models, we analyze their response to both test fields and gravitational perturbations, interpreting the latter within the framework of Einstein's field equations in the presence of an appropriate exotic matter distribution. Numerical and analytical methods reveal that RBHs exhibit non-trivial tidal responses, influenced by their regularization parameters and exotic matter distributions. The results obtained for test fields and gravitational perturbations are in qualitative agreement. This hints at the possibility that similar conclusions could hold if these spacetimes were interpreted as solutions of a modified gravitational action. Our findings suggest that RBHs possess distinct, though subtle, tidal signatures, which may serve as observational probes of their internal structure in gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00536v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard paradigm of cosmology assumes two distinct dark components, namely the dark energy driving the late-universe acceleration and the dark matter that is responsible for the structure formation. However, the necessity of splitting the dark-side world into two sectors has not been experimentally or theoretically proven. It is shown in Wang et al. 2024 that cosmology with one unified dark fluid can also explain the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and late-universe data, with the fitting quality not much worse than the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. The present work aims to provide a clearer physical interpretation of the Wang et al. 2024 results. We show that the unified dark fluid model can produce primary CMB temperature and polarization power spectra that are very close to the $\Lambda$CDM prediction (relative difference $\lesssim 10^{-4}$). The model can also mimic the $\Lambda$CDM background expansion history and linear growth factor on sub-horizon scales with percent-level accuracy. With better physical understanding of the model, we make precision tests and find a minor error in the Boltzmann code used in Wang et al. 2024. We correct the error and update the model comparison between $\Lambda$CDM and the unified dark fluid model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isospin asymmetric nuclear matter is introduced to V-QCD, a bottom-up holographic Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) model. Using a small isospin chemical potential we extract the symmetry energy in the model, finding excellent agreement with experimental results for some of the potentials. Extending the calculation for finite and arbitrary sized isospin chemical potentials, we construct beta-equilibrated neutron stars via the usual Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equations. We find, pleasingly, that the neutron stars passing the mass/radius and tidal deformability constraints are those with the potentials that also lead to excellent symmetry energies.</description>

      <title>The Sky as a Killing Horizon</title>

Abstract: Symmetries are ubiquitous in modern physics. They not only allow for a more simplified description of physical systems but also, from a more fundamental perspective, can be seen as determining a theory itself. In the present paper, we propose a new definition of asymptotic symmetries that unifies and generalizes the usual notions of symmetry considered in asymptotically flat spacetimes and expanding universes with cosmological horizons. This is done by considering BMS-like symmetries for "asymptotic (conformal) Killing horizons", or A(C)KHs, here defined as null hypersurfaces that are tangent to a vector field satisfying the (conformal) Killing equation in a limiting sense. The construction is theory-agnostic and extremely general, for it makes no use of the Einstein equations and can be applied to a wide range of scenarios with different dimensions or hypersurface cross sections. While we reproduce the results by Dappiaggi, Moretti, and Pinamonti in the case of asymptotic Killing horizons, the conformal generalization does not yield only the BMS group, but a larger group. The enlargement is due to the presence of "superdilations". We speculate on many implications and possible continuations of this work, including the exploration of gravitational memory effects beyond general relativity, understanding antipodal matching conditions at spatial infinity in terms of bifurcate horizons, and the absence of superrotations in de Sitter spacetime and Killing horizons.</description>

      <title>Physical ageing from generalised time-translation-invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16857</link>

Abstract: A generalised form of time-translation-invariance permits to re-derive the known generic phenomenology of ageing, which arises in classical many-body systems after a quench from an initially disordered system to a temperature $T\leq T_c$, at or below the critical temperature $T_c$. Generalised time-translation-invariance is obtained, out of equilibrium, from a change of representation of the Lie algebra generators of the dynamical symmetries of scale-invariance and time-translation-invariance. Observable consequences include the algebraic form of the scaling functions for large arguments of the two-time auto-correlators and auto-responses, the equality of the auto-correlation and the auto-response exponents $\lambda_C=\lambda_R$, the cross-over scaling form for an initially magnetised critical system and the explanation of a novel finite-size scaling if the auto-correlator or auto-response converge for large arguments $y=t/s\gg 1$ to a plateau. For global two-time correlators, the time-dependence involving the initial critical slip exponent $\Theta$ is confirmed and is generalised to all temperatures below criticality and to the global two-time response function, and their finite-size scaling is derived as well. This also includes the time-dependence of the squared global order-parameter. The celebrate Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation with the auto-correlation exponent is thereby extended to all temperatures below the critical temperature. A simple criterion on the relevance of non-linear terms in the stochastic equation of motion is derived, taking the dimensionality of couplings into account. Its applicability in a wide class of models is confirmed, for temperatures $T\leq T_c$. Relevance to experiments is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Nonequilibrium Stochastic Processes</title>

Abstract: We show that bootstrap methods based on the positivity of probability measures provide a systematic framework for studying both synchronous and asynchronous nonequilibrium stochastic processes on infinite lattices. First, we formulate linear programming problems that use positivity and invariance property of invariant measures to derive rigorous bounds on their expectation values. Second, for time evolution in asynchronous processes, we exploit the master equation along with positivity and initial conditions to construct linear and semidefinite programming problems that yield bounds on expectation values at both short and late times. We illustrate both approaches using two canonical examples: the contact process in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions, and the Domany-Kinzel model in both synchronous and asynchronous forms in 1+1 dimensions. Our bounds on invariant measures yield rigorous lower bounds on critical rates, while those on time evolutions provide two-sided bounds on the half-life of the infection density and the temporal correlation length in the subcritical phase.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy at Late Time $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical properties of dark energy through a detailed analysis of its equation of state parameter $w(z)$ as a function of redshift. We derive a general expression for $w(z)$ from the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) equations, establishing a direct relationship between the dark energy equation of state and the observable Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and its derivative. Using the relation $w(z) = -1 + \frac{2(1+z)}{3H(z)} \frac{dH}{dz}$, we develop an approximation method valid for $z \lesssim 1$ that accounts for the changing balance between matter and dark energy contributions to cosmic expansion. We compare our theoretical framework with recent observational data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2, analysing how well the commonly used Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization $w(z) = -1 + w_a \frac{z}{1+z}$ captures the evolution of dark energy. Our results indicate that the dark energy equation of state exhibits a monotonic evolution with redshift, transitioning from deceleration to acceleration around $z \approx 0.7$. Notably, our predicted $w_{\mathrm{DE}}$ remains greater than $-1$ across all redshifts, avoiding phantom energy scenarios that would violate the null energy condition. This work demonstrates how precise measurements of the cosmic expansion history can constrain the nature of dark energy and provides a framework for testing dynamical dark energy models against current and future cosmological observations.</description>
