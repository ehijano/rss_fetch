      <title>Trigonometric Moments of a Generalized von Mises Distribution in 2-D Range-Only Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 2D range-only tracking scenario is non-trivial due to two main reasons. First, when the states to be estimated are in Cartesian coordinates, the uncertainty region is multi-modal. The second reason is that the probability density function of azimuth conditioned on range takes the form of a generalized von Mises distribution, which is hard to tackle. Even in the case of implementing a uni-modal Kalman filter, one needs expectations of trigonometric functions of conditional bearing density, which are not available in the current literature. We prove that the trigonometric moments (circular moments) of the azimuth density conditioned on range can be computed as an infinite series, which can be sufficiently approximated by relatively few terms in summation. The solution can also be generalized to any order of the moments.
  This important result can provide an accurate depiction of the conditional azimuth density in 2D range-only tracking geometries. We also present a simple optimization problem that results in deterministic samples of conditional azimuth density from the knowledge of its circular moments leading to an accurate filtering solution. The results are shown in a two-dimensional simulation, where the range-only sensor platform maneuvers to make the system observable. The results prove that the method is feasible in such applications.</description>

      <title>Adapting to Reality: Over-the-Air Validation of AI-Based Receivers Trained with Simulated Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has shown that integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into wireless communication systems can significantly improve spectral efficiency. However, the prevalent use of simulated radio channel data for training and validating neural network-based radios raises concerns about their generalization capability to diverse real-world environments. To address this, we conducted empirical over-the-air (OTA) experiments using software-defined radio (SDR) technology to test the performance of an NN-based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receiver in a real-world small cell scenario. Our assessment reveals that the performance of receivers trained on diverse 3GPP TS38.901 channel models and broad parameter ranges significantly surpasses conventional receivers in our testing environment, demonstrating strong generalization to a new environment. Conversely, setting simulation parameters to narrowly reflect the actual measurement environment led to suboptimal OTA performance, highlighting the crucial role of rich and randomized training data in improving the NN-based receiver's performance. While our empirical test results are promising, they also suggest that developing new channel models tailored for training these learned receivers would enhance their generalization capability and reduce training time. Our testing was limited to a relatively narrow environment, and we encourage further testing in more complex environments.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Semantic-Enabled 6G Communication: A Task-oriented and Privacy-preserving Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trustworthy task-oriented semantic communication (ToSC) emerges as an innovative approach in the 6G landscape, characterized by the transmission of only vital information that is directly pertinent to a specific task. While ToSC offers an efficient mode of communication, it concurrently raises concerns regarding privacy, as sophisticated adversaries might possess the capability to reconstruct the original data from the transmitted features. This article provides an in-depth analysis of privacy-preserving strategies specifically designed for ToSC relying on deep neural network-based joint source and channel coding (DeepJSCC). The study encompasses a detailed comparative assessment of trustworthy feature perturbation methods such as differential privacy and encryption, alongside intrinsic security incorporation approaches like adversarial learning to train the JSCC and learning-based vector quantization (LBVQ). This comparative analysis underscores the integration of advanced explainable learning algorithms into communication systems, positing a new benchmark for privacy standards in the forthcoming 6G era.</description>

      <title>Resonant Beam Enabled DoA Estimation in Passive Positioning System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of the next generation of communications and internet of things (IoT) technologies has made the provision of location-based services for diverse devices an increasingly pressing necessity. Localizing devices with/without intelligent computing abilities, including both active and passive devices is essential, especially in indoor scenarios. For traditional RF positioning systems, aligning transmission signals and dealing with signal interference in complex environments are inevitable challenges. Therefore, this paper proposed a new passive positioning system, the RF-band resonant beam positioning system (RF-RBPS), which achieves energy concentration and beam alignment by amplifying echoes between the base station (BS) and the passive target (PT), without the need for complex channel estimation and time-consuming beamforming and provides high-precision direction of arrival (DoA) estimation for battery-free targets using the resonant mechanism. The direction information of the PT is estimated using the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm at the end of BS. The feasibility of the proposed system is validated through theoretical analysis and simulations. Results indicate that the proposed RF-RBPS surpasses RF-band active positioning system (RF-APS) in precision, achieving millimeter-level precision at 2m within an elevation angle of 35$^\circ$, and an error of less than 3cm at 2.5m within an elevation angle of 35$^\circ$.</description>

      <title>Pilot-Aided Joint Time Synchronization and Channel Estimation for OTFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a joint time synchronization and channel estimation (JTSCE) algorithm with embedded pilot for orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) systems. It completes both synchronization and channel estimation using the same pilot signal. Unlike existing synchronization and channel estimation algorithms based on embedded pilots, JTSCE employs a maximum length sequence (MLS) rather than an isolated signal as the pilot. Specifically, JTSCE first explores the autocorrelation properties of MLS to estimate timing offset (TO) and channel delay taps. After obtaining these types of delay taps, the closed-form estimation expressions of the Doppler and channel gain of each propagation path are derived. Extensive simulation results indicate that compared to its counterparts, JTSCE achieves better bit error rate (BER) performance, close to that with perfect time synchronization and channel state information.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Cohen's Class Time-Frequency Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fixed kernel function-based Cohen's class time-frequency distributions (CCTFDs) allow flexibility in denoising for some specific polluted signals. Due to the limitation of fixed kernel functions, however, from the view point of filtering they fail to automatically adjust the response according to the change of signal to adapt to different signal characteristics. In this letter, we integrate Wiener filter principle and the time-frequency filtering mechanism of CCTFD to design the least-squares adaptive filter method in the Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) domain, giving birth to the least-squares adaptive filter-based CCTFD whose kernel function can be adjusted with the input signal automatically to achieve the minimum mean-square error denoising in the WVD domain. Some examples are also carried out to demonstrate that the proposed adaptive CCTFD outperforms some state-of-the-arts in noise suppression.</description>

Abstract: The conventional Cohen's distribution can't meet the requirement of additive noises jamming signals high-performance denoising under the condition of low signal-to-noise ratio, it is necessary to integrate the metaplectic transform for non-stationary signal fractional domain time-frequency analysis. In this paper, we blend time-frequency operators and coordinate operator fractionizations to formulate the definition of the metaplectic Wigner distribution, based on which we integrate the generalized metaplectic convolution to address the unified representation issue of the convolution type of metaplectic Cohen's distribution (CMCD), whose special cases and essential properties are also derived. We blend Wiener filter principle and fractional domain filter mechanism of the metaplectic transform to design the least-squares adaptive filter method in the metaplectic Wigner distribution domain, giving birth to the least-squares adaptive filter-based CMCD whose kernel function can be adjusted with the input signal automatically to achieve the minimum mean-square error (MSE) denoising in Wigner distribution domain. We discuss the optimal symplectic matrices selection strategy of the proposed adaptive CMCD through the minimum MSE minimization modeling and solving. Some examples are also carried out to demonstrate that the proposed filtering method outperforms some state-of-the-arts including Wiener filter and fixed kernel functions-based or adaptive Cohen's distribution in noise suppression.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficiency Comparison of RIS Architectures in MISO Broadcast Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop energy-efficient schemes for multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channels (BCs), assisted by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). To this end, we consider three architectures of RIS: locally passive diagonal (LP-D), globally passive diagonal (GP-D), and globally passive beyond diagonal (GP-BD). In a globally passive RIS, the power of the output signal of the RIS is not greater than its input power, but some RIS elements can amplify the signal. In a locally passive RIS, every element cannot amplify the incident signal. We show that these RIS architectures can substantially improve energy efficiency (EE) if the static power of the RIS elements is not too high. Moreover, GP-BD RIS, which has a higher complexity and static power than LP-D RIS and GP-D RIS, provides better spectral efficiency, but its EE performance highly depends on the static power consumption and may be worse than its diagonal counterparts.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Assisted Semantic Interference Cancellation on Moderate Interference Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of conventional interference management strategies degrades when interference power is comparable to signal power. We consider a new perspective on interference management using semantic communication. Specifically, a multi-user semantic communication system is considered on moderate interference channels (ICs), for which a novel framework of deep learning-based prompt-assisted semantic interference cancellation (DeepPASIC) is proposed. Each transmitted signal is partitioned into common and private parts. The common parts of different users are transmitted simultaneously in a shared medium, resulting in superposition. The private part, on the other hand, serves as a prompt to assist in canceling the interference suffered by the common part at the semantic level. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DeepPASIC outperforms conventional interference management strategies under moderate interference conditions.</description>

      <title>Secure Transmission for Movable Antennas Empowered Cell-Free Symbiotic Radio Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel movable antenna (MA) empowered secure transmission scheme is designed for cell-free symbiotic radio (SR) systems in the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve). Specifically, multiple distributed access points (APs) equipped with MAs collaboratively transmit confidential information to the primary user (PU), in the meanwhile the backscatter device (BD) transmits its own information to the secondary user (SU) by reflecting incident signals from the APs. The MAs deployed at the APs can adjust their positions flexibly to improve channel conditions between the APs and the PU/SU/BD and suppress the eavesdropping from the Eve on confidential information at the PU. Under this setup, we maximize the secrecy rate of primary transmission through jointly optimizing the APs' transmission beamforming vectors and the positions of the MAs, while adhering to the quality of service constraints at the SU. To address the challenges caused by the non-convexity and find a near-optimal solution, an alternating optimization (AO) framework is proposed, utilizing the successive convex approximation method, the semi-definite relaxation technology and a genetic algorithm modified particle swarm optimization (GA-PSO) algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the secrecy rate enhancement provided by utilizing the MAs and show the impact of the GA-PSO algorithm for improving the solving accuracy.</description>

      <title>Statistical Framework for Clustering MU-MIMO Wireless via Second Order Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the clustering of wireless users by examining the distances between their channel covariance matrices, which reside on the Riemannian manifold of positive definite matrices. Specifically, we consider an estimator of the Log-Euclidean distance between multiple sample covariance matrices (SCMs) consistent when the number of samples and the observation size grow unbounded at the same rate. Within the context of multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) wireless communication systems, we develop a statistical framework that allows to accurate predictions of the clustering algorithm's performance under realistic conditions. Specifically, we present a central limit theorem that establishes the asymptotic Gaussianity of the consistent estimator of the log-Euclidean distance computed over two sample covariance matrices.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Equivalent of the Log-Euclidean Distance between Sample Covariance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Log-Euclidean distances are commonly used to quantify the similarity between positive definite matrices using geometric considerations. This paper analyzes the behavior of this distance when it is used to measure closeness between independent sample covariance matrices. A closed form expression is given for the deterministic equivalent of such distance, which asymptotically approximates the actual distance in the large observation regime (both sample size and observation dimension grow to infinity at the same rate). The deterministic equivalent can be used to analyze the performance of the log-Euclidean metric when compared to other commonly used metrics such as the Euclidean norm or the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler divergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimal allocation of channels and power resources plays a crucial role in ensuring minimal interference, maximal data rates, and efficient energy utilisation. As a successful approach for tackling resource management problems in wireless networks, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted a lot of attention. This article proposes a GNN-based algorithm to address the joint resource allocation problem in heterogeneous wireless networks. Concretely, we model the heterogeneous wireless network as a heterogeneous graph and then propose a graph neural network structure intending to allocate the available channels and transmit power to maximise the network throughput. Our proposed joint channel and power allocation graph neural network (JCPGNN) comprises a shared message computation layer and two task-specific layers, with a dedicated focus on channel and power allocation tasks, respectively. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves satisfactory performance but with higher computational efficiency compared to traditional optimisation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Semantic Enabled 6G LEO Satellite Communication for Earth Observation: A Resource-Constrained Network Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth observation satellites generate large amounts of real-time data for monitoring and managing time-critical events such as disaster relief missions. This presents a major challenge for satellite-to-ground communications operating under limited bandwidth capacities. This paper explores semantic communication (SC) as a potential alternative to traditional communication methods. The rationality for adopting SC is its inherent ability to reduce communication costs and make spectrum efficient for 6G non-terrestrial networks (6G-NTNs). We focus on the critical satellite imagery downlink communications latency optimization for Earth observation through SC techniques. We formulate the latency minimization problem with SC quality-of-service (SC-QoS) constraints and address this problem with a meta-heuristic discrete whale optimization algorithm (DWOA) and a one-to-one matching game. The proposed approach for captured image processing and transmission includes the integration of joint semantic and channel encoding to ensure downlink sum-rate optimization and latency minimization. Empirical results from experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework for latency optimization while preserving high-quality data transmission when compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>Field of View Expansion for Resonant Beam Information and Power Transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) leverages lightwave as the wireless transmission medium, emerging as a promising technology in the future Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. The use of retro-reflectors in constructing spatially separated laser resonators (SSLR) enables a self-aligning wireless transmission system with the self-reproducing resonant beam, i.e. resonant beam system (RBS). However, it's effective Field of View (FoV) is physically limited by the size of retroreflectors and still requires significant improvement. This restricts the transmitter from providing seamless wireless connectivity and power supply to receivers within a large dynamic movement range. In this paper, we propose an FoV-enlarged resonant beam system operating at a meter distance by incorporating a telescope. The telescope plays a crucial role in minimizing the extra loss inflicted on the gain medium, which typically arises from the deviation of the resonant beam within the cavity. Further, we construct the proposed telescope-based RBS and experimentally demonstrate that the design could expand the FoV to 28$^\circ$ over 1 m transmission distance is about triple that of the ordinary RBS design.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the mobility problem with the assistance of fluid antenna (FA) on the user equipment (UE) side. We propose a matrix pencil-based moving port (MPMP) prediction method, which may transform the time-varying channel to a static channel by timely sliding the liquid. Different from the existing channel prediction method, we design a moving port selection method, which is the first attempt to transform the channel prediction to the port prediction by exploiting the movability of FA. Theoretical analysis shows that for the line-ofsight (LoS) channel, the prediction error of our proposed MPMP method may converge to zero, as the number of BS antennas and the port density of the FA are large enough. For a multi-path channel, we also derive the upper and lower bounds of the prediction error when the number of paths is large enough. When the UEs move at a speed of 60 or 120 km/h, simulation results show that, with the assistance of FA, our proposed MPMP method performs better than the existing channel prediction method.</description>

      <title>Feedback Design with VQ-VAE for Robust Precoding in Multi-User FDD Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE)-based feedback scheme for robust precoder design in multi-user frequency division duplex (FDD) systems. We demonstrate how the VQ-VAE can be tailored to specific propagation environments, focusing on systems with low pilot overhead, which is crucial in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). Extensive simulations with real-world measurement data show that our proposed feedback scheme outperforms state-of-the-art autoencoder (AE)-based compression schemes and conventional Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook-based schemes. These improvements enable the deployment of systems with fewer feedback bits or pilots.</description>

      <title>Supplementary File: Cooperative Gradient Coding for Semi-Decentralized Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Stragglers' effects are known to degrade FL performance. In this paper, we investigate federated learning (FL) over wireless networks in the presence of communication stragglers, where the power-constrained clients collaboratively train a global model by iteratively optimizing a local objective function with their local datasets and transmitting local model updates to the central parameter server (PS) through fading channels. To tackle communication stragglers without dataset sharing or prior information about the network at PS, we propose cooperative gradient coding (CoGC) for semi-decentralized FL to enable the exact global model recovery at PS. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed approach. Namely, an outage analysis of the proposed approach is provided, followed by a convergence analysis based on the failure probability of the global model recovery at PS. Nevertheless, simulation results reveal the superiority of the proposed approach in the presence of stragglers under imbalanced data distribution.</description>

      <title>Digital Twins and Testbeds for Supporting AI Research with Autonomous Vehicle Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital twins (DTs), which are virtual environments that simulate, predict, and optimize the performance of their physical counterparts, hold great promise in revolutionizing next-generation wireless networks. While DTs have been extensively studied for wireless networks, their use in conjunction with autonomous vehicles featuring programmable mobility remains relatively under-explored. In this paper, we study DTs used as a development environment to design, deploy, and test artificial intelligence (AI) techniques that utilize real-world (RW) observations, e.g. radio key performance indicators, for vehicle trajectory and network optimization decisions in autonomous vehicle networks (AVN). We first compare and contrast the use of simulation, digital twin (software in the loop (SITL)), sandbox (hardware-in-the-loop (HITL)), and physical testbed (PT) environments for their suitability in developing and testing AI algorithms for AVNs. We then review various representative use cases of DTs for AVN scenarios. Finally, we provide an example from the NSF AERPAW platform where a DT is used to develop and test AI-aided solutions for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles for localizing a signal source based solely on link quality measurements. Our results in the physical testbed show that SITL DTs, when supplemented with data from RW measurements and simulations, can serve as an ideal environment for developing and testing innovative AI solutions for AVNs.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Based IRS Assisted NLoS DoA Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel learning-based methodology for Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation in environments featuring an Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) or Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS), particularly under challenging Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) conditions. The core innovation lies in the integration of a specialized Neural Network (NN) layer, termed the NN-based RIS layer, within a broader network architecture.
  The NN-based RIS layer is meticulously designed to autonomously learn the optimal phase shifts for the RIS, specifically tailored to enhance the accuracy of DoA estimation. In this framework, pre-processed real-valued input observations are directed into the RIS layer, which possesses a distinct and specialized structure. Unlike conventional neural network layers, the NN-based RIS layer imposes constraints on its weights, requiring them to be sinusoidal functions. The phase arguments of these sinusoidal functions serve as the tunable parameters during the training process, effectively enabling the layer to simulate the physical behavior of an RIS.
  To accommodate the unique properties of the NN-based RIS layer, the standard feed-forward and back-propagation algorithms are adapted, ensuring that the learning process aligns with the specialized requirements of the RIS-based architecture. This innovative approach allows the network to seamlessly integrate the RIS functionality into the DoA estimation process.
  Extensive numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed machine learning-based technique, demonstrating its superior performance compared to traditional non-learning-based methods across a range of RIS-assisted scenarios. The results underscore the potential of this approach to significantly enhance DoA estimation accuracy in complex wireless communication environments, paving the way for future advancements in RIS-enabled systems.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-Enhanced Wireless Communications: General Architectures and Implementation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs), traditionally explored in antenna design, have recently garnered significant attention in wireless communications due to their ability to dynamically adjust the antenna positions to changes in the propagation environment. However, previous research has primarily focused on characterizing the performance limits of various MA-assisted wireless communication systems, with less emphasis on their practical implementation. To address this gap, in this article, we propose several general MA architectures that extend existing designs by varying several key aspects to cater to different application scenarios and tradeoffs between cost and performance. Additionally, we draw from fields such as antenna design and mechanical control to provide an overview of candidate implementation methods for the proposed MA architectures, utilizing either direct mechanical or equivalent electronic control. Simulation results are finally presented to support our discussion.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Empowered Downlink NOMA Systems: Power Allocation and Antenna Position Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel communication paradigm employing movable antennas (MAs) within a multiple-input single-output (MISO) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) downlink framework, where users are equipped with MAs. Initially, leveraging the far-field response, we delineate the channel characteristics concerning both the power allocation coefficient and positions of MAs. Subsequently, we endeavor to maximize the channel capacity by jointly optimizing power allocation and antenna positions. To tackle the resultant non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) scheme underpinned by successive convex approximation (SCA) to converge towards a stationary point. Through numerical simulations, our findings substantiate the superiority of the MA-assisted NOMA system over both orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and conventional NOMA configurations in terms of average sum rate and outage probability.</description>
