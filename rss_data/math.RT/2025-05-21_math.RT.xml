      <title>Generalised Burnside and Dixon algorithms for irreducible projective representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the recently proposed character theory of projective representations of finite groups proposed, we generalise several algorithms for computing character tables and matrices of irreducible linear representations to projective representations. In particular, we present an algorithm based on that of Burnside to compute the characters of all irreducible projective representations of a finite group with a given Schur multiplier, and transpose it to exact integer arithmetic following Dixon's character table algorithm. We also describe an algorithm based on that of Dixon to split a projective representation into irreducible subspaces in floating-point arithmetic, and discuss how it can be used to compute matrices for all projective irreps with a given multiplier. Our algorithms bypass the construction of the representation group of the Schur multiplier, which makes them especially attractive for floating-point computations, where exact values of the multiplier are not necessarily available.</description>

      <title>An inequality of Harish-Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In paper I of his masterpiece Harmonic Analysis on Real Reductive Groups, Harish-Chandra included an important inequality that is useful in proving that certain key integrals depending on a parameter converge for large values of the parameter. His proof involved the Tarski-Seidenberg Theorem. The purpose of this note is an elementary proof of the inequality which is an expansion of the idea in my Real Reductive Groups I. This exposition fixes several critical misprints in the original and can be considered to be an erratum for the book.</description>

      <title>$p$-Biset Functor of Monomial Burnside Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of the monomial Burnside biset functor over a field of characteristic zero, with particular focus on its restriction kernels. For each finite \( p \)-group \( G \), we give an explicit description of the restriction kernel at \( G \), and determine the complete list of composition factors of the functor. We prove that these composition factors have minimal groups \( H \) isomorphic either to a cyclic \( p \)-group or to a direct product of such a group with a cyclic group of order \( p \). Furthermore, we identify the simple \( \mathbb{C}[\Aut(H)] \)-modules that appear as evaluations of these composition factors at their minimal groups. Explicit classifications of composition factors for biset functors are rare, and our results provide one of the few complete examples of such classifications.</description>

      <title>A Categorical Decomposition of $\mathbb C^{\times}$-fibered $p$-biset Functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize Bouc's construction of orthogonal idempotents in the double Burnside algebra to the setting of the double $\mathbb{C}^\times$-fibered Burnside algebra. This yields a structural decomposition of the evaluations of $\mathbb{C}^\times$-fibered biset functors on finite groups. We then construct a complete set of orthogonal idempotents in the category of $\mathbb{C}^\times$-fibered $p$-biset functors, leading to a categorical decomposition of this category into subcategories indexed by isomorphism classes of atoric $p$-groups. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of vertices for indecomposable functors and establish that the Ext-groups between simple functors with distinct vertices vanish. As an application, we describe a set containing composition factors of the monomial Burnside functor, thereby providing new insights into its structure. Additionally, we develop a technique for analyzing fibered biset functors via their underlying biset structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study non-weight modules over gap-$p$ Virasoro algebras, including Whittaker modules, $\mathcal{U}(\mathbb{C} L_0)$-free modules and their tensor products. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for universal Whittaker modules to be irreducible and study the structure of irreducible Whittaker modules. The $\mathcal{U}(\mathbb{C} L_0)$-free modules of rank 1 are classified and the irreducibility of such modules are determined. Moreover, the irreducibility of tensor products of $\mathcal{U}(\mathbb{C} L_0)$-free modules of rank 1 and irreducible restricted modules is also determined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we establish the convexity and monotonicity for affine standard Lyndon words in all types, generalizing the $A$-type results of arXiv:2305.16299. We also derive partial results on the structure of imaginary standard Lyndon words and present a conjecture for their general form. Additionally, we provide computer code in Appendix which, in particular, allows to efficiently compute affine standard Lyndon words in exceptional types for all orders.</description>

      <title>Special cycles in compact locally Hermitian symmetric spaces of type III associated with the Lie group $SO_0(2,m)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G = SO_0(2,m),$ the connected component of the Lie group $SO(2,m);\ K = SO(2) \times SO(m),$ a maximal compact subgroup of $G;$ and $\theta$ be the associated Cartan involution of $G.$ Let $X = G/K,\ \frak{g}_0$ be the Lie algebra of $G$ and $\frak{g} = \frak{g}_0^\mathbb{C}.$ In this article, we have considered the special cycles associated with all possible involutions of $G$ commuting with $\theta.$ We have determined the special cycles which give non-zero cohomology classes in $H^*(\Gamma \backslash X; \mathbb{C})$ for some $\theta$-stable torsion-free arithmetic uniform lattice $\Gamma$ in $G,$ by a result of Millson and Raghunathan. For each cohomologically induced representation $A_\frak{q}$ with trivial infinitesimal character, we have determined the special cycles for which the non-zero cohomology class has no $A_\frak{q}$-component, via Matsushima's isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Multiple q-zeta values and traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(a)_\infty = (a; q)_\infty = \prod_{n=0}^\infty (1-aq^n)$. An elegant result of Bloch and Okounkov [BO] states that if $x = e^z$, then $$ \frac{(xq)_\infty (x^{-1}q)_\infty}{(q)_\infty^2}, $$ which appears in various traces in representation theory and algebraic geometry, is a formal power series in $z^2$ whose coefficient for $z^{2k}$ is a quasi-modular form of weight $2k$. Quasi-modular forms are special types of multiple $q$-zeta values. In this paper, we generalize this result of Bloch and Okounkov and prove that certain other traces are related to multiple $q$-zeta values. A simple case of our main results asserts that if $x = e^z$ and $y = e^w$, then $$ \frac{(xq)_\infty (yq)_\infty}{(q)_\infty (xyq)_\infty}, $$ which appears in [CW, Theorem 5] as a trace (the deformed Bloch-Okounkov $1$-point function), is a formal power series in $z$ and $w$ whose coefficient for $z^mw^n$ is a multiple $q$-zeta value (in the sense of [BK3, Oko]) of weight $(m+n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop skein theory for 3-manifolds in the presence of codimension-one defects, focusing especially on defects arising from parabolic induction/restriction for quantum groups. We use these defects as a model for the quantum decorated character stacks of arXiv:2102.12283, thus extending them to 3-manifolds with surface defects. As a special case we obtain knot invariants closely related to the ``quantum $A$-polynomial", and we give a concrete method for computation resembling the approach of Dimofte and collaborators based on ideal triangulations and gluing equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For finite groups $G$, we show that bosonic-fermionic coinvariant rings have a natural $U(\mathfrak{gl}(k|j)) \otimes \mathbb{C}[G]$-module structure. In particular, we show that their character series are a sum of super Schur functions $s_\lambda(\mathbf{q}/\mathbf{u})$ times irreducible characters of $G$ with universal coefficients, which do not depend on $k,j$. In the case where $G$ is the symmetric group with diagonal action, this proves the "Diagonal Supersymmetry" conjecture of Bergeron (2020).</description>

      <title>Categorical absorption for hereditary orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Kuznetsov--Shinder's notion of deformation absorption of singularities leads to a new approach for studying the bounded derived category of a hereditary order on a curve. The starting point is a hereditary order which can be interpreted as a smoothing of the finite-dimensional algebra obtained from the restriction to a ramified point. We construct a triangulated subcategory inside the derived category of this finite-dimensional algebra which provides a deformation absorption of singularities. This allows us to obtain a semiorthogonal decomposition of the bounded derived category of the hereditary order, which is in addition linear over the base.</description>

      <title>An enhanced extriangulated subquotient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bondal-Kapranov's enhanced triangulated categories perform nicely in the context of the localization theory, that is, the Verdier quotient is lifted to the Drinfeld dg quotient of pretriangulated dg categories. In this article, we provide a development of such an enhancement for Nakaoka-Palu's notion of extriangulated categories which contains exact and triangulated categories. The enhancement of them was recently initiated by Xiaofa Chen under the name of exact dg categories. In addition, it is known that a certain ideal quotient of an extriangulated category is still extriangulated, and such an extriangulated ideal quotient was enhanced by the dg quotient of the associated connective exact dg category there. Motivated by Chen's enhanced extriangulated theory, we introduce the notion of cohomological envelope of an exact dg category and generalize his enhanced ideal quotient. We indeed show that the dg quotient of exact dg categories passing to the cohomological envelope and substructures, where we call it the exact dg subquotient, enjoys compatibility with a wide class of extriangulated quotients in the sense of Nakaoka-Ogawa-Sakai. To utilize and clarify the range of our approach, we formulate the extriangulated subquotient which permits us to localize any extriangulated category by extension-closed subcategories. It includes not only both the ideal quotient and the Verdier quotient, but the quotient of an exact category by biresolving subcategories. Notably the extriangulated subquotient is lifted to the exact dg subquotient.</description>

Abstract: We present a variety of new identities involving operators in the theory of wreath Macdonald polynomials. One such family of identities gives five-term relations, analogous to the one given by Garsia and Mellit for the modified Macdonald polynomials. As a consequence, we generate tableau formulas for wreath Macdonald Pieri coefficients, which give an incredibly quick way of computing their monomial expansions.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of Young diagrams for symplectic groups and semiclassical orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider an $n\times k$ matrix of i.i.d. Bernoulli random numbers with $p=1/2$. Dual RSK algorithm gives a bijection of this matrix to a pair of Young tableaux of conjugate shape, which is manifestation of skew Howe $GL_{n}\times GL_{k}$-duality. Thus the probability measure on zero-ones matrix leads to the probability measure on Young diagrams proportional to the ratio of the dimension of $GL_{n}\times GL_{k}$-representation and the dimension of the exterior algebra $\bigwedge\left(\mathbb{C}^{n}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{k}\right)$.
  Similarly, by applying Proctor's algorithm based on Berele's modification of the Schensted insertion, we get skew Howe duality for the pairs of groups $Sp_{2n}\times Sp_{2k}$. In the limit when $n,k\to\infty$ $GL$-case is relatively easily studied by use of free-fermionic representation for the correlation kernel. But for the symplectic groups there is no convenient free-fermionic representation. We use Christoffel transformation to obtain the semiclassical orthogonal polynomials for $Sp_{2n}\times Sp_{2k}$ from Krawtchouk polynomials that describe $GL_{2n}\times GL_{2k}$ case. We derive an integral representation for semiclassical polynomials. The study of the asymptotic of this integral representation gives us the description of the limit shapes and fluctuations of the random Young diagrams for symplectic groups.</description>

Abstract: A theorem of Cohen from 1950 states that a commutative ring is Noetherian if and only if every prime ideal is finitely generated. In this note, we establish analogues of this result in tensor triangular geometry. In particular, for an essentially small tensor triangulated category $\mathscr{K}$ with weakly Noetherian spectrum, we show that every prime ideal in $\mathscr{K}$ can be generated by finitely many objects if and only if the set of prime ideals of $\mathscr{K}$ is finite.</description>

Abstract: We give an explicit formula for an operator that sends a wreath Macdonald polynomial to the delta function at a character associated to its partition. This allows us to prove many new results for wreath Macdonald polynomials, especially pertaining to reciprocity: Macdonald--Koornwinder duality, evaluation formulas, etc. Additionally, we initiate the study of wreath interpolation Macdonald polynomials, derive a plethystic formula for wreath $(q,t)$-Kostka coefficients, and present series solutions to the bispectral problem involving wreath Macdonald operators. Our approach is to use the eigenoperators for wreath Macdonald polynomials that have been produced from quantum toroidal and shuffle algebras.</description>
