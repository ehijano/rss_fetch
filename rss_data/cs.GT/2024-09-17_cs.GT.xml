      <title>Reducing Leximin Fairness to Utilitarian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two prominent objectives in social choice are utilitarian - maximizing the sum of agents' utilities, and leximin - maximizing the smallest agent's utility, then the second-smallest, etc. Utilitarianism is typically computationally easier to attain but is generally viewed as less fair. This paper presents a general reduction scheme that, given a utilitarian solver, produces a distribution over outcomes that is leximin in expectation. Importantly, the scheme is robust in the sense that, given an approximate utilitarian solver, it produces an outcome that is approximately-leximin (in expectation) - with the same approximation factor. We apply our scheme to several social choice problems: stochastic allocations of indivisible goods, giveaway lotteries, and fair lotteries for participatory budgeting.</description>

      <title>MALADY: Multiclass Active Learning with Auction Dynamics on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active learning enhances the performance of machine learning methods, particularly in semi-supervised cases, by judiciously selecting a limited number of unlabeled data points for labeling, with the goal of improving the performance of an underlying classifier. In this work, we introduce the Multiclass Active Learning with Auction Dynamics on Graphs (MALADY) framework which leverages the auction dynamics algorithm on similarity graphs for efficient active learning. In particular, we generalize the auction dynamics algorithm on similarity graphs for semi-supervised learning in [24] to incorporate a more general optimization functional. Moreover, we introduce a novel active learning acquisition function that uses the dual variable of the auction algorithm to measure the uncertainty in the classifier to prioritize queries near the decision boundaries between different classes. Lastly, using experiments on classification tasks, we evaluate the performance of our proposed method and show that it exceeds that of comparison algorithms.</description>

      <title>Generative Semantic Communication via Textual Prompts: Latency Performance Tradeoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops an edge-device collaborative Generative Semantic Communications (Gen SemCom) framework leveraging pre-trained Multi-modal/Vision Language Models (M/VLMs) for ultra-low-rate semantic communication via textual prompts. The proposed framework optimizes the use of M/VLMs on the wireless edge/device to generate high-fidelity textual prompts through visual captioning/question answering, which are then transmitted over a wireless channel for SemCom. Specifically, we develop a multi-user Gen SemCom framework using pre-trained M/VLMs, and formulate a joint optimization problem of prompt generation offloading, communication and computation resource allocation to minimize the latency and maximize the resulting semantic quality. Due to the nonconvex nature of the problem with highly coupled discrete and continuous variables, we decompose it as a two-level problem and propose a low-complexity swap/leaving/joining (SLJ)-based matching algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate significant performance improvements over the conventional semanticunaware/non-collaborative offloading benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Instigating Cooperation among LLM Agents Using Adaptive Information Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for human strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these agents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments. Our approach extends traditional agent-based simulations by using strategic LLM agents (SLA) and introducing dynamic and adaptive governance through a pro-social promoting RL agent (PPA) that modulates information access across agents in a network, optimizing social welfare and promoting pro-social behavior. Through validation in iterative games, including the prisoner dilemma, we demonstrate that SLA agents exhibit nuanced strategic adaptations. The PPA agent effectively learns to adjust information transparency, resulting in enhanced cooperation rates. This framework offers significant insights into AI-mediated social dynamics, contributing to the deployment of AI in real-world team settings.</description>

      <title>Ambiguous Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07621v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the deliberate infusion of ambiguity into the design of contracts. We show that when the agent is ambiguity-averse and hence chooses an action that maximizes their minimum utility, the principal can strictly gain from using an ambiguous contract, and this gain can be arbitrarily high. We characterize the structure of optimal ambiguous contracts, showing that ambiguity drives optimal contracts towards simplicity. We also provide a characterization of ambiguity-proof classes of contracts, where the principal cannot gain by infusing ambiguity. Finally, we show that when the agent can engage in mixed actions, the advantages of ambiguous contracts disappear.</description>

      <title>Reducing Optimism Bias in Incomplete Cooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperative game theory has diverse applications in contemporary artificial intelligence, including domains like interpretable machine learning, resource allocation, and collaborative decision-making. However, specifying a cooperative game entails assigning values to exponentially many coalitions, and obtaining even a single value can be resource-intensive in practice. Yet simply leaving certain coalition values undisclosed introduces ambiguity regarding individual contributions to the collective grand coalition. This ambiguity often leads to players holding overly optimistic expectations, stemming from either inherent biases or strategic considerations, frequently resulting in collective claims exceeding the actual grand coalition value. In this paper, we present a framework aimed at optimizing the sequence for revealing coalition values, with the overarching goal of efficiently closing the gap between players' expectations and achievable outcomes in cooperative games. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we study the individual players' optimistic completions of games with missing coalition values along with the arising gap, and investigate its analytical characteristics that facilitate more efficient optimization; (ii) we develop methods to minimize this gap over classes of games with a known prior by disclosing values of additional coalitions in both offline and online fashion; and (iii) we empirically demonstrate the algorithms' performance in practical scenarios, together with an investigation into the typical order of revealing coalition values.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Finding the Best Pure Nash Equilibrium in Edge-weighted Budgeted Maximum Coverage Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new integer programming game (IPG) named the Edge-weighted Budgeted Maximum Coverage (EBMC) game and proposes a new algorithm, the Best Response Plus (BR-plus) algorithm, for finding the best Pure Nash Equilibrium (PNE). We demonstrate this methodology by optimizing county-level decisions to prevent aquatic invasive species (AIS) in Minnesota lakes, where each county-level decision makers has self-serving objectives while AIS is an interconnected issue that crosses county borders. Specifically, we develop EBMC games to model the strategic interactions among county-level decision-makers with two variations in utility functions. We also study and prove the existence of a PNE in these models under specified conditions. We advance the current state-of-the-art, which is limited to only a few players, by presenting the BR-plus algorithm that can handle a large set of players via utilizing the best response dynamics for finding PNE in normal-form games. Experimental results show that our BR-plus algorithm offers computational advantages over the ZR algorithm, especially in larger games, on both random and real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Distributed Learning Dynamics Converging to the Core of $B$-Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $B$-Matching is a special case of matching problems where nodes can join multiple matchings with the degree of each node constrained by an upper bound, the node's $B$-value. The core solution of a bipartite $B$-matching is both a matching between the nodes respecting the upper bound constraint and an allocation of the weights of the edges among the nodes such that no group of nodes can deviate and collectively gain higher allocation. We present two learning dynamics that converge to the core of the bipartite $B$-matching problems. The first dynamics are centralized dynamics in the nature of the Hungarian method, which converge to the core in a polynomial time. The second dynamics are distributed dynamics, which converge to the core with probability one. For the distributed dynamics, a node maintains only a state consisting of (i) the aspiration levels for all of its possible matches and (ii) the matches, if any, to which it belongs. The node does not keep track of its history nor is it aware of the environment state. In each stage, a randomly activated node proposes to form a new match and changes its aspiration based on the success or failure of its proposal. At this stage, the proposing node inquires about the aspiration of the node it wants to match with to calculate the feasibility of the match. The environment matching structure changes whenever a proposal succeeds. A state is absorbing for the distributed dynamics if and only if it is in the core of the $B$-matching.</description>

      <title>Zero-Knowledge Proof-of-Identity: Sybil-Resistant, Anonymous Authentication on Permissionless Blockchains and Incentive Compatible, Strictly Dominant Cryptocurrencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09093</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.09093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-Knowledge Proof-of-Identity from trusted public certificates (e.g., national identity cards and/or ePassports; eSIM) is introduced here to permissionless blockchains in order to remove the inefficiencies of Sybil-resistant mechanisms such as Proof-of-Work (i.e., high energy and environmental costs) and Proof-of-Stake (i.e., capital hoarding and lower transaction volume). The proposed solution effectively limits the number of mining nodes a single individual would be able to run while keeping membership open to everyone, circumventing the impossibility of full decentralization and the blockchain scalability trilemma when instantiated on a blockchain with a consensus protocol based on the cryptographic random selection of nodes. Resistance to collusion is also considered.
  Solving one of the most pressing problems in blockchains, a zk-PoI cryptocurrency is proved to have the following advantageous properties:
  - an incentive-compatible protocol for the issuing of cryptocurrency rewards based on a unique Nash equilibrium
  - strict domination of mining over all other PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies, thus the zk-PoI cryptocurrency becoming the preferred choice by miners is proved to be a Nash equilibrium and the Evolutionarily Stable Strategy
  - PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies are condemned to pay the Price of Crypto-Anarchy, redeemed by the optimal efficiency of zk-PoI as it implements the social optimum
  - the circulation of a zk-PoI cryptocurrency Pareto dominates other PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies
  - the network effects arising from the social networks inherent to national identity cards and ePassports dominate PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies
  - the lower costs of its infrastructure imply the existence of a unique equilibrium where it dominates other forms of payment</description>

      <title>Side-Constrained Dynamic Traffic Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study dynamic traffic assignment with side-constraints. We first give a counter-example to a key result from the literature regarding the existence of dynamic equilibria for volume-constrained traffic models in the classical edge-delay model. Our counter-example shows that the feasible flow space need not be convex and it further reveals that classical infinite dimensional variational inequalities are not suited for the definition of side-constrained dynamic equilibria. We propose a new framework for side-constrained dynamic equilibria based on the concept of feasible $\gamma$-deviations of flow particles in space and time. Under natural assumptions, we characterize the resulting equilibria by means of quasi-variational and variational inequalities, respectively. Finally, we establish first existence results for side-constrained dynamic equilibria for the non-convex setting of volume-constraints.</description>

      <title>Cost-sharing in Parking Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12265v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the total displacement statistic of parking functions from the perspective of cooperative game theory. We introduce parking games, which are coalitional cost-sharing games in characteristic function form derived from the total displacement statistic. We show that parking games are supermodular cost-sharing games, indicating that cooperation is difficult (i.e., their core is empty). Next, we study their Shapley value, which formalizes a notion of "fair" cost-sharing and amounts to charging each car for its expected marginal displacement under a random arrival order. Our main contribution is a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the Shapley value of parking games, in contrast with known hardness results on computing the Shapley value of arbitrary games. The algorithm leverages the permutation-invariance of total displacement, combinatorial enumeration, and dynamic programming. We conclude with open questions around an alternative solution concept for supermodular cost-sharing games and connections to other areas in combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Learning in General-sum Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Markov game framework is widely used to model interactions among agents with heterogeneous utilities in dynamic, uncertain, societal-scale systems. In these settings, agents typically operate in a decentralized manner due to privacy and scalability concerns, often without knowledge of others' strategies. Designing decentralized learning algorithms that provably converge to rational outcomes remains challenging, especially beyond Markov zero-sum and potential games, which do not fully capture the mixed cooperative-competitive nature of real-world interactions. Our paper focuses on designing decentralized learning algorithms for general-sum Markov games, aiming to provide guarantees of convergence to approximate Nash equilibria. We introduce a Markov Near-Potential Function (MNPF), and show that MNPF plays a central role in the analysis of convergence of an actor-critic-based decentralized learning dynamics to approximate Nash equilibria. Our analysis leverages the two-timescale nature of actor-critic algorithms, where Q-function updates occur faster than policy updates. This result is further strengthened under certain regularity conditions and when the set of Nash equilibria is finite. Our findings provide a new perspective on the analysis of decentralized learning in multi-agent systems, addressing the complexities of real-world interactions.</description>

      <title>Consumable Data via Quantum Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical data can be copied and re-used for computation, with adverse consequences economically and in terms of data privacy. Motivated by this, we formulate problems in one-way communication complexity where Alice holds some data and Bob holds $m$ inputs, and he wants to compute $m$ instances of a bipartite relation on Alice's data and each of his inputs. We call this the asymmetric direct sum question for one-way communication. We give a number of examples where the quantum communication complexity of such problems scales polynomially with $m$, while the classical communication complexity depends at most logarithmically on $m$.
  For these examples, data behaves like a consumable resource when the owner stores and transmits it as quantum states. We show an application to a strategic data-selling game, and discuss other potential economic implications.</description>
