      <title>The impact of magnetic fields during tidal disruption events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During a tidal disruption event (TDE) the stream debris inherits the magnetic field of the star. As the stream stretches, the magnetic field evolves and can eventually become dynamically important. We study this effect by means of magnetohydrodynamic simulations and a semi-analytic model of the disruption of a main-sequence star by a supermassive black hole. For stellar magnetic fields stronger than $\sim 10^4\,\rm{G}$, magnetic pressure becomes important in a significant fraction of the mass of the stream, leading to a fast increase in its thickness, an effect that may impact its subsequent evolution. We find that this dynamical effect is associated with a phase of transverse equilibrium between magnetic and tidal forces, which causes the stream width to increase with distance to the black hole as $H \propto R^{5/4}$. In the unbound tail, this fast expansion could enhance the radio emission produced by the interaction with the ambient medium, while in the returning stream, it may qualitatively affect the subsequent gas evolution, particularly the gas dynamics and radiative properties of shocks occurring after the stream's return to pericentre. By characterizing the magnetohydrodynamic properties of the stream from disruption to the first return to pericentre, this work provides physically motivated initial conditions for future studies of the later phases of TDEs, accounting for magnetic fields. This will ultimately shed light on the role of magnetic fields in enabling angular momentum transport in the ensuing accretion disk, thereby affecting observable signatures such as X-ray radiation and relativistic outflows.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves as a Probe of Core Collapse Supernova Progenitor Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the gravitational wave predictions from two-dimensional core collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations initiated from two nearly identical progenitors that have significantly different internal structures due to their late-stage stellar evolution. At the time of collapse, the 15.78 $M_{\odot}$ and 15.79 $M_{\odot}$ progenitors have compactness parameters $\xi_{2.5}$ of 0.136 and 0.206, respectively. We connect several features of the gravitational wave signal from each model to its previously explored explosion dynamics. In particular, the greater accretion onto the PNS of the more compact model is evident in broad-band frequency features with larger amplitude gravitational wave strains and greater gravitational wave energy release when compared to the less compact model. Additionally, the faster contraction rate of the more compact model is reflected in the $\sim$26% greater slope of the $g$-/$f$-mode feature (gfF) evolution of the gravitational wave signal. This work shows that in principle gravitational wave detection may provide information about interior stellar structure.</description>

      <title>Data span and frequency coverage requirements for robust detection and inference in PTAs: A case study with EPTA DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) are approaching the sensitivity required for a $5\sigma$ detection of the nanohertz stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB). This makes it crucial to deeply understand the behaviour of our analysis pipelines. A counterintuitive feature of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) second data release is that restricting the dataset to the last 10.3 years (DR2new) increases the inferred GWB significance from $\leq2\sigma$ for the full 25-year dataset (DR2full) to $\geq3.5\sigma$. We investigate whether this behaviour indicates an anomaly or is a possible outcome of the pipeline. Using realistic, DR2-like simulations with varying timespans, we find that the first 10 years contribute little to the GWB evidence due to their limited frequency coverage. This produces substantial overlap between the HD S/N distributions of DR2full and DR2new. Random noise fluctuations therefore yield a higher GWB evidence in DR2new than in DR2full in $15\%$ of cases. Furthermore, $5\%$ of simulations match the HD S/N of the real data, indicating that the observed behaviour is consistent with being a $\sim2\sigma$ outcome due to noise fluctuations. Regardless of significance, DR2new simulations introduce biases in the GWB parameter estimation due to spectral leakage effects that are ignored in standard analyses and which flatten the inferred spectrum. Including leakage removes these biases, demonstrating the reliability of DR2new when the signal is properly modelled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that combining EPTA DR2full with long-baseline data from NANOGrav and PPTA, as well as low-frequency data from LOFAR and NenuFAR, significantly enhances GWB evidence and parameter accuracy. Finally, we examine the impact of the observation timespan and find that short-baseline datasets introduce strong amplitude biases and are ineffective at constraining the GWB.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Binary Black Hole Subpopulations in GWTC-4 with Binned Gaussian Processes: On the Origins of the $35M_{\odot}$ Peak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the astrophysical origins of binary black holes requires accurate and flexible modeling of multi-dimensional population properties. In this paper, using a data-driven framework based on binned Gaussian processes, we characterize the joint distribution of BBH primary masses, mass ratios, and effective inspiral spins. We identify three distinct subpopulations in the GWTC-4 sample of observations and investigate their astrophysical origins. We find that only one of the three subpopulations exhibits the $35M_{\odot}$ peak, which is characterized by a strong preference for equal mass systems and isotropic spin orientations. Our inferred distributions are consistent with a predominantly dynamical origin of this feature. By comparing with theoretical simulations, we further show that the subpopulation that exhibits the $35M_{\sun}$ peak can exclusively comprise dynamically assembled systems in globular clusters, specifically if black hole birth spins are in the range~$(0.1-0.2)$, whereas the other two subpopulations require substantial contributions from alternative formation channels. We constrain the \textit{lower bound} on the merger rate of BBHs in globular clusters to be $0.69^{+0.23}_{-0.33} \rm{Gpc}^{-3}\rm{yr}^{-1}$, which is consistent with theoretical predictions. We conclude that dynamical formation in globular clusters remains a strong candidate for the origin of this excess near $30-40M_{\odot}$ and that more data and targeted parametric models are necessary to rigorously establish this interpretation.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Properties of GRB Accreting Magnetar with $R/I$ Evolutionary Effects Using \emph{Swift}/XRT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A newly born millisecond magnetar has been proposed as one possible central engine of some long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) with X-ray plateau. In this work, we used a universal correlation between initial spin period ($P_0$) and surface magnetic field ($B_p$) of newborn magnetar based on an LGRB sample in \cite{Lan2025} to explore the propeller properties of accreting magnetar with $R/I$ evolutionary effects. We found that $B_p-P_0$ relation is approximately consistent with $B_p\propto P_{\rm eq}^{7/6}$. Here, $P_{\rm eq}$ is equilibrium spin period in magnetic propeller model. The $B_p-P_0$ relation indicates that $P_0$ may not be true initial spin period of newborn magnetar, but had reached an equilibrium spin period via fallback accretion in propeller model. The magnetar accretion rate in our LGRBs is in range of $\dot{M}\sim10^{-5}-10^{-2} M_{\odot} \rm s^{-1}$ by incorporating $R/I$ evolutionary effects, and using the transition relation between gravitational mass $M_g$ and baryonic mass $M_b$ in different equation of states. Such accretion rates ensure that the accreting magnetars in our sample survive until reaching the equilibrium spin period, and the accretion rate is one order of magnitude lower compared to the statistical results in \cite{Stratta2018} and \cite{Linweili2020}, which used constant $R/I/M_g$ scenario. We suggested that adopting a constant $R/I/M_g$ scenario for modeling propeller regime in accreting magnetar results in a higher mass accretion rate, which may impair our understanding of the physical nature and its surroundings of accreting magnetar, and low-metallicity progenitors can provide enough material to satisfy the accretion requirements of newborn accreting magnetar in LGRBs.</description>

      <title>Needle in a Poissonian haystack -- An X-ray astronomer's guide to QPE fishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After six years of studies following the discovery of GSN069, a link is starting to appear between the elusive Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs) and other types of nuclear transients, among which are Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs). As such, observing strategies are adapting, with a current trend focusing on late-time X-ray follow-ups of (optical) TDEs. While these campaigns are so far proving quite successful, the inherent confirmation bias they introduce in our sample could lead the community to hasty, and perhaps erroneous, conclusions. It is thus important to still pursue the search for nuclear transients in other, more agnostic directions. In this work, we focus on the observational aspects of our field, and lay out two different methods that can be deployed in order to reveal new QPE sources. These complementary methods enable the detection of long-term ($\sim$years) and short term ($\sim$minutes) transient events, that would have otherwise been missed by the standard detection pipelines. Both of these methods can be used either for data mining in the 25 years worth of XMM-Newton archive, or to trigger real-time follow-ups upon a more recent discovery.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding the Origin of Swift Gamma-Ray Bursts Driven by Magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a sample of\textit{ Swift} gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with extended emissions in $\gamma$-rays and/or X-ray plateaus that may be driven by magnetars. Multi-wavelength data and multi-standards have been adopted to investigate the issue jointly. First, we find that GRBs with both extended emission and X-ray plateau satisfy a three-parameter relation between the luminosity and the end time of X-ray plateaus and the $\gamma$-ray isotropic energy as $L_X\varpropto T_a^{-1.13}E_{\gamma,iso}^{0.74}$, which is consistent with that of normal GRBs. Second, we distinguish these GRBs in the plane of magnetic field versus period of neutron star and find that almost all GRBs but GRB 211024B have reasonable periods and majority of them could be powered by magnetars. Third, we standardize the X-ray afterglows with distinct characteristics and find that the standard X-ray light curves with/without plateaus are significantly different. The standardized X-ray plateaus are similar to the mean temporal profile of magnetars. Fourth, it is verified with a K-S test that all types of GRBs except short ones have the similar distributions of redshift and isotropic energy in the observer/rest frame. GRBs with internal plateaus are significantly different from those of normal long GRBs and GRBs with external plateaus and/or extended emissions. Interestingly, the isotropic energy distributions of GRBs with internal and external plateaus are identical with those of short and long GRBs, respectively. Overall, our study can bring solid evidence that the fascinating magnetars could have multi-formation channels to account for not only short but also long GRBs with either internal or external X-ray plateaus as well.</description>

      <title>Vortex Dynamics in the Neutron Star Inner Crust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the superfluid vortex motion in the neutron star inner crust through direct three-dimensional simulations of the coupled dynamics of the vortex and the nuclear lattice. We demonstrate the pinning of an initially moving vortex to the lattice through excitation of lattice vibrations, and show that the efficiency of this process is higher for attractive than for repulsive nucleus-vortex interactions. We explore the unpinning of a vortex under the action of the applied Magnus force, and find that it is influenced by multiple parameters, including the sign of the pinning force, the lattice orientation, composition, temperature, and the energy of pinning to individual nucleus. In lattices with multiple grains, the unpinning transition is triggered inside the grains with weaker pinning, propagates along the vortex (mediated by the excited Kelvin waves) and crosses into grains with stronger pinning. This is likely to effectively decrease the critical force at which vortices unpin and to produce extended regions of unpinned vorticity. Shearing of the crust lattice (e.g., by a starquake) initiates the unpinning of the vortices that are crossing the slip plane. A close encounter of an unpinned vortex with a pinned vortex would cause the latter to unpin, perhaps initiating an unpinning avalanche of many vortices.</description>

      <title>Incorporating neutron star physics into gravitational wave inference with neural priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian inference, widely used in gravitational-wave parameter estimation, depends on the choice of priors, i.e., on our previously existing knowledge. However, to investigate neutron star mergers, priors are often chosen in an agnostic way, leaving valuable information from nuclear physics and independent observations of neutron stars unused. In this work, we propose to encode information on neutron star physics into data-driven prior distributions constructed with normalizing flows, referred to as neural priors. These priors take input from constraints on the nuclear equation of state and neutron star population models. Applied to GW170817, GW190425, and GW230529, we highlight two contributions of the framework. First, we demonstrate its ability to provide source classification and to enable model selection of equation of state constraints for loud signals such as GW170817, directly from the gravitational-wave data. Second, we obtain narrower constraints on the source properties through these informed priors. As a result, the neural priors consistently recover higher luminosity distances compared to agnostic priors. Our method paves the way for classifying future ambiguous low-mass mergers observed through gravitational waves and for continuously incorporating advances in our understanding of neutron star properties into gravitational-wave data analysis.</description>

      <title>Blazar classification from multi-wavelength data using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The launch of the Fermi-LAT telescope has revolutionized gamma-ray astronomy by detecting over 7,000 gamma-ray emitting objects. A major fraction of the objects are blazars of known type, and a similar fraction of objects were classified as blazars of uncertain types (BCUs). Apart from that, some of the objects were found to be unassociated with any other classes, and no information is available in other wavebands. These types of objects are classified as unassociated objects in the Fermi catalog. To classify the unassociated objects into known categories and BCUs into a known type of blazar, numerous efforts have been made using the machine learning approach. The ideal way of classification would be to have multi-wavelength temporal and spectral information, which is nearly impossible to have for this number of objects in the near future. In this paper, we focus on classifying BCUs into other types of blazars, such as FSRQs and BL Lacs. For this purpose, we have developed for the first time a deep feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify them, using multi-wavelength data. The complete understanding of blazars can only be known through multi-wavelength observation, and hence, we begin with four input parameters that cover broadband information (radio, optical, X-ray fluxes, and redshift) to train the neural network, and then extend the framework by including additional parameters to examine their impact on the outcome.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Dark Matter under siege: from White Dwarf Data to Gravitational Wave Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter (DM) remains a profound mystery. Macroscopic candidates, such as Fermi-balls, offer a distinct alternative to conventional particle DM, yet their low number density makes terrestrial detection challenging. In this work, we present a unified search strategy for sub-saturated Fermi-ball DM. We first revisit and significantly update astrophysical constraints from compact objects, utilizing rigorous expressions and additional white dwarf data related to ignition and subsequent supernovae. Crucially, we then explore novel signatures of Fermi-balls in future gravitational wave experiments like LISA and TianQin, performing detailed signal-to-noise ratio and Fisher matrix analyses. By combining these updated white dwarf/neutron star limits with the projected gravitational wave sensitivities, we derive the most comprehensive constraints on Fermi-ball parameter space to date, demonstrating the power of multi-messenger approaches for probing macroscopic DM.</description>

      <title>Simulating AGN feedback in galaxy clusters with pre-existing turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is believed to play a significant role in suppressing cooling flows in cool-core (CC) clusters. Turbulence in the intracluster medium (ICM), which may be induced by AGN activity or pre-existing motions, has been proposed as a potential heating mechanism based on analysis of Chandra X-ray surface brightness fluctuations. However, subsequent simulation results have found the subdominant role of turbulence in heating the ICM. To investigate this discrepancy, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a Perseus-like cluster including both AGN feedback and pre-existing turbulence, which is stirred to the observationally constrained level in the Perseus cluster. Our results indicate that, although the velocity field is dominated by the pre-existing turbulence, AGN heating through bubbles and shocks remains significant. More importantly, analysis of the velocity structure function and the energy power spectrum shows that the turbulent heating rate is smaller than the radiative cooling rate, especially in the cluster core. Our results offer insights relevant for recent XRISM observations and indicate that turbulent heating alone cannot offset radiative cooling in CC clusters.</description>

      <title>Synchrotron Self-Compton Model of TeV Afterglows in Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of a very-high-energy TeV spectral component in the afterglow emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has opened a new probe into the energetics of ultra-relativistic blast waves and the nature of the circumburst environment in which they propagate. The afterglow emission is well understood as the synchrotron radiation from the shock-accelerated electrons in the medium swept up by the blast wave. The same distribution of electrons also inverse-Compton upscatters the softer synchrotron photons to produce the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) TeV emission. Accurate modeling of this component generally requires a computationally expensive numerical treatment, which makes it impractical when fitting to observations using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Simpler analytical formalisms are often limited to broken power-law solutions and some predict an artificially high Compton-Y parameter. Here we present a semi-analytic framework for a spherical blast wave that accounts for adiabatic cooling and expansion, photon escape, and equal-arrival-time-surface integration, in addition to Klein-Nishina effects. Our treatment produces the broadband afterglow spectrum and its temporal evolution at par with results obtained from more sophisticated kinetic calculations. We fit our model to the afterglow observations of the TeV bright GRB\,190114C using MCMC, and find an energetic blast wave with kinetic energy $E_{k, \rm iso} = 9.1^{+7.41}_{-3.13} \times 10^{54} \, \rm erg$ propagating inside a radially stratified external medium with number density $n(r)\propto r^{-k}$ and $k=1.67^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$. A shallower external medium density profile ($k&lt;2$) departs from the canonical approximation of a steady wind ($k=2$) from the progenitor star and may indicate a non-steady wind or a transition to an interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Variation of Microphysical Parameters in Reverse-shock Scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), among the most compelling astrophysical phenomena, are potential candidates for exploring the evolution of energy distribution among magnetic fields and particles through multiwavelength observations. The fraction of energy transferred between particles and the magnetic field is governed by microphysical parameters, typically assumed to be constant during relativistic shocks but may in fact vary with time. In this work, we derive the light curves and closure relations (CRs) of the synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) process from the external reverse shock (RS) with variations of microphysical parameters in a homogeneous and stellar-wind medium. We consider the evolution of the RS in the thick- and thin-shell regimes. We demonstrate that, depending on the microphysical parameters, this process can mimic plateau phases and produce temporal decay indices steeper than those predicted by high-latitude emission alone. The current model is employed to examine the evolution of the spectral and temporal indices of GRBs reported in the Second Fermi-LAT Gamma-ray Burst Catalog (2FLGC) and bursts detected at very high energies, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of WIMP Models Explaining the Fermi-LAT Galactic Center Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Galactic Center excess (GCE) of GeV $\gamma$ rays may hint at dark matter (DM), yet its origin remains debated. Motivated by this, we survey weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) models that can fit the GCE while satisfying relic-density, direct-detection (DD), and indirect-detection (ID) bounds. We group candidates into hadronic (Higgs portals; simplified scalar/vector mediators), leptonic ($U(1)_{L_i-L_j}$), and mixed ($U(1)_{B-L}$, $Z$-portal) classes. Across all cases, present DD and dwarf-spheroidal $\gamma$-ray limits exclude wide regions, leaving mainly narrow resonant funnels with $m_{\rm DM}\!\simeq\! m_{\rm med}/2$ and portal couplings $\ll 1$. In hadronic setups, scalar and vector Higgs portals survive only in a thin strip near $m_h/2\simeq62.5$ GeV with portal couplings $\sim 10^{-4}$, while the Dirac Higgs and $Z$ portals are essentially excluded. The UV-complete vector Higgs portal retains resonant bands whose viable portal strength depends on the mixing angle. Simplified scalars allow small windows for complex-scalar or vector DM; Dirac DM is strongly disfavored, whereas a pseudoscalar with Dirac DM remains viable over a broader parameter range. For a simplified $Z'$ mediator, a pure vector coupling leaves only a marginal region, while pure axial is excluded by DD/ID bounds. In leptonic scenarios, inverse-Compton emission is essential: $L_\mu-L_e$ (and, to a lesser extent, $B\!-\!L$) fits the GCE with near-thermal cross sections, while $L_\mu-L_\tau$ is disfavored. Overall, viable WIMP explanations are constrained to finely tuned resonant regime, with leptophilic vectors and pseudoscalar portals emerging as the most robust options.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from the late inspiral, transition, and plunge of small-mass-ratio eccentric binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole binaries with small mass ratios will be important sources for the forthcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. Models of such binaries also serve as useful tools for understanding the dynamics of compact binary systems and the gravitational waves they emit. Using an eccentric Ori-Thorne procedure developed in previous work, we build worldlines that describe the full inspiral and plunge of a small body on an initially eccentric orbit of a Kerr black hole. We now calculate the gravitational waves associated with these trajectories using a code that solves the Teukolsky equation in the time domain. The final cycles of these waveforms, the ringdown, contains a superposition of Kerr quasinormal modes followed by a power-law tail. In this paper, we study how a binary's eccentricity and orbital anomaly angle affect the excitation of both quasinormal modes and late-time tails. We find that the relative excitation of quasinormal modes varies in an important and interesting way with these parameters. For some anomaly angles, the relative excitations of quasinormal modes are essentially indistinguishable from those excited in quasi-circular coalescences. Consistent with other recent studies, we find that eccentricity tends to amplify the late-time power-law tail, though the amount of this amplification varies significantly with orbital anomaly. We thus find that eccentricity has an important impact on the late-time coalescence waveform, but the interplay of eccentricity and orbit anomaly complicates this impact.</description>

      <title>QCD axions and domain walls in dense matter under compact stellar conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In compact stellar environments, the stability of dense QCD matter requires the simultaneous fulfillment of charge neutrality and beta equilibrium. In this work, we study how temperature and finite chemical potential affect QCD topology and axion properties within this medium, analyzing both cases with and without the charge neutrality condition. Our results show that the topological susceptibility and axion properties are highly sensitive to the critical behavior of the chiral phase transition in both cases. In particular, the axion mass is strongly suppressed near the transition, while the axion self-coupling constant develops a pronounced peak whose magnitude depends on the temperature and density of the medium. Remarkably, around the critical point at $T\simeq70$ MeV and $\mu\simeq346$ MeV, the self-coupling constant is enhanced by more than a factor of seven compared to its vacuum value, a feature that to the best of our knowledge has not been reported in previous studies. Such a strong amplification at the phase boundary indicates that axion-mediated interactions could play an important role in shaping the structure and stability of compact stars, with potential implications for their evolution and observable astrophysical signatures.</description>

      <title>Net Charge Accretion in Magnetized Kerr Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the charging process of a rotating Kerr black hole of mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$ immersed in a stationary, axisymmetric, asymptotically uniform magnetic field of strength $B_{0}$. In Wald's classic analysis (Wald 1974), which was based on the assumption of vanishing injection energy, the black hole was predicted to acquire a universal "saturation charge" $Q_{\mathrm{w}}=2B_{0}J$. However, the physical mechanism that sets the saturation charge must ultimately be governed by the competition between the absorption rates of positively and negatively charged particles. Motivated by this observation, we revisit the problem in the framework of a simple accretion model, where two dilute, equivalent fluxes of charged particles of opposite signs are injected from infinity along the magnetic field lines. The problem then reduces to that of individual particle motion in the electromagnetic field of the magnetized Kerr black hole. Using a combination of numerical and analytical tools, we determine the domains of absorption and establish both lower and upper bounds on the corresponding absorption cross sections. At $Q=Q_\mathrm{w}$ these bounds reveal a systematic difference between the two charge signs. In particular, for sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the lower bound on the absorption cross section for the "attracted" charge exceeds the upper bound for the "repelled" one. This charge accretion imbalance (which we find to become extreme at the limit of large $B_{0}$) indicates a persistent net charge accretion at $Q=Q_{\mathrm{w}}$, implying that the actual saturation charge must differ from Wald's charge $Q_{\mathrm{w}}$.</description>

      <title>Multipole moments do not uniquely characterise spacetimes beyond general relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spacetimes in general relativity can be uniquely decomposed into a set of multipole moments. Given the usefulness of moments in the categorisation of radiation patterns, tidal deformations, and other phenomena associated with compact objects, a number of studies have explored their construction in beyond-Einstein theories of gravity. It is shown here that uniqueness does not necessarily extend across theories: by comparing a few static and spherically-symmetric solutions in different theories, we find that two distinct objects can possess the same Geroch-Hansen moments. Moreover, two metrics can match and yet take different moments. Implications of this result are explored in the context of black-hole shadows and ``universal'' relations hinging on moment computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have recently entered the detection era, quickly moving beyond the goal of simply improving sensitivity at the lowest frequencies for the sake of observing the stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB), and focusing on its accurate spectral characterization. While all PTA collaborations around the world use Fourier-domain Gaussian processes to model the GWB and intrinsic long time-correlated (red) noise, techniques to model the time-correlated radio frequency-dependent (chromatic) processes have varied from collaboration to collaboration. Here we test a new class of models for PTA data, Gaussian processes based on time-domain kernels that model the statistics of the chromatic processes starting from the covariance matrix. As we will show, these models can be effectively equivalent to Fourier-domain models in mitigating chromatic noise. This work presents a method for Bayesian model selection across the various choices of kernel as well as deterministic chromatic models for non-stationary chromatic events and the solar wind. As PTAs turn towards high frequency (&gt;1/yr) sensitivity, the size of the basis used to model these processes will need to increase, and these time-domain models present some computational efficiencies compared to Fourier-domain models.</description>

      <title>Constraining of Nuclear Matter Equations of State With Rotating Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars can be regarded as natural laboratories that enable us to investigate nuclear matter properties under extreme conditions that are otherwise impossible to access in terrestrial experiments. Astrophysical observations of neutron stars provide invaluable information on existing nuclear interaction models and equations of state (EoSs) at various densities. Most studies of neutron star structure employ the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation which describes spherically symmetric, non-rotating stars in hydrostatic equilibrium. However, since neutron stars rotate fast, they could experience significant centrifugal deformation, and axially-symmetric calculations are required for accurate description of internal structure. The Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu (KEH) method is well known for modeling rapidly-rotating compact objects in a fully general relativistic manner. In this contribution, we report results of KEH calculations for rapidly-rotating neutron stars using EoSs based on Gogny-type finite-range effective nucleon-nucleon interactions. Our results show that the mass-radius relation systematically changes with increasing angular velocity, highlighting the importance of including rotational effects when confronting theoretical EoSs with observational data.</description>

      <title>SN 2021ukt: A Transitional Supernova with a Short Plateau and Persistent Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present spectroscopic and photometric observations of supernova (SN) 2021ukt, a peculiar short-plateau object that was originally identified as a Type IIn SN and later underwent an unprecedented transition to a Type Ib (possibly Type IIb) SN. The early-time light curves of SN 2021ukt exhibit a ~25 day plateau. Such a short phase of hydrogen recombination suggests a rather thin H-rich outer envelope of the progenitor star. The relatively narrow Balmer emission lines in spectra of SN 2021ukt during the first week indicate the interaction between the expanding ejecta and the immediate circumstellar material (CSM). This H{\alpha} line is observed throughout its helium-rich ejecta-dominated phase and nebular phase, suggesting persistent interaction with a radially extended CSM profile. We explore the synthetic light-curve model among grids of parameters generated by MESA+STELLA. We also compare the spectrophotometric evolution of SN 2021ukt with several well-sampled supernovae that exhibit a short plateau and persistent ejecta-CSM interaction. An estimate of the progenitor mass of SN 2021ukt is made based on the flux ratio between [Ca II] {\lambda}{\lambda} 7291, 7324 and [O I] {\lambda}{\lambda} 6300, 6364 during its nebular phase. Our analysis suggests that the progenitor star of SN 2021ukt has a zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass of about 12 solar masses, a mass of radioactive nickel-56 synthesized in the SN ejecta of about 0.04 solar masses, and a mass of the H-rich envelope of about 0.5 solar masses. This study adds to the growing sample of transitional supernovae, reinforcing evidence for a continuum of underrepresented progenitors whose evolutionary pathways lie between those of standard SN models.</description>

      <title>Properties of Core Collapse Supernovae from Binary Population Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) impact many areas of astrophysics, including compact object formation and gravitational waves, but many uncertainties remain in our understanding of the evolution of their progenitors. We use the binary population synthesis code COSMIC to simulate populations of CCSNe across a wide range of metallicities and binary evolution assumptions. Our models vary the prescriptions for mass transfer stability, common envelope ejection efficiency, natal kick strength, and remnant mass-limited explodability to assess their impact on the resulting population of CCSNe. We find that reproducing the observed Type I to Type II rate requires either low common envelope efficiency or modified prescriptions for common envelope survival, highlighting the importance of stellar mergers in shaping the CCSN population. We further classify our synthetic CCSNe into subtypes and present their relative abundances using several different sets of classification criteria, highlighting the large uncertainties that persist in mapping progenitor properties to spectral classes. Finally, we present delay time distributions (DTDs) for our overall populations, separated into Type I and II, and into the full set of observed subtypes. Our DTDs show that models reproducing the observed Type I to Type II rate produce a larger fraction of late CCSNe than is expected under standard assumptions.</description>

Abstract: Searching for Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) using astrophysical sources such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is crucial for probing quantum gravity. However, the dependence of LIV constraints on assumed cosmological models has been largely overlooked. In this work, we present a model-independent reconstruction of the cosmic expansion history using artificial neural networks (ANN), thereby avoiding biases from specific cosmological priors. We analyze 74 GRB time delays, including 37 measurements from GRB~160625B across multiple energy bands at $z = 1.41$, and 37 additional bursts spanning redshifts $0.117 \leq z \leq 1.99$. Our analysis yields stringent constraints on both linear and quadratic LIV, with $E_{\mathrm{QG},1} \geq 2.60 \times 10^{15}~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $E_{\mathrm{QG},2} \geq 1.21 \times 10^{10}~\mathrm{GeV}$. The linear limit is within four orders of magnitude of the Planck scale. By leveraging a large sample of GRBs, our approach significantly enhances the robustness of LIV constraints, providing a powerful, cosmological-independent framework for future tests of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>A multi-messenger window into galactic magnetic fields and black hole mergers with LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale (i.e., $\gtrsim {\rm kpc}$) and micro-Gauss scale magnetic fields have been observed throughout the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. These fields depend on the geometry and matter-energy composition, can display complicated behavior such as direction reversals, and are intimately related to the evolution of the source galaxy. Simultaneously, gravitational-wave astronomy offers a new probe into astrophysical systems, for example the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe the mergers of massive (i.e., $M ~&gt; 10^6$ M$_{\odot}$) black-hole binaries and provide extraordinary constraints on the evolution of their galactic hosts. In this work, we show how galactic, large-scale magnetic fields and their electromagnetic signatures are connected with LISA gravitational-wave observations via their common dependence on the massive black-hole binary formation scenario of hierarchical galaxy mergers. Combining existing codes, we astrophysically evolve a population of massive binaries from formation to merger and find that they are detectable by LISA with signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 10^3$ which is correlated with quantities from the progenitors' phase of circumbinary disk migration such as the maximum magnetic field magnitude $|\mathbf{B}| \approx 7 \,\mu$G, polarized intensity, and Faraday rotation measure. Interesting correlations result between these observables arising from their dependencies on the black-hole binary total mass, suggesting a need for further analyses of the full parameter space. We conclude with a discussion on this new multi-messenger window into galactic magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Hubble constant measurement from QPEs as electromagnetic counterparts to extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) accompanied by electromagnetic (EM) counterparts provide a novel methodology to measure the Hubble constant ($H_0$), known as bright sirens. However, the rarity of such multi-messenger events limits the precision of the $H_0$ constraint. Recently, the newly-discovered nuclear transient, quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) show intriguing evidence of a stellar-mass companion captured by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme/intermediate mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI/IMRI), which is the most promising sources of the space-based GW detectors, such as LISA. Here, we model the secular orbital evolution of known QPE systems using two frameworks: a stripping scenario in which periodic mass transfer at periapsis drives the evolution; and an orbiter-disk collision scenario in which the companion interacts with a misaligned accretion disk, modulated by coupled orbiter-disk precession. For each framework, we assess detectability by LISA, together with the resulting constraints on $H_0$. Our principal findings are: (i) in the stripping scenario, no currently known QPE reaches detectability within a four-year LISA mission. (ii) in the orbiter-disk scenario, two sources-eRO-QPE2 and eRO-QPE4-are detectable with signal-to-noise ratios $\simeq 8.5-28.8$ and constrain $H_0$ with fractional uncertainty of 6.7-14.9\%. QPE systems remain uncertain on the decade-long secular evolution. Therefore, they motivate continued time-domain monitoring of QPE candidates.</description>

      <title>SN2023syz and SN2025cbj: Two Type IIn Supernovae Associated with IceCube High-energy Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) are a subclass of core-collapse SNe in which strong interactions occur between the ejecta and dense circumstellar material, creating ideal conditions for the production of high-energy neutrinos. This makes them promising candidate sources of neutrinos.In this work, we conduct an association study between 163 SNe IIn observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility and 138 neutrino alert events detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory. After excluding alerts with poor localization, we find two SNe that are spatiotemporally coincident with neutrino events. IC231027A and IC250421A coincide with the positions of SN2023syz and SN2025cbj, respectively, within their localization uncertainties, and the neutrino arrival times are delayed by 38 days and 61 days relative to the discovery times of the corresponding SNe. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate that the probability of such two coincidences occurring by chance in our sample is $p \sim 0.67\%$, suggesting that they may originate from genuine physical associations, though the result is not yet statistically significant. Our model calculations, however, indicate that the likelihood of a neutrino originating from IC231027A is low, implying that the association between IC231027A and SN2023syz is likely coincidental. Nevertheless, under optimistic parameters, the probability of detecting a neutrino from the whole SNe IIn sample could reach $\gtrsim6\%$, indicating that detecting neutrino emission from the SNe population may be possible. Our study provides a systematic analysis, combining statistical analysis and model calculations, to assess whether interacting supernovae can serve as potential sources of neutrino emission.</description>

      <title>A novel reverberation mapping method for blazars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reverberation mapping (RM) is the most promising method to measure the masses of supermassive black holes in the center of active galaxy nuclei (AGNs). However, the dominant jet component hinders the application of RM method for blazars. In this work, we present a new algorithm to disentangle the contribution of the accretion disk from that of the relativistic jet in blazars by analyzing the spectral break of the optical spectroscopic data. We applied this method to two flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), PKS 1510-089 and PKS 0736+017. In PKS 1510-089, the variability of the H$\gamma$ line is delayed with respect to the disk emission by approximately 94 days, while the H$\beta$ line shows a lag of about 111 days relative to the disk. In PKS 0736+017, the H$\gamma$ variability is delayed with respect to the disk by roughly 66 days, and the H$\beta$ line exhibits a lag of about 67 days. Based on these measured time lags, we estimate black hole masses of $\sim1.4\times10^{8}\,M_{\odot}$ for PKS 1510-089 and $\sim8.1\times10^{7}\,M_{\odot}$ for PKS 0736+017. This method paves the way to apply the RM method for blazars, and improves the understanding of disk and jet activities.</description>

      <title>Where did Heavy Binaries Go? Gravitational-wave Populations Using Delaunay Triangulation with Optimized Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the joint mass-redshift evolution of the binary black-hole merger rate in the latest Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog, GWTC-4.0. We present and apply a novel non-parametric framework for modeling multi-dimensional, correlated distributions based on Delaunay triangulation. Crucially, the complexity of the model -- namely, the number, positions, and weights of triangulation nodes -- is inferred directly from the data, resulting in a highly efficient approach that requires about one to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters and significantly less calibration than current state-of-the-art methods. We find no evidence for a peak at $M_{\mathrm{tot}} \sim 70\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ at low redshifts ($z \sim 0.2$), where it would correspond to the $m_1 \sim 35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ feature reported in redshift-independent mass spectrum analyses, and we infer an increased merger rate at high redshifts ($z \sim 1$) around those masses, compatible with such a peak. When related to the time-delay distribution from progenitor formation to binary black-hole merger, our results suggest that sources contributing to the $m_1 \sim 35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ feature follow a steeper (shallower) time-delay distribution at high (low) redshifts. This hints at contributions from different formation channels -- for example dense environments and isolated binary evolution, respectively -- although firm identification of specific formation pathways will require further observations and analyses.</description>

      <title>Confirmation of SRGt 062340.2-265751 as a nova-like cataclysmic variable with a possible magnetic nature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SRGt 062340.2-265751, a cataclysmic variable identified by SRG/eROSITA thanks to its significant X-ray variability, remains poorly characterised despite the multi-wavelength follow-up. We present spectral and timing analyses from the first dedicated X-ray and ultraviolet observations with XMM-Newton, complemented by SRG/eROSITA data from four all-sky surveys (eRASS1-4) and ASAS-SN optical photometry. Our timing analysis reveals a &gt;8$\sigma$ significant modulation at 3.6 $\pm$ 0.5 hours, likely representing the orbital period. Long-term ASAS-SN monitoring confirms the source as a VY Sculptoris-type nova-like system, while short-timescale X-ray and ultraviolet variability, down to a few minutes, suggests a possible underlying magnetic white dwarf. Two additional significant X-ray modulations at 43 $\pm$ 1 min and 36.0 $\pm$ 0.7 min tentatively point to the spin period of an intermediate polar. The best-fit XMM-Newton energy spectra reveal a multi-temperature thermal plasma ($kT$ = 0.23, 0.94, and 5.2 keV), while the SRG/eROSITA spectra are consistent with a single-temperature thermal plasma of a few keV. We estimate unabsorbed X-ray luminosities of $\gtrsim$$10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (0.2-12 keV). Broadband spectral energy distribution modelling, from near-ultraviolet to infrared, indicates a disc-dominated system consistent with a nova-like classification. We discuss these results in the context of the source's confirmed nova-like classification and its possible magnetic nature, a scenario increasingly supported by discoveries of intermediate polars exhibiting VY Sculptoris-type nova-like features.</description>

      <title>Recoil-Enabled Energy Transfer from Coherent Neutrino Scattering in Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit neutrino-matter coupling in the post-shock region of core-collapse supernovae by restoring nuclear recoil in coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS). The resulting local energy transfer (a few keV per ~10 MeV neutrino) accumulates across the ~100 km stalled-shock layer, yielding a total heating of 10^49-10^50 erg, comparable within an order of magnitude to the increment required to trigger shock revival in current multidimensional simulations. This indicates that the long-standing failure of isoenergetic transport schemes to revive the shock originates from their neglect of recoil kinematics. Because the momentum exchange in each scattering is tiny, the emergent neutrino spectra and lepton-number balance remain essentially unchanged. The result highlights nuclear recoil as a minimal yet physically grounded correction to standard neutrino transport, providing a self-consistent route toward reliable explosion modeling.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Milli-Charged Particles with a running electromagnetic coupling constant at IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is postulated that heavy dark matter $\phi$ with a mass on the order of TeV, once captured by the Earth, can decay into relativistic milli-charged particles (MCPs). These MCPs are potentially detectable at the IceCube neutrino telescope. In this study, MCPs are modeled within the massless hidden photon framework, where they interact with nuclei via a running electromagnetic coupling constant, thereby enabling the prediction of their expected event rates and fluxes at IceCube. The expected number of background neutrino events at IceCube has also been evaluated. Under the assumption that no signal events are observed over a 10-year period at IceCube, upper limits on the MCP flux have been derived at the 90\% confidence level. The results suggest that MCPs originating from the Earth's core could be directly detected at IceCube at energies around $\mathcal{O}(1\ \text{TeV})$ for a fractional charge-squared range of $5.65\times10^{-5} \lesssim \epsilon^2 \lesssim 1.295\times10^{-3}$. Furthermore, with 10 years of IceCube data, a new region in the $m_{\text{MCP}}$-$\epsilon$ parameter space--specifically, $4\ \text{GeV} &lt; m_{\text{MCP}} &lt; 100\ \text{GeV}$ and $5.51\times10^{-2} &lt; \epsilon &lt; 0.612$--has been excluded.</description>

      <title>Broad-band temporal and spectral study of TeV blazar TXS 0518+211</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a long-term broad-band temporal and spectral study of a TeV BL Lac source TXS 0518+211 by analyzing nearly 16 years (MJD 54682 -- 60670) of simultaneous optical, UV and X-ray light curves from Swift-XRT/UVOT and gamma-ray light curves from Fermi-LAT. Based on the availability of simultaneous multi-wavelength data and considering flux level as the depiction of AGN-jet activity we identified 11 epochs (named as Epoch-A to Epoch-K) and investigated temporal as well as spectral variability during these epochs to understand the emission properties in this source. The fractional variability analysis reveals that, in all epochs, X-ray light curve exhibits relatively high degree of variability in compared to the optical, UV and gamma-ray light curves. The flux-flux plots among different bands, in general, show weak to moderate correlation with Spearman correlation coefficient ranging from 0.29 to 0.58. Notably, during Epoch-I, we detect a possible orphan flare exhibiting increase in the X-ray flux level ($\sim$ 2.4 times of the total average flux) but with no corresponding counterpart seen in the optical, UV bands. In contrast, during Epoch-K, we detect a significant decrease in the X-ray flux but no corresponding decrease in optical, UV and gamma-ray bands. Overall, our study reveals several changes in the flux states and complex nature of jet dominated emission processes. In all the epochs, two-zone leptonic model provides a better description of the broad-band emission in this TeV BL Lac source.</description>

      <title>Compton-induced $\gamma$-ray Cascade Emissions in Radio Galaxy NGC 1275</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among active galactic nuclei (AGNi), blazars are the brightest emitters of high-energy (HE, $E \geq 100$ MeV) to very-high-energy (VHE, $E \geq 100$ GeV) $\gamma$-rays from their jets. Radio galaxies, being the misaligned parent population of the blazar class, were historically not detected at these frequencies. However, advances in experiments and observatories have led to their detection in the HE--VHE $\gamma$-ray band. In this work, we leverage and refine a Monte-Carlo photon and electron-positron (e$^\pm$) pair tracking code in the AGN environment of the radio galaxy NGC 1275. In the code, we consider the isotropic broad-line region (BLR) and anisotropic Shakura-Sunyaev (SS) accretion disk radiation fields, with mild magnetic fields in the AGN environment. We find that cascade $\gamma$-rays from inverse-Compton scattering by relativistic e$^\pm$ pairs of these external radiation fields can explain the Fermi Large Area Telescope's (LAT) and Major Atmospheric Cherenkov Experiment's observations from the radio galaxy NGC 1275. We present a set of plausible parameters obtained from the code by fitting the source's spectral energy distribution (SED) during flaring events reported during the period December 2022 to January 2023.</description>

      <title>Waveform models for the gravitational-wave memory effect: II. Time-domain and frequency-domain models for nonspinning binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear gravitational-wave (GW) memory effect$\unicode{x2014}$a permanent shift in the GW strain that arises from nonlinear GW interactions in the wave zone$\unicode{x2014}$is a prediction of general relativity which has not yet been observed. The amplitude of the GW memory effect from binary-black-hole (BBH) mergers is small compared to that of primary (oscillatory) GWs and is unlikely to be detected by current ground-based detectors. Evidence for its presence in the population of all the BBH mergers is more likely, once thousands of detections are made by these detectors. Having an accurate and computationally efficient waveform model of the memory signal will assist detecting the memory effect with current data-analysis pipelines. In this paper, we build on our prior work to develop analytical time-domain and frequency-domain models for the dominant nonlinear memory multipole signal ($l=2$, $m=0$) from nonspinning BBH mergers in quasicircular orbits. The model is calibrated for mass ratios between one and eight. There are three parts to the time-domain signal model: a post-Newtonian inspiral, a quasinormal-mode-based ringdown, and a phenomenological signal during the late inspiral and merger (which interpolates between the inspiral and ringdown). The time-domain model also has an analytical Fourier transform, which we compute in this paper. We assess the accuracy of our model using the mismatch between our waveform model and the memory signal computed from the oscillatory modes of a numerical-relativity surrogate model. We use the advanced LIGO sensitivity curve from the fourth observing run and find that the mismatch increases with the total mass of the system and is of order $10^{-2}\unicode{x2013}10^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of magnetized BPS baryonic layers and the effects of the Isospin chemical potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics, BPS magnetized Baryonic layers (possessing both baryonic charge and magnetic flux) have been constructed in the gauged non-linear sigma model (G-NLSM) minimally coupled to Maxwell theory, which is one of the most relevant effective theories for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the strongly interacting low-energy limit which also takes into account the electromagnetic interactions. Since the topological charge that naturally appears on the right hand side of the BPS bound is a non-linear function of the baryonic charge, the thermodynamics of these magnetized Baryonic layers is highly non-trivial. In this work, using tools from the theory of Casimir effect, we derive analytical relationship between baryonic charge, topological charge, magnetic flux and relevant thermodynamical quantities (such as pressure, specific heat and magnetic susceptibility) of these layers. The critical Baryonic chemical potential is identified. Quite interestingly, the grand canonical partition function can be related with the Riemann zeta function. On the technical side, it is quite a remarkable result to derive explicit expressions for all these thermodynamics quantities of a strongly interacting magnetized system at finite Baryon density. The effects of the Isospin chemical potential can be included as well: in particular, we will be able to construct explicitly the BPS bound and the corresponding BPS configurations also in the case in which the Isospin chemical potential is non-zero. The physical interpretations of our analytical results will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Cosmological abundance of primordial black holes in mixed dark matter scenarios incorporating Kaluza-Klein dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) dark matter particles and primordial black holes (PBHs) emerge as plausible candidates for dark matter. In scenarios where dark matter is a mix of KK particles and PBHs, PBHs can attract surrounding KK dark matter particles post-formation, leading to the creation of ultracompact dark matter halos (UCMHs). The distribution of KK dark matter particles within UCMHs tends to be steeper than in classical dark matter halo structures, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White model. Consequently, the annihilation rate of KK dark matter particles in UCMHs is significant. The high-energy photons resulting from the annihilation of KK particles in UCMHs contribute to the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB). Leveraging data from the $\mathtt{Fermi\text{-}LAT}$ experiment, we have derived, for the first time, upper limits on the cosmological abundance of PBHs in the context of KK dark matter annihilation. For a KK dark matter mass range of $500\le m_{\rm B^{(1)}}\le 1500$ GeV, which aligns with the observed present abundance of dark matter, the conservative limits on the fraction of dark matter in PBHs, for massive PBHs with $M_{\rm PBH}\gtrsim 10^{-11}M_{\odot}$, are $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 2\times 10^{-5}$.</description>

Abstract: The particle origin of dark matter (DM) remains elusive despite decades of direct, indirect, and collider searches. Several groups have reported a $\gamma$-ray excess toward the Galactic Centre, commonly referred to as the Galactic Centre Excess (GCE). Its spectrum is consistent with annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) of mass $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ GeV and a thermal-relic cross section. Although many concrete WIMP models reproduce the GCE spectrum, most are now excluded by direct detection experiments that are approaching the neutrino floor. We investigate a class of anomaly-free extensions of the Standard Model featuring gauged differences of lepton number, $U(1)_{L_i-L_j}$, and gauged baryon minus lepton number, $U(1)_{B-L}$. We show that these models can reproduce the GCE while remaining compatible with the observed relic abundance. We then impose collider and direct detection constraints, accounting for both tree-level and loop-induced kinetic mixing. The $L_\mu-L_e$ model gives the best fit to the GCE: a DM mass of $m_\chi\sim 40-50$ GeV remains consistent with the muon and electron magnetic moment anomalies, $(g-2)_{\mu,e}$, as well as current collider and direct detection limits, for mediator masses in the range $m_{A'}\sim 70-86$ GeV and a DM-mediator coupling of $(1-5)\times10^{-2}$. By contrast, the $L_e-L_\tau$ and $L_\mu-L_\tau$ models yield poorer fits; satisfying both the relic density and experimental bounds forces the DM mass to lie very close to resonance (i.e., approximately half the mediator mass). Finally, while the $B-L$ model also matches the GCE well, its parameter space is almost entirely ruled out by strong direct detection limits, except for the narrow resonance region where $m_\chi$ should be equal to $m_{A'}/2$ requiring a fine-tuning at the few-percent level.</description>

      <title>Probing the nonstrange quark star equation of state with compact stars and gravitational waves</title>

Abstract: A recent study shows that incorporating a new term into the thermodynamic potential density, as required by the thermodynamic consistency criterion, can effectively resolve the thermodynamic inconsistency problems of the conventional perturbative QCD model. This additional term plays a crucial role in resolving inconsistencies at relatively low densities and becomes negligible at extremely high densities. Within this revised perturbative QCD model, we find that if we require only that the energy per baryon of up-down ($ud$) quark matter exceeds 930 MeV so as not to contradict the standard nuclear physics, the maximum mass of an $ud$ quark star allowed by the revised perturbative QCD model can reach up to 2.17 $M_{\odot}$. From this perspective, the observed 2.14 $M_{\odot}$ pulsar PSR J0740+6620 may be an $ud$ quark star. However, if we further impose the constraint that the tidal deformability of a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ $ud$ quark star must be consistent with the GW170817 event, the maximum mass allowed by the revised perturbative QCD model would decrease to no more than 2.08 $M_{\odot}$. Consequently, our results suggest that the compact object with a mass of 2.50-2.67 $M_{\odot}$, as observed in the GW190814 event, cannot be an $ud$ quark star, according to the revised perturbative QCD model.</description>

Abstract: The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) mission concept is a proposed mission to NASA's Astrophysics Probe Explorer (APEX) call. The concept features a cryogenically cooled 1.8 m diameter telescope, and is designed to carry two science instruments covering the 24 to 264 $\mu$m wavelength range: an imaging polarimeter (PRIMAger) and a spectrometer (FIRESS). The majority of PRIMA's time (75%) will be open to observations proposed by the community (General Observer science / GO), and all of data will be publicly available for archival research (Guest Investigator science / GI). Following up on the successful community engagement created by the first volume of the GO PRIMA Science Book (arXiv:2310.20572), Volume 2 gathers 120 new and updated contributed science cases which could be performed within the context of the PRIMA GO/GI program. This volume reflects the strong development of the community interest, awareness and involvement in PRIMA, and further develops how PRIMA's unprecedented capabilities can be leveraged for an impactful and innovative GO/GI program covering most areas of astrophysics and over 90% of the scientific questions and discovery areas in the Astro2020 decadal survey.</description>

      <title>A Bottom-Up EFT Approach To Superdense Baryonic Matter</title>

Abstract: How to arrive at the densest matter in massive compact stars starting from Walecka's linear $\omega$-$\sigma$ mean-field model is described in a series of arguments anchored on hidden local symmetry, hidden scale symmetry and emergent parity-doublet symmetry. I follow the bottom-up approach from chiral symmetry with pions, coupled to hidden local and scale symmetry degrees of freedom. Exploiting the renormalization-group treatment \`a la Shankar and Polchinski of the fermionic interactions on the Fermi sphere, leading to Landau-Migdal Fermi-liquid, one obtains a sort of generalized ``Density Functional" that allows via a topology change hadrons transform to quarks without phase changes at the center of massive stars. The highly dense matter is ``pseudo-conformal" with the sound velocity $v_{pcs}^2/c^2\approx 1/3$ but the trace of the energy-momentum tensor is not equal to zero, hence the matter is non-conformal.</description>
