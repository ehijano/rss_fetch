      <title>New insights into linear maps which are anti-derivable at zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a Banach algebra admitting a bounded approximate unit and satisfying property $\mathbb{B}$. Suppose $T: A \rightarrow X$ is a continuous linear map, where $X$ is an essential Banach $A$-bimodule. We prove that the following statements are equivalent:
  $(i)$ $T$ is anti-derivable at zero (i.e., $a b =0$ in $A$ $\Rightarrow T(b)\cdot a + b\cdot T(a) =0$);
  $(ii)$ There exist an element $\xi \in X^{**}$ and a linear map (actually a bounded Jordan derivation) $d: A\to X$ satisfying $\xi \cdot a = a \cdot \xi \in X$, $T(a) = d(a) +\xi \cdot a$, and $d(b)\cdot a + b\cdot d(a)= - 2 \xi \cdot (b a),$ for all $a,b\in A$ with $a b =0$.
  Assuming that $A$ is a C$^*$-algebra we show that a bounded linear mapping $T: A\to X$ is anti-derivable at zero if, and only if, there exist an element $\eta \in X^{**}$ and an anti-derivation $d: A \rightarrow X$ satisfying $\eta \cdot a = a \cdot \eta \in X$, $\eta \cdot [a,b] = 0$ {\rm(}i.e., $L_{\eta}: A \to A$, $L_{\eta} (a) = \eta \cdot a$ vanishes on commutators{\rm)}, and $T(a) = d(a) +\eta \cdot a$, for all $a,b \in A$. The results are also applied for some special operator algebras.</description>

      <title>Embedding into Leavitt algebra $L_K(1, 2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a unital homomorphism from every Bergman $K$-algebra corresponding to a conical commutative monoid with an order-unit into Leavitt algebra $L_K(1,2)$, where $K$ is a field. This will be used to give a short proof that Leavitt path algebras associated with graphs with condition $(L)$ embed into $L_K(1,2)$. We then show that the Heisenberg equation $xy-yx=1$ cannot be realized in any Steinberg algebra, implying that Weyl algebras can't be embedded in $L_K(1,2)$, giving an affirmative answer to a question of Brownlowe and Sorensen on the embeddability of $K$-algebras with a countable basis inside $L_K(1,2)$.</description>

      <title>Effective Operators in the Theory of Composites: Hilbert Space Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this chapter, the Hilbert space framework in the mathematical theory of composite materials is introduced for studying the properties of effective operators. The goal is to introduce some of the key concepts and fundamental theorems in this area while showing that they follow naturally from using only basic results in operator theory on Hilbert spaces. These concepts include the $Z$-problem as an abstraction of a constitutive equation defined in terms of a bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space with a Hodge decomposition, direct and dual $Z$-problems with the duality interpretation of the inverse of an effective operator, and the notion of an $n$-phase composite with orthogonal $Z(n)$-subspace collection. These theorems include sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of both the solution of a $Z$-problem and the effective operator of a $Z$-problem, a representation formula for the effective operator as an operator Schur complement, the Dirichlet and Thomson minimization principles for the effective operator, the result on monotonicity and concavity of the effective operator map, and the Keller-Dykhne-Mendelson duality relations. Moreover, another important theorem given here (which may also be of independent interest to systems theorists) says that an effective operator of an $n$-phase composite with orthogonal $Z(n)$-subspace collection is the Schur complement of a normalized homogeneous semidefinite operator pencil (in particular, has a Bessmertny\u{\i} realization) and, up to a unitary equivalence, the converse is also true. Finally, the general theory presented here is shown to recover classical results dealing with effective conductivity but can also be applied to many other important problems involving composites in physics and engineering, e.g., in elasticity and electromagnetism.</description>

      <title>On the small boundary property and $\mathcal Z$-absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Property (C) for a unital commutative sub-C*-algebra $D$ of a unital C*-algebra $A$, a version of the relative comparison property using almost normalizers. Under the assumption of this property, the $\mathcal Z$-absorption of $A$ is shown to imply the small boundary property of $(D, \mathrm{T}(A)|_D)$, where $A =\mathrm{C}(X) \rtimes \mathbb Z^d $ and $D = \mathrm{C}(X)$.</description>

      <title>Additive C*-categories and K-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.14830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the notions of a multiplier category and the $W^{*}$-envelope of a $C^{*}$-category. We then consider the notion of an orthogonal sum of a (possibly infinite) family of objects in a $C^{*}$-category. Furthermore, we construct reduced crossed products of $C^{*}$-categories with groups. We axiomatize the basic properties of the $K$-theory for $C^{*}$-categories in the notion of a homological functor. We then study various rigidity properties of homological functors in general, and special additional features of the $K$-theory of $C^{*}$-categories. As an application we construct and study interesting functors on the orbit category of a group from $C^{*}$-categorical data.</description>
