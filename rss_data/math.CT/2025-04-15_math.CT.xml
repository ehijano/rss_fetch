      <title>Double categories of profunctors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize virtual double categories of enriched categories, functors, and profunctors by introducing a new notion of double-categorical colimits. Our characterization is strict in the sense that it is up to equivalence between virtual double categories and, at the level of objects, up to isomorphism of enriched categories. Throughout the paper, we treat enrichment in a unital virtual double category rather than in a bicategory or a monoidal category, and, for consistency and better visualization of pasting diagrams, we adopt augmented virtual double categories as a fundamental language for double-categorical concepts.</description>

      <title>Directed First-Order Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a first-order logic equipped with an "asymmetric" directed notion of equality, which can be thought of as transitions/rewrites between terms, allowing for types to be interpreted as preorders. We then provide a universal property to such "directed equalities" by describing introduction and elimination rules that allows them to be contracted only with certain syntactic restrictions, based on polarity, which do not allow for symmetry to be derived. We give a characterization of such directed equality as a relative left adjoint, generalizing the idea by Lawvere of equality as left adjoint. The logic is equipped with a precise syntactic system of polarities, inspired by dinaturality, that keeps track of the occurrence of variables (positive/negative/both). The semantics of this logic and its system of variances is then captured categorically using the notion of directed doctrine, which we prove sound and complete with respect to the syntax.</description>

      <title>String Diagrams for Premonoidal Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06075v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Premonoidal categories are monoidal categories without the interchange law while effectful categories are premonoidal categories with a chosen monoidal subcategory of interchanging morphisms. In the same sense that string diagrams, pioneered by Joyal and Street, are an internal language for monoidal categories, we show that string diagrams with an added "runtime object", pioneered by Alan Jeffrey, are an internal language for effectful categories and can be used as string diagrams for effectful, premonoidal, and Freyd categories.</description>

      <title>Classical Distributive Restriction Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the category of sets and partial functions, $\mathsf{PAR}$, while the disjoint union $\sqcup$ is the usual categorical coproduct, the Cartesian product $\times$ becomes a restriction categorical analogue of the categorical product: a restriction product. Nevertheless, $\mathsf{PAR}$ does have a usual categorical product as well in the form $A \&amp; B := A \sqcup B \sqcup (A \times B)$. Surprisingly, asking that a distributive restriction category (a restriction category with restriction products $\times$ and coproducts $\oplus$) has $A \&amp; B$ a categorical product is enough to imply that the category is a classical restriction category. This is a restriction category which has joins and relative complements and, thus, supports classical Boolean reasoning. The first and main observation of the paper is that a distributive restriction category is classical if and only if $A \&amp; B := A \oplus B \oplus (A \times B)$ is a categorical product in which case we call $\&amp;$ the ''classical'' product.
  In fact, a distributive restriction category has a categorical product if and only if it is a classified restriction category. This is in the sense that every map $A \to B$ factors uniquely through a total map $A \to B \oplus \mathsf{1}$, where $\mathsf{1}$ is the restriction terminal object. This implies the second significant observation of the paper, namely, that a distributive restriction category has a classical product if and only if it is the Kleisli category of the exception monad $\_ \oplus \mathsf{1}$ for an ordinary distributive category.
  Thus having a classical product has a significant structural effect on a distributive restriction category. In particular, the classical product not only provides an alternative axiomatization for being classical but also for being the Kleisli category of the exception monad on an ordinary distributive category.</description>

      <title>The Grothendieck construction in the context of tangent categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14643v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Grothendieck construction establishes an equivalence between fibrations, a.k.a. fibred categories, and indexed categories, and is one of the fundamental results of category theory. Cockett and Cruttwell introduced the notion of fibrations into the context of tangent categories and proved that the fibres of a tangent fibration inherit a tangent structure from the total tangent category. The main goal of this paper is to provide a Grothendieck construction for tangent fibrations. Our first attempt will focus on providing a correspondence between tangent fibrations and indexed tangent categories, which are collections of tangent categories and tangent morphisms indexed by the objects and morphisms of a base tangent category. We will show that this construction inverts Cockett and Cruttwell's result but it does not provide a full equivalence between these two concepts. In order to understand how to define a genuine Grothendieck equivalence in the context of tangent categories, inspired by Street's formal approach to monad theory we introduce a new concept: tangent objects. We show that tangent fibrations arise as tangent objects of a suitable $2$-category and we employ this characterization to lift the Grothendieck construction between fibrations and indexed categories to a genuine Grothendieck equivalence between tangent fibrations and tangent indexed categories.</description>

      <title>Interval Decomposition of Persistence Modules over a Principal Ideal Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07971v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of persistent homology has contributed new insights and perspectives into a variety of interesting problems in science and engineering. Work in this domain relies on the result that any finitely-indexed persistence module of finite-dimensional vector spaces admits an interval decomposition -- that is, a decomposition as a direct sum of simpler components called interval modules. This result fails if we replace vector spaces with modules over more general coefficient rings.
  We introduce an algorithm to determine whether a persistence module of pointwise free and finitely-generated modules over a principal ideal domain (PID) splits as a direct sum of interval submodules. If one exists, our algorithm outputs an interval decomposition. When considering persistence modules with coefficients in $\Z$ or $\Q[x]$, our algorithm computes an interval decomposition in polynomial time. This is the first algorithm with these properties of which we are aware.
  We also show that a persistence module of pointwise free and finitely-generated modules over a PID splits as a direct sum of interval submodules if and only if the cokernel of every structure map is free. This result underpins the formulation of our algorithm. It also complements prior findings by Obayashi and Yoshiwaki regarding persistent homology, including a criterion for field independence and an algorithm to decompose persistence homology modules of simplex-wise filtrations.</description>

      <title>Twisted Post-Hopf Algebras, Twisted Relative Rota-Baxter Operators and Hopf Trusses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16704v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present article is devoted to studying the categorical relationships between the categories of Hopf trusses, weak twisted post-Hopf algebras, introduced by Wang (2023), and weak twisted relative Rota-Baxter operators. The latter objects are a generalisation of the relative Rota-Baxter operators defined by Li-Sheng-Tang (2024), where the Rota-Baxter condition is modified through a cocycle. Under certain conditions, this work shows that the three aforementioned categories are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Unitary Categorical Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global invertible symmetries act unitarily on local observables or states of a quantum system. In this note, we aim to generalise this statement to non-invertible symmetries by considering unitary actions of higher fusion category symmetries $\mathcal{C}$ on twisted sector local operators. We propose that the latter transform in $\ast$-representations of the tube algebra associated to $\mathcal{C}$, which we introduce and classify using the notion of higher $S$-matrices of higher braided fusion categories.</description>

      <title>Frobenius reciprocity, modular connections, lattice isomorphism theorem and abstract principal ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this short note is to fill a gap in the literature: Frobenius reciprocity in the theory of doctrines is closely related to modular connections in projective homological algebra and the notion of a principal element in abstract commutative ideal theory. These concepts are based on particular properties of Galois connections which play an important role also in the abstract study of group-like structures from the perspective of categorical/universal algebra; such role stems from a classical and basic result in group theory: the lattice isomorphism theorem.</description>
