      <title>The CMS statistical analysis and combination tool: COMBINE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the COMBINE software package used for statistical analyses by the CMS Collaboration. The package, originally designed to perform searches for a Higgs boson and the combined analysis of those searches, has evolved to become the statistical analysis tool presently used in the majority of measurements and searches performed by the CMS Collaboration. It is not specific to the CMS experiment, and this paper is intended to serve as a reference for users outside of the CMS Collaboration, providing an outline of the most salient features and capabilities. Readers are provided with the possibility to run COMBINE and reproduce examples provided in this paper using a publicly available container image. Since the package is constantly evolving to meet the demands of ever-increasing data sets and analysis sophistication, this paper cannot cover all details of COMBINE. However, the online documentation referenced within this paper provides an up-to-date and complete user guide.</description>

      <title>Machine learning assisted optical diagnostics on a cylindrical atmospheric pressure surface dielectric barrier discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study explores combining machine learning (ML) algorithms with standard optical diagnostics (such as time--integrated emission spectroscopy and imaging) to accurately predict operating conditions and assess the emission uniformity of a cylindrical surface Dielectric Barrier Discharge (SDBD). It is demonstrated that ML can be complementary with these optical diagnostics and identify peculiarities associated with the discharge emission pattern at different high voltage waveforms (AC and pulsed) and amplitudes. By employing unsupervised (Principal Component Analysis (PCA)) and supervised (Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks) algorithms, the applied voltage waveform and amplitude are categorised and predicted based on correlations/differences identified within large amounts of corresponding data. PCA allowed us to effectively classify the voltage waveforms and amplitudes applied to the SDBD through a transformation of the spectroscopic/imaging data into principal components (PCs) and their projection to a two-dimensional PC space. Furthermore, an accurate prediction of the voltage amplitude is achieved using the MLP which is trained with PCA--preprocessed data. A particularly interesting aspect of this concept involves examining the uniformity of the emission pattern of the discharge. This is achieved by analysing spectroscopic data recorded at four different regions around the SDBD surface using the two ML--based techniques. These discoveries are instrumental in enhancing plasma--induced processes. They open up new avenues for real--time control, monitoring, and optimization of plasma--based applications across diverse fields such as flow control for the present SDBD.</description>

      <title>Adaptive hybrid density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14793v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exact exchange contributions are known to crucially affect electronic states, which in turn govern covalent bond formation and breaking in chemical species. Empirically averaging the exact exchange admixture over compositional degrees of freedom, hybrid density functional approximations have been widely successful, yet have fallen short to reach high level quantum chemistry accuracy, primarily due to delocalization errors. We propose to `adaptify` hybrid functionals by generating optimal admixture ratios of exact exchange on the fly, i.e. specifically for any chemical compound, using extremely data efficient quantum machine learning models that carry negligible overhead. The adaptive Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof based hybrid density functional (aPBE0) is shown to yield atomization energies with sufficient accuracy to effectively cure the infamous spin gap problem in open shell systems, such as carbenes. aPBE0 further improves energetics, electron densities, and HOMO-LUMO gaps in organic molecules drawn from the QM9 and QM7b data set. Obtained with aPBE0 in a large basis, we present a revision of the entire QM9 data set (revQM9) with an estimated quality vastly superior to the original containing on average, stronger covalent binding, larger band-gaps, more localized electron densities, and larger dipole-moments. While aPBE0 is applicable in the equilibrium regime, outstanding limitations include covalent bond dissociation when going beyond the Coulson-Fisher point.</description>
