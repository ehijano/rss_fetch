      <title>When do common time series estimands have nonparametric causal meaning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.01637v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the direct potential outcome system as a framework for analyzing dynamic causal effects of assignments on outcomes in observational time series settings. We provide conditions under which common predictive time series estimands, such as the impulse response function, generalized impulse response function, local projection, and local projection instrumental variables, have a nonparametric causal interpretation in terms of dynamic causal effects. The direct potential outcome system therefore provides a foundation for analyzing popular reduced-form methods for estimating the causal effect of macroeconomic shocks on outcomes in time series settings.</description>

      <title>Testing and Estimating Structural Breaks in Time Series and Panel Data in Stata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.14550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying structural change is a crucial step in analysis of time series and panel data. The longer the time span, the higher the likelihood that the model parameters have changed as a result of major disruptive events, such as the 2007--2008 financial crisis and the 2020 COVID--19 outbreak. Detecting the existence of breaks, and dating them is therefore necessary, not only for estimation purposes but also for understanding drivers of change and their effect on relationships. This article introduces a new community contributed command called xtbreak, which provides researchers with a complete toolbox for analysing multiple structural breaks in time series and panel data. xtbreak can detect the existence of breaks, determine their number and location, and provide break date confidence intervals. The new command is used to explore changes in the relationship between COVID--19 cases and deaths in the US, using both aggregate and state level data, and in the relationship between approval ratings and consumer confidence, using a panel of eight countries.</description>

      <title>The Challenge of Using LLMs to Simulate Human Behavior: A Causal Inference Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential to simulate human behavior. We identify a fundamental challenge in using them to simulate experiments: when LLM-simulated subjects are blind to the experimental design (as is standard practice with human subjects), variations in treatment systematically affect unspecified variables that should remain constant, violating the unconfoundedness assumption. Using demand estimation as a context and an actual experiment as a benchmark, we show this can lead to implausible results. While confounding may in principle be addressed by controlling for covariates, this can compromise ecological validity in the context of LLM simulations: controlled covariates become artificially salient in the simulated decision process, which introduces focalism. This trade-off between unconfoundedness and ecological validity is usually absent in traditional experimental design and represents a unique challenge in LLM simulations. We formalize this challenge theoretically, showing it stems from ambiguous prompting strategies, and hence cannot be fully addressed by improving training data or by fine-tuning. Alternative approaches that unblind the experimental design to the LLM show promise. Our findings suggest that effectively leveraging LLMs for experimental simulations requires fundamentally rethinking established experimental design practices rather than simply adapting protocols developed for human subjects.</description>

      <title>Minimax Optimal Simple Regret in Two-Armed Best-Arm Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates an asymptotically minimax optimal algorithm in the two-armed fixed-budget best-arm identification (BAI) problem. Given two treatment arms, the objective is to identify the arm with the highest expected outcome through an adaptive experiment. We focus on the Neyman allocation, where treatment arms are allocated following the ratio of their outcome standard deviations. Our primary contribution is to prove the minimax optimality of the Neyman allocation for the simple regret, defined as the difference between the expected outcomes of the true best arm and the estimated best arm. Specifically, we first derive a minimax lower bound for the expected simple regret, which characterizes the worst-case performance achievable under the location-shift distributions, including Gaussian distributions. We then show that the simple regret of the Neyman allocation asymptotically matches this lower bound, including the constant term, not just the rate in terms of the sample size, under the worst-case distribution. Notably, our optimality result holds without imposing locality restrictions on the distribution, such as the local asymptotic normality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Neyman allocation reduces to the uniform allocation, i.e., the standard randomized controlled trial, under Bernoulli distributions.</description>
