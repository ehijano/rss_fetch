      <title>Risk measures based on target risk profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem that classical risk measures may not detect the tail risk adequately. This can occur for instance due to the averaging process when computing Expected Shortfall. The current literature proposes a solution, the so-called adjusted Expected Shortfall. This risk measure is the supremum of Expected Shortfalls for all possible levels, adjusted with a function $g$, the so-called target risk profile. We generalize this idea by using other risk measures instead of Expected Shortfall. Therefore, we introduce the concept of general adjusted risk measures. For these the realization of the adjusted risk measure quantifies the minimal amount of capital that has to be raised and injected in a financial position $X$ to ensure that the risk measure is always smaller or equal to the adjustment function $g(p)$ for all levels $p\in[0,1]$. We discuss a variety of assumptions such that desirable properties for risk measures are satisfied in this setup. From a theoretical point of view, our main contribution is the analysis of equivalent assumptions such that a general adjusted risk measure is positive homogeneous and subadditive. Furthermore, we show that these conditions hold for a bunch of new risk measures, beyond the adjusted Expected Shortfall. For these risk measures, we derive their dual representations. Finally, we test the performance of these new risk measures in a case study based on the S$\&amp;$P $500$.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Approximation of Limit Order Books in a Single-Scale Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a first and second-order approximation for an infinite dimensional limit order book model (LOB) in a single (''critical'') scaling regime where market and limit orders arrive at a common time scale. With our choice of scaling we obtain non-degenerate first-order and second-order approximations for the price and volume dynamics. While the first-order approximation is given by a standard coupled ODE-PDE system, the second-order approximation is non-standard and described in terms of an infinite-dimensional stochastic evolution equation driven by a cylindrical Brownian motion. The driving noise processes exhibit a non-trivial correlation in terms of the model parameters. We prove that the evolution equation has a unique solution and that the sequence of standardized LOB models converges weakly to the solution of the evolution equation. The proof uses a non-standard martingale problem. We calibrate a simplified version of our model to market data and show that the model accurately captures correlations between price and volume fluctuations.</description>

      <title>The Elasticity of Quantitative Investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What is the demand elasticity of statistical arbitrageurs that invest according to the advice of modern cross-sectional asset pricing models? Thirteen models from the literature exhibit strikingly inelastic demand, in contrast to classical models that rely on statistical arbitrageurs to create elastic market demand for assets. This inelasticity arises from the difficulty of trading against price changes. A quantitative equilibrium model shows that aggregate demand remains inelastic even with these statistical arbitrageurs in the market.</description>
