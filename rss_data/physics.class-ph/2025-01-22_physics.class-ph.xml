      <title>Inflation and instabilities of a spherical magnetoelastic balloon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the instabilities during the axisymmetric inflation of an initially spherical magnetoelastic balloon, modeled as a magnetizable Ogden material, under combined internal pressure and a non-uniform magnetic field generated by current-carrying coils. The nonlinear interplay of geometric and material effects leads to governing equations sensitive to bifurcations and instabilities. A coordinate singularity at the poles of the balloon is identified within the system of governing differential equations, which is resolved through an appropriate choice of field variables and L'H\^opital's rule. Stability analysis reveals that as inflation progresses, axisymmetry is broken through a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation, resulting in a pear-shaped equilibrium. This symmetry is later restored through a reverse subcritical pitchfork bifurcation, forming an isolated loop of pear-shaped solutions containing stable and unstable branches in the case of a six-parameter Ogden material model (SPOM). The onset of symmetry-breaking bifurcations is influenced by material parameters and magnetic field intensity, with critical values beyond which such bifurcations are suppressed. Both symmetry-preserving and pear-shaped configurations are stable under small asymmetric perturbations in both magnetic and non-magnetic cases. Snap-through transitions between pear-shaped and axisymmetric configurations are also observed.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium of circular von-K\'arm\'an plate bonded with Kirchhoff rod</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A circular von Karman plate is considered bonded at its boundary to a circular Kirchhoff rod via a hinge like junction. There is a mismatch of dimension between the rod and the plate boundary in their respective stress free configurations. The process of gluing of the inextensible circular rod to the edge of the extensible plate causes the system to develop internal stress in the natural planar configuration. For some critical values of this mismatch the rod plate system, as expected, shows buckling behaviour in the interior or at the boundary of plate. In this paper, the corresponding bifurcation problem is formulated using the mismatch parameter as a bifurcation parameter. The non linear equations of equilibrium are linearized near the homogeneously deformed state and necessary conditions of bifurcation are solved for the critical geometric mismatch that is when non trivial solutions of the linearized equations exist. These critical points are candidates to be classified as bifurcation points. Additionally, the semi analytic nature of the analysis is exploited to perform a parametric study, relative to structure parameters in the problem formulation, of the critical points in the problem and the characteristic features are summarised. It is found that the rod plays an important role in determining the buckling behaviour when the plate's dimension is smaller than the looped rod, as in that case the rod buckles and the plate can bend or stretch depending on the planar or non planar nature of buckled mode of the rod. When the plate is larger, the rod effectively stimulates a rigid Dirichlet boundary condition due to its inextensibility; the critical points in this case are found to coincide with the case when buckling in the sole plate as a system is considered.</description>

      <title>Poincare invariant interaction between two Dirac particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spinning electron-electron interaction is described in classical terms by means of two possible classical interactions: The instantaneous Coulomb interaction between the charge centers of both particles and the Poincar\'e invariant interaction developed in a previous work. The numerical integrations are performed with several Mathematica notebooks that are available for the interested readers in the reference Section. One difference of these interactions is that the Poincar\'e invariant interaction does not satisfy the action-reaction principle in the synchronous description and, therefore, there is no conservation of the mechanical linear momentum. It is the total linear momentum of the system what is conserved.
  In this synchronous description the interaction is not mediated by the retarded fields but is described in terms of the instantaneous positions, velocities and accelerations of the center of charge of both particles. In the Poincar\'e invariant description the net binding force that holds linked two Dirac particles is stronger than in the Coulomb case, thus forming a stable spin 1 system of 2 Dirac particles. This bosonic state of spin 1 does not correspond to a Cooper pair because the separation between the centers of mass of the Dirac particles is below Compton's wavelength, smaller than the correlation distance of the Cooper pair. Since the Poincar\'e invariant interaction is relativistically invariant it can be used for analyzing high energy scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Dressed Subsystems in Classical Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of consistently defining subsystems in gravitational theories. It is argued that a subsystem is a spacetime subregion in which the observables form a closed Poisson algebra. In a generally covariant theory, the location of the subregion must be determined in relation to other degrees of freedom. It is proposed that these degrees of freedom should live within the region, so that an observer can determine its edge by only measuring fields inside of it. This turns out to be equivalent to the property that observables in the subregion generate field-dependent gauge transformations on the causal complement. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that this is \textit{exactly} what is necessary for the observables to form a Poisson algebra and thus to constitute a consistent subsystem. Observables in spacelike separated "dressed subsystems" are shown to commute. Several examples are given in the context of General Relativity. Along the way, new perspectives on the covariant phase space formalism are introduced that clarify well-known issues, such as the factorization of subregions in gauge theories and the unambiguous definition of Noether charges associated with one-sided boosts. Finally, prospects for extending these results to a perturbative quantum setting are discussed.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically exact theory of functionally graded elastic beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a one-dimensional first-order theory for functionally graded elastic beams using the variational-asymptotic method. This approach ensures an asymptotically exact one-dimensional equations, allowing for the precise determination of effective stiffnesses in extension, bending, and torsion via numerical solutions of the dual variational problems on the cross-section. Our theory distinguishes itself by offering a rigorous error estimation based on the Prager-Synge identity, which highlights the limits of accuracy and applicability of the derived one-dimensional model for beams with continuously varying elastic moduli across the cross section.</description>

      <title>The magnetic scalar potential and demagnetization vector for a cylinder tile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poisson's equation for the magnetic scalar potential generated by a magnetized cylindrical slice and a full cylinder is solved analytically and a closed-form solution for the magnetic scalar potential is determined. This is given in terms of elliptic integrals of the first, second and third kind. We show that the magnetic scalar potential can be written as a demagnetization vector, containing all the geometric information of generating cylinder, multiplied with the magnetization. We validate the derived analytical expression for the magnetic scalar potential by comparing with a finite element simulation and show that these agree perfectly for both the cylindrical slice and the full cylinder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a lower bound for the energy decay rate in piezoelectric cylinders. The bound incorporates material properties and geometric factors, including the cross-section's Poincar\'e-Wirtinger and Korn constants. A detailed analysis of a circular cross-section cylinder yields a precise numerical lower bound, illustrating the practical application of this result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical stress control is becoming one of the major challenges for the future of micro and nanotechnologies. Micro scanning X-ray diffraction is one of the promising techniques that allows stress characterization in such complex structures at sub micron scales. Two types of MEMS structure have been studied: a bilayer cantilever composed of a gold film deposited on poly-silicon and a boron doped silicon bridge. X-ray diffraction results are discussed in view of numerical simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>The outer gravitational potential of an inhomogeneous torus with an elliptical cross-section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Toroidal structures are a common feature in a wide variety of astrophysical objects, including dusty tori in AGNs, rings in galaxies, protoplanetary disks, and others. The matter distribution in such structures is not homogeneous and can be flattened by self-gravity or become elongated in the vertical direction, as is the case with obscuring tori in AGNs. This led us to consider the more general case of the gravitational potential of an inhomogeneous torus with an elliptical cross-section. We begin by showing that the outer potential of a homogeneous elliptical torus can be effectively approximated with less than 1\% error by the potentials of two infinitely thin rings with a minor correction term. These two rings have masses each equal to half the total mass of the torus. The most notable feature is that each such infinitely thin ring is positioned at precisely the halfway point between the center and the focus of the elliptical cross-section, regardless of the torus' other parameters. The result, which holds for both oblate and prolate geometries, allows us to find a new expression to handle the outer potential of an inhomogeneous torus with an elliptical cross-section. The confocal density distribution is a special case. We have found that the outer potential of such a torus is only weakly dependent of the density distribution law. Consequently, even for the confocal inhomogeneous case, the outer potential is well represented by two infinitely thin rings. This approach can simplify problems of dynamics for the systems consisting of toroidal structures. We have also derived the expressions for the external force components exerted by a homogeneous torus with an elliptical cross-section, both for the exact form of the potential and for our approximation by two infinitely thin rings. Comparison of the two shows that our model fits the true trend of the force well.</description>

      <title>Active charge and discharge of a capacitor: scaling solution and energy optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capacitors are ubiquitous in electronic and electrical devices. In this article, we study -- both theoretically and experimentally -- the charging and discharging of capacitors using active control of a voltage source. The energy of these processes is analyzed in terms of work and heat. We show how to approach the quasistatic regime by slowing down the charging or discharging processes. Conversely, we study the price to be paid in terms of Joule heat when we speed up these processes. Finally, we develop optimal processes that minimize energy consumption for a finite charging time. Our work combines fundamental concepts from thermodynamics, classical mechanics and electrical circuits, thus blurring the artificial frontiers at the undergraduate level between these disciplines. Also, it provides a simple example of a prominent problem in current science, the optimization of energy resources. Moreover, our study lends itself well to an experimental project in the classroom, involving computer control of a voltage source, data acquisition, and processing.</description>

      <title>First part of Clausius heat theorem in terms of Noether's theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After Helmholtz, the mechanical foundation of thermodynamics included the First Law $d E = \delta Q + \delta W$, and the first part of the Clausius heat theorem $\delta Q^\text{rev}/T = dS$. The resulting invariance of the entropy $S$ for quasistatic changes in thermally isolated systems invites a connection with Noether's theorem (only established later). In this quest, we continue an idea, first brought up by Wald in black hole thermodynamics and by Sasa $\textit{et al.}$ in various contexts. We follow both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frameworks, and emphasize the role of Killing equations for deriving a First Law for thermodynamically consistent trajectories, to end up with an expression of ``heat over temperature'' as an exact differential of a Noether charge.</description>

      <title>Invariant measures for some dissipative systems from the Jacobi last multiplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian dynamics describing conservative systems naturally preserves the standard notion of phase-space volume, a result known as the Liouville's theorem which is central to the formulation of classical statistical mechanics. In this paper, we obtain explicit expressions for invariant phase-space measures for certain (generally dissipative) mechanical systems, namely, systems described by conformal vector fields on symplectic manifolds that are cotangent bundles, contact Hamiltonian systems, and systems of the Li\'enard class. The latter class of systems can be described by certain generalized conformal vector fields on the cotangent bundle of the configuration space. The computation of the invariant measures is achieved by making use of the formalism of Jacobi last multipliers.</description>
