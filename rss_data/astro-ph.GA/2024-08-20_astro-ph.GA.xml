      <title>A Dusty Dawn: Galactic Dust Buildup at $z\gtrsim5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) has revealed massive, extremely dusty star-forming galaxies at $z\gtrsim5$, and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is primed to uncover even more information about them. These extreme observations both need dust evolution theory to provide context and are excellent benchmarks to test this theory. Here, we investigate the evolution of galactic dust populations at cosmic dawn using a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of moderately massive, high-redshift ($M_*\gtrsim10^9 M_{\odot}$; $z\gtrsim5$) galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project, the highest resolution of such simulations to date. Our simulations incorporate a dust evolution model that accounts for the dominant sources of dust production, growth, and destruction and follows the evolution of specific dust species, allowing it to replicate a wide range of present-day observations. We find, similar to other theoretical works, that dust growth via gas-dust accretion is the dominant producer of dust mass for these galaxies. However, our fiducial model produces $M_{\rm dust}$ that fall ${\gtrsim}1$ dex below observations at any given $M_*$, which we attribute to reduced accretion efficiencies caused by a combination of low metallicities and extremely bursty star formation in these galaxies. Modest enhancements (i.e., within observational/theoretical uncertainties) to accretion and SNe II dust creation raise $M_{\rm dust}$ by ${\lesssim}1$ dex, but this still falls below observations which assume $T_{\rm dust}\sim25$ K. One possibility is that inferred dust masses for $z\gtrsim4$ galaxies are overestimated, and recent observational works that find $T_{\rm dust}\sim50$ K along with metallicity constraints tentatively support this.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Dynamics in a Galactic Multipolar Halo with a Compact Primary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational evidence strongly supports the existence of a Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH) at the Galactic center, surrounded by dense stellar clusters. Modeling galactic centers with intricate structures like shells and rings pose challenges, prompting the use of simplified models such as a spherical monopole potential with a multipolar halo mass distribution. This approach, employing a multipolar expansion model, provides versatility for numerical analyses, revealing the complex dynamics of stars in this region. Pseudo-Potentials like Paczynsky-Wiita and Artemova-Bjornsson-Novikov are utilized to simulate the impacts of strong gravity from non-rotating and rotating compact objects respectively, elucidating their influence on stellar dynamics. Chaos naturally arises due to non-central forces, visualized using the Poincar\'e section technique. Of particular importance is the utilization of the Smaller Alignment Index (SALI), a powerful nonlinear dynamical tool, which categorizes particle orbits as escaping, regular, sticky, or chaotic. We exhaustively examine all combinations of multipolar moments up to the octupolar term along with spin using this tool, which had not been studied earlier. SALI provides a straightforward yet efficient method for assessing the interplay between the system's different multipolar moments, their combinations, and spin. Thus, our findings offer insights into the dynamics of compact objects enshrouded in a halo mass distribution and lay the groundwork for understanding complex astrophysical systems in galactic centers.</description>

      <title>Parabolic-like Trend in SiO Ratios throughout the Central Molecular Zone: Possible Signature of a Past Nuclear Activity in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a characteristic trend in the intensity ratios of SiO emissions across the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy. Using the Nobeyama Radio Observatory 45-m telescope, we conducted large-scale, high-sensitivity imaging observations in molecular lines including SiO $J$=2$-$1 and CS $J$=2$-$1. By identifying SiO-emitting clouds and examining their intensity ratios relative to the other molecular lines, we unveiled a parabolic-like trend showing lower ratios near the Galactic nucleus, Sgr A$^*$, with gradual increases toward the edges of the CMZ. This pattern suggests a possible outburst of the nucleus within the last $\sim 10^5$ yr, which may have propagated through the entire CMZ with strong shocks. Alternatively, the observed trend may also be attributed to the destruction of small dust grains by high-energy photons. Our results can potentially lead to a new perspective on the history of nuclear activity and its impact on the surrounding molecular environment.</description>

      <title>First Discovery and Confirmation of PN Candidates Found from AI and Deep Learning Techniques Applied to VPHAS+ Survey Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. We have developed deep learning (DL) and AI-based tools to search extant narrow-band wide-field H$\alpha$ surveys of the Galactic Plane for elusive planetary nebulae (PNe) which are hidden in dense star fields towards the Galactic center. They are faint, low-surface brightness, usually resolved sources, which are not discovered by previous automatic searches that depend on photometric data for point-like sources. These sources are very challenging to find by traditional visual inspection in such crowded fields and many have been missed. We have successfully adopted a novel 'Swin-Transformer' AI algorithm, which we described in detail in the preceding Techniques paper (Paper I). Aims. Here, we present preliminary results from our first spectroscopic follow-up run for 31 top-quality PN candidates found by the algorithm from the high-resolution H$\alpha$ survey VPHAS+. This survey has not yet undergone extensive manual, systematic searching. Methods. Our candidate PNe were observed with the SpUpNIC spectrograph on the 1.9 m telescope at the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) in June 2023. We performed standard IRAF spectroscopic reduction and then followed our normal HASH PN identification and classification procedures. Results. Our reduced spectra confirmed that these candidates include 22 true, likely, and possible PNe (70.97\%), 3 emission-line galaxies, 2 emission-line stars, 2 late-type star contaminants, and 2 other H$\alpha$ sources including a newly identified detached fragment of SNR RCW 84. We present the imaging and spectral data of these candidates and a preliminary analysis of their properties. These data provide strong input to help evaluate and refine the behavior of the AI algorithm when searching for PNe in wide-field H$\alpha$ surveys.</description>

      <title>Extreme Metallicity Dwarf Galaxies in IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of extremely metal-deficient dwarf galaxies (XMDs) as nearby analogs for high-redshift protogalaxies is generating renewed interest due to recent JWST observations studying these protogalaxies. However, the existence of a population of unenriched galaxies at $z\sim0$ raises fundamental questions about how galaxies with such pristine gas reservoirs could be formed. To address these questions we study XMDs in the IllustrisTNG simulation. We find that XMDs at $z=0$ are not relics of the first galaxies, but dwarf galaxies that experience a dramatic $\sim0.3$ dex drop in their gas-phase metallicity in the past few Gyr. We investigate possible causes of this drop in metallicity including high gas fractions, outflow efficiency or inflow/outflow rates, unique environments, pristine inflow metallicity, and inflow/SFR interactions. Of these, we find that inflow/outflow interactions, parameterized by the cumulative regional SFR experienced by inflows, has the strongest correlation with dwarf galaxy metallicity and XMD formation. In other words, inefficient gas enrichment during the short time between its accretion from the CGM and the initiation of star formation is the most important cause of XMD formation in the simulation. Observationally, we identify differences in star formation history between XMDs and non-XMDs (with XMDs having significantly decreased star formation rates on $1-5$ Gyr timescales) and differences in galaxy size (with XMDs having a more extended young stellar population) as the primary differences between the two populations. These results highlight the importance of inflow enrichment efficiency as a possible driver of dwarf galaxy metallicities.</description>

      <title>Curvature Mapping Method: Mapping Lorentz Force in Orion A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic force is a fundamental force in nature. Although widely believed to be important in counterbalancing against collapse in star formation, a clear evaluation of the role of the magnetic field in star formation remains hard to achieve. Past research attempts to evaluate the importance of magnetic forces using diagnostics such as the mass-to-flux ratio, which measures its strength but not how it functions. Since star formation is a complex process and the observed regions have complex structures, mapping the importance of the magnetic field is necessary. We propose a new technique, the Curvature Mapping Method, to evaluate the role of the magnetic force by providing maps of the magnetic force estimated using polarization observations. The Curvature Mapping Method provides maps with the contribution of the magnetic force clearly outlined. We apply the method to the star formation region of Orion A and provide a first quantitative result where the magnetic force arising from the pinched magnetic field does provide support against gravity. By comparing it against the gravitational force, we find that the magnetic force is enough to affect the low-density gas but is insufficient to support the dense region from collapse. The method effectively uses information contained in polarization maps and can be applied to data from surveys to understand the role of the B-field.</description>

      <title>Double-peaked Narrow Emission-Line Galaxies in SDSS-IV MaNGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narrow emission lines in a galaxy's spectrum that show double peaks indicate the presence of distinct gas components with different velocities, and its physical origin remains uncertain. This study uses galaxies from the final MaNGA data release to detect double-peaked narrow emission-line spaxels (DPSs) by examining the double Gaussian profiles of the H$ \alpha $-[N \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}] doublets across all MaNGA spaxels. A total of 5,420 DPSs associated with 304 double-peaked narrow emission-line galaxies (DPGs) are identified, each DPG containing a minimum of 5 DPSs and being free from overlap with other galaxies. We find that DPSs can be categorized into three groups according to their central distance $r/R_e$ and the velocity difference $\Delta v$ between their two components: the inner low-$\Delta v$, inner high-$\Delta v$ and outer DPSs. By incorporating the physical characteristics of the DPGs into their DPSs, we demonstrate for the first time the existence of statistical correlations between barred DPGs and inner low-$\Delta v$ DPSs, AGN-hosting DPGs and inner high-$\Delta v$ DPSs, as well as tidal DPGs and outer DPSs.</description>

      <title>Apostle--Auriga: Effects of stellar feedback subgrid models on the evolution of angular momentum in disc galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the Apostle--Auriga simulations, which start from the same zoom-in initial conditions of Local Group-like systems but run with different galaxy formation subgrid models and hydrodynamic solvers, we study the impact of stellar feedback models on the evolution of angular momentum in disc galaxies. At $z = 0$, Auriga disc galaxies tend to exhibit higher specific angular momenta compared to their cross-matched Apostle counterparts. By tracing the evolution history of the Lagrangian mass tracers of the in-situ star particles in the $z = 0$ galaxies, we find that the specific angular momentum distributions of the gas tracers from the two simulations at the halo accretion time are relatively similar. The present-day angular momentum difference is mainly driven by the physical processes occurring inside dark matter haloes, especially galactic fountains. Due to the different subgrid implementations of stellar feedback processes, Auriga galaxies contain a high fraction of recycled gas tracers (${\sim} 65$ per cent) which could acquire angular momentum through mixing with the high angular momentum circumgalactic medium (CGM). In Apostle, however, the fraction of recycled gas tracers is significantly lower (down to ${\sim} 20$ per cent for Milky Way-sized galaxies) and the angular momentum acquisition from the CGM is marginal. As a result, the present-day Auriga galaxies overall have higher specific angular momenta.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of embedded clusters in ATLASGAL clumps with HII regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the optimal sampling model, we synthesized the embedded clusters of ATLASGAL clumps with HII regions (HII-clumps). The 0.1 Myr isochrone was used to estimate the bolometric luminosity of each star in an embedded cluster, we also added the accretion luminosity of each star in the embeded cluster. The total bolometric luminosity of synthetic embedded clusters can well fit the observed bolometric luminosity of HII-clumps. More realistically, we considered the age spread in the young star and protostar populations in embedded clusters of HII-clumps by modeling both constant and time-varying star formation histories (SFHs). According to the age distribution of the stellar population, we distributed the appropriate isochrones to each star, and sorted out the fraction of stellar objects that are still protostars (Class 0 and Class I phases) to properly add their accretion luminosities. Compared to a constant SFH, burst-like and time-dependent SFHs can better fit the observational data. We found that as long as 20\% of the stars within the embedded cluster are still accreting, the contribution of accretion luminosity will be significant to the total bolometric luminosity of low-mass HII-clumps with mass log$_{10}$(M$_{\rm cl}$/M$_{\odot}$) $&lt;$ 2.8. Variations in the accretion rate, the SFE and the initial mass function (IMF) and more physical processes like the external heating from HII regions and the flaring from pre-main sequence (PMS) stars and protostars need to be investigated to further explain the excess luminosity of low-mass HII-clumps.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of the Star-formation in a Tidally Disturbed Disk galaxy: NGC 3718</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a UV, optical and near-infrared (near-IR) study of the star-forming complexes in the nearby peculiar galaxy NGC 3718, using UVIT, GALEX, Spitzer and DECaLS imaging data. The galaxy has a disturbed optical morphology due to the multiple tidal arms, the warped disk and the prominent curved dust lanes, but in the near-IR, it appears to be a bulge-dominated galaxy. Its disturbed morphology makes it an excellent case to study star formation in a tidally disturbed galaxy that may have undergone a recent minor merger. To study the distribution and properties of the star-forming clumps (SFCs), we divided the galaxy within the R$_{25}$ (B band) radius into three parts --the upper, central and lower regions. Using the UV band images, we investigated the warped star-forming disk, the extended tidal arms, and the distribution and sizes of the 182 SFCs. Their distribution is 49, 60 and 73 in the galaxy's upper, central and lower regions, respectively. We determined the UV color, star-formation rates (SFRs), star-formation density ($\Sigma_{SFR}$) and ages of the SFCs.The central disk of the galaxy has a larger mean $\Sigma_{SFR}$ which is $\sim$3.3 and $\sim$1.6 times higher than the upper and lower regions, respectively. We also find that the SFCs in the central disk are older than those in the tidal arms. Our study thus shows that minor mergers can trigger the inside-out growth of galaxy disks, where the younger SFCs are in outer tidal arms and not in the inner disk.</description>

      <title>Warps induced by satellites on barred and non-barred galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Warps are common vertical asymmetries that appear in the outer parts of the galactic discs, bending one part upwards and the other downwards. Many mechanisms can trigger warp formation, including tidal interactions. The interactions with satellites distort the edges of the disc and can also change the central morphology, impacting, for example, the development of a galactic bar. In mergers events, the bar can be weakened or even destroyed. In this study, we aim to compare barred and non-barred galaxy models and their susceptibility to warping. To analyze the effects of induced warps, we used $N$-body simulations of a barred and a non-barred central galaxy interacting with satellites of varying masses ($0.1 \times 10^{10} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, $0.5 \times 10^{10} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and $1 \times 10^{10} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) and initial orbital radii (10, 20 and 30 kpc). We also ran isolated simulations of the central galaxies for comparison. We found that the induced warps are stronger in the barred galaxy compared with the non-barred galaxy, in perturbed and isolated models. In addition, the masses of the satellites determine the level of destruction of the bar and the intensity of the induced warp. The time in which the bar will be weakened or destroyed depends on the orbital radius of the satellite.</description>

      <title>Detection of the [O I] 63 $\mu$m emission line from the $z = 6.04$ quasar J2054-0005</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the highest-redshift detection of [O I] 63 $\mu$m from a luminous quasar, J2054-0005, at $z=6.04$ based on the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array Band 9 observations. The [O I] 63 $\mu$m line luminosity is $(4.5\pm1.5) \times 10^{9}~L_{\rm \odot}$, corresponding to the [O I] 63 $\mu$m-to-far-infrared luminosity ratio of $\approx 6.7\times10^{-4}$, which is consistent with the value obtained in the local universe. Remarkably, [O I] 63 $\mu$m is as bright as [C II] 158 $\mu$m, resulting in the [O I]-to-[C II] line luminosity ratio of $1.3\pm0.5$. Based on a careful comparison of the luminosity ratios of [O I] 63 $\mu$m, [C II] 158 $\mu$m, and dust continuum emission to models of photo-dissociation regions, we find that J2054-0005 has a gas density log($n_{\rm H}$/cm$^{-3}$)$=3.7\pm0.3$ and an incident far-ultraviolet radiation field of log($G/G_{\rm 0}$)$= 3.0\pm0.1$, showing that [O I] 63 $\mu$m serves as an important coolant of the dense and warm gas in J2054-0005. A close examination of the [O I] and [C II] line profiles suggests that the [O I] line may be partially self-absorbed, however deeper observations are needed to verify this conclusion. Regardless, the gas density and incident radiation field are in a broad agreement with the values obtained in nearby star-forming galaxies and objects with [O I] 63 $\mu$m observations at $z=1-3$ with the Herschel Space Observatory. These results demonstrate the power of ALMA high-frequency observations targeting [O I] 63 $\mu$m to examine the properties of photo-dissociation regions in high-redshift galaxies.</description>

Abstract: We present morphological classifications based on Galaxy Zoo analysis of 71,052 galaxies with imaging from the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS). Galaxies were selected out of the Galaxy Zoo 2 (GZ2) sample, so also have gri imaging from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. An identical classification tree, and vote weighting/aggregation was applied to both UKIDSS and GZ2 classifications enabling direct comparisons. With this Research Note we provide a public release of the GZ:UKIDSS morphologies and discuss some initial comparisons with GZ2.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Ray Cooling in Active Galactic Nuclei as a New Probe of Inelastic Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel way to probe inelastic dark matter using cosmic-ray (CR) cooling in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Dark matter (DM) in the vicinity of supermassive black holes may scatter off CRs, resulting in the rapid cooling of CRs for sufficiently large cross sections. This in turn can alter the high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray fluxes detected from these sources. We show that AGN cooling bounds obtained through the multimessenger data of NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056 allow to reach unprecedently large mass splittings for inelastic DM ($\gtrsim$ TeV), orders of magnitude larger than those probed by direct detection experiments and DM capture in neutron stars. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cooling bounds from AGNs can probe thermal light DM with small mass splittings. This provides novel and complementary constraints in parts of a parameter space accessible solely by colliders and beam dump experiments.</description>

      <title>Testing the sources of the peculiar abundances in globular clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to analyze some of the polluters proposed in the self-enrichment scenarios put forward to explain the multiple populations in globular clusters (GCs), extending previous studies. Three scenarios with different polluter stars were tested: asymptotic giant branch stars, high-mass interacting binaries, and fast rotating massive stars. With abundance data available from the APOGEE survey and $\Delta Y$ estimates from precise HST photometry, twenty-six clusters were studied. We also included the study of the abundances of N, C, Mg and Al, extending previous studies that focused mainly on the abundances of He, O and Na. In addition, we constructed an empirical model to test whether one could explain the chemical signatures of the 'enriched' population of GC stars with a fixed source and dilution process based on empirical data. In agreement with work by other authors, we found that the proposed polluters can generally predict the qualitative abundance patterns in GC stars and in some cases quantitatively predict some elements, but in most cases when we compare the model yields with the observations, we find that they can not explain the entire set of observed abundance patterns. The empirical model succeeds in reproducing the abundances of Al for a given $\Delta Y$ (and vice versa), showing that there is a direct relationship between Al and He, with one increasing proportionally to the other. However, the empirical model fails to reproduce the observed abundances of Na and N, in agreement with the results of previous works. The observed decoupling between the maximum abundances of CNO-cycle elements like N and Na with those of Al and He provides new information and constraints for future models and could take us a step closer to understanding the origin of the peculiar abundance variations of globular cluster stars.</description>

      <title>Investigating the mixing between two black hole populations in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA GWTC-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a population model to analyze the mixing between hypothesised power-law and $\sim 35 M_\odot$ Gaussian bump black hole populations in the latest gravitational wave catalog, GWTC-3, estimating their co-location and separation. We find a relatively low level of mixing, $3.1^{+5.0}_{-3.1}\%$, between the power-law and Gaussian populations, compared to the percentage of mergers containing two Gaussian bump black holes, $5.0^{+3.2}_{-1.7}\%$. Our analysis indicates that black holes within the Gaussian bump are generally separate from the power-law population, with only a minor fraction engaging in mixing and contributing to the $\mathcal{M} \sim 14 M_\odot$ peak in the chirp mass. This leads us to identify a distinct population of Binary Gaussian Black Holes (BGBHs) that arise from mergers within the Gaussian bump. We suggest that current theories for the formation of the massive $35 M_\odot$ Gaussian bump population may need to reevaluate the underlying mechanisms that drive the preference for BGBHs.</description>

      <title>On the Formation of Planets in the Milky Way's Thick Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanet demographic surveys have revealed that close-in (${\lesssim}$1 au) small planets orbiting stars in the Milky Way's thick disk are ${\sim}50\%$ less abundant than those orbiting stars in the Galactic thin disk. One key difference between the two stellar populations is the time at which they emerged: thick disk stars are the likely product of cosmic noon (redshift $z {\sim}2$), an era characterized by high star formation rate, massive and dense molecular clouds, and strong supersonic turbulence. Solving for the background radiation field in these early star-forming regions, we demonstrate that protoplanetary disks at cosmic noon experienced radiation fields up to ${\sim}7$ orders of magnitude more intense than in solar neighborhood conditions. Coupling the radiation field to a one-dimensional protoplanetary disk evolution model, we find that external UV photoevaporation destroys protoplanetary disks in just ${\sim}$0.2--0.5 Myr, limiting the timescale over which planets can assemble. Disk temperatures exceed the sublimation temperatures of common volatile species for ${\gtrsim}$Myr timescales, predicting more spatial homogeneity in gas chemical composition. Our calculations imply that the deficit in planet occurrence around thick disk stars should be even more pronounced for giant planets, particularly those at wide orbital separations, predicting a higher rocky-to-giant planet ratio in the Galactic thick disk vs.~thin disk.</description>

      <title>Revised LOFAR upper limits on the 21-cm signal power spectrum at $\mathbf{z\approx9.1}$ using Machine Learning and Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for foregrounds mitigation in data collected by the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) to measure the high-redshift 21-cm signal power spectrum has been shown to have issues of signal loss when the 21-cm signal covariance is misestimated. To address this problem, we have recently introduced covariance kernels obtained by using a Machine Learning based Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) algorithm in combination with simulations of the 21-cm signal. In this work, we apply this framework to 141 hours ($\approx 10$ nights) of LOFAR data at $z \approx 9.1$, and report revised upper limits of the 21-cm signal power spectrum. Overall, we agree with past results reporting a 2-$\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta^2_{21} &lt; (80)^2~\rm mK^2$ at $k = 0.075~h~\rm Mpc^{-1}$. Further, the VAE-based kernel has a smaller correlation with the systematic excess noise, and the overall GPR-based approach is shown to be a good model for the data. Assuming an accurate bias correction for the excess noise, we report a 2-$\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta^2_{21} &lt; (25)^2~\rm mK^2$ at $k = 0.075~h~\rm Mpc^{-1}$. However, we still caution to take the more conservative approach to jointly report the upper limits of the excess noise and the 21-cm signal components.</description>

      <title>Eight New Substellar Hyades Candidates from the UKIRT Hemisphere Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have used the UKIRT Hemisphere Survey (UHS) combined with the UKIDSS Galactic Cluster Survey (GCS), the UKIDSS Galactic Plane Survey (GPS), and the CatWISE2020 catalog to search for new substellar members of the nearest open cluster to the Sun, the Hyades. Eight new substellar Hyades candidate members were identified and observed with the Gemini/GNIRS near-infrared spectrograph. All eight objects are confirmed as brown dwarfs with spectral types ranging from L6 to T5, with two objects showing signs of spectral binarity and/or variability. A kinematic analysis demonstrates that all eight new discoveries likely belong to the Hyades cluster, with future radial velocity and parallax measurements needed to confirm their membership. CWISE J042356.23$+$130414.3, with a spectral type of T5, would be the coldest ($T_{\rm eff}$$\approx$1100 K) and lowest-mass ($M$$\approx$30 $M_{\rm Jup}$) free-floating member of the Hyades yet discovered. We further find that high-probability substellar Hyades members from this work and previous studies have redder near-infrared colors than field-age brown dwarfs, potentially due to lower surface gravities and super-solar metallicities.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Fields in Massive Star-forming Regions (MagMaR) IV: Tracing the Magnetic Fields in the O-type protostellar system IRAS 16547$-$4247</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of the massive stars, and in particular, the role that the magnetic fields play in their early evolutionary phase is still far from being completely understood. Here, we present Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.2 mm full polarized continuum, and H$^{13}$CO$^+$(3$-$2), CS(5$-$4), and HN$^{13}$C(3$-$2) line observations with a high angular resolution ($\sim$0.4$''$ or 1100 au). In the 1.2 mm continuum emission, we reveal a dusty envelope surrounding the massive protostars, IRAS16547-E and IRAS16547-W, with dimensions of $\sim$10,000 au. This envelope has a bi-conical structure likely carved by the powerful thermal radio jet present in region. The magnetic fields vectors follow very-well the bi-conical envelope. The polarization fraction is $\sim$2.0\% in this region. Some of these vectors seem to converge to IRAS 16547-E, and IRAS 16547-W, the most massive protostars. Moreover, the velocity fields revealed from the spectral lines H$^{13}$CO$^+$(3$-$2), and HN$^{13}$C(3$-$2) show velocity gradients with a good correspondence with the magnetic fields, that maybe are tracing the cavities of molecular outflows or maybe in some parts infall. We derived a magnetic field strength in some filamentary regions that goes from 2 to 6.1\,mG. We also find that the CS(5$-$4) molecular line emission reveals multiple outflow cavities or bow-shocks with different orientations, some of which seem to follow the NW-SE radio thermal jet.</description>

      <title>The hot circumgalactic medium in the eROSITA All-Sky Survey I. X-ray surface brightness profiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17308v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) provides the material needed for galaxy formation and influences galaxy evolution. The hot ($T&gt;10^6K$) CGM is poorly detected around galaxies with stellar masses ($M_*$) lower than $3\times10^{11}M_\odot$ due to the low surface brightness. We used the X-ray data from the first four SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Surveys (eRASS:4). Based on the SDSS spectroscopic survey and halo-based group finder algorithm, we selected central galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts of $z_{\rm spec}&lt;0.2$ and stellar masses of $10.0&lt;\log(M_*/M_\odot)&lt;11.5$ (85,222 galaxies) -- or halo masses of $11.5&lt;\log(M_{\rm 200m}/M_\odot)&lt;14.0$ (125,512 galaxies). By stacking the X-ray emission around galaxies, masking the detected X-ray point sources and carefully modeling the X-ray emission from the unresolved active galactic nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries (XRB), we obtain the X-ray emission from the hot CGM. We detected the X-ray emission around MW-mass and more massive central galaxies extending up to the virial radius ($R_{\rm vir}$). We used a $\beta$ model to describe the X-ray surface brightness profile and found $\beta =0.43^{+0.10}_{-0.06}\,(0.37^{+0.04}_{-0.02})$ for MW-mass (M31-mass) galaxies.We estimated the baryon budget of the hot CGM and obtained a value that is lower than the prediction of $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, indicating significant gas depletion in these halos. We extrapolated the hot CGM profile measured within $R_{\rm vir}$ to larger radii and found that within $\approx 3 R_{\rm vir}$, the baryon budget is close to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology prediction. Our results set a firm footing for the presence of the hot CGM around such galaxies. These measurements constitute a new benchmark for galaxy evolution models and possible implementations of feedback processes therein.</description>

      <title>The hot circumgalactic medium in the eROSITA All-Sky Survey II. Scaling relations between X-ray luminosity and galaxies' mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how the properties of galaxies relate to the properties of the hot circum-galactic medium (CGM) around them can constrain galaxy evolution models. We measured the X-ray luminosity of the hot CGM based on the surface brightness profiles of central galaxy samples measured from Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG)/eROSITA all-sky survey data. We related the X-ray luminosity to the galaxies' stellar and halo mass, and we compared the observed relations to the self-similar model and intrinsic (i.e., not forward-modeled) output of the IllustrisTNG, EAGLE, and SIMBA simulations. The average hot CGM X-ray luminosity ($L_{\rm X,CGM}$) correlates with the galaxy's stellar mass ($M_*$). It increases from $(1.6 \pm 2.1)\times10^{39} \rm erg\,s^{-1}$ to $(3.4 \pm 0.3)\times10^{41} \rm erg\,s^{-1}$, when $\log(M_*)$ increases from 10.0 to 11.5. A power law describes the correlation as $\log(L_{\rm X,CGM})= (2.4\pm 0.1)\times \log(M_*)+(14.6\pm1.5)$. The hot CGM X-ray luminosity as a function of halo mass is measured within $\log(M_{\rm 500c})=11.3-13.7$, extending our knowledge of the scaling relation by more than two orders of magnitude. $L_{\rm X,CGM}$ increases with $M_{\rm 500c}$ from $(3.0 \pm 1.6)\times10^{39}\ \rm erg\,s^{-1}$ at $\log(M_{\rm 500c})=11.3$ to $(1.3 \pm 0.1)\times10^{42}\ \rm erg\,s^{-1}$ at $\log(M_{\rm 500c})=13.7$. The relation follows a power law of $\log(L_{\rm X,CGM})= (1.32\pm 0.05)\times \log(M_{\rm 500c})+(24.1\pm0.7)$. Our observations highlight the necessity of non-gravitational processes at the galaxy group scale while suggesting these processes are sub-dominant at the galaxy scale. We show that the outputs of current cosmological galaxy simulations generally align with the observational results uncovered here but with possibly important deviations in selected mass ranges.</description>

      <title>Open Cluster Dynamics under the Influence of Outflow-Ambient Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Outflowing stars impinging upon ambient gas experience accelerations due to the gravitational feedback from the interaction morphology between the outflow and the ambient gas. Such ``negative dynamical friction'' (NDF), in contrast to the conventional ``dynamical friction'' (DF), is studied for its impact on the dynamics of open clusters (OCs) immersed in a uniform ambient gas. We modify the $N$-body integration code \rebound with both NDF and DF implemented according to the outflow conditions of each star in a consistently constructed OC. The evolution of stars is also involved in determining the gas-star interactions throughout their stellar lives. Compared to DF-only and gas-free models with identical initial conditions, the NDF-affected cluster is puffier and evaporates faster, as indicated by various diagnostics, including lower velocity dispersions and larger half-mass and half-light radii. Neutron stars with fast winds are expelled from the cluster due to their intensive NDF effect, even without the ``kicks'' by asymmetric supernovae. Exploration of parameter space confirms that the NDF effect is generally enhanced with higher ambient gas densities, in qualitatively agreement with the expression of acceleration. Outflow-ambient interactions should be considered for the proper interpretation of the stellar dynamics evolution in clusters.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Positive AGN Feedback on the Properties of Galaxies in a Semi-Analytic Model of Galaxy Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the state-of-the-art semi-analytic model {\small FEGA} (Formation and Evolution of GAlaxies), which incorporates updated prescriptions for key physical processes in galaxy formation. Notably, {\small FEGA} features an unprecedented semi-analytic modeling of positive Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback. The model combines the latest prescriptions for gas infall and cooling, a revised star formation recipe that incorporates the extended Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, disk instability, updated supernovae feedback, reincorporation of ejected gas, hot gas stripping from satellite galaxies, and the formation of diffuse light. A novel description of AGN feedback is introduced, describing the positive mode as a burst of star formation from a cooling gas fraction. {\small FEGA} is rigorously calibrated using an MCMC procedure to match the evolution of the stellar mass function from high redshift to the present. Subsequently, the model is tested against several observed and predicted scaling relations, including the star formation rate-mass, black hole-bulge and stellar mass, stellar-to-halo mass, and red fraction-mass relations. Additionally, we test {\small FEGA} against other galaxy properties such as the distribution of specific star formation rates, stellar metallicity and morphology. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of positive AGN feedback can co-exist with its negative counterpart without drastic alterations to other prescriptions. Importantly, this inclusion improves the ability of the model to describe the primary scaling relations observed in galaxies.</description>

      <title>The red giant branch tip in the SDSS, PS1, JWST, NGRST and Euclid photometric systems. Calibration in optical passbands using Gaia DR3 synthetic photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use synthetic photometry from Gaia DR3 BP and RP spectra for a large selected sample of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) to derive the magnitude of the Red Giant Branch (RGB) tip for these two galaxies in several passbands in various widely used optical photometric systems, including those of space missions that have not yet started operations. The RGB tip is estimated by fitting a well-motivated model to the RGB luminosity function (LF) within a fully Bayesian framework, allowing for a proper representation of the uncertainties of all the involved parameters and their correlations. Adopting the best available distance and interstellar extinction estimates we provide a calibration of the RGB tip as a standard candle for the following passbands: Johnson-Kron-Cousins I (mainly used for validation purposes), Hubble Space Telescope F814W, Sloan Digital Sky Survey i and z, PanSTARRS1 y, James Webb Space Telescope F090W, Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Z087, and Euclid I$_E$, with an accuracy of a few per cent, depending on the case. The trend of the absolute magnitude of the tip as a function of colour in the different passbands, beyond the range spanned by the LMC and SMC, as well as its dependency on age, is explored by means of theoretical models. These calibrations can be very helpful to obtain state-of-the-art RGB tip distance estimates to stellar systems in a very large range of distances directly from data in the natural photometric system of these surveys and/or missions, without recurring to photometric transformations.

Abstract: We present the galaxy stellar mass - size relation in the rest-frame near-IR ($1.5~\mu{\text{m}}$) and its evolution with redshift up to $z=2.5$. S\'ersic profiles are measured for $\sim$ $26\,000$ galaxies with stellar masses $M_\star &gt; 10^9~{\text{M}}_\odot$ from JWST/NIRCam F277W and F444W imaging provided by the COSMOS-WEB and PRIMER surveys, using coordinates, redshifts, colors and stellar mass estimates from the COSMOS2020 catalog. The new rest-frame near-IR effective radii are generally smaller than previously measured rest-frame optical sizes, on average by 0.14~dex, with no significant dependence on redshift. For quiescent galaxies this size offset does not depend on stellar mass, but for star-forming galaxies the offset increases from -0.1~dex at $M_\star = 10^{9.5}~{\text{M}}_\odot$ to -0.25~dex at $M_\star &gt; 10^{11}~{\text{M}}_\odot$. That is, we find that the near-IR stellar mass - size relation for star-forming galaxies is flatter in the rest-frame near-IR than in the rest-frame optical at all redshifts $0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5$. The general pace of size evolution is the same in the near-IR as previously demonstrated in the optical, with slower evolution ($R_{\text{e}} \propto (1+z)^{-0.7}$) for $L^*$~star-forming galaxies and faster evolution ($R_{\text{e}} \propto (1+z)^{-1.3}$) for $L^*$~quiescent galaxies. Massive ($M_\star&gt;10^{11}~{\text{M}}_\odot$) star-forming galaxies evolve in size almost as fast as quiescent galaxies. Low-mass ($M_\star&lt;10^{10}~{\text{M}}_\odot$)~quiescent galaxies evolve as slow as star-forming galaxies. Our main conclusion is that the size evolution narrative as it has emerged over the past two decades does not radically change when accessing with JWST the rest-frame near-IR, a better proxy of the underlying stellar mass distribution.</description>

      <title>What halts the growth of galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11127v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gas reservoir of galaxies can be altered by outflows driven by star-formation and luminous active galactic nuclei. Jets heating the surroundings of host galaxies can also prevent gas cooling and inflows. Spectacular examples for these three mass displacement channels have been observed, but their importance in transforming the galaxy population depends on the occurrence rates of outflow triggers. We aim to investigate the absolute and relative importance of these three channels. In an observation-driven approach, we combine distribution functions and scaling relations to empirically compare average outflow rates across the galaxy total stellar mass spectrum and across cosmic time. This hinges on local outflow studies which should be extended to systematic, large and diverse samples, and we do not yet consider a halo heating effect by radiation-driven outflows. Our results show, independent of simulations, the dominance of star formation-driven outflows in low-mass galaxies. Massive galaxies today are predominately prevented from growing further by jet heating, while at $z=1-3$ all three processes are approximately similarly important. Over the full mass spectrum and cosmic history, outflows driven by the radiation from active galactic nuclei is never the dominant process.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Cosmic Chemistry: Revisiting the Mass-Metallicity Relation with JWST/NIRSpec at 4 &lt; z &lt; 10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present star formation rates (SFR), the mass-metallicity relation (MZR), and the SFR-dependent MZR across redshifts 4 to 10 using 81 star-forming galaxies observed by the JWST NIRSpec employing both low-resolution PRISM and medium-resolution gratings, including galaxies from the JADES GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields, the JWST-PRIMAL Legacy Survey, and additional galaxies from the literature in Abell 2744, SMACS-0723, RXJ2129, BDF, COSMOS, and MACS1149 fields. These galaxies span a 3 dex stellar mass range of $10^7 &lt; M_{\ast}/M_{\odot} &lt; 10^{10}$, with an average SFR of $7.2 \pm 1.2 M_{\odot} {\rm yr}^{-1}$ and an average metallicity of $12+{\rm log(O/H)} = 7.91 \pm 0.08$. Our findings align with previous observations up to $z=8$ for the MZR and indicate no deviation from local universe FMR up to this redshift. Beyond $z=8$, we observe a significant deviation $\sim 0.27$ dex) in FMR, consistent with recent JWST findings. We also integrate CEERS (135 galaxies) and JADES (47 galaxies) samples with our data to study metallicity evolution with redshift in a combined sample of 263 galaxies, revealing a decreasing metallicity trend with a slope of $0.067 \pm 0.013$, consistent with IllustrisTNG and EAGLE, but contradicts with FIRE simulations. We introduce an empirical mass-metallicity-redshift (MZ-$z$ relation): $12+{\rm log(O/H)}=6.29 + 0.237 \times{\rm log}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}) - 0.06 \times (1+z)$, which accurately reproduces the observed trends in metallicity with both redshift and stellar mass. This trend underscores the ``Grand Challenge'' in understanding the factors driving high-redshift galactic metallicity trends, such as inflow, outflow, and AGN/stellar feedback -- and emphasizes the need for further investigations with larger samples and enhanced simulations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical formation of black hole binaries in dense star clusters: Rapid cluster evolution code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.10055v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave observations have just started probing the properties of black hole binary merger populations. The observation of binaries with very massive black holes and significantly asymmetric masses motivates the study of dense star clusters as astrophysical environments which can produce such events dynamically. In this paper we present Rapster (for "Rapid cluster evolution"), a new code designed to rapidly model binary black hole population synthesis and the evolution of massive star clusters based on simple, yet realistic prescriptions. We also perform a thorough comparison with the Cluster Monte Carlo code and find generally good agreement. The code can be used to generate large populations of dynamically formed binary black holes.</description>

      <title>Turbocharging constraints on dark matter substructure through a synthesis of strong lensing flux ratios and extended lensed arcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03253v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing provides a purely gravitational means to infer properties of dark matter halos and thereby constrain the particle nature of dark matter. Strong lenses sometimes appear as four lensed images of a background quasar accompanied by spatially-resolved emission from the quasar host galaxy encircling the main deflector (lensed arcs). We present methodology to simultaneously reconstruct lensed arcs and relative image magnifications (flux ratios) in the presence of full populations of subhalos and line-of-sight halos. To this end, we develop a new approach for multi-plane ray tracing that accelerates lens mass and source light reconstruction by factors of $\sim 100-1000$. Using simulated data, we show that simultaneous reconstruction of lensed arcs and flux ratios isolates small-scale perturbations to flux ratios by dark matter substructure from uncertainties associated with the main deflector mass profile on larger angular scales. Relative to analyses that use only image positions and flux ratios to constrain the lens model, incorporating arcs strengthens likelihood ratios penalizing warm dark matter (WDM) with a suppression scale $m_{\rm{hm}} / M_{\odot}$ in the range $\left[10^7 - 10^{7.5}\right]$, $\left[10^{7.5} - 10^{8}\right]$, $\left[10^8 - 10^{8.5}\right]$, $\left[10^{8.5} - 10^{9}\right]$ by factors of $1.3$, $2.5$, $5.6$, and $13.1$, respectively, for a cold dark matter (CDM) ground truth. The $95\%$ exclusion limit improves by 0.5 dex in $\log_{10} m_{\rm{hm}}$. The enhanced sensitivity to low-mass halos enabled by these methods pushes the observational frontier of substructure lensing to the threshold of galaxy formation, enabling stringent tests of any theory that alters the properties of dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>The 21-cm signal during the end stages of reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the epoch of reionization (EoR), the 21-cm signal allows direct observation of the neutral hydrogen (HI) in the intergalactic medium (IGM). In the post-reionization era, this signal instead probes HI in galaxies, which traces the dark matter density distribution. With new numerical simulations, we investigated the end stages of reionization to elucidate the transition of our Universe into the post-reionization era. Our models are consistent with the latest high-redshift measurements, including ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions \RefereeReport{up to redshift $\simeq$8}. Notably, these models consistently reproduced the evolution of the UV photon background, which is constrained from Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption spectra. We studied the dependence of this background on the nature of photon sinks in the IGM, requiring mean free path of UV photons to be $\sim$10 comoving-megaparsecs (cMpc) during the EoR that increases gradually with time during late stages ($z\lesssim 6$). Our models revealed that the reionization of the IGM transitioned from an \textit{inside-out} to an \textit{outside-in} process when the Universe is less than 0.01 per cent neutral. During this epoch, the 21-cm signal also shifted from probing predominantly the HI in the IGM to that in galaxies. Furthermore, we identified a statistically significant number of large neutral islands (with sizes up to 40 cMpc) persisting until very late stages ($5 \lesssim z \lesssim 6$) that can imprint features in Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption spectra and also produce a knee-like feature in the 21-cm power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Identifying Halos in Cosmological Simulations with Continuous Wavelet Analysis: The 2D Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous wavelet analysis is gaining popularity in science and engineering for its ability to analyze data across spatial and scale domains simultaneously. In this study, we introduce a wavelet-based method to identify halos and assess its feasibility in two-dimensional (2D) scenarios. We begin with the generation of four pseudo-2D datasets from the SIMBA dark matter simulation by compressing thin slices of three-dimensional (3D) data into 2D. We then calculate the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) directly from the particle distributions, identify local maxima that represent actual halos, and segment the CWT to delineate halo boundaries. A comparison with the traditional friends-of-friends (FOF) method shows that our CWT-identified halos, while contain slightly fewer particles, have smoother boundaries and are more compact in dense regions. In contrast, the CWT method can link particles over greater distances to form halos in sparse regions due to its spatial segmentation scheme. The spatial distribution and halo power spectrum of both CWT and FOF halos demonstrate substantial consistency, validating the 2D applicability of CWT for halo detection. Our identification scheme operates with a linear time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$, suggesting its suitability for analyzing significantly larger datasets in the future.</description>

      <title>Primeval very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs -- VIII. The first age benchmark L subdwarf, a wide companion to a halo white dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19219v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of five white dwarf + ultracool dwarf systems identified as common proper motion wide binaries in the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars. The discoveries include a white dwarf + L subdwarf binary, VVV 1256-62AB, a gravitationally bound system located 75.6(+1.9/-1.8) pc away with a projected separation of 1375(+35/-33) au. The primary is a cool DC white dwarf with a hydrogen dominated atmosphere, and has a total age of 10.5(+3.3/-2.1) Gyr, based on white dwarf model fitting. The secondary is an L subdwarf with a metallicity of [M/H] = -0.72(+0.08/-0.10) (i.e. [Fe/H] = -0.81+/-0.10) and Teff = 2298(+45/-43) K based on atmospheric model fitting of its optical to near infrared spectrum, and likely has a mass just above the stellar/substellar boundary. The sub-solar metallicity of the L subdwarf and the system's total space velocity of 406 km/s indicates membership in the Galactic halo, and it has a flat eccentric Galactic orbit passing within 1~kpc of the centre of the Milky Way every ~0.4Gyr and extending to 15-31 kpc at apogal. VVV 1256-62B is the first L subdwarf to have a well-constrained age, making it an ideal benchmark of metal-poor ultracool dwarf atmospheres and evolution.</description>
