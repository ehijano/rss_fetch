      <title>About possibility to observe spin dichroism effect (the effect of tensor polarization acquiring) for the effect of tensor polarization acquiring by a nonpolarized deuteron beam passing through the nonpolarized internal target of Nuclotron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deuteron passage through a nonpolarized target is accompanied by birefringence effect which reveals as diverse phenomena, namely: rotation of spin and tensor polarization about the momentum direction, spin oscillations, vector polarization conversion to tensor that and vice versa, spin dichroism. Possibility to study deuteron spin dichroism effect i.e. the effect of tensor polarization acquiring by a nonpolarized deuteron beam moving in NuclotronM and passing through its internal target is discussed.</description>

      <title>HFBTHO-AD: Differentiation of a nuclear energy density functional code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The HFBTHO code implements a nuclear energy density functional solver to model the structure of atomic nuclei. HFBTHO has previously been used to calibrate energy functionals and perform sensitivity analysis by using derivative-free methods. To enable derivative-based optimization and uncertainty quantification approaches, we must compute the derivatives of HFBTHO outputs with respect to the parameters of the energy functional, which are a subset of all input parameters of the code. We use the algorithmic/automatic differentiation (AD) tool Tapenade to differentiate HFBTHO. We compare the derivatives obtained using AD against finite-difference approximation and examine the performance of the derivative computation.</description>

      <title>Cluster breaking and reconfiguration effects in 12 Lambda B hypernucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cluster-breaking effect and spatial distribution of negative-parity states in the 12 Lambda B hypernucleus using the Hyper-Brink model with cluster-breaking(CB-Hyper-Brink) optimized via Control Neural Network (Ctrl.NN). The results demonstrate that the inclusion of cluster-breaking is essential for accurately reproducing the observed low-lying energy levels and for making reliable predictions of the Hoyle-analog state 1-4 in 12 Lambda B. Cluster-breaking manifests as strong spin-orbit correlations and the dissolution of ideal cluster configurations, as revealed by the analysis of one-body spin-orbit operator expectation values and the spatial overlap with projected cluster bases. The interplay between short-range repulsion and intermediate-range attraction in the Lambda N interaction induces the cluster reconfiguration effect, which is characterized by the coexistence of Lambda-alpha and Lambda-triton correlations; this reconfiguration effect leads to a modest stabilization and shrinkage of cluster structures. The variation in electric quadrupole transition strengths, B(E2), between the ground and Hoyle-analog states serves as a sensitive probe for the degree of cluster-breaking, providing direct evidence for its physical relevance. These findings highlight the crucial role of cluster-breaking in characterizing the hypernuclear structure and offer a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between clustering and shell-model dynamics in hypernuclei.</description>

      <title>From Hyperons to Hypernuclei: A New Route to Unravel Proton Spin Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12193v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions create the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) known as the hottest, least viscous, and most vortical fluid ever produced in terrestrial laboratories. Its vortical structure has been uncovered through the spin polarization of Lambda ($\Lambda$) hyperons, attributed to the spin-orbit coupling that transfers the system's orbital angular momentum to the quark spin, which is then inherited by hadrons via quark recombination or coalescence. However, $\Lambda$ polarization reflects primarily the strange-quark component, leaving the spin dynamics of the up and down quarks largely unexplored. Although the proton is an ideal probe, its stability makes direct measurements experimentally challenging. Here, we propose to reveal proton spin polarization via hypertriton ($^3_\Lambda \text{H}$) measurements, exploiting the fact that spin information is preserved when polarized nucleons and $\Lambda$ coalesce to form hypertriton. We show that, over a broad range of collision energies, the polarizations of proton, $\Lambda$, and hypertriton are related by a simple linear scaling law. Since both $\Lambda$ and hypertriton polarizations can be measured via their self-analyzing weak decays, this linear relation provides a practical experimental avenue for accessing spin polarizations of protons and neutrons-the dominant baryonic degrees of freedom in nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>Candidates for three-quasiparticle $K$-isomers in even-odd Fm-Cn nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following our study of possible $K$-isomers in odd-even Md-Rg nuclei, here we continue with searching for three-quasiparticle 1$\nu$2$\pi$ and 3$\nu$ isomer candidates in even-odd Fm - Cn nuclei. We use the same approach to calculate energies of different nuclear configurations using a microscopic-macroscopic model with the Woods-Saxon potential. We used two versions of pairing: quasi-particle BCS method and particle number projection formalism. The optimal deformations for both ground states and high-$K$ configurations are determined through a four-dimensional energy minimization process. We point out the most promising candidates for high-$K$ isomers and compare them, where possible, with existing experimental data.</description>

      <title>The NN$\Omega_{ccc}$ Bound-States with the HAL QCD interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Newly, first-principles lattice QCD results at the physical pion mass, $ m_\pi \backsimeq 137.1 $ MeV, have been reported by the HAL QCD Collaboration for the S-wave interaction between the nucleon (N) and the triply charmed Omega baryon ($\Omega_{ccc}$). The N$\Omega_{ccc}$ potentials in the spin-1 $ \left(^{3}S_{1}\right) $ and spin-2 $ \left(^{5}S_{2}\right) $ channels were derived and found to be attractive, though no bound state was supported in these channels. It is shown that, when the spin-1 and spin-2 N$\Omega_{ccc}$ channels are combined with the realistic NN Malfliet-Tjon (MT) potential in the $ ^{3}S_{1} $ channel, bound states of deuteron (d)-$\Omega_{ccc}$ are generated with binding energies near 1.3 MeV and 1.2 MeV for the states with quantum numbers $(I)J^{\pi} = (0)1/2^{+}$ and $(0)5/2^{+}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dipole moments adjacent to doubly-magic nuclei in self-consistent mean-field theory with realistic spin-isospin and tensor forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic dipole ($M1$) moments in nuclei neighboring the doubly-magic core
  are investigated by the self-consistent mean-field (SCMF) approaches
  allowing the breaking of the time-reversal symmetry.
  By the SCMF calculations with the M3Y-P6 interaction,
  which keeps realistic spin-isospin and tensor channels,
  the $M1$ moments are well reproduced,
  particularly those in the nuclei adjacent to $jj$-closed magicity.
  The results are in better agreement with the data
  than those with the Gogny-D1S interaction,
  slightly better than those of UNEDF1
  supplemented by a spin-isospin channel adjusted
  to the $M1$ moments themselves,
  and comparable to the shell-model results
  with the chiral effective-field-theory ($\chi$EFT) interaction.
  Analyses via the quadrupole moments, occupation numbers
  and the lowest-order perturbation theory
  elucidate cooperative effects of quadrupole deformation
  and spin correlation on the displacement from the Schmidt values,
  which has been known in terms of the quenching of the spin matrix elements.
  It is shown that a significant portion of the spin correlation is carried
  by the spin-isospin and tensor channels in the effective interaction.
  However, while agreement is remarkable at $^{131}$Sn$^m$, $^{133}$Sn
  and $^{209}$Pb,
  discrepancies remain at the $Z=\mathrm{odd}$ nuclei
  $^{133}$Sb, $^{207}$Ti and $^{209}$Bi,
  as in the $\chi$EFT-based shell-model results.</description>

      <title>Influence of Cluster Configurations and Nucleon--Nucleon Scattering Cross-Section on Stopping Power in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impacts of nuclear $\alpha$-clustering structures and nucleon--nucleon cross-section on nuclear stopping power for ${}^{16}\text{O}$ + ${}^{40}\text{Ca}$ collisions below 300 MeV/nucleon using an extended quantum molecular dynamics (EQMD) model. Our results show that the specific $\alpha$-clustering configurations of ${}^{16}\text{O}$--including chain, square, kite, and tetrahedron--have a significant effect on collision dynamics. Among them, the tightly bound tetrahedral structure exhibits the highest stopping power. Moreover, the repulsive Coulomb interaction is found to reduce the stopping power of protons in the Fermi-energy domain. At higher energies, the decreasing trend is influenced by both the nucleon--nucleon cross-section and the mean field.</description>

      <title>Nonlocality parameters of microscopic optical potentials from Skyrme-based nuclear structure models at low energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the non-locality parameters $ \beta $ in nucleon-nucleus interactions for $ ^{16}\mathrm{O} $, $ ^{40}\mathrm{Ca} $, $ ^{48}\mathrm{Ca} $, and $ ^{208}\mathrm{Pb} $ using a microscopic optical potential (MOP) derived from nuclear structure models based on Skyrme self-consistent mean-field calculations at low incident energies. No \textit{ad hoc} adjusted parameters were employed in the present calculations. The analysis reveals that the non-locality parameter exhibits a clear dependence on the radial position within the nucleus, the incident nucleon energy, and the choice of target nucleus. At incident energies below $30$ MeV, the $ \beta $ lies between $0.8$ fm and $1.2$ fm for all considered targets. For the light nucleus $^{16}\mathrm{O}$, the non-locality parameter in the interior is smaller than that on the surface, whereas for medium and heavy nuclei $( ^{40}\mathrm{Ca} $, $ ^{48}\mathrm{Ca} $, and $ ^{208}\mathrm{Pb} $ ), the values are comparable in both regions.</description>

      <title>Reaction processes of muon-catalyzed fusion in the muonic molecule $dd\mu$ studied with the tractable $T$-matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muon-catalyzed fusion has recently regained significant attention due to experimental and theoretical developments being performed. The present authors [Phys. Rev. C {\bf 109} 054625 (2024)] proposed the tractable $T$-matrix model based on the Lippmann-Schwinger equation to approximate the elaborate two- and three-body coupled-channel (CC) calculations [Kamimura, Kino, and Yamashita, Phys. Rev. C {\bf 107}, 034607 (2023)] for the nuclear reaction processes in the muonic molecule $dt\mu$, $(dt\mu)_{J=0} \to\!^4{\rm He} + n + \mu + 17.6 \, {\rm MeV}$. % or $(^4{\rm He}\mu)_{nl} + n + 17.6 \,{\rm MeV}$. The $T$-matrix model well reproduced almost all of the results generated by the CC work. In the present paper, we apply this model to the nuclear reaction processes in the $dd\mu$ molecule, $(dd\mu)_{J=1} \to\!^3{\rm He} + n + \mu +3.27 \,$ MeV or $t + p + \mu + 4.03 \,$ MeV, in which the fusion takes place via the $p$-wave $d$-$d$ relative motion. Recently, significantly different $p$-wave astrophysical $S(E)$ factors of the reaction $d + d \to\!^3{\rm He} + n$ or $t + p$ at $E \! \simeq \! 1$ keV to 1 MeV have been reported experimentally and theoretically by five groups. Employing many sets of nuclear interactions that can reproduce those five cases of $p$-wave $S(E)$ factors, we calculate the fusion rate of the $(dd\mu)_{J=1}$ molecule using three kinds of methods where results are consistent with each other. We also derive the $^3{\rm He}$-$\mu$ sticking probability and the absolute values of the energy and momentum spectra of the emitted muon. The violation of charge symmetry in the $p$-wave $d$-$d$ reaction and the $dd\mu$ fusion reaction is discussed. Information on the emitted 2.45-MeV neutrons and \mbox{1 keV-dominant} muons should be useful for the application of $dd\mu$ fusion.</description>

      <title>Radial oscillations of neutron stars within density-dependent relativistic-mean field model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radial oscillations of neutron stars are studied using equations of state derived from density-dependent relativistic mean-field (DDRMF) models, which effectively describe the ground-state properties of finite nuclei. A novel numerical approach, the finite volume method (FVM), is employed to solve the eigenvalue problem associated with oscillation frequencies. Compared to conventional methods such as the finite difference method and shooting method, the FVM avoids the numerical instability encountered at high frequencies with an equation of state that includes a discontinuous adiabatic index and offers greater computational efficiency. The oscillation frequencies of high-order modes exhibit a similar trend of change. The radial displacements and pressure perturbations are largely influenced by the EOSs of crust region. {The frequency of the first excited state shows a strong linear relationship with both the slope and skewness parameters of the symmetry energy.} These findings suggest that the density dependence of the symmetry energy can be constrained through observations of neutron star radial oscillation frequencies.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of fermionic excitations in heavy-quark QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of fermionic excitations in heavy-quark QCD on the lattice with Wilson fermions. The grand potential is calculated analytically in the hopping parameter expansion (HPE) on the basis of the cumulant expansion. Using the grand potential, we compute the quark number susceptibilities and their ratios up to next-to-leading order in the HPE. The ratio of fourth- to second-order susceptibilities is shown to be unity (nine) in the deconfined (confined) phase at the leading order. Excitation properties of baryonic and quark modes in each phase are also investigated utilizing the Boltzmann statistics. We obtain an analytic formula for the quark excitation energy in the deconfined phase, while that for baryonic excitations in the confined phase is decomposed into flavor multiplets.</description>

      <title>Thermalization of Bottomonium in the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the approach to equilibrium of bottomonium in the quark-gluon plasma within the open quantum system framework. We perform large-scale simulations of the long-time behavior in three dimensions using the quantum trajectory method to observe the emergence of steady states and determine the timescale of thermalization in position-, angular-momentum-, and color-space. We find that the thermalization timescale increases with decreasing temperature and decreasing coupling to the medium, which is given by transport coefficients of the medium. Additionally, we observe that the steady states exhibit small corrections to the Gibbs state due to medium interactions and show that these corrections diminish for weaker medium coupling and higher temperature. At a temperature of $450\,$MeV, quarkonium relaxes to a state that is approximately thermal, with the most significant correction being a smaller overlap of the $1S$ state with respect to the Gibbs state. We compare these findings with the master equation obtained at leading order in the expansion of the binding energy over the temperature, which we find to have a trivial steady state.</description>

      <title>Limitations in constraining neutron star radii and nuclear properties from inspiral gravitational wave detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the constraints on the neutron star equation of state (EoS) and nuclear properties achievable with third-generation gravitational wave detectors using the Fisher information matrix approach. Assuming an optimistic binary neutron star (BNS) merger rate, we generate synthetic inspiral gravitational wave (GW) signals corresponding to one year of observation. From these simulated data, we compute the covariance matrix and posterior distributions for nuclear properties and EoS. Our results show that the EoS can be tightly constrained, particularly in the density range between one and four times nuclear saturation density. However, due to the scarcity of of low-mass neutron stars in the GW sample, the EoS at sub-saturation densities remains poorly constrained. Thus, in turn, leads to weaker constraints on neutron star radii, as the radii are sensitive to the low-density EoS. Additionally, We note that the nuclear properties are degenerate in their influence on the EoS, making them difficult to be constrained through GW observations alone. These highlights inherent limitations of inspiral GW signals in probing dense matter properties. Therefore, precise radius measurements, post-merger GW observations, and supplementary constraints from terrestrial nuclear experiments remain essential for a comprehensive understanding of dense matter.</description>

      <title>In-medium heavy quark-antiquark $T$-matrix without partial wave expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The T-matrix of the heavy quark-antiquark ($Q\bar{Q}$) pair interacting through a screened Cornell potential in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is computed without employing the partial wave expansion. This is compared with the results obtained using the conventional method of partial wave expansion. Through a comprehensive survey over a range of screening mass and center-of-mass energy, which, when combined, determine the orbital angular momentum involved in the scattering through the associated force range and incident momentum, it is demonstrated that a substantial number of partial wave terms are necessary to precisely match the full scattering amplitude directly obtained from the method without partial wave expansion. For moderate screening masses (corresponding to one to two times the crossover transition temperature) and center-of-mass energy, the number of partial waves required for satisfactory matching turns out as large as 10-20, substantially larger than what one would expect based on simply measuring the magnitudes of the first few partial wave amplitudes. This highlights the efficiency of the new method in directly obtaining the full scattering amplitude needed for further computation of phenomenological observables. We also employ the new method to calculate the T-matrix at center-of-mass energies below the $Q\bar{Q}$ mass threshold, and demonstrate the presence of bound states of different orbital quantum numbers simultaneously in a single energy scan.</description>

      <title>Simulation of heavy quarkonium equilibration in the quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate the heavy quarkonium equilibration through transport in a static and homogeneous quark-gluon plasma (QGP) box within the semi-classical Boltzmann approach incorporating both the leading-order and next-to-leading-order dissociation and regeneration reactions. The scattering amplitudes involved are taken from perturbative computations based on effective color-electric dipole coupling of the heavy quarkonium with thermal gluons. By coupling the Langevin simulation of single heavy quark diffusion and the Boltzmann transport of the heavy quarkonium in a real-time fashion, we demonstrate how the kinetic and chemical equilibrium of heavy quarkonium with single heavy quarks in the medium is achieved in terms of both the bound state's yields and momentum distributions. The pertinent equilibration time turns out to be comparable to the lifetime of the QGP created in the most central heavy-ion collisions at the LHC energies. The role of the intricate interplay between the open and hidden heavy sector in the process of equilibration is highlighted. This work provides a dynamical way of understanding the phenomenological success of statistical hadronization model for charmonium production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, and also paves the way for realistic phenomenological applications to heavy quarkonium transport.</description>

      <title>Scaling behaviour of charged particles generated in Xe$-$Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.44 TeV using the AMPT model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial configurations of particles produced in the kinematic phase space during a heavy-ion collision reflect the characteristics of the system created in the collision. The scaling behaviour of the multiplicity fluctuations is studied for the charged particles generated in Xe--Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.44 TeV using the String Melting (SM) mode of the AMPT (A Multi-Phase Transport) model. The scaling behaviour of the normalized factorial moments ($F_\text{q}$) give significant information about the dynamics of the systems under study. A linear power-law growth of the $F_\text{q}$ with the increasing phase space resolution, termed as intermittency, is investigated. The anomalous fractal dimension $D_\text{q}$ is determined, which is linked to the self-similarity and fractal nature of the particle emission spectra, a dependence of which on the order of the moment ($q$) is characterised by the intermittency index ($\varphi_{\text{q}}$). Relating $q^{\rm{th}}$ order Normalised Factorial Moment (NFM) with $F_{2}$, the scaling exponent ($\nu$) is determined that quantifies the dynamics of the system created by these collisions and is analyzed for its dependence on the transverse momentum bin width ($\Delta p_\text{T}$). A comparative study of experimental and model results may help to understand the dynamics of multiparticle production in the heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions V: complex $\phi^4$ field model in $3+1$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Ref.~\cite{Guo:2024zal} and associated studies, a relativistic finite-volume formalism in $1+1$ dimensions is proposed to extract infinite-volume scattering phaseshift.
  It is based on the difference of integrated correlation functions (ICF) rather than energy spectrum in the finite volume, and can be regarded as complementary to the well-known L\"{uscher} formalism.
  In the present work, the formalism is further extended into $3+1$ dimensional spacetime. The aim is to explore and demonstrate the challenges in applying the formalism to more practical settings. Specifically, Monte Carlo simulations of a complex $\phi^4$ relativistic field model are carried out in both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions on lattices of varying sizes, and phaseshifts for the contact interaction are extracted from the formalism using modest computing resources.</description>

      <title>Polarized electromagnetic radiation by chiral media with time-dependent chiral chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate photon production from media characterized by a time-dependent chiral chemical potential $\mu_5(t)$. We first consider the chiral anomaly as a small perturbation and show that $\mu_5\to 2\gamma$ process generates non-polarized radiation, as the probabilities of producing right and left-handed photons are equal. In chiral semimetal with a vanishing chiral chemical potential but a finite separation of Weyl nodes, ${\bf \Delta}(t)$, the photon production vanishes at the leading order of perturbation theory. We then employ the method of Bogolyubov transformation to obtain the photon spectrum that sums up all powers of $\mu_5$. Employing the exactly solvable model $\mu_5(t) \propto A+B\tanh(t/\tau)$, we demonstrate that the spectrum exhibits strong circular polarization, whose direction is determined by the sign of $\mu_5$. The spectrum contains resonances associated with the instability of the electromagnetic field in chiral media. We discuss potential phenomenological applications of these findings.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of nuclear incompressibility from collective flow in mid-central Au+Au collisions at 400--1500 MeV/nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The incompressibility $K$ of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) is determined through a Bayesian analysis of collective flow data from Au + Au collisions at beam energies $E = 400 -1500$ MeV/nucleon. This analysis utilizes a Gaussian process (GP) emulator applied to the isospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamics (IQMD) model for heavy-ion collisions, both with and without incorporating the momentum dependence of the single-nucleon potentials. Specifically, the inferred incompressibility values are $K=188.9^{+2.9}_{-4.5}$ MeV and $256.1^{+8.2}_{-8.7}$ MeV at $E = 400$ MeV/nucleon, respectively, at the 68\% confidence level using rapidity and transverse velocity dependence of proton elliptic flow data, with and without consideration of the momentum dependence. When the transverse momentum dependence of proton-like directed flow data is included, the inferred incompressibility values become $K=222.3^{+9.0}_{-9.9}$ MeV and $K=285.5^{+6.7}_{-7.3}$ MeV, respectively. Furthermore, we found that the value of $K$ derived from observables of proton elliptic flow increases with beam energy. This indicates that the equation of state (EoS) of nuclear matter hardens at higher densities and temperatures in reactions with higher beam energies.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent microscopic calculations for electron captures on nuclei in core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calculations for electron capture rates on nuclei with atomic numbers between $Z=20$ and $Z=52$ are performed in a self-consistent finite-temperature covariant energy density functional theory within the relativistic quasiparticle random-phase approximation. Electron captures on these nuclei contribute most to reducing the electron fraction during the collapse phase of core-collapse supernovae. The rates include contributions from allowed (Gamow-Teller) and first-forbidden (FF) transitions, and it is shown that the latter become dominant at high stellar densities and temperatures. Temperature-dependent effects such as Pauli unblocking and transitions from thermally excited states are also included. The new rates are implemented in a spherically symmetric 1D simulation of the core-collapse phase. The results indicate that the increase in electron capture rates, due to inclusion of FF transitions, leads to reductions of the electron fraction at nuclear saturation density, the peak neutrino luminosity, and enclosed mass at core bounce. The new rates reaffirm that the most relevant nuclei for the deleptonization situate around the $N = 50$ and $82$ shell closures, but compared to previous simulations, nuclei are less proton rich. The new rates developed in this work are available, and will be of benefit to improve the accuracy of multi-dimensional supernova simulations.</description>

Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions have recently emerged as a promising ``imaging-by-smashing'' approach that may reveal the intrinsic shapes of atomic nuclei. Here, I outline a conceptual framework for this technique, explaining how nuclear shapes are encoded during quark-gluon plasma formation and evolution, and how they can be decoded from final-state particle distributions. I highlight the method's potential to advance our understanding of both nuclear structure and quark-gluon plasma physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear masses play a crucial role in both nuclear physics and astrophysics, driving sustained efforts toward their precise experimental determination and reliable theoretical prediction. In this work, we compile the newly measured masses for 296 nuclides from 40 references published between 2021 and 2024, subsequent to the release of the latest Atomic Mass Evaluation. These data are used to benchmark the performance of several relativistic and non-relativistic density functionals, including PC-PK1, TMA, SLy4, SV-min, UNEDF1, and the recently proposed PC-L3R. Results for PC-PK1 and PC-L3R are obtained using the state-of-the-art deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc), while the others are adopted from existing literature. It is found that the DRHBc calculations with PC-PK1 and PC-L3R achieve an accuracy better than 1.5 MeV, outperforming the other functionals, which all exhibit root-mean-square deviations exceeding 2 MeV. The odd-even effects and isospin dependence in these theoretical descriptions are examined. The PC-PK1 and PC-L3R descriptions are qualitatively similar, both exhibiting robust isospin dependence along isotopic chains. Finally, a quantitative comparison between the PC-PK1 and PC-L3R results is presented, with their largest discrepancies analyzed in terms of potential energy curves from constrained DRHBc calculations.</description>

      <title>Searching for entanglement in final polarization states of the neutron-proton scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate polarization states of the outgoing neutron-proton ($np$) pair in elastic polarized neutron and proton scattering, aiming to find unambiguous evidence for entanglement of their spin states. To obtain complete information about these states, we calculate, using the high precision nucleon-nucleon potential AV18, the final polarizations of the neutron and proton as well as their spin correlation coefficients, which unequivocally define the corresponding spin density matrix. We compute all terms contributing to polarizations and spin correlations, e.g. not only induced polarizations and correlations resulting from unpolarized $np$ scattering, but also contributions from single polarization and correlation transfers from individual polarized incoming nucleons, and, for the first time, allotment to both quantities stemming from a doubly spin polarized initial state. We find that for the most part the final spin states are statistical mixture of states.The only pure states occur for highly polarized incoming neutrons and protons with maximal polarizations. By quantifying the degree of entanglement through entanglement power and concurrence, we observed that the entanglement of impure final states increases with energy. Among the pure spin states resulting from incoming states with maximal neutron and proton polarizations, we found, at $E_{lab}=100$~MeV, cases of strongly entangled Bell-type states with only a small admixture of entanglement-spoiling contributions.</description>

      <title>Machine learning the single-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei with neural-network quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei are the most straightforward extension of atomic nuclei. A thorough description of baryonic system beyond first-generation quark sector is indispensable for the maturation of nuclear $ab$ $initio$ methods. This study pioneers the application of neural-network quantum states to hypernuclei, with trainable parameters determined by variational Monte Carlo approach (VMC-NQS). In order to reduce the numerical uncertainty and treat the nucleons and hyperons in a unified manner, spinor grouping (SG) method is proposed to analytically integrate out isospin degrees of freedom. A novel spin purification scheme is developed to address the severe spin contamination occurring in standard energy minimization due to the weakly bound characteristic of light single-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei. The energy spectrum of $s$-shell hypernuclei is computed with one-thousandth level accuracy and benchmarked against existing stochastic variational results, showing superior performance. By comparing two different sets of Hamiltonian based on pionless effective field theory (pionless EFT), we choose an optimal model and further carry out calculations of selected $p$-shell charge-symmetric hypernuclei with mass number up to 13, exhibiting satisfactory consistency with experimental results. Our findings underscore the potential of VMC-NQS family in approaching exact solution of few-body systems and the accuracy of pionless EFT in modeling hypernuclei. This is crucial for understanding hyperon-nucleon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon-nucleon interactions, providing a powerful tool for precisely predicting the properties of multi-strangeness hypernuclei.</description>

      <title>Rapidity asymmetry of jet-hadron correlation as a robust signal of diffusion wake induced by di-jets in high-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03419v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion wake accompanying a Mach cone is a unique feature of the medium response to projectiles traveling at a speed faster than the velocity of sound. This is also the case for jet-medium interaction inside the quark-gluon plasma in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. It leads to a depletion of soft hadrons in the opposite direction of the propagating jet and has been recently observed in $Z$-jet events of Pb+Pb collisions at LHC. In di-jet events, however, the diffusion wake of one jet usually overlaps with the medium-induced hadron enhancement of other jet without a clear signal except a reduction of the hadron enhancement, unless there is a large rapidity gap between the two jets. We propose to use the rapidity asymmetry of jet-hadron correlations in di-jets with a finite rapidity gap relative to that without, as a robust and background-free signal of the diffusion wake. The asymmetry emerges because the diffusion wake of one jet is shifted to a finite rapidity relative to the other jet. Consequently, a depletion of soft hadrons appears in the shifted rapidity region of the diffusion wake and an enhancement in the rapidity region of the other jet whose soft hadron enhancement is no longer or less reduced by the diffusion wake as in di-jets without a rapidity gap. We predict the rapidity asymmetry using both theoretical and mixed-event background subtraction for different values of the rapidity gap within the CoLBT-hydro model. Future measurements of this rapidity asymmetry with high statistics data on di-jets should provide more precise insights into the jet-induced diffusion wake and properties of the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

Abstract: The traditional Fermi function ansatz for nuclear beta decay describes enhanced perturbative effects in the limit of large nuclear charge $Z$ and/or small electron velocity $\beta$. We define and compute the quantum field theory object that replaces this ansatz for neutron beta decay, where neither of these limits hold. We present a new factorization formula that applies in the limit of small electron mass, analyze the components of this formula through two loop order, and resum perturbative corrections that are enhanced by large logarithms. We apply our results to the neutron lifetime, supplying the first two-loop input to the long-distance corrections. Our result can be summarized as \begin{equation*}
  \tau_n \times |V_{ud}|^2\big[1+3\lambda^2\big]\big[1+\Delta_R\big]
  =
  \frac{5263.284(17)\,{\rm s}}
  {1 + 27.04(7)\times 10^{-3} }~, \end{equation*} with $|V_{ud}|$ the up-down quark mixing parameter, $\tau_n$ the neutron's lifetime, $\lambda$ the ratio of axial to vector charge, and $\Delta_R$ the short-distance matching correction. We find a shift in the long-distance radiative corrections compared to previous work, and discuss implications for extractions of $|V_{ud}|$ and tests of the Standard Model.</description>

Here we explore the host-dependence of the nuclear clock frequency, focusing on the isomer shift induced by the difference in the nuclear charge distribution between the ground and excited nuclear states. We combine relativistic many-body methods of atomic structure with periodic density functional theory to evaluate the isomer shifts in solid-state hosts. We elucidate the critical importance of the ``relaxation'' effect in evaluating the isomer shifts. Our analysis predicts nuclear clock frequencies for various solid-state and trapped ion platforms: $ \omega_\text{clk}(\text{solid state}) = 2,020,407,384(40) \, \text{MHz}$, $\omega_\text{clk}(^{229}\text{Th}^{4+}) = 2,020,407,648(70) \, \text{MHz}$, and $ \omega_\text{clk}(^{229}\text{Th}^{3+}) = 2,020,407,114(70) \, \text{MHz}$. We also determine the nuclear transition energy for the bare $^{229}$Th nucleus to be $\omega_\text{nuc} = 8.272(22) \,\text{eV}$. Our calculated valence-band isomer shifts for different host materials constrain the nuclear transition frequencies to an 80 MHz-wide frequency window, aiding experimental searches for the $^{229}$Th nuclear transition in novel materials.</description>

Abstract: We discuss in detail the relativistic spatial distribution of transverse angular momentum, including both orbital and intrinsic spin contributions. Using the quantum phase-space formalism, we begin with the definition of the three-dimensional spatial distributions of transverse orbital angular momentum and intrinsic spin in a generic Lorentz frame. By integrating these three-dimensional spatial distributions over the longitudinal axis, we derive for the first time the relativistic spatial distributions of transverse orbital angular momentum, intrinsic spin, and total angular momentum for spin-0 and spin-1/2 targets in the transverse plane. We verify the transverse spin sum rule about the relativistic center of spin for spin-0 and spin-1/2 systems, and find that the transverse total angular momentum distribution is non-trivial, even for spin-0 targets. We also show how the distributions of transverse orbital angular momentum, intrinsic spin, and total angular momentum change with the target momentum.</description>

      <title>Relaxation for massive particles: transport and causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlators at finite density and temperature encode important information about a physical system, such as transport and causality. For a massive gas of particles in the relaxation time approximation of kinetic theory, we provide complete analytic results for all first order transport coefficients, including thermoelectric coefficients. We demonstrate the first complete picture of the complex structure of the correlators as a function of mass, providing an interpretation in terms of the causal structure of lightcones. We provide a simple criterion to extract the effective lightcone velocity from the cut of the retarded correlator.</description>

      <title>Probing Spin and Lifetime Correlations in Entangled Hyperon-AntiHyperon Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement has now been demonstrated in several hadronic systems, revealing that non-classical spin correlations survive even through the strong-interaction hadronization process. To date, however, all studies have focused exclusively on angular observables, leaving the possibility untouched that quantum coherence might also influence the decay times of entangled partners. In this work we propose data-driven tests of spin-lifetime and lifetime-lifetime correlations for Lambda-antiLambda pairs produced in high-energy collisions. By examining the opening-angle distribution in slices of Delta t, constructing a pair-wise spin-lifetime correlator, and testing a simple lifetime-lifetime covariance, we search for deviations from independent exponential decay that align with known spin correlations. Observation of nonzero lifetime correlations would compel a reassessment of how entanglement manifests in decaying systems, revealing hitherto unexplored temporal coherence.</description>
