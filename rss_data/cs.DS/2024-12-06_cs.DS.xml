      <title>Classic Round-Up Variant of Fast Unsigned Division by Constants: Algorithm and Full Proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integer division instruction is generally expensive in most architectures. If the divisor is constant, the division can be transformed into combinations of several inexpensive integer instructions. This article discusses the classic round-up variant of the fast unsigned division by constants algorithm, and provides full proof of its correctness and feasibility. Additionally, a simpler variant for bounded dividends is presented.</description>

      <title>The Online Submodular Assignment Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online resource allocation is a rich and varied field. One of the most well-known problems in this area is online bipartite matching, introduced in 1990 by Karp, Vazirani, and Vazirani [KVV90]. Since then, many variants have been studied, including AdWords, the generalized assignment problem (GAP), and online submodular welfare maximization.
  In this paper, we introduce a generalization of GAP which we call the submodular assignment problem (SAP). This generalization captures many online assignment problems, including all classical online bipartite matching problems as well as broader online combinatorial optimization problems such as online arboricity, flow scheduling, and laminar restricted allocations. We present a fractional algorithm for online SAP that is (1-1/e)-competitive.
  Additionally, we study several integral special cases of the problem. In particular, we provide a (1-1/e-epsilon)-competitive integral algorithm under a small-bids assumption, and a (1-1/e)-competitive integral algorithm for online submodular welfare maximization where the utility functions are given by rank functions of matroids.
  The key new ingredient for our results is the construction and structural analysis of a "water level" vector for polymatroids, which allows us to generalize the classic water-filling paradigm used in online matching problems. This construction reveals connections to submodular utility allocation markets and principal partition sequences of matroids.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Selection with Costly Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of optimization problems over stochastic variables where the algorithm can learn information about the value of any variable through a series of costly steps; we model this information acquisition process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The algorithm's goal is to minimize the cost of its solution plus the cost of information acquisition, or alternately, maximize the value of its solution minus the cost of information acquisition. Such bandit superprocesses have been studied previously but solutions are known only for fairly restrictive special cases.
  We develop a framework for approximate optimization of bandit superprocesses that applies to arbitrary processes with a matroid (and in some cases, more general) feasibility constraint. Our framework establishes a bound on the optimal cost through a novel cost amortization; it then couples this bound with a notion of local approximation that allows approximate solutions for each component MDP in the superprocess to be composed without loss into a global approximation.
  We use this framework to obtain approximately optimal solutions for several variants of bandit superprocesses for both maximization and minimization. We obtain new approximations for combinatorial versions of the previously studied Pandora's Box with Optional Inspection and Pandora's Box with Partial Inspection; as well as approximation algorithms for a new problem that we call the Weighing Scale problem.</description>

      <title>Computing diverse pair of solutions for tractable SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many decision-making processes, one may prefer multiple solutions to a single solution, which allows us to choose an appropriate solution from the set of promising solutions that are found by algorithms. Given this, finding a set of \emph{diverse} solutions plays an indispensable role in enhancing human decision-making. In this paper, we investigate the problem of finding diverse solutions of Satisfiability from the perspective of parameterized complexity with a particular focus on \emph{tractable} Boolean formulas. We present several parameterized tractable and intractable results for finding a diverse pair of satisfying assignments of a Boolean formula. In particular, we design an FPT algorithm for finding an ``almost disjoint'' pair of satisfying assignments of a $2$CNF formula.</description>

      <title>Recognizing 2-Layer and Outer $k$-Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crossing number of a graph is the least number of crossings over all drawings of the graph in the plane. Computing the crossing number of a given graph is NP-hard, but fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to the natural parameter. Two well-known variants of the problem are 2-layer crossing minimization and circular crossing minimization, where every vertex must lie on one of two layers, namely two parallel lines, or a circle, respectively. Both variants are NP-hard, but FPT with respect to the natural parameter.
  Recently, a local version of the crossing number has also received considerable attention. A graph is $k$-planar if it admits a drawing with at most $k$ crossings per edge. In contrast to the crossing number, recognizing $k$-planar graphs is NP-hard even if $k=1$.
  In this paper, we consider the two above variants in the local setting. The $k$-planar graphs that admit a straight-line drawing with vertices on two layers or on a circle are called 2-layer $k$-planar and outer $k$-planar graphs, respectively. We study the parameterized complexity of the two recognition problems with respect to $k$. For $k=0$, both problems can easily be solved in linear time. Two groups independently showed that outer 1-planar graphs can also be recognized in linear time [Algorithmica 2015/2016]. One group asked whether outer 2-planar graphs can be recognized in polynomial time.
  Our main contribution consists of XP-algorithms for recognizing 2-layer $k$-planar graphs and outer $k$-planar graphs. We complement these results by showing that both recognition problems are XNLP-hard. This implies that both problems are W$[t]$-hard for every $t$ and that it is unlikely that they admit FPT-algorithms. On the other hand, we present an FPT-algorithm for recognizing 2-layer $k$-planar graphs where the order of the vertices on one layer is specified.</description>

      <title>Robust Contraction Decomposition for Minor-Free Graphs and its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a robust contraction decomposition theorem for $H$-minor-free graphs, which states that given an $H$-minor-free graph $G$ and an integer $p$, one can partition in polynomial time the vertices of $G$ into $p$ sets $Z_1,\dots,Z_p$ such that $\operatorname{tw}(G/(Z_i \setminus Z')) = O(p + |Z'|)$ for all $i \in [p]$ and $Z' \subseteq Z_i$. Here, $\operatorname{tw}(\cdot)$ denotes the treewidth of a graph and $G/(Z_i \setminus Z')$ denotes the graph obtained from $G$ by contracting all edges with both endpoints in $Z_i \setminus Z'$.
  Our result generalizes earlier results by Klein [SICOMP 2008] and Demaine et al. [STOC 2011] based on partitioning $E(G)$, and some recent theorems for planar graphs by Marx et al. [SODA 2022], for bounded-genus graphs (more generally, almost-embeddable graphs) by Bandyapadhyay et al. [SODA 2022], and for unit-disk graphs by Bandyapadhyay et al. [SoCG 2022].
  The robust contraction decomposition theorem directly results in parameterized algorithms with running time $2^{\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k})} \cdot n^{O(1)}$ or $n^{O(\sqrt{k})}$ for every vertex/edge deletion problems on $H$-minor-free graphs that can be formulated as Permutation CSP Deletion or 2-Conn Permutation CSP Deletion. Consequently, we obtain the first subexponential-time parameterized algorithms for Subset Feedback Vertex Set, Subset Odd Cycle Transversal, Subset Group Feedback Vertex Set, 2-Conn Component Order Connectivity on $H$-minor-free graphs. For other problems which already have subexponential-time parameterized algorithms on $H$-minor-free graphs (e.g., Odd Cycle Transversal, Vertex Multiway Cut, Vertex Multicut, etc.), our theorem gives much simpler algorithms of the same running time.</description>

      <title>Towards Metric DBSCAN: Exact, Approximate, and Streaming Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DBSCAN is a popular density-based clustering algorithm that has many different applications in practice. However, the running time of DBSCAN in high-dimensional space or general metric space ({\em e.g.,} clustering a set of texts by using edit distance) can be as large as quadratic in the input size. Moreover, most of existing accelerating techniques for DBSCAN are only available for low-dimensional Euclidean space. In this paper, we study the DBSCAN problem under the assumption that the inliers (the core points and border points) have a low intrinsic dimension (which is a realistic assumption for many high-dimensional applications), where the outliers can locate anywhere in the space without any assumption. First, we propose a $k$-center clustering based algorithm that can reduce the time-consuming labeling and merging tasks of DBSCAN to be linear. Further, we propose a linear time approximate DBSCAN algorithm, where the key idea is building a novel small-size summary for the core points. Also, our algorithm can be efficiently implemented for streaming data and the required memory is independent of the input size. Finally, we conduct our experiments and compare our algorithms with several popular DBSCAN algorithms. The experimental results suggest that our proposed approach can significantly reduce the computational complexity in practice.</description>

      <title>An efficient implementation for solving the all pairs minimax path problem in an undirected dense graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07058v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an efficient $ O(n^2) $ implementation for solving the all pairs minimax path problem or widest path problem in an undirected dense graph. It is a code implementation of the Algorithm 4 (MMJ distance by Calculation and Copy) in a previous paper. The distance matrix is also called the all points path distance (APPD). We conducted experiments to test the implementation and algorithm, compared it with several other algorithms for solving the APPD matrix. Result shows Algorithm 4 works good for solving the widest path or minimax path APPD matrix. It can drastically improve the efficiency for computing the APPD matrix. There are several theoretical outcomes which claim the APPD matrix can be solved accurately in $ O(n^2) $ . However, they are impractical because there is no code implementation of these algorithms. It seems Algorithm 4 is the first algorithm that has an actual code implementation for solving the APPD matrix of minimax path or widest path problem in $ O(n^2) $, in an undirected dense graph.</description>

      <title>Sinkhorn Algorithm for Sequentially Composed Optimal Transports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sinkhorn algorithm is the de-facto standard approximation algorithm for optimal transport, which has been applied to a variety of applications, including image processing and natural language processing. In theory, the proof of its convergence follows from the convergence of the Sinkhorn--Knopp algorithm for the matrix scaling problem, and Altschuler et al. show that its worst-case time complexity is in near-linear time. Very recently, sequentially composed optimal transports were proposed by Watanabe and Isobe as a hierarchical extension of optimal transports. In this paper, we present an efficient approximation algorithm, namely Sinkhorn algorithm for sequentially composed optimal transports, for its entropic regularization. Furthermore, we present a theoretical analysis of the Sinkhorn algorithm, namely (i) its exponential convergence to the optimal solution with respect to the Hilbert pseudometric, and (ii) a worst-case complexity analysis for the case of one sequential composition.</description>

      <title>Approximation Algorithms for D-optimal Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:1802.08372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental design is a classical statistics problem and its aim is to estimate an unknown $m$-dimensional vector $\beta$ from linear measurements where a Gaussian noise is introduced in each measurement. For the combinatorial experimental design problem, the goal is to pick $k$ out of the given $n$ experiments so as to make the most accurate estimate of the unknown parameters, denoted as $\hat{\beta}$. In this paper, we will study one of the most robust measures of error estimation - $D$-optimality criterion, which corresponds to minimizing the volume of the confidence ellipsoid for the estimation error $\beta-\hat{\beta}$. The problem gives rise to two natural variants depending on whether repetitions of experiments are allowed or not. We first propose an approximation algorithm with a $\frac1e$-approximation for the $D$-optimal design problem with and without repetitions, giving the first constant factor approximation for the problem. We then analyze another sampling approximation algorithm and prove that it is $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation if $k\geq \frac{4m}{\epsilon}+\frac{12}{\epsilon^2}\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon \in (0,1)$. Finally, for $D$-optimal design with repetitions, we study a different algorithm proposed by literature and show that it can improve this asymptotic approximation ratio.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer bootstrapping: A recipe for efficient agnostic tomography and magic estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the task of agnostic tomography: given copies of an unknown $n$-qubit state $\rho$ which has fidelity $\tau$ with some state in a given class $C$, find a state which has fidelity $\ge \tau - \epsilon$ with $\rho$. We give a new framework, stabilizer bootstrapping, for designing computationally efficient protocols for this task, and use this to get new agnostic tomography protocols for the following classes:
  Stabilizer states: We give a protocol that runs in time $\mathrm{poly}(n,1/\epsilon)\cdot (1/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\tau))}$, answering an open question posed by Grewal, Iyer, Kretschmer, Liang [43] and Anshu and Arunachalam [6]. Previous protocols ran in time $\mathrm{exp}(\Theta(n))$ or required $\tau&gt;\cos^2(\pi/8)$.
  States with stabilizer dimension $n - t$: We give a protocol that runs in time $n^3\cdot(2^t/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\epsilon))}$, extending recent work on learning quantum states prepared by circuits with few non-Clifford gates, which only applied in the realizable setting where $\tau = 1$ [33, 40, 49, 66].
  Discrete product states: If $C = K^{\otimes n}$ for some $\mu$-separated discrete set $K$ of single-qubit states, we give a protocol that runs in time $(n/\mu)^{O((1 + \log (1/\tau))/\mu)}/\epsilon^2$. This strictly generalizes a prior guarantee which applied to stabilizer product states [42]. For stabilizer product states, we give a further improved protocol that runs in time $(n^2/\epsilon^2)\cdot (1/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\tau))}$.
  As a corollary, we give the first protocol for estimating stabilizer fidelity, a standard measure of magic for quantum states, to error $\epsilon$ in $n^3 \mathrm{quasipoly}(1/\epsilon)$ time.</description>

      <title>Relax and Merge: A Simple Yet Effective Framework for Solving Fair $k$-Means and $k$-sparse Wasserstein Barycenter Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fairness of clustering algorithms has gained widespread attention across various areas, including machine learning, In this paper, we study fair $k$-means clustering in Euclidean space. Given a dataset comprising several groups, the fairness constraint requires that each cluster should contain a proportion of points from each group within specified lower and upper bounds. Due to these fairness constraints, determining the optimal locations of $k$ centers is a quite challenging task. We propose a novel ``Relax and Merge'' framework that returns a $(1+4\rho + O(\epsilon))$-approximate solution, where $\rho$ is the approximate ratio of an off-the-shelf vanilla $k$-means algorithm and $O(\epsilon)$ can be an arbitrarily small positive number. If equipped with a PTAS of $k$-means, our solution can achieve an approximation ratio of $(5+O(\epsilon))$ with only a slight violation of the fairness constraints, which improves the current state-of-the-art approximation guarantee. Furthermore, using our framework, we can also obtain a $(1+4\rho +O(\epsilon))$-approximate solution for the $k$-sparse Wasserstein Barycenter problem, which is a fundamental optimization problem in the field of optimal transport, and a $(2+6\rho)$-approximate solution for the strictly fair $k$-means clustering with no violation, both of which are better than the current state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the empirical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can significantly outperform baseline approaches in terms of clustering cost.</description>
