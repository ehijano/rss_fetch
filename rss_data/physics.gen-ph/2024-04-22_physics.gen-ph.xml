      <title>Spin Theory Based on the Extended Least Action Principle and Information Metrics: Quantization, Entanglement, and Bell Test With Time Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theory of electron spin is developed here based on the extended least action principle and assumptions of intrinsic angular momentum of an electron with random orientations. By incorporating appropriate relative entropy for the random orientations of intrinsic angular momentum in the extended least action principle, the theory recovers the quantum formulation of electron spin. The two-level quantization of spin measurement is a natural mathematical consequence instead of a postulate. The formulation of measurement probability when a second Stern-Gerlach apparatus is rotated relative to the first Stern-Gerlach apparatus, and the Schr\"{o}dinger-Pauli equation, are also derived successfully. Furthermore, we provide an intuitive physical model and formulation to explain the entanglement phenomenon between two electron spins. In this model, spin entanglement is the consequence of correlation between the random orientations of the intrinsic angular momenta of the two electrons. Since the orientation is an intrinsic local property of electron, the correlation of orientations can be preserved even when the two electrons are remotely separated. Such a correlation can be manifested without causal effect. Owing to this orientation correlation, the Bell-CHSH inequality is shown to be violated in a Bell test. The standard quantum theory of electron spin can be considered as an ideal approximation of the present theory when certain conditions are taken to the limits. A potential experiment is proposed to test the difference between the present theory and the standard quantum theory. In a typical Bell test that confirms the violation of Bell-CHSH inequality, the theory suggests that by adding a sufficiently large time delay before Bob's measurement, the Bell-CHSH inequality can become non-violated.</description>

      <title>(Pseudo-)Synthetic BRST quantisation of the bosonic string and the higher quantum origin of dualities</title>

Abstract: In this article I am arguing in favour of the hypothesis that the origin of gauge and string dualities in general can be found in a higher-categorical interpretation of basic quantum mechanics. It is interesting to observe that the Galilei group has a non-trivial cohomology, while the Lorentz/Poincare group has trivial cohomology. When we constructed quantum mechanics, we noticed the non-trivial cohomology structure of the Galilei group and hence, we required for a proper quantisation procedure that would be compatible with the symmetry group of our theory, to go to a central extension of the Galilei group universal covering by co-cycle. This would be the Bargmann group. However, Nature didn't choose this path. Instead in nature, the Galilei group is not realised, while the Lorentz group is. The fact that the Galilei group has topological obstructions leads to a central charge, the mass, and a superselection rule, required to implement the Galilei symmetry, that forbids transitions between states of different mass. The topological structure of the Lorentz group however lacks such an obstruction, and hence allows for transitions between states of different mass. The connectivity structure of the Lorentz group as opposed to that of the Galilei group can be interpreted in the sense of an ER=EPR duality for the topological space associated to group cohomology. In string theory we started with the Witt algebra, and due to similar quantisation issues, we employed the central extension by co-cycle to obtain the Virasoro algebra. This is a unique extension for orientation preserving diffeomorphisms on a circle, but there is no reason to believe that, at the high energy domain in physics where this would apply, we do not have a totally different structure altogether and the degrees of freedom present there would require something vastly more general and global.</description>
