      <title>Surface transport and barrier effects in metal halide perovskites explored by bias polarity switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface transport and barrier effects in metal halide perovskites explored by bias polarity switching. By bias polarity switching we experimentally proved that free and trapped holes accumulate beneath the contact barrier. Further investigation proved that the duration of bias pulse changes surface properties that surprisingly affect only free holes. Temperature dependence of accumulated hole dissipation revealed two activation energies 150meV the height of the barrier and 770meV corresponding to a yet unknown process.</description>

      <title>Goldstone mode of the broken helix in U(1) magnet EuIn2As2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Goldstone modes acquire a frequency gap in the presence of perturbations that break the underlying continuous symmetry. Here, we study the response of a spin-based Goldstone mode to strain and magnetic field in the broken helix, a multi-$\textbf{Q}$ phase of EuIn$_2$As$_2$. Optical polarimetry with spatial and temporal resolution allows us to access information about both the structure and frequency of optically excited spin-wave modes under different strain conditions. We observe nearly uniform spin precession characteristic of a Goldstone mode only when magnetic field dominates over strain. In this regime, the frequency depends linearly on the applied field. A symmetry analysis for predicting the mode frequency near zero field demonstrates that the observed scaling is of the lowest allowed order. This work thus demonstrates the connections between magnetic symmetries and the frequency dependence of the Goldstone mode in an external field, and illustrates the power of our technique for studying the dynamics of complex magnets.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties from an efficient analytical representation of the $GW$ self-energy within a multipole approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient analytical representation of the frequency-dependent $GW$ self-energy $\Sigma$ via a multipole approximation (MPA-$\Sigma$). The multipole-Pad\'e model for the self-energy is interpolated from a small set of numerical evaluations of $\Sigma$ in the complex frequency plane, similarly to the previously multipole representation developed for the screened Coulomb interaction (MPA-$W$) [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, 115157 (2021)]. We show that, likewise MPA-$W$, an appropriate choice of frequency sampling in MPA-$\Sigma$ is critical to guarantee computational efficiency and high accuracy. The combined MPA-$W$ and MPA-$\Sigma$ scheme considerably reduces the cost of full-frequency self-energy calculations, especially for spectral band structures over a wide energy range. Crucially, MPA-$\Sigma$ enables a multipole representation for the interacting Green's function $G$ (MPA-$G$), providing a straightforward evaluation of all the spectral properties, and a more general way to define the renormalization factor $Z$. We validate the MPA-$\Sigma$ and MPA-$G$ approaches for diverse systems: bulk Si, Na and Cu, monolayer MoS$_2$, the NaCl ion-pair and the F$_2$ molecule. Moreover, we introduce toy MPA-$\Sigma$/$G$ models to examine the quasiparticle picture in different regimens of weak and strong correlation. With these models, we expose limitations in defining $Z$ from the local derivative of $\Sigma$.</description>

      <title>Correlation between structural and magnetic properties of epitaxial YIG films by pulsed laser deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the relationships between film growth conditions, crystalline microstructure, and magnetic properties of epitaxial Yttrium Iron Garnet (Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$, YIG) thin films, deposited on Gallium Gadolinium Garnet (Ga$_3$Gd$_5$O$_{12}$, GGG). A direct correlation was observed between the residual epitaxial strain, bulk magnetic properties like saturation magnetization and magnetic damping), and the performance of spin-wave transmission devices based on these films. This correlation offers a pathway for a simplified, rapid assessment of YIG film quality, avoiding the need for complex time-consuming characterization techniques. In addition, we report a comprehensive investigation into the influence of pulsed-laser deposition parameters, including deposition temperature, pressure, laser fluence, frequency, and annealing conditions. Through systematic deposition optimization, state-of-the-art YIG films exhibiting ultralow magnetic damping could be obtained, which is critical for high-performance spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Predicting Fundamental Gaps of Chromium-Based 2D Materials Using GW Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise and accurate predictions of the two-dimensional (2D) material's fundamental gap are crucial for next-generation flexible electronic and photonic devices. We, therefore, evaluated the predictivity of the GW approach in its several variants built on various density functional theory (DFT) inputs. We identified reasons for significant discrepancies between generalized gradient approximation and hybrid DFT results for intricate cases of 2D materials containing chromium and evaluated the diverse behavior of subsequent quasiparticle corrections. We examined the impact of omitted vertex corrections using the more computationally intensive quasiparticle self-consistent QPGW and partially self-consistent QPGW$_0$ methodologies. We observed consistent trends across Cr-based and other 2D materials compared by advanced GW calculations, suggesting that single-shot G$_0$W$_0$@PBE can provide reasonable estimates of fundamental gaps when applied with caution. While this approach shows promise for a variety of 2D materials, including complicated antiferromagnetic chromium-based transition metal carbides (MXenes), further research is required to validate its reliability for strongly correlated systems. In contrast, the G$_0$W$_0$@HSE06 approach may strongly overestimate gaps in some cases.</description>

      <title>Transparent Correlated Metallic Perovskites with Conducive Chemical Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript presents a working model linking chemical disorder and transport properties in correlated-electron perovskites with high-entropy formulations and a framework to actively design them. We demonstrate this new learning in epitaxial Sr$x$(Ti,Cr,Nb,Mo,W)O$3$ thin films that exhibit exceptional crystalline fidelity despite a diverse chemical formulation where most B-site species are highly misfit with respect to valence and radius. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy confirm a unique combination of chemical disorder and structural perfection in thick epitaxial layers. This combination produces significant electron correlation, low electrical resistivity, and an optical transparency window that surpasses that of constituent end-members, with a flattened frequency- and temperature-dependent response. We address the computational challenges of modeling such systems and investigate short-range ordering using cluster expansion. These results showcase that unusual d-metal combinations access an expanded property design space that is predictable using end-member characteristics -- though unavailable to them -- thus offering performance advances in optical, spintronic, and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Relationships between Nanoporous Structures and Electrochemical Performance in MOF Supercapacitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of supercapacitors is impeded by the unclear relationships between nanoporous electrode structures and electrochemical performance, primarily due to challenges in decoupling the complex interdependencies of various structural descriptors. While machine learning (ML) techniques offer a promising solution, their application is hindered by the lack of large, unified databases. Herein, we use constant-potential molecular simulation to construct a unified supercapacitor database with hundreds of metal-organic framework (MOF) electrodes. Leveraging this database, well-trained decision-tree-based ML models achieve fast, accurate, and interpretable predictions of capacitance and charging rate, experimentally validated by a representative case. SHAP analyses reveal that specific surface area (SSA) governs gravimetric capacitance while pore size effects are minimal, attributed to the strong dependence of electrode-ion coordination on SSA rather than pore size. SSA and porosity, respectively, dominate volumetric capacitance in 1D-pore and 3D-pore MOFs, pinnacling the indispensable effects of pore dimensionality. Meanwhile, porosity is found to be the most decisive factor in the charging rate for both 1D-pore and 3D-pore MOFs. Especially for 3D-pore MOFs, an exponential increase with porosity is observed in both ionic conductance and in-pore ion diffusion coefficient, ascribed to loosened ion packing. These findings provide profound insights for the design of high-performance supercapacitor electrodes.</description>

      <title>Tuning topologically nontrivial states in the BHT-Ni metal organic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using first principles calculations, we have demonstrated the creation of multiple quantum states, in the experimentally accessible metal organic framework BHT-Ni. Specifically, quantum spin Hall and quantum anomalous Hall states are induced by two and four electron doping, respectively. The geometrical symmetry breaking, is also investigated. For a low electron doping concentration of two electrons per unit cell, the Fermi energy shifts to a nontrivial band gap, between Dirac bands and a quantized spin Hall conductivity is predicted. Subsequently in a high electron doping concentration, Anomalous Hall conductivity with a quantized value was observed. In addition, for centrosymmetric (trans-like) and non-centrosymmetric (cis-like) structures, we found that the trans-like structure preserves quantum spin Hall and quantized spin Hall conductivity. In contrast, in the cis-like structure, space inversion symmetry breaking leads to the appearance of valley Hall effect and the disappearance of spin Hall conductivity.</description>

      <title>Rapid, Comprehensive Search of Crystalline Phases from X-ray Diffraction in Seconds via GPU-Accelerated Bayesian Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In analysis of X-ray diffraction data, identifying the crystalline phase is important for interpreting the material. The typical method is identifying the crystalline phase from the coincidence of the main diffraction peaks. This method identifies crystalline phases by matching them as individual crystalline phases rather than as combinations of crystalline phases, in the same way as the greedy method. If multiple candidates are obtained, the researcher must subjectively select the crystalline phases. Thus, the identification results depend on the researcher's experience and knowledge of materials science. To solve this problem, we have developed a Bayesian estimation method to identify the combination of crystalline phases, taking the entire profile into account. This method estimates the Bayesian posterior probability of crystalline phase combinations by performing an approximate exhaustive search of all possible combinations. It is a method for identifying crystalline phases that takes into account all peak shapes and phase combinations. However, it takes a few hours to obtain the analysis results. The aim of this study is to develop a Bayesian method for crystalline phase identification that can provide results in seconds, which is a practical calculation time. We introduce variational sparse estimation and GPU computing. Our method is able to provide results within 10 seconds even when analysing $2^{50}$ candidate crystalline phase combinations. Furthermore, the crystalline phases identified by our method are consistent with the results of previous studies that used a high-precision algorithm.</description>

      <title>Edge-Dependent Step-Flow Growth Mechanism in $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ (100) Facet at the Atomic Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homoepitaxial step-flow growth of high-quality $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ thin films is essential for the advancement of high-performance Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$-based devices. In this work, the step-flow growth mechanism of $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ (100) facet is explored by machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations. Our results reveal that Ga adatoms and Ga-O adatom pairs, with their high mobility, are the primary atomic species responsible for efficient surface migration on the (100) facet. The asymmetric monoclinic structure of $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ induces a distinct two-stage Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier for Ga adatoms at the [00$\overline{1}$] step edge, contributing to the suppression of double-step and hillock formation. Furthermore, a miscut towards [00$\overline{1}$] does not induce the nucleation of stable twin boundaries, whereas a miscut towards [001] leads to the spontaneous formation of twin boundaries. This research provides meaningful insights not only for high-quality $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ homoepitaxy but also the step-flow growth mechanism of other similar systems.</description>

      <title>Mixed atomic-scale electronic configuration as a strategy to avoid cocatalyst utilization in photocatalysis by high-entropy oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance the activity of photocatalysts for hydrogen production and CO2 conversion, noble metal cocatalysts as electron traps and/or acceptors such as platinum or gold are usually utilized. This study hypothesizes that mixing elements with heterogeneous electronic configurations and diverse electronegativities can provide both acceptor and donor sites of electrons to avoid using cocatalysts. This hypothesis was examined in high-entropy oxides (HEOs), which show high flexibility for atomic-scale compositional changes by keeping their single-or dual-phase structure. A new highentropy oxide was designed and synthesized by mixing elements with an empty d orbital (titanium, zirconium, niobium and tantalum) and a fully occupied d orbital (gallium). The oxide, synthesized by high-pressure torsion followed by calcination, had two phases (88 wt% orthorhombic (Pbcn) and 12 wt% monoclinic (I2/m)) with an overall composition of TiZrNbTaGaO10.5. It exhibited UV and visible light absorbance with a low bandgap of 2.5 eV, low radiative electron-hole recombination and oxygen vacancy generation due to mixed valences of cations. It successfully acted as a photocatalyst for CO and CH4 production from CO2 conversion and hydrogen production from water splitting without cocatalyst addition. These findings confirm that introducing heterogeneous electronic configurations and electronegativities can be considered as a design criterion to avoid the need to use cocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Tunable spin and orbital torques in Cu-based magnetic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current-induced torques originating from earth-abundant 3d elements offer a promising avenue for low-cost and sustainable spintronic memory and logic applications. Recently, orbital currents -- transverse orbital angular momentum flow in response to an electric field -- have been in the spotlight since they allow current-induced torque generation from 3d transition metals. Here, we report a comprehensive study of the current-induced spin and orbital torques in Cu-based magnetic heterostructures. We show that high torque efficiencies can be achieved in engineered Ni80Fe20/Cu bilayers where Cu is naturally oxidized, exceeding the ones found in the archetypical Co/Pt. Furthermore, we demonstrate sign and amplitude control of the damping-like torque by manipulating the oxidation state of Cu via solid-state gating. Our findings provide insights into the interplay between charge, spin, and orbital transport in Cu-based heterostructures and open the door to the development of gate-tunable spin-orbitronic devices.</description>

      <title>Which chromium-sulfur compounds exist as 2D material?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) chromium-sulfides are synthesized by molecular beam epitaxy using graphene as a substrate. Structure characterization by employing scanning tunneling microscopy and low energy electron diffraction indicates that there are two 2D phases, Cr$_2$S$_3$-2D and Cr$_{2\frac{2}{3}}$S$_4$-2D, which have not been reported before. Cr$_{2\frac{2}{3}}$S$_4$-2D is related to bulk Cr$_5$S$_6$, but thinner than a bulk unit cell. For Cr$_2$S$_3$-2D, an even thinner material, no bulk counterpart exists. Both 2D materials are found to be structurally stable under ambient conditions and exhibit interesting electronic properties. Extensive first-principles calculations provide further insight into the electronic structure of these systems and indicate that they should be magnetic. Surprisingly, CrS$_2$ recently reported from density functional theory calculations and experiments could not be fabricated.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity in layered bismuth oxide down to 1 nanometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic-scale ferroelectrics are of great interest for high-density electronics, particularly field-effect transistors, low-power logic, and nonvolatile memories. We devised a film with a layered structure of bismuth oxide that can stabilize the ferroelectric state down to 1 nanometer through samarium bondage. This film can be grown on a variety of substrates with a cost-effective chemical solution deposition. We observed a standard ferroelectric hysteresis loop down to a thickness of ~1 nanometer. The thin films with thicknesses that range from 1 to 4.56 nanometers possess a relatively large remanent polarization from 17 to 50 microcoulombs per square centimeter. We verified the structure with first-principles calculations, which also pointed to the material being a lone pair-driven ferroelectric material. The structure design of the ultrathin ferroelectric films has great potential for the manufacturing of atomic-scale electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Exploring the wettability of liquid iron on refractory oxides with sessile drop technique and density-functional derived Hamaker constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The macroscopic interactions of liquid iron and solid oxides, such as alumina, calcia, magnesia, silica, and zirconia manifest the behavior and efficiency of high-temperature metallurgical processes. The oxides serve dual roles, both as components of refractory materials in submerged entry nozzles and also as significant constituents of non-metallic inclusions in the melt. It is therefore crucial to understand the physicochemical interplay between the liquid and the oxides in order to address the nozzle clogging challenges, and thereby optimize cast iron and steel production. This paper presents a methodology for describing these interactions by combining the materials' dielectric responses, computed within the density functional theory, with the Casimir-Lifshitz dispersion forces to generate the Hamaker constants. The approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the wettability of iron against these refractory oxides, revealing the complex relation between molecular and macroscopic properties. Our theoretically determined crystalline structures are confirmed by room-temperature X-ray diffraction, and the contact angles of liquid iron on the oxides are validated with a sessile drop system at the temperature 1823 K. For comparison, we also present the wettability of the oxides by a liquid tin-bismuth alloy. The findings are essential in advancing the fundamental understanding of interfacial interactions in metallurgical science, and are also pivotal in driving the development of more efficient and reliable steelmaking processes.</description>

      <title>Advancements and Challenges in Sintering Cr4+:YAG Ceramics: A Comprehensive Review on Transparent Ceramic Technology for Q-switched Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resent progress in the technology of transparent ceramics extends the application of CW and pulsed lasers. The parameters of the transparent ceramics are comparable with the single crystals both for active elements (Nd:YAG, Yb:YAG, etc.) and passive Q-switchers such as Cr4+:YAG. Despite the reaching of considerable progress, the sintering of Cr4+:YAG remains a challenge up to now. Up to the present the influence of the CaO, MgO and Cr2O3 additives on the sintering process is poorly understander. Moreover, there is an absence of the unified model of Cr4+ ions formations in YAG ceramics. This factor limits the progress in the development of Cr4+:YAG ceramics. This review focused on the influence of the single additives and their combinations on the sintering trajectory of tetravalent chromium - doped YAG ceramics and the Cr4+ ions formation.</description>

      <title>Annealing-Induced Magnetic Modulation in Co- and Y-doped CeO2: Insights from Experiments and DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential applications of dilute magnetic oxides (DMOs) in magneto-optic and spintronic devices have attracted significant attention, although understanding their magnetic behavior is complex due to intricate interactions of intrinsic defects. The present study aims to investigate the effect of different annealing environments on the magnetic properties of polycrystalline transition metal cation (Co and Y) doped CeO2 DMO with a 5% doping concentration of transition metal (TM). The objective is to investigate the defect interactions within the lattice through a comprehensive investigation involving structural characterizations, magnetic measurements, and first principle calculations. The results show that the Ar/H2 annealing environment induced more oxygen vacancies than air-annealed samples. Consequently, field-dependent magnetization measurements revealed above-room-temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) in both un-doped and TM-doped CeO2. The ferromagnetic (FM) properties of CeO2 resulted from carrier-trapped vacancy centers facilitating exchange interactions between the spins of magnetic ions. The Langevin field profile indicated that TM-doped CeO2 formed more bound magnetic polarons (BMPs) during annealing in an Ar/H2 environment, which contributed to the enhanced ferromagnetism. Similarly, enhancement in the magnetic properties with increasing oxygen vacancies is observed through first principle calculations. This suggests the potential for optimizing the magnetic properties of DMOs through controlled annealing processes.</description>

      <title>Mixed anion control of enhanced negative thermal expansion in the oxysulfide of PbTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rare physical property of negative thermal expansion (NTE) is intriguing because materials with large NTE over a wide temperature range can serve as high-performance thermal expansion compensators. However, applications of NTE are hindered by the fact that most of the available NTE materials show small magnitudes of NTE, and/or NTE occurs only in a narrow temperature range. Herein, for the first time, we investigated the effect of anion substitution instead of general Pb/Ti-site substitutions on the thermal expansion properties of a typical ferroelectric NTE material, PbTiO3. Intriguingly, the substitution of S for O in PbTiO3 further increases the tetragonality of PbTiO3. Consequently, an unusually enhanced NTE with an average volumetric coefficient of thermal expansion $\bar{\alpha}_V$ = -2.50 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$/K was achieved over a wide temperature range (300 -- 790 K), which is contrasted to that of pristine PbTiO3 ($\bar{\alpha}_V$ = -1.99 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$/K RT -- 763 K). The intensified NTE is attributed to the enhanced hybridization between Pb/Ti and O/S atoms by the substitution of S, as evidenced by our theoretical investigations. We therefore demonstrate a new technique for introducing mixed anions to achieve large NTE over a wide temperature range in PbTiO3-based ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Data Analytics Techniques in Reflection High Energy Electron Diffraction to Enable Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite oxides such as LaFeO$_3$ are a well-studied family of materials that possess a wide range of useful and novel properties. Successfully synthesizing perovskite oxide samples usually requires a significant number of growth attempts and a detailed film characterization on each sample to find the optimal growth window of a material. The most common real-time \textit{in situ} diagnostic technique available during molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) synthesis is reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED). Conventional use of RHEED allows a highly experienced operator to determine growth rate by monitoring intensity osciallations and make some qualitative observations during growth, such as recognizing the sample has become amorphous or recognizing that large islands have formed on the surface. However, due to a lack of theoretical understanding of the diffraction patterns, finer, more precise levels of observations are challenging. To address these limitations, we implement new data analytics techniques in the growth of three LaFeO$_3$ samples on Nb-doped SrTiO$_3$ by MBE. These techniques improve our ability to perform unsupervised machine learning using principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering by using drift correction to overcome sample or stage motion during growth and intensity transformations that highlight more subtle features in the images such as Kikuchi bands. With this approach, we enable the first demonstration of PCA and k-means across multiple samples, allowing for quantitative comparison of RHEED videos for two LaFeO$_3$ film samples. These capabilities set the stage for real-time processing of RHEED data during growth to enable machine learning-accelerated film synthesis.</description>

      <title>Probing the Quantized Berry Phases in 1H-NbSe$_2$ Using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topologically trivial insulators are classified into two primary categories: unobstructed and obstructed atomic insulators. While both types can be described by exponentially localized Wannier orbitals, a defining feature of obstructed atomic insulators is that the centers of charge of these orbitals are positioned at empty sites within the unit cell, rather than on atoms. Despite extensive theoretical predictions, the unambiguous and quantitative experimental identification of an obstructed atomic phase has remained elusive. In this work, we present the first direct experimental evidence of such a phase in 1H-NbSe$_2$. We develop a novel method to extract the inter-orbital correlation functions from the local spectral function probed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), leveraging the orbital wave functions obtained from ab initio calculations. Applying this technique to STM images, we determine the inter-orbital correlation functions for the atomic band of 1H-NbSe$_2$ that crosses the Fermi level. Our results show that this band realizes an optimally compact obstructed atomic phase, providing the first unambiguous experimental identification of such a phase. Our approach of deconvolving the STM signal using ab initio orbital wave functions is broadly applicable to other material platforms, offering a powerful tool for exploring other electronic phases.</description>

      <title>Physics-Aware POD-Based Learning for Ab initio QEM-Galerkin Simulations of Periodic Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum nanostructures offer crucial applications in electronics, photonics, materials, drugs, etc. For accurate design and analysis of nanostructures and materials, simulations of the Schrodinger or Schrodinger-like equation are always needed. For large nanostructures, these eigenvalue problems can be computationally intensive. One effective solution is a learning method via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), together with ab initio Galerkin projection of the Schrodinger equation. POD-Galerkin projects the problem onto a reduced-order space with the POD basis representing electron wave functions (WFs) guided by the first principles in simulations. To minimize training effort and enhance robustness of POD-Galerkin in larger structures, the quantum element method (QEM) was proposed previously, which partitions nanostructures into generic quantum elements. Larger nanostructures can then be constructed by the trained generic quantum elements, each of which is represented by its POD-Galerkin model. This work investigates QEM-Galerkin thoroughly in multi-element quantum-dot (QD) structures on approaches to further improve training effectiveness and simulation accuracy and efficiency for QEM-Galerkin. To further improve computing speed, POD and Fourier bases for periodic potentials are also examined in QEM-Galerkin simulations. Results indicate that, considering efficiency and accuracy, the POD potential basis is superior to the Fourier potential basis even for periodic potentials. Overall, QEM-Galerkin offers more than a 2-order speedup in computation over direct numerical simulation for multi-element QD structures, and more improvement is observed in a structure comprising more elements.</description>

      <title>Landauer resistivity dipole at one dimensional defect revealed via near-field photocurrent nanoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental question how to describe Ohmic resistance at the nanoscale has been answered by Landauer in his seminal picture of the so-called Landauer resistivity dipole. This picture has been theoretically well understood, however experimentally there are only few studies due to the need for a non-invasive local probe. Here we use the nanometer lateral resolution of near-field photocurrent imaging to thoroughly characterize a buried monolayer - bilayer graphene interface as an ideal one dimensional defect for the Landauer resistivity dipole. Via systematic tuning of the overall charge carrier density and the current flow we are able to detect the formation of Landauer resistivity dipoles due to charge carrier accumulation around the one dimensional defects. We found that, for Fermi energy values near the charge neutrality point (i.e. at low hole or electron doping), the photocurrent exhibits the same polarity as the applied source-drain voltage, which is consistent with changes in carrier concentration induced by the Landauer resistivity dipoles. This signature is no longer evident at higher charge carrier density in agreement with the performed numerical calculations. Photocurrent nanoscopy can thus serve as non-invasive technique to study local dissipation at hidden interfaces.</description>

      <title>Singular Spectrum Analysis of Time-series Data from Time-dependent density-functional theory in Real-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a spectral analysis of time-seires data derived from real-time time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) using Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). TDDFT is a robust method for obtaining molecular excited states and optical spectra by tracking the time evolution of dynamical dipole moments. However, the spectral resolution can be compromised when Fourier transformation's total time duration is insufficient. SSA enabled the extraction of specific oscillation components from the time-series data, facilitating the generation of higher-precision spectra. Even with relatively short time-series dataset, the predictive extension of SSA yielded high-resolution spectra, demonstrating substantial agreement with results obtained through conventional methods. The efficacy of this approach was validated for several small molecules, including ethylene, benzene, and others. SSA's ability to conduct detailed spectral anasysis in specific energy regions enhance spectral resolution and facilitates the clarification of oscillation components within these regions. Real-time TDDFT combined with SSA provides a new analytical method for analyzing the optical properties of molecules, significantly improving the accuracy of the analysis of emission and absorption spectra analysis. This method is expected to have various applications.</description>

      <title>At low temperatures, glass-forming liquids relax in a simple way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glass-forming liquids have only a modest tendency to crystallize and hence their dynamics can be studied even below the melting temperature. The relaxation dynamics of most of these liquids shows at a temperature $T_c$, somewhat above the glass-transition temperature $T_g$, a crossover, which indicates the conjunction of two different dynamical regimes. For temperatures slightly above $T_c$, experiments and computer simulations have extensively probed this dynamics on the particle level and identified several universal scaling laws that are often compatible with theoretical predictions. Using large scale computer simulations we extend these studies to temperatures below $T_c$ and find that the relaxation mechanism is qualitatively different from the one found at higher temperatures. We identify new scaling laws that allow to give a simple description of the relaxation dynamics at very low $T$s. Specifically we reveal that the cage-escape process is related to rare but large particle displacements that give rise to a distinctive sub-diffusive power-law in the time correlation functions. This insight helps to advance our understanding on the relaxation dynamics of glass-forming systems at temperatures that are close to the experimental glass transition.</description>

Abstract: The optical conductivity and the relevant electronic excitation processes are investigated in topologically-nontrivial MXenes, Mo$_2$HfC$_2$O$_2$ and W$_2$HfC$_2$O$_2$, utilizing first-principles calculation and effective model analysis. The numerical calculation based on the first-principles band structure reveals the presence of several characteristic features in the spectrum of optical conductivity as a function of photon energy. The drastic dependence on the photon polarization angle is also presented in terms of apparent features. In this paper, an effective model is also generated referring to the crystal symmetries and applied to reveal the microscopic origin of the characteristics. Then, it is shown that some features are strongly related to parity inversion between the conduction and valence bands, the key signature in electronic structures of topologically nontrivial insulators.</description>

      <title>Magnetically induced deformation of isotropic magneto-active elastomers and its relation to the magnetorheological effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can isotropic Magneto-Active Elastomers (MAEs) undergo giant magnetically induced deformations and exhibit huge magnetorheological effects simultaneously? In this experimental and theoretical study, we reveal how the macroscopic deformation of MAEs relates to the process of particle restructuring caused by application of a magnetic field. For this purpose, MAE cylinders with different aspect ratios and particle loadings are studied in uniform magnetic fields. The axial deformations of the cylinders are acquired using an optical camera. A unified mean-field model proposed in previous studies is adapted to describe the transition of initially isotropic cylinders into transversely isotropic ones. This mechanical transition is caused by the rearrangement of particles into dense columnar structures aligned with the field and is believed to result in a huge magnetorheological effect. Our model however predicts less than three-fold increase in elastic moduli when evaluated along the field direction. This prediction is based on a careful examination of the shear moduli of studied MAEs and the columnar structures. A weak magnetorheological effect explains significant axial deformations measured in the field direction. A strong magnetorheological effect would hinder axial deformations due to an increase in modulus by several orders of magnitude. Not only are the moduli and macroscopic deformations influenced by microstructure evolution, but so is the magnetization of particles, which increases as they rearrange into dense columns. With this study, we show that the unified mean-field model provides quantitative access to hidden material properties such as magnetization and stiffness in MAE samples with different shapes and evolving microstructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the modeling of longitudinal strain waves in a rod composed of a nonlinear viscoelastic material characterized by frequency-dependent second- and third-order elastic constants. We demonstrate that long waves in such a material can be effectively described by a damped Boussinesq-type equation for the longitudinal strain, incorporating dissipation through retarded operators. Using the existing theory of solitary wave solutions in nearly integrable systems, we derive a slowly-decaying strain soliton solution to this equation. The derived soliton characteristics are shown to be in a good agreement with results from full 3D simulations. We demonstrate the importance of taking into account the frequency dependence of third-order elastic constants for the description of strain solitons.</description>

      <title>Stacking disorder in novel ABAC-stacked brochantite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In geometrically frustrated magnetic systems, weak interactions or slight changes to the structure can tip the delicate balance of exchange interactions, sending the system into a different ground state. Brochantite, Cu$_4$SO$_4$(OH)$_6$, has a copper sublattice composed of distorted triangles, making it a likely host for frustrated magnetism, but exhibits stacking disorder. The lack of synthetic single crystals has limited research on the magnetism in brochantite to powders and natural mineral crystals. We grew crystals which we find to be a new polytype with a tendency toward ABAC stacking and some anion disorder, alongside the expected stacking disorder. Comparison to previous results on natural mineral specimens suggests that cation disorder is more deleterious to the magnetism than anion and stacking disorder. Our specific heat data suggest a double transition on cooling into the magnetically ordered state.</description>

      <title>Competing structures in a minimal double-well potential model of condensed matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The microscopic structure of several amorphous substances often reveals complex patterns such as medium- or long-range order, spatial heterogeneity, and even local polycrystallinity. To capture all these features, models usually incorporate a refined description of the particle interaction that includes an ad hoc design of the inside of the system constituents, and use temperature as a control parameter. We show that all these features can emerge from a minimal athermal two-dimensional model where particles interact isotropically by a double-well potential, which includes an excluded volume and a maximum coordination number. The rich variety of structural patterns shown by this simple geometrical model apply to a wide range of real systems including water, silicon, and different amorphous materials.</description>

      <title>Peculiar magnetism and magneto-transport properties in a non-centrosymmetric self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet Cr5Te8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trigonal Cr5Te8, a self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet with an out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy, has long been known to crystallize in a centrosymmetric structure. However, optical second harmonic generation experiments, together with comprehensive structural analysis, indicate that this compound rather adopts a non-centrosymmetric structure. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy reveals the presence of N\'eel-type skyrmions, consistent with its non-centrosymmetric structure. A large anomalous Hall conductivity of 102 ohm^-1cm^-1 at low temperature stems from intrinsic origin, which is larger than any previously reported values in the bulk Cr-Te system. Notably, spontaneous topological Hall resistivity arising from the skyrmionic phase has been observed. Our findings not only elucidate the unique magnetic and magneto-transport properties of non-centrosymmetric trigonal Cr5Te8, but also open new avenues for investigating the effects of broken inversion symmetry on material properties and their potential applications.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Behavior of High-Permittivity Gate Dielectrics: The Impact of the Atomic Layer Deposition Temperature and the Lithographic Patterning Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dielectrics featuring a high relative permittivity, i.e., high-k dielectrics, have become the standard insulators in gate architectures, enhancing the electrical performance of both room temperature and cryogenic electronics. This study delves into the cryogenic (3 K) performance of high-k dielectrics commonly used as gate insulators. We fabricated Al2O3 and HfO2 layers via Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and we extrapolated relative permittivity (k) and dielectric strength (E_BD) from AC (100 Hz to 100 kHz) and DC measurements on metal-insulator-metal capacitors. Our findings reveal a strong dependence of HfO2 cryogenic performance on the ALD growth temperature, while the latter shows a negligible impact on Al2O3. We estimated a ~9 % and ~14 % reduction of the relative permittivity of HfO2 and Al2O3, respectively, from 300 K to 3 K. Additionally, we designed and fabricated Al2O3/HfO2 bilayers and we checked their properties at cryogenic temperatures. The study also investigates the impact of the patterning method, namely, UV or electron-beam lithography (acceleration voltage of 10, 20, or 30 kV), on the high-k dielectric properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20456v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets are defined as magnetic states with fully compensated spin angular momenta (spins) and broken PT (P: parity, T: time reversal, PT: parity times time reversal) symmetry. We classify three kinds of altermagnets: M-type: broken T symmetry and nonzero net magnetic moments, S-type: broken T symmetry and zero net magnetic moments, and A-type: unbroken T and broken P symmetries. Furthermore, strong altermagnets have spin split bands through exchange coupling in the non-relativistic limit, i.e., for zero spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and weak altermagnets has spin split bands only with non-zero SOC. These strong vs. weak altermagnets can be identified from the total number of symmetric orthogonal spin rotation operations. These classifications of altermagnets will be an essential guidance for the future research on altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>The impact of strain on the GeV-color center in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Color centers in diamond, such as the GeV center, are promising candidates for quantum-based applications. Here, we investigate the impact of strain on the zero-phonon line (ZPL) position of GeV$^0$. Both hydrostatic and linear strain are modeled using density functional theory for GeV$^0$ concentrations of $1.61$ \% down to $0.10$ \%. We present qualitative and quantitative differences between the two strain types: for hydrostatic tensile and compressive strain, red-and blue-shifted ZPL positions are expected, respectively, with a linear relation between the ZPL shift and the experienced stress. By calculating the ZPL shift for varying GeV$^0$ concentrations, a shift of $0.15$ nm/GPa ($0.38$ meV/GPa) is obtained at experimentally relevant concentrations using a hybrid functional. In contrast, only red-shifted ZPL are found for tensile and compressive linear strain along the $\langle100\rangle$ direction. The calculated ZPL shift exceeds that of hydrostatic strain by at least one order of magnitude, with a significant difference between tensile and compressive strains: $3.2$ and $4.8$ nm/GPa ($8.1$ and $11.7$ meV/GPa), respectively. In addition, a peak broadening is expected due to the lifted degeneracy of the GeV$^0$ $e_g$ state, calculated to be about $6$ meV/GPa. These calculated results are placed in perspective with experimental observations, showing values of ZPL shifts and splittings of comparable magnitude.</description>

      <title>How quantum selection rules influence the magneto-optical effects of driven, ultrafast magnetization dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrafast magnetization dynamics driven by ultrashort pump lasers is typically explained by changes in electronic populations and scattering pathways of excited conduction electrons. This conventional approach overlooks the fundamental role of quantum mechanical selection rules, governing transitions from core states to the conduction band, that forms the key method of the probing step in these experiments. By employing fully ab initio time-dependent density functional theory, we reveal that these selection rules profoundly influence the interpretation of ultrafast spin dynamics at specific probe energies. Our analysis for hcp Co and fcc Ni at the M edge demonstrates that the transient dynamics, as revealed in pump-probe experiments, arise from a complex interplay of optical excitations of the M shell. Taking into account the selection rules and conduction electron spin flips, this leads to highly energy-dependent dynamics. These findings address longstanding discrepancies in experimental TMOKE measurements and show that only through meticulous consideration of matrix elements at the probe stage, can one ensure that magnetization dynamics is revealed in its true nature, instead of being muddled by artifacts arising from the choice of probe energy.</description>

      <title>Ion correlations explain kinetic selectivity in diffusion-limited solid state synthesis reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Establishing viable solid-state synthesis pathways for novel inorganic materials remains a major challenge in materials science. Previous pathway design methods using pair-wise reaction approaches have navigated the thermodynamic landscape with first-principles data but lack kinetic information, limiting their effectiveness. This gap leads to suboptimal precursor selection and predictions, especially for reactions forming competing phases with similar formation energies, where ion diffusion is a critical influence. Here, we demonstrate an inorganic synthesis framework by incorporating machine learning-derived transport properties through "liquid-like" product layers into a thermodynamic cellular reaction model. In the Ba-Ti-O system, known for its competitive polymorphism, we obtain accurate predictions of phase formation with varying BaO:TiO2 ratios as a function of time and temperature. We find that diffusion-thermodynamic interplay governs phase compositions, with cross-ion transport coefficients critical for predicting diffusion-limited selectivity. This work bridges length and time scales by integrating solid-state reaction kinetics with first-principles thermodynamics and spatial reactivity.</description>

      <title>On the engineering of higher-order Van Hove singularities in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The properties of correlated electron materials are often intricately linked to Van Hove singularities (VHS) in the vicinity of the Fermi energy. The class of these VHS is of great importance, with higher-order ones -- with power-law divergence in the density of states -- leaving frequently distinct signatures in physical properties. We use a new theoretical method to detect and analyse higher-order VHS (HOVHS) in two-dimensional materials and apply it to the electronic structure of the surface layer of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. We then constrain a low energy model of the VHS of the surface layer of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ against angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and quasiparticle interference data to analyse the VHS near the Fermi level. We show how these VHS can be engineered into HOVHS.</description>

      <title>Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra of spinon, doublon, and quarton excitations of a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg trimer chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the excitation spectra of a spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg trimer spin chain by employing a combination of numerical and theoretical techniques. Utilizing the Krylov-space correction-vector method in density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), we calculate both the direct and indirect resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra for the trimer spin chain. To interpret the observed features in the RIXS spectra, we perform a theoretical perturbative analysis to compute the energy dispersions which are then utilized to determine the density of states (DOS) for both the single-particle and the two-particle excitation spectra. Our results show that the single-particle continua of the direct RIXS spectrum align with the energy levels observed in the DOS spectra of spinon, doublon, and quarton excitations. Furthermore, the two-particle continua are revealed in the indirect RIXS process, where all possible single particle excitations combine to form the various two-particle excitations of the trimer spin chain. Based on our calculations, we propose the RIXS mechanism of generating the fractionalized (spinon) and collective (doublon and quarton) excitations in the trimer spin chain at both the $L$-edge and the $K$-edge, including discussing the interplay of these excitations in the RIXS spectrum for various trimer coupling strength. The computed energy range of the excitations suggest the possibility of experimental detection at both the $L$-edge and the $K$-edge within the current capabilities of RIXS instrumentation resolution.</description>
