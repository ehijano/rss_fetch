      <title>Subspace Constrained Variational Bayesian Inference for Structured Compressive Sensing with a Dynamic Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of recovering a structured sparse signal from a linear observation model with an uncertain dynamic grid in the sensing matrix. The state-of-the-art expectation maximization based compressed sensing (EM-CS) methods, such as turbo compressed sensing (Turbo-CS) and turbo variational Bayesian inference (Turbo-VBI), have a relatively slow convergence speed due to the double-loop iterations between the E-step and M-step. Moreover, each inner iteration in the E-step involves a high-dimensional matrix inverse in general, which is unacceptable for problems with large signal dimensions or real-time calculation requirements. Although there are some attempts to avoid the high-dimensional matrix inverse by majorization minimization, the convergence speed and accuracy are often sacrificed. To better address this problem, we propose an alternating estimation framework based on a novel subspace constrained VBI (SC-VBI) method, in which the high-dimensional matrix inverse is replaced by a low-dimensional subspace constrained matrix inverse (with the dimension equal to the sparsity level). We further prove the convergence of the SC-VBI to a stationary solution of the Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization problem. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed SC-VBI algorithm can achieve a much better tradeoff between complexity per iteration, convergence speed, and performance compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Virtual Full-Duplex Wireless Communications with Zero-Interval Modulation and Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a virtual full-duplex (VFD) technique with zero-interval modulation and sampling (ZIMS), where two half-duplex (HD) transceivers can simultaneously transmit signals and each transceiver can effectively receive the desired information. In ZIMS-VFD, the transceiver inserts a zero-interval for each symbol in the transmit signal and provides self-interference (SI)-free intervals for itself. Meanwhile, it samples the receive signal in the provided SI-free intervals and restores the desired symbols. Based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), we formulate the system model and show the transmit signal structure. Then, we give the transceiver design for single input single output (SISO) ZIMS-VFD and extend it to multiple input multiple output (MIMO) communications. Numerical results verify our theoretical analyses and show that ZIMS-VFD can effectively increase the capacity and approach the FD without SI.</description>

      <title>Multi-Frequency Resonant Circuit Based Multi-User Emergency Through-the-Earth Communication with Magnetic Induction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic induction (MI) is an effective technique in emergency through-the-earth communications due to the higher penetration efficiency and lower propagation loss as compared with electromagnetic wave communication. How to cancel the interference between different users and enhance the effectiveness of multi-user transmissions is imperative for the practical application of MI communication. In this paper, we use multi-frequency resonant circuit to establish multiple resonant frequencies for MI communication. The transmissions corresponding to different users operate at different resonant frequencies and multi-user interferences can be naturally mitigated. Numerical results verify our theoretical analyses and show that the proposed system can significantly enhance the performance.</description>

      <title>Efffcient Sensing Parameter Estimation with Direct Clutter Mitigation in Perceptive Mobile Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate sensing parameter estimation in the presence of clutter in perceptive mobile networks (PMNs) that integrate radar sensing into mobile communications. Performing clutter suppression before sensing parameter estimation is generally desirable as the number of sensing parameters can be signiffcantly reduced. However, existing methods require high-complexity clutter mitigation and sensing parameter estimation, where clutter is ffrstly identiffed and then removed. In this correspondence, we propose a much simpler but more effective method by incorporating a clutter cancellation mechanism in formulating a sparse signal model for sensing parameter estimation.
  In particular, clutter mitigation is performed directly on the received signals and the unitary approximate message passing (UAMP) is leveraged to exploit the common support for sensing parameter estimation in the formulated sparse signal recovery problem. Simulation results show that, compared to state-of-theart methods, the proposed method delivers signiffcantly better performance while with substantially reduced complexity.</description>

      <title>The Analytic Stockwell Transform and its Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent original line of research in time--frequency analysis has shifted the interest in energy maxima toward zeros. Initially motivated by the intriguing uniform spread of the zeros of the spectrogram of white noise, it has led to fruitful theoretical developments combining probability theory, complex analysis and signal processing. In this vein, the present work proposes a characterization of the zeros of the Stockwell Transform of white noise, which consists in an hybrid time--frequency multiresolution representation. First of all, an analytic version of the Stockwell Transform is designed. Then, analyticity is leveraged to establish a connection with the hyperbolic Gaussian Analytic Function, whose zero set is invariant under the isometries of the Poincar\'e disk. Finally, the theoretical spatial statistics of the zeros of the hyperbolic Gaussian Analytic Function and the empirical statistics of the zeros the Analytic Stockwell Transform of white noise are compared through intensive Monte Carlo simulations, supporting the established connection. A publicly available documented Python toolbox accompanies this work.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation for 5G-UAV Based Emergency Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For unforeseen natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods, etc., the traditional communication infrastructure is unavailable or seriously disrupted along with persistent secondary disasters. Under such circumstances, it is highly demanded to deploy emergency wireless communication (EWC) networks to restore connectivity in accident/incident areas. The emerging fifth-generation (5G)/beyond-5G (B5G) wireless communication system, like unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted networks and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) based communication systems, are expected to be designed or re-farmed for supporting temporary high quality communications in post-disaster areas. However, the channel characteristics of post-disaster areas quickly change as the secondary disaster resulted topographical changes, imposing new but critical challenges for EWC networks. In this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous $\mathcal{F}$ composite fading channel model for EWC networks which accurately models and characterizes the composite fading channel with reflectors, path-loss exponent, fading, and shadowing parameters in 5G-UAV based EWC networks. Based on the model, we develop the optimal power allocation scheme with the simple closed-form expression and the numerical results based optimal joint bandwidth-power allocation scheme. We derive the corresponding capacities and compare the energy efficiency between IRS and traditional relay based 5G-UAVs. Numerical results show that the new heterogeneous Fisher-Snedecor $\mathcal{F}$ composite fading channel adapted resource allocation schemes can achieve higher capacity and energy efficiency than those of traditional channel model adapted resource allocation schemes, thus providing better communications service for post-disaster areas.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communication with Extremely Large-Scale Antenna Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a near-field integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system with extremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA), in which a base station (BS) deployed with enormous number of antennas transmits wireless signals to communicate with multiple communication users (CUs) and simultaneously uses the echo signals to localize multiple point targets in the three-dimension (3D) space. To balance the performance tradeoff between communication and target localization, we design the transmit covariance matrix at the BS to optimize the localization performance while ensuring the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at individual CUs. In particular, we formulate three design problems by considering different 3D localization performance metrics, including minimizing the sum Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB), maximizing the minimum target illumination power, and maximizing the minimum target echo signal power. Although the three design problems are non-convex in general, we obtain their global optimal solutions via the technique of semi-definite relaxation (SDR). It is shown that the three problems have low-rank solution structures depending on the sensing and communication channel matrices, helping reduce the complexity of the SDR-based solutions. Interestingly, we find that in the special case with a single collocated target/CU present towards the middle of a symmetric uniform planar array (UPA), the optimal solutions to the three problems become identical to the SINR-maximization design and have a closed form, while in other cases they can be different in general. Besides, when the target/CU moves away from the transmitter/receiver, the CRB may first decrease and then increase. These two phenomena differ from those in the far-field. Numerical results show the benefits of the proposed designs for near-field ISAC, by exploiting the beam focusing capabilities of ELAA.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Scalable Anomalous Reflectors through Ray Tracing and Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we elaborate on the concept of scalable anomalous reflector (AR) to analyze the angular response, frequency response, and spatial scalability of a designed AR across a broad range of angles and frequencies. We utilize theoretical models and ray tracing simulations to investigate the communication performance of two different-sized scalable finite ARs, one smaller configuration with 48 x 48 array of unit cells and the other constructed by combining four smaller ARs to form a larger array with 96 x 96 unit cells. To validate the developed theoretical approach, we conducted measurements in an auditorium to evaluate the received power through an AR link at different angles and frequencies. In addition, models of scalable deflectors are implemented in the MATLAB ray tracer to simulate the measurement scenario. The results from theoretical calculations and ray tracing simulations achieve good agreement with measurement results.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmit and Jamming Power Optimization for Secrecy in Energy Harvesting Networks: A Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of joint allocation of transmit and jamming power at the source and destination, respectively, to enhance the long-term cumulative secrecy performance of an energy-harvesting wireless communication system until it stops functioning in the presence of an eavesdropper. The source and destination have energy-harvesting devices with limited battery capacities. The destination also has a full-duplex transceiver to transmit jamming signals for secrecy. We frame the problem as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) problem and propose a reinforcement learning-based optimal joint power allocation (OJPA) algorithm that employs a policy iteration (PI) algorithm. Since the optimal algorithm is computationally expensive, we develop a low-complexity sub-optimal joint power allocation (SJPA) algorithm, namely, reduced state joint power allocation (RSJPA). Two other SJPA algorithms, the greedy algorithm (GA) and the naive algorithm (NA), are implemented as benchmarks. In addition, the OJPA algorithm outperforms the individual power allocation (IPA) algorithms termed individual transmit power allocation (ITPA) and individual jamming power allocation (IJPA), where the transmit and jamming powers, respectively, are optimized individually. The results show that the OJPA algorithm is also more energy efficient. Simulation results show that the OJPA algorithm significantly improves the secrecy performance compared to all SJPA algorithms. The proposed RSJPA algorithm achieves nearly optimal performance with significantly less computational complexity marking it the balanced choice between the complexity and the performance. We find that the computational time for the RSJPA algorithm is around 75 percent less than the OJPA algorithm.</description>

      <title>Fusion and Cross-Modal Transfer for Zero-Shot Human Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite living in a multi-sensory world, most AI models are limited to textual and visual interpretations of human motion and behavior. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) provide a salient signal to understand human motion; however, they are challenging to use due to their uninterpretability and scarcity of their data. We investigate a method to transfer knowledge between visual and inertial modalities using the structure of an informative joint representation space designed for human action recognition (HAR). We apply the resulting Fusion and Cross-modal Transfer (FACT) method to a novel setup, where the model does not have access to labeled IMU data during training and is able to perform HAR with only IMU data during testing. Extensive experiments on a wide range of RGB-IMU datasets demonstrate that FACT significantly outperforms existing methods in zero-shot cross-modal transfer.</description>

      <title>DeepCell: A Ubiquitous Accurate Provider-side Cellular-based Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although outdoor localization is already available to the general public and businesses through the wide spread use of the GPS, it is not supported by low-end phones, requires a direct line of sight to satellites and can drain phone battery quickly. The current fingerprinting solutions can provide high-accuracy localization but are based on the client side. This limits their ubiquitous deployment and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce DeepCell: a provider-side fingerprinting localization system that can provide high accuracy localization for any cell phone. To build its fingerprint, DeepCell leverages the unlabeled cellular measurements recorded by the cellular provider while opportunistically synchronizing with selected client devices to get location labels. The fingerprint is then used to train a deep neural network model that is harnessed for localization. To achieve this goal, DeepCell need to address a number of challenges including using unlabeled data from the provider side, handling noise and sparsity, scaling the data to large areas, and finally providing enough data that is required for training deep models without overhead. Evaluation of DeepCell in a typical realistic environment shows that it can achieve a consistent median accuracy of 29m. This accuracy outperforms the state-of-the-art client-based cellular-based systems by more than 75.4%. In addition, the same accuracy is extended to low-end phones.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communication with Nested Array: Beam Pattern and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Towards the upcoming 6G wireless networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been identified as one of the typical usage scenarios. To further enhance the performance of ISAC, increasing the number of antennas as well as array aperture is one of the effective approaches. However, simply increasing the number of antennas will increase the cost of radio frequency chains and power consumption. To address this issue, in this paper, we consider an uplink ISAC system with nested array deployed at the base station. Nested array is a classic sparse array architecture that is able to enlarge the array aperture without increasing the number of physical antennas. While nested array for wireless sensing has been extensively studied, its potential for ISAC system has not been fully exploited. To fill this gap, in this paper, we provide the beam pattern analysis of nested arrays, and derive the closed-form expressions for the three beam pattern metrics, namely, the main lobe beam width, peak-to-local-minimum ratio, and prominent side lobes height. Extensive simulation results are provided to show that compared with conventional uniform arrays, nested arrays can achieve higher communication performance for densely located users while maintaining its advantage of sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For unforeseen emergencies, such as natural disasters and pandemic events, it is highly demanded to cope with the explosive growth of mobile data traffic in extremely critical environments. An Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) fleet is an effective way to facilitate the Emergency wireless COmmunication NETwork (EcoNet). In this article, a MUlti-tier Heterogeneous UAV Network (MuHun), which is with different UAV fleets in different altitudes, is proposed to flexibly serve various emergencies. We refresh the key performance indicators of full coverage, network capacity, low latency, and energy efficiency in harsh environments. Then, we present the special challenges regarding shadowing-dominated complex channel model, energy supply limited short-endurance, various communication mechanisms coexistence, and communication island for underground users in UAV-based EcoNet, followed by the MuHun-based EcoNet architecture and its advantages. Furthermore, some potential solutions such as the new hybrid-channel adapted resource allocation, reconfigurable intelligent surface assisted UAV communications, competitive heterogenous-networks, and magnetic induction based air-to-ground/underground communications are discussed to effectively achieve full coverage, high capacity, high energy efficiency, and diverse qualities of services for EcoNets in harsh environments.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficiency Optimization in Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial UAV-Enabled Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) into satellite-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks offers an effective solution for enhancing connectivity. In this setup, UAVs serve as access points (APs) of a terrestrial CF-mMIMO network extending the satellite network capabilities, thereby ensuring robust, high-quality communication links. In this work, we propose a successive convex approximation algorithm for maximizing the downlink energy efficiency (EE) at the UAVs under per-UAV power budget and user quality-of-service constraints. We derive a closed-form expression for the EE that accounts for maximum-ratio transmission and statistical channel knowledge at the users. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in maximizing the EE at the UAV layer. Moreover, we observe that a few tens of UAVs transmitting with a fine-tuned power are sufficient to empower the service of satellite networks and significantly increase the spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>Geometry-preserving Lie Group Integrators For Differential Equations On The Manifold Of Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08842v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many applications, one encounters signals that lie on manifolds rather than a Euclidean space. In particular, covariance matrices are examples of ubiquitous mathematical objects that have a non Euclidean structure. The application of Euclidean methods to integrate differential equations lying on such objects does not respect the geometry of the manifold, which can cause many numerical issues. In this paper, we propose to use Lie group methods to define geometry-preserving numerical integration schemes on the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices. These can be applied to a number of differential equations on covariance matrices of practical interest. We show that they are more stable and robust than other classical or naive integration schemes on an example.</description>

This study introduces four innovative strategies to enhance smartphone-based photoplethysmography for BP estimation (SPW-BP), addressing the interpretability-accuracy dilemma. First, we employ often-neglected data-quality improvement techniques, such as height normalization, corrupt data removal, and boundary signal reconstruction. Second, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of thirty waveform indicators across three categories to identify the most predictive features. Third, we use SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to ensure the transparency and explainability of machine learning outcomes. Fourth, we utilize Bland-Altman analysis alongside AAMI and BHS standards for comparative evaluation. Data from 127 participants demonstrated a significant correlation between smartphone-captured waveform features and those from standard BP monitoring devices. Employing multiple linear regression within a cross-validation framework, waveform variables predicted systolic blood pressure (SBP) with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.08-16.64 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) with an MAE of 2.86-13.16 mmHg. Further application of Random Forest models significantly improved the prediction MAE for SBP to 2.61-15.21 mmHg and for DBP to 2.14-11.22 mmHg, indicating enhanced predictive accuracy. Correlation and SHAP analysis identified key features for improving BP estimation. However, Bland-Altman analysis revealed systematic biases, and MAE analysis showed that the results did not meet AAMI and BHS accuracy standards. Our findings highlight the potential of SPW-BP, yet suggest that smartphone PPG technology is not yet a viable alternative to traditional medical devices for BP measurement.</description>

Abstract: Digital Twin has emerged as a promising paradigm for accurately representing the electromagnetic (EM) wireless environments. The resulting virtual representation of the reality facilitates comprehensive insights into the propagation environment, empowering multi-layer decision-making processes at the physical communication level. This paper investigates the digitization of wireless communication propagation, with particular emphasis on the indispensable aspect of ray-based propagation simulation for real-time Digital Twins. A benchmark for ray-based propagation simulations is presented to evaluate computational time, with two urban scenarios characterized by different mesh complexity, single and multiple wireless link configurations, and simulations with/without diffuse scattering. Exhaustive empirical analyses are performed showing and comparing the behavior of different ray-based solutions. By offering standardized simulations and scenarios, this work provides a technical benchmark for practitioners involved in the implementation of real-time Digital Twins and optimization of ray-based propagation models.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna-Assisted Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Systems</title>

Abstract: This paper examines a fluid antenna (FA)-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system. Unlike traditional SWIPT systems with fixed-position antennas (FPAs), our FA-assisted system enables dynamic reconfiguration of the radio propagation environment by adjusting the positions of FAs. This capability enhances both energy harvesting and communication performance. The system comprises a base station (BS) equipped with multiple FAs that transmit signals to an energy receiver (ER) and an information receiver (IR), both equipped with a single FA. Our objective is to maximize the communication rate between the BS and the IR while satisfying the harvested power requirement of the ER. This involves jointly optimizing the BS's transmit beamforming and the positions of all FAs. To address this complex convex optimization problem, we employ an alternating optimization (AO) approach, decomposing it into three sub-problems and solving them iteratively using first and second-order Taylor expansions. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed FA-assisted SWIPT system, demonstrating significant performance improvements over traditional FPA-based systems.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Interference Mitigation for Uplink NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13841</link>

Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has become a promising technology for next-generation wireless communications systems due to its capability to provide access for multiple users on the same resource. In this paper, we consider an uplink power-domain NOMA system aided by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) in the presence of a jammer that aims to maximize its interference on the base station (BS) uplink receiver. We consider two kinds of RISs, a regular RIS whose elements can only change the phase of the incoming wave, and an RIS whose elements can also attenuate the incoming wave. Our aim is to minimize the total power transmitted by the user terminals under quality-of-service constraints by controlling both the propagation from the users and the jammer to the BS with help of the RIS. The resulting objective function and constraints are both non-linear and non-convex, so we address this problem using numerical optimization. Our numerical results show that the RIS can help to dramatically reduce the per user required transmit power in an interference-limited scenario.</description>

      <title>Robust Beamforming for RIS-aided Communications: Gradient-based Manifold Meta Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has become a promising technology to realize the programmable wireless environment via steering the incident signal in fully customizable ways. However, a major challenge in RIS-aided communication systems is the simultaneous design of the precoding matrix at the base station (BS) and the phase shifting matrix of the RIS elements. This is mainly attributed to the highly non-convex optimization space of variables at both the BS and the RIS, and the diversity of communication environments. Generally, traditional optimization methods for this problem suffer from the high complexity, while existing deep learning based methods are lack of robustness in various scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce a gradient-based manifold meta learning method (GMML), which works without pre-training and has strong robustness for RIS-aided communications. Specifically, the proposed method fuses meta learning and manifold learning to improve the overall spectral efficiency, and reduce the overhead of the high-dimensional signal process. Unlike traditional deep learning based methods which directly take channel state information as input, GMML feeds the gradients of the precoding matrix and phase shifting matrix into neural networks. Coherently, we design a differential regulator to constrain the phase shifting matrix of the RIS. Numerical results show that the proposed GMML can improve the spectral efficiency by up to 7.31\%, and speed up the convergence by 23 times faster compared to traditional approaches. Moreover, they also demonstrate remarkable robustness and adaptability in dynamic settings.</description>

      <title>PAPR Reduction with Pre-chirp Selection for Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a promising new multicarrier technique for high-mobility communications based on discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT). By properly tuning the pre-chirp parameter and the post-chirp parameter in the DAFT, the effective channel in the DAFT domain can completely circumvent path overlap, thereby constituting a full representation of delay-Doppler profile. However, AFDM has a crucial problem of high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), stemming from randomness of modulated symbols. In this letter, a novel algorithm named grouped pre-chirp selection (GPS) is proposed to reduce PAPR by strategically varying the pre-chirp parameter across subcarrier groups. Initially, it is established that key AFDM properties are maintained when implementing GPS. Next, we proceed to detail the operational procedures of the GPS algorithm, elucidating its principle for PAPR reduction and emphasizing its computational efficiency advantages. Finally, simulation results employing the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) validate the effectiveness of the proposed GPS in reducing PAPR.</description>
