      <title>A Comprehensive Review: Applicability of Deep Neural Networks in Business Decision Making and Market Prediction Investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Big data, both in its structured and unstructured formats, have brought in unforeseen challenges in economics and business. How to organize, classify, and then analyze such data to obtain meaningful insights are the ever-going research topics for business leaders and academic researchers. This paper studies recent applications of deep neural networks in decision making in economical business and investment; especially in risk management, portfolio optimization, and algorithmic trading. Set aside limitation in data privacy and cross-market analysis, the article establishes that deep neural networks have performed remarkably in financial classification and prediction. Moreover, the study suggests that by compositing multiple neural networks, spanning different data type modalities, a more robust, efficient, and scalable financial prediction framework can be constructed.</description>

      <title>Testing Capacity-Constrained Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the first general test of capacity-constrained learning models. Cognitive economic models of this type share the common feature that constraints on perception are exogenously fixed, as in the widely used fixed-capacity versions of rational inattention (Sims 2003) and efficient coding (Woodford 2012). We show that choice data are consistent with capacity-constrained learning if and only if they satisfy a No Improving (Action or Attention) Switches (NIS) condition. Based on existing experiments in which the incentives for being correct are varied, we find strong evidence that participants fail NIS for a wide range of standard perceptual tasks: identifying the proportion of ball colors, recognizing shapes, and counting the number of balls. However, we find that this is not true for all existing perceptual tasks in the literature, which offers insights into settings where we do or do not expect incentives to impact the extent of attention.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Structures of Knowledge Production: Citation Rates in Hydrogen Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a dynamic patent citation network model to explain the established link between network structure and technological improvement rate. This model, a type of survival model, posits that the *dynamic* network structure determines the *constant* improvement rate, requiring consistent structural reproduction over time. The model's hazard rate, the probability of a patent being cited, represents "knowledge production," reflecting the output of new patents given existing ones. Analyzing hydrogen technology patents, we find distinct subdomain knowledge production rates, but consistent development across subdomains. "Distribution" patents show the lowest production rate, suggesting dominant "distribution" costs in $H_2$ pricing. Further modeling shows Katz-centrality predicts knowledge production, outperforming subdomain classification. Lower Katz centrality in "distribution" suggests inherent organizational differences in invention. Exploitative learning (within-subdomain citations) correlates with higher patenting opportunity costs, potentially explaining slower "distribution" development, as high investment needs may incentivize monopolization over knowledge sharing.</description>

      <title>Can the Nexus of Scaling Laws Coupled with Constant or Variable Elasticity of Substitution Predict AI and Other Technology Adoption?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent technologies such as solar power, electric vehicles, and artificial intelligence (AI) often exhibit exponential or power function price declines and various ``S-curves'' of adoption. We show that under CES and VES utility, such price and adoption curves are functionally linked. When price declines follow Moore's, Wright's and AI scaling "Laws,'' the S-curve of adoption is Logistic or Log-Logistic whose slope depends on the interaction between an experience parameter and the elasticity of substitution between the incumbent and emergent good. These functional relations can serve as a building block for more complex models and guide empirical specifications of technology adoption.</description>

      <title>The Weitzman Premium on the Social Cost of Carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preference heterogeneity massively increases the social cost of carbon. We call this the Weitzman premium. Uncertainty about an exponential discount rate implies a hyperbolic discount rate, which in the near term is equal to the average discount rate but in the long term falls to the minimum discount rate. We calibrate the pure rate of time preference and the inverse of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution of 79,273 individuals from 76 countries and compute the corresponding social cost of carbon. Compared to the social cost of carbon for average time preferences, the average social cost of carbon is 6 times as large in the base calibration, and up to 200 times as large in sensitivity analyses.</description>

      <title>The Solo Revolution: A Theory of AI-Enabled Individual Entrepreneurship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the AI Enabled Individual Entrepreneurship Theory (AIET), a theoretical framework explaining how artificial intelligence technologies transform individual entrepreneurial capability. The theory identifies two foundational premises: knowledge democratization and resource requirements evolution. Through three core mechanisms skill augmentation, capital structure transformation, and risk profile modification AIET explains how individuals can now undertake entrepreneurial activities at scales previously requiring significant organizational infrastructure. The theory presents five testable propositions addressing the changing relationship between organizational size and competitive advantage, the expansion of individual entrepreneurial capacity, the transformation of market entry barriers, the evolution of traditional firm advantages, and the modification of entrepreneurial risk profiles. Boundary conditions related to task characteristics and market conditions define the theory's scope and applicability. The framework suggests significant implications for entrepreneurship theory, organizational design, and market structure as AI capabilities continue to advance. This theory provides a foundation for understanding the evolving landscape of entrepreneurship in an AI-enabled world.</description>

      <title>Can AI Solve the Peer Review Crisis? A Large Scale Experiment on LLM's Performance and Biases in Evaluating Economics Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether artificial intelligence can address the peer review crisis in economics by analyzing 27,090 evaluations of 9,030 unique submissions using a large language model (LLM). The experiment systematically varies author characteristics (e.g., affiliation, reputation, gender) and publication quality (e.g., top-tier, mid-tier, low-tier, AI generated papers). The results indicate that LLMs effectively distinguish paper quality but exhibit biases favoring prominent institutions, male authors, and renowned economists. Additionally, LLMs struggle to differentiate high-quality AI-generated papers from genuine top-tier submissions. While LLMs offer efficiency gains, their susceptibility to bias necessitates cautious integration and hybrid peer review models to balance equity and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Price formation without fuel costs: the interaction of demand elasticity with storage bidding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studies looking at electricity market designs for very high shares of wind and solar often conclude that the energy-only market will break down. Without fuel costs, it is said that there is nothing to set prices. Symptoms of breakdown include long phases of zero prices, scarcity prices too high to be politically acceptable, prices that collapse under small perturbations of capacities from the long-term equilibrium, cost recovery that is impossible due to low market values, high variability of revenue between different weather years, and difficulty operating long-term storage with limited foresight. We argue that all these problems are an artefact of modelling with perfectly inelastic demand. If short-term elasticity to reflect today's flexible demand (-5%) is implemented, these problems are reduced. The interaction of demand willingness to pay and storage opportunity costs is enough to produce stable pricing. This behavior is illustrated by a model with wind, solar, batteries, and hydrogen-based storage, where the price duration curve is smoothed with a piecewise linear demand curve. This removes high price peaks, reduces the fraction of zero-price hours from 90% to around 30%, and guarantees more price stability for perturbations of capacity and different weather years. Furthermore, we show that with demand elasticity, the long-term optimisation model exactly reproduces the prices of the short-term model with the same capacities. We then use insights from the long-term model to derive simple bidding strategies for storage so that we can also run the short-term model with limited operational foresight. We demonstrate this short-term operation in a model optimised using 35 years of weather data and then tested on another 35 years of unseen data. We conclude that the energy-only market can still play a key role in coordinating dispatch and investment in the future.</description>

      <title>Global Public Sentiment on Decentralized Finance: A Spatiotemporal Analysis of Geo-tagged Tweets from 150 Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi) are reshaping global financial systems. Despite their impact, the spatial distribution of public sentiment and its economic and geopolitical determinants are often overlooked. This study analyzes over 150 million geo-tagged, DeFi-related tweets from 2012 to 2022, sourced from a larger dataset of 7.4 billion tweets. Using sentiment scores from a BERT-based multilingual classification model, we integrated these tweets with economic and geopolitical data to create a multimodal dataset. Employing techniques like sentiment analysis, spatial econometrics, clustering, and topic modeling, we uncovered significant global variations in DeFi engagement and sentiment. Our findings indicate that economic development significantly influences DeFi engagement, particularly after 2015. Geographically weighted regression analysis revealed GDP per capita as a key predictor of DeFi tweet proportions, with its impact growing following major increases in cryptocurrency values such as bitcoin. While wealthier nations are more actively engaged in DeFi discourse, the lowest-income countries often discuss DeFi in terms of financial security and sudden wealth. Conversely, middle-income countries relate DeFi to social and religious themes, whereas high-income countries view it mainly as a speculative instrument or entertainment. This research advances interdisciplinary studies in computational social science and finance and supports open science by making our dataset and code available on GitHub, and providing a non-code workflow on the KNIME platform. These contributions enable a broad range of scholars to explore DeFi adoption and sentiment, aiding policymakers, regulators, and developers in promoting financial inclusion and responsible DeFi engagement globally.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Viral Nature of Toxicity in Competitive Online Video Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Toxicity is a widespread phenomenon in competitive online video games. In addition to its direct undesirable effects, there is a concern that toxicity can spread to others, amplifying the harm caused by a single player's misbehavior. In this study, we estimate whether and to what extent a player's toxic speech spreads, causing their teammates to behave similarly. To this end, we analyze proprietary data from the free-to-play first-person action game Call of Duty: Warzone. We formulate and implement an instrumental variable identification strategy that leverages the network of interactions among players across matches. Our analysis reveals that all else equal, all of a player's teammates engaging in toxic speech increases their probability of engaging in similar behavior by 26.1 to 30.3 times the average player's likelihood of engaging in toxic speech. These findings confirm the viral nature of toxicity, especially toxic speech, in competitive online video games.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Generative AI for Economic Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use generative AI to extract managerial expectations about their economic outlook from over 120,000 corporate conference call transcripts. The overall measure, AI Economy Score, robustly predicts future economic indicators such as GDP growth, production, and employment, both in the short term and to 10 quarters. This predictive power is incremental to that of existing measures, including survey forecasts. Moreover, industry and firm-level measures provide valuable information about sector-specific and individual firm activities. Our findings suggest that managerial expectations carry unique insights about economic activities, with implications for both macroeconomic and microeconomic decision-making.</description>
