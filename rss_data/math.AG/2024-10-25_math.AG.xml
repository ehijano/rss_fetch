      <title>A Step towards Computational Derived Algebraic Geometry: The RepHomology Package For Macaulay2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the \verb|Macaulay2| package \verb|RepHomology| for the computations of representation homology of certain spaces. The main methods implement computing the representation homology of surfaces (with group coefficients, and analogies with algebra and Lie algebra coefficients), and the representation homology of link complements.</description>

      <title>Group actions and irrationality in surface families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rationality specializes in families of surfaces, even with mild singularities. In this paper, we study the analogous question for the degree of irrationality. We prove a specialization result when the degree of irrationality on the generic fiber arises from the quotient by a group action.</description>

      <title>The noncommutative MMP for blowup surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the noncommutative minimal model program for blowups of surfaces. The program, as defined by Halpern-Leistner, is designed to construct a quasiconvergent path in the space of Bridgeland stability conditions. In this paper, we construct a family of quasi-convergent paths in the case of blowups of surfaces. These paths provide different semiorthogonal decompositions through parameter transformation.</description>

      <title>Affine holomorphic bundles over $\mathbb{P}^1_\mathbb{C}$ and apolar ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the classification of affine holomorphic bundles over a compact complex manifold $X$ in general, and we apply the general theory to the case $X=\mathbb{P}^1_\mathbb{C}$. We study the moduli space of framed, non-degenerate rank 2 affine bundles over $\mathbb{P}^1_\mathbb{C}$ whose linearisation, viewed as locally free sheaf, is isomorphic to $ {\mathcal O}_{\mathbb{P}^1_\mathbb{C}}(n_1)\oplus {\mathcal O}_{\mathbb{P}^1_\mathbb{C}}(n_2)$ where $n_1&gt;n_2$. We show that this moduli space can be identified with the "topological cokernel" of a morphism of linear spaces over the projective space $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{C}[X_0,X_1]_{l})$ of binary forms of degree $l:= -2-n_2$, in particular it fibres over this projective space with vector spaces as fibres. We show that the stratification of $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{C}[X_0,X_1]_{l})$ defined by the level sets of the fibre dimension map is determined explicitly by $d:= n_1-n_2$ and the cactus rank stratification of $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{C}[X_0,X_1]_{l})$.</description>

      <title>The Kodaira dimension of even spin strata of Abelian differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The even spin components of the strata of Abelian differentials are difficult to handle from a birational geometry perspective due to the fact that their spin line bundles have more sections than expected. Nevertheless, in this paper, we prove that for large genus, the minimal even spin components are of general type. This result complements the previous work by the second and third authors, together with Costantini, on the Kodaira dimension of general strata and the minimal odd spin components of Abelian differentials. Our main technical tool is the computation and estimation of a series of effective divisor classes on the even spin components.</description>

      <title>Nonzero Constant Wronskians of Polynomials and Laurent Polynomials, and Geometric Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the polynomials $p_1(t), ... , p_n(t)$ whose Wronskian $W(p_1, ... , p_n)$ is a nonzero constant. Then, we generalize our results to characterize the Laurent polynomials with the same property. Finally, for rational functions we prove an impossibility result for $n=2$, and pose the case $n \geq 3$ as an open question, although we suggest an impossibility conjecture. Some geometric consequences are derived, especially in the case of polynomials.</description>

      <title>Sub-twistor metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a natural distance function on the period space of a hyperk\"ahler manifold associated to non-holonomic constraints imposed by twistor lines. These metrics were introduced by Verbitsky in the context of the global Torelli theorem for hyperk\"aler manifolds. We show that they are Finsler and explicitly describe their Finsler norms. To achieve this goal we consider a class of distance functions (called here sub-conic metrics) that slightly generalize sub-Riemann metrics. The main technical result is the statement that every sub-conic metric is sub-Finsler. The content and methods of the paper lie within basic metric geometry. The complex geometrical background and motivation are isolated in the appendix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact complex surface. Consider a finitely supported probability measure $\mu$ on $\text{Aut}(X)$ such that $\Gamma_{\mu} = \langle \text{Supp}(\mu)\rangle&lt;\text{Aut}(X)$ is non-elementary. We do not assume that $\Gamma_{\mu}$ contains any parabolic elements. In this paper, we study and classify hyperbolic, ergodic $\mu$-stationary probability measures.</description>

      <title>Lim Cohen-Macaulay sequences of modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a lim Cohen-Macaulay sequence of modules. We prove the existence of such sequences in positive characteristic, and show that their existence in mixed characteristic implies the long open conjecture about positivity of Serre intersection multiplicities for all regular local rings, as well as a new proof of the existence of big Cohen-Macaulay modules. We describe how such a sequence leads to a notion of closure for submodules of finitely generated modules: this family of closure operations includes the usual notion of tight closure in characteristic $p&gt;0$, and all of them have the property of capturing colon ideals. In fact they satisfy axioms formulated by G.~Dietz from which it follows that if a local ring $R$ has a lim Cohen-Macaulay sequence then it has a big Cohen-Macaulay module. We also prove the existence of lim Cohen-Macaulay sequences for certain rings of mixed characteristic.</description>

      <title>Futaki Invariants and Reflexive Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Futaki invariants of the classical moduli space of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories determine whether they have a conformal fixed point in the IR. We systematically compute the Futaki invariants for a large family of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories coming from D3-branes probing Calabi-Yau 3-fold singularities whose bases are Gorenstein Fano surfaces. In particular, we focus on the toric case where the Fano surfaces are given by the 16 reflexive convex polygons and the moduli spaces are given by the corresponding toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds. We study the distribution of and conjecture new bounds on the Futaki invariants with respect to various topological and geometric quantities. These include the minimum volume of the Sasaki-Einstein base manifolds as well as the Chern and Euler numbers of the toric Fano surfaces. Even though the moduli spaces for the family of theories studied are known to be K-stable, our work sheds new light on how the topological and geometric quantities restrict the Futaki invariants for a plethora of moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>Closed real plane curves of hyperelliptic solutions of focusing gauged modified KdV equation of genus three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The real and imaginary parts of the focusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (MKdV) equation defined over the complex field $\mathbb{C}$ give rise to the focusing gauged MKdV (FGMKdV) equations. As a generalization of Euler's elastica whose curvature obeys the focusing static MKdV (FSMKdV) equation, we study real plane curves whose curvature obeys the FGMKdV equation since the FSMKdV equation is a special case of the FGMKdV equation. In this paper, we focus on the hyperelliptic curves of genus three. By tuning some moduli parameters and initial conditions, we show closed real plane curves associated with the FGMKdV equation beyond Euler's figure-eight of elastica.</description>

      <title>Topological 8d $\mathcal{N}=1$ Gauge Theory: Novel Floer Homologies, and $A_\infty$-categories of Six, Five, and Four-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is a continuation of the program initiated in [arXiv:2311.18302]. We show how one can define novel gauge-theoretic (holomorphic) Floer homologies of seven, six, and five-manifolds, from the physics of a topologically-twisted 8d $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theory on a Spin$(7)$-manifold via its supersymmetric quantum mechanics interpretation. They are associated with $G_2$ instanton, Donaldson-Thomas, and Haydys-Witten configurations on the seven, six, and five-manifolds, respectively. We also show how one can define hyperk\"ahler Floer homologies specified by hypercontact three-manifolds, and symplectic Floer homologies of instanton moduli spaces. In turn, this will allow us to derive Atiyah-Floer type dualities between the various gauge-theoretic Floer homologies and symplectic intersection Floer homologies of instanton moduli spaces. Via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the 8d theory, one can derive novel Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-categories that categorify Donaldson-Thomas, Haydys-Witten, and Vafa-Witten configurations on six, five, and four-manifolds, respectively, where an Atiyah-Floer type correspondence for the Donaldson-Thomas case can be established. Last but not least, topological invariance of the theory suggests a relation amongst these Floer homologies and Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-categories for certain Spin$(7)$-manifolds. Our work therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the conjectures by Donaldson-Thomas [2], Donaldson-Segal [3], Cherkis [4], Hohloch-Noetzel-Salamon [5], Salamon [6], Haydys [7], and Bousseau [8], and more.</description>

      <title>Computation of symmetries of rational surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide, first, a general symbolic algorithm for computing the symmetries of a given rational surface, based on the classical differential invariants of surfaces, i.e. Gauss curvature and mean curvature. In practice, the algorithm works well for sparse parametrizations (e.g. toric surfaces) and PN surfaces. Additionally, we provide a specific, also symbolic algorithm for computing the symmetries of ruled surfaces; this algorithm works extremely well in practice, since the problem is reduced to that of rational space curves, which can be efficiently solved by using existing methods. The algorithm for ruled surfaces is based on the fact, proven in the paper, that every symmetry of a rational surface must also be a symmetry of its line of striction, which is a rational space curve. The algorithms have been implemented in the computer algebra system Maple, and the implementations have been made public; evidence of their performance is given in the paper.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study convex elements in a (twisted) Weyl group introduced by Ivanov and the first named author. We show that each conjugacy class of the twisted Weyl group contains a convex element, and moreover, the Steinberg cross-sections exist for all convex elements. This result strictly enlarges the cases of Steinberg cross-sections from a new perspective, and will play an essential role in the study of higher Deligne-Lusztig representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a flat proper morphism of finite presentation between schemes with almost coherent structural sheaves (in the sense of Faltings), we prove that the higher direct images of quasi-coherent and almost coherent modules are quasi-coherent and almost coherent. Our proof uses Noetherian approximation, inspired by Kiehl's proof of the pseudo-coherence of higher direct images. Our result allows us to extend Abbes-Gros' proof of Faltings' main $p$-adic comparison theorem in the relative case for projective log-smooth morphisms of schemes to proper ones, and thus also their construction of the relative Hodge-Tate spectral sequence.</description>

Abstract: We explore the maximality of the Hilbert square of maximal real surfaces, and find that in many cases the Hilbert square is maximal if and only if the surface has connected real locus. In particular, the Hilbert square of no maximal K3-surface is maximal. Nevertheless, we exhibit maximal surfaces with disconnected real locus whose Hilbert square is maximal.</description>

      <title>Length of triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of composition series of triangulated categories. Their lengths yield invariants for these categories. We then focus on composition series of derived categories of certain projective varieties and finite dimensional algebras. We construct composition series of different lengths, for some smooth projective rational surfaces and for certain smooth threefolds. On the other hand, we prove that for derived categories of finite dimensional representations of Dynkin and extended Dynkin quivers, for derived categories of some singular varieties, all composition series have the same length. If this property would also hold for the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^2$ in $10$ general points, then Krah's phantom subcategory would have infinite length. In particular, it would have infinite chain of thick subcategories.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Hyperelliptic Curves in Residue Characteristic 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g$ over a field $K$ of characteristic zero. After extending $K$ we can view it as a marked curve with its $2g+2$ Weierstrass points. We present an explicit algorithm to compute the stable reduction of this marked curve for a valuation of residue characteristic $2$ over a finite extension of $K$. In the cases $g\le2$ we work out relatively simple conditions for the structure of this reduction.</description>

      <title>Moment varieties of the inverse Gaussian and gamma distributions are nondefective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the parameters of a $k$-mixture of inverse Gaussian or gamma distributions are algebraically identifiable from the first $3k-1$ moments, and rationally identifiable from the first $3k+2$ moments. Our proofs are based on Terracini's classification of defective surfaces, careful analysis of the intersection theory of moment varieties, and a recent result on sufficient conditions for rational identifiability of secant varieties by Massarenti--Mella.</description>

      <title>Affine Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials on the subregular cell in non simply-laced Lie algebras: with an application to character formulae (with an appendix by Roman Bezrukavnikov, Vasily Krylov, and Kenta Suzuki)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the techniques in arXiv:2209.08865(1) to the non-simply-laced situation, and calculate explicit special values of parabolic affine inverse Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for subregular nilpotent orbits. We thus obtain explicit character formulas for certain irreducible representations of affine Lie algebras. As particular cases, we compute characters of simple vertex algebras $V_{k}(\mathfrak{g})$ for $k=-1,\ldots,-b$, where $b$ is the largest label of the highest short coroot $\theta^\vee$. Conjecturally, all ordinary modules over $V_{-b}(\mathfrak{g})$ are covered by our computations. As an application, we obtain the explicit formulas for flavoured Schur indices of rank one Argyres-Douglas 4d SCFTs with flavour symmetry $G_2$ and $B_3$. Our results are proved using the geometry of the Springer resolution. We identify the cell quotient of the anti-spherical module over $\widehat{W}$ corresponding to the subregular cell with a certain one-dimensional extension of a module defined by Lusztig. We describe the canonical basis in this module geometrically and present an explicit description of the corresponding objects in the derived category of equivariant coherent sheaves on the Springer resolution. They correspond to irreducible objects in the heart of a certain $t$-structure that we describe using an equivariant version of the derived McKay correspondence.</description>
