      <title>Privacy-Preserving Hamming Distance Computation with Property-Preserving Hashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of approximating Hamming distance in sublinear time under property-preserving hashing (PPH), where only hashed representations of inputs are available. Building on the threshold evaluation framework of Fleischhacker, Larsen, and Simkin (EUROCRYPT 2022), we present a sequence of constructions with progressively improved complexity: a baseline binary search algorithm, a refined variant with constant repetition per query, and a novel hash design that enables constant-time approximation without oracle access. Our results demonstrate that approximate distance recovery is possible under strong cryptographic guarantees, bridging efficiency and security in similarity estimation.</description>

      <title>A Galois-Theoretic Complexity Measure for Solving Systems of Algebraic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications of algebraic geometry, we introduce the Galois width, a quantity characterizing the complexity of solving algebraic equations in a restricted model of computation allowing only field arithmetic and adjoining polynomial roots. We explain why practical heuristics such as monodromy give (at least) lower bounds on this quantity, and discuss problems in geometry, optimization, statistics, and computer vision for which knowledge of the Galois width either leads to improvements over standard solution techniques or rules out this possibility entirely.</description>

      <title>Exponential Resolution Lower Bounds for Weak Pigeonhole Principle and Perfect Matching Formulas over Sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.00534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show exponential lower bounds on resolution proof length for pigeonhole principle (PHP) formulas and perfect matching formulas over highly unbalanced, sparse expander graphs, thus answering the challenge to establish strong lower bounds in the regime between balanced constant-degree expanders as in [Ben-Sasson and Wigderson '01] and highly unbalanced, dense graphs as in [Raz '04] and [Razborov '03, '04]. We obtain our results by revisiting Razborov's pseudo-width method for PHP formulas over dense graphs and extending it to sparse graphs. This further demonstrates the power of the pseudo-width method, and we believe it could potentially be useful for attacking also other longstanding open problems for resolution and other proof systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Merlin-Arthur proof systems for synthesizing quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01877v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complexity theory typically focuses on the difficulty of solving computational problems using classical inputs and outputs, even with a quantum computer. In the quantum world, it is natural to apply a different notion of complexity, namely the complexity of synthesizing quantum states. We investigate a state-synthesizing counterpart of the class NP, referred to as stateQMA, which is concerned with preparing certain quantum states through a polynomial-time quantum verifier with the aid of a single quantum message from an all-powerful but untrusted prover. This is a subclass of the class stateQIP recently introduced by Rosenthal and Yuen (ITCS 2022), which permits polynomially many interactions between the prover and the verifier. Our main result consists of error reduction of this class and its variants with an exponentially small gap or bounded space, as well as how this class relates to other fundamental state synthesizing classes, i.e., states generated by uniform polynomial-time quantum circuits (stateBQP) and space-uniform polynomial-space quantum circuits (statePSPACE). Furthermore, we establish that the family of UQMA witnesses, considered as one of the most natural candidates for stateQMA containments, is in stateQMA. Additionally, we demonstrate that stateQCMA achieves perfect completeness.</description>

      <title>On the Computational Hardness of Quantum One-Wayness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08363v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a large body of work studying what forms of computational hardness are needed to realize classical cryptography. In particular, one-way functions and pseudorandom generators can be built from each other, and thus require equivalent computational assumptions to be realized. Furthermore, the existence of either of these primitives implies that $\rm{P} \neq \rm{NP}$, which gives a lower bound on the necessary hardness.
  One can also define versions of each of these primitives with quantum output: respectively one-way state generators and pseudorandom state generators. Unlike in the classical setting, it is not known whether either primitive can be built from the other. Although it has been shown that pseudorandom state generators for certain parameter regimes can be used to build one-way state generators, the implication has not been previously known in full generality. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, the existence of one-way state generators has no known implications in complexity theory.
  We show that pseudorandom states compressing $n$ bits to $\log n + 1$ qubits can be used to build one-way state generators and pseudorandom states compressing $n$ bits to $\omega(\log n)$ qubits are one-way state generators. This is a nearly optimal result since pseudorandom states with fewer than $c \log n$-qubit output can be shown to exist unconditionally. We also show that any one-way state generator can be broken by a quantum algorithm with classical access to a $\rm{PP}$ oracle.
  An interesting implication of our results is that a $t(n)$-copy one-way state generator exists unconditionally, for every $t(n) = o(n/\log n)$. This contrasts nicely with the previously known fact that $O(n)$-copy one-way state generators require computational hardness. We also outline a new route towards a black-box separation between one-way state generators and quantum bit commitments.</description>

      <title>Scalable Neighborhood Local Search for Single-Machine Scheduling with Family Setup Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00771v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the task of scheduling jobs on a single machine with sequence dependent family setup times under the goal of minimizing the makespan, that is, the completion time of the last job in the schedule. This notoriously NP-hard problem is highly relevant in practical productions and requires heuristics that provide good solutions quickly in order to deal with large instances. In this paper, we present a heuristic based on the approach of parameterized local search. That is, we aim to replace a given solution by a better solution having distance at most $k$ in a pre-defined distance measure. This is done multiple times in a hill-climbing manner, until a locally optimal solution is reached. We analyze the trade-off between the allowed distance $k$ and the algorithm's running time for four natural distance measures. Example of allowed operations for our considered distance measures are: swapping $k$ pairs of jobs in the sequence, or rearranging $k$ consecutive jobs. For two distance measures, we show that finding an improvement for given $k$ can be done in $f(k) \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ time, while such a running time for the other two distance measures is unlikely. We provide a preliminary experimental evaluation of our local search approaches.</description>
