      <title>First Measurement of the Total Compton Scattering Cross Section between 6 and 11 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The total cross section for Compton scattering off atomic electrons, $\gamma+e\rightarrow\gamma'+e'$, was measured using photons with energies between 6.5 and 11.1~GeV incident on a $^9$Be target as part of the PrimEx-eta experiment in Hall D at Jefferson Lab. This is the first measurement of this fundamental QED process within this energy range. The total uncertainties of the cross section averaged to 3.4% across all energy bins. This not only demonstrates the capability of this experimental setup to perform precision cross-section measurements at forward angles but also allows us to compare with state-of-the-art QED calculations.</description>

      <title>Improved ion bunch quality of conical target irradiated by ultra-intense and ultra-short laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct particle-in-cell simulations to estimate the effects of circularly and linearly polarized SEL 100 PW lasers on flat Th targets with thicknesses of 50 nm, 100 nm and 250 nm, as well as easy to manufacture conical Th targets with angularity either on the left or right. As the thickness of the three types of targets increases and under the same polarized laser, the average energy, maximum energy and energy conversion efficiency of Th ions decrease as it is well-known, and except for the circularly polarized laser hit on the conical target with angularity on the left, the Th ion beam emittance also decreases, while its beam intensity increases conversely. The linearly polarized laser, compared to the circularly polarized laser with the same laser intensity, exhibits higher beam intensity, beam emittance and energy conversion efficiency for the same type and thickness of Th target. The conical Th target with angularity on the left and intermediate thickness, compared to the flat target and conical target with angularity on the right of the same thickness, possesses both higher ion average energy up to 7 GeV and virtually the same beam intensity up to 0.8 MA under the linearly polarized laser. The results lead us to an easier way of controlling laser-accelerated high-quality heavy ion beam by switching to an optimal laser-target configuration scheme, which may enable the synthesis of superheavy nuclei in a high-temperature and high-density extreme plasma environment in astronuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Towards Foundation Models for Experimental Readout Systems Combining Discrete and Continuous Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a (proto) Foundation Model for Nuclear Physics, capable of operating on low-level detector inputs from Imaging Cherenkov Detectors at the future Electron Ion Collider. To address limitations in existing next-token prediction approaches-namely resolution loss from VQ-VAE tokenization and lack of conditional generation-we propose three key innovations: (i) separate vocabularies for discrete spatial features and continuous variates, combined via Causal Multi-Head Cross-Attention (CMHCA), (ii) continuous kinematic conditioning through prepended context embeddings, and (iii) scalable and simple, high-resolution continuous variate tokenization without joint vocabulary inflation. Our model enables fast, high-fidelity generation of pixel and time sequences for Cherenkov photons, validated through closure tests in the High Performance DIRC. We also show our model generalizes to reconstruction tasks such as pion and kaon identification, in which we show its ability to leverage fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Hyperon global polarization in isobar Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polarization of Lambda, Anti-Lambda, Xi, and Anti-Xi hyperons along the angular momentum of the system has been measured in isobar collisions of Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV with the STAR detector at RHIC. The polarization dependence on collision centrality is explored and found to show an increasing trend in more peripheral collisions. Dependencies on transverse momentum and pseudorapidity are investigated for Lambda and Anti-Lambda hyperons, but no significant dependence has been observed. The polarization measurements for Lambda and Anti-Lambda are consistent with each other, indicating little contribution of the spin-magnetic coupling in the observed polarization. The results for Lambda hyperons measurements are qualitatively consistent with hydrodynamic calculations incorporating effects from shear-induced polarization and thermal vorticity, and show no obvious system size dependence in comparison with previous results in Au+Au collisions. For the first time, the dependence of the polarization on the hyperon's emission azimuthal angle with respect to the second harmonic event plane is extracted and shows stronger polarization for the in-plane emitted hyperons at the level of 2.4$\sigma$ significance in 20-50% centrality. The measurements of Xi hyperons polarization via the polarization transfer analysis exhibit a finite positive polarization, 2.9$\sigma$ significance in 20-50% centrality, slightly enhanced compared to the inclusive Lambda polarization.</description>

      <title>$B_c^{\pm}$-$^{12}$C states and detailed study of momentum space method for $\Upsilon$- and $\eta_b$-nucleus bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a detailed study of the $\Upsilon$-, $\eta_b$-, and $B_c$-nucleus systems in momentum space to calculate the bound-state energies and the corresponding coordinate-space radial wave functions. The attractive strong potentials for the meson-nucleus systems are calculated from the Lorentz scalar mass modifications of these mesons in nuclear matter in the local density approximation in the nucleus. The downward shift of the meson masses may be regarded as a signature of partial restoration of chiral symmetry in a nuclear medium applied in the present study in an empirical sense, because the origin of the negative mass shift in this study is not directly related to the chiral symmetry mechanism. Furthermore, as an initial and realistic study, the $B_c^{\pm}$-$^{12}$C bound states are studied for the first time, with the effects of self-consistently calculated Coulomb potentials in $^{12}$C (when the $B_c^{\pm}$ mesons are absent).</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing Using Cold Atoms and Molecules for Nuclear and Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Technologies for manipulating single atoms and molecules have advanced drastically in the past decades. Due to their excellent controllability of internal states, atoms and molecules serves as one of the ideal platforms as quantum systems. One major research direction in atomic systems is the precise determination of energy differences between two energy levels in atoms. This field, known as precision measurement, is symbolized by the remarkable fractional uncertainty of $10^{-18}$ or lower achieved in the state-of-the-art atomic clocks. Two-level systems in atoms are sensitive to various external fields and can therefore be function as quantum sensors. The effect of these fields manifests as energy shifts in the two-level system. Traditionally, such shifts are induced by electric or magnetic fields, as recognized even before the advent of the precision spectroscopy with lasers. However, with high-precision measurements, energy shifts can also be caused by hypothetical fields weakly coupled to ordinary matter, or by small effects mediated by massive particles, which are conventionally dealt with in the field of nuclear and particle physics. In most cases, the atomic systems as quantum sensors have not been sensitive enough to detect such effects. Instead, experiments searching for these interactions have placed constraints on coupling constants, except in a few cases where effects are predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics. Nonetheless, measurements and searches for these effects in atomic systems have led to the emergence of a new field of physics. In some cases, they open new parameter spaces to explore in conventionally investigated topics, e.g., dark matter, fifth force, CP-violation, and other physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Probing Solar Heavy Neutrinos with Heliospheric Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for an excess of electrons and positrons in the interplanetary space from the decays of heavy neutrinos produced in nuclear reactions in the Sun. Using measurements of the electron spectra in the MeV range from the Ulysses and SOHO satellites, we report the strongest direct upper bound to date on the mixing between heavy neutral leptons with MeV masses and electron neutrinos, reaching $U_e^2\simeq 10^{-6}$ at $M_N=10\,$MeV. Our sensitivity is predominantly constrained by the uncertainties in the propagation of electrons and positrons, particularly the diffusion coefficient in the inner Solar System, as well as the uncertainties in the astrophysical background. Enhancing our understanding of either of these factors could lead to a significant improvement in sensitivity.</description>

      <title>QED corrections to the parity-violating asymmetry in high-energy electron-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The parity-violating asymmetry, including leading-order QED corrections to the Coulomb potential, is calculated non-perturbatively by solving the Dirac equation. At GeV collision energies and forward scattering angles, QED effects enhance the asymmetry by approximately 5% for the recently measured nuclei 27Al, 48Ca, and 208Pb. The corrections result in a shift of the estimated neutron radius, leading to an increase in the inferred neutron skin thicknesses of these nuclei and, thus, to the pressure neutrons feel around nuclear saturation density.</description>

      <title>Bremsstrahlung photon contributions to parton energy loss at high virtuality ($Q^2$) : a perturbative calculation at $O(\alpha_{s} \alpha_{em})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02667v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, real photon production scattering kernels from jet-medium interactions in the QCD medium are perturbatively calculated using the higher-twist (HT) formalism. Focus is given towards real photon production from a highly virtual (and highly energetic) quark, taking into account heavy-quark mass scales [Phys. Rev. C 94, 054902 (2016)], fermion-boson conversion processes [Nucl. Phys. A 793, 128-170 (2007)], as well as coherence effects [Phys. Rev. C 105, 024908 (2022)]. A generalized factorization procedure, such as that used in e-A deep-inelastic scattering, is employed to derive an improved single-scattering medium-induced photon emission kernels that go beyond the traditional in-medium gluon exchange approximation. Diagrams with real-photon emission from the hard quark are classified based on the final-state particles, and include two types of scattering kernels at $O(\alpha_{em}\alpha_{s})$ giving the following final states: (i) real photon and real quark, (ii) real photon and real gluon. The collisional kernels, thus derived, include full phase factors from all non-vanishing diagrams and complete second-order derivative terms in the transverse momentum gradient expansion. Moreover, the calculation includes heavy-quark mass effects, thus exploring heavy-quark energy loss. The in-medium parton distribution functions and the related jet transport coefficients have a hard transverse momentum dependence (of the emitted gluon or photon) present within the phase factor. It is observed that the jet transport coefficients resemble the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions.</description>
