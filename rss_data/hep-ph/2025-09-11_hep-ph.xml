      <title>GUMP1.0 -- First global extraction of generalized parton distributions from experiment and lattice data with NLO accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first global extraction of generalized parton distributions (GPDs), GUMP1.0, by combining deeply virtual Compton scattering and $\rho$-meson production data from Jefferson Lab and Hadron-Electron Ring Accelerator with global fits of parton distribution functions, charge form factors, and lattice quantum chromodynamics simulations. Using a conformal moment space parametrization, we achieve a unified description across low- and high-$x$ regions at next to leading order (NLO) accuracy in perturbative corrections. The results provide state-of-the-art GPDs consistent with almost all known facts, enabling three-dimensional nucleon imaging in impact parameter space and, at the same time, establishing a benchmark for future theoretical and experimental studies of the nucleon structure.</description>

      <title>Breaking Dark: Hunting Heavy Decaying Dark Matter with Tibet AS$_\gamma$ and LHAASO-KM2A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements of diffuse sub-PeV gamma-rays by the Tibet AS$_\gamma$ and LHAASO collaborations have reshaped our understanding of the gamma-ray sky. Besides uncovering the nature of `PeVatrons', these measurements can also be used to probe the non-gravitational nature of dark matter. PeV-scale decaying dark matter can produce high-energy gamma rays in the final state and contribute to the measurements made by extensive air-shower detectors like Tibet AS$_\gamma$ and LHAASO. Using the latest Tibet AS$_\gamma$ upper limits on diffuse gamma rays away from the Galactic plane and the LHAASO-KM2A measurements of diffuse gamma rays from the Galactic plane, we put stringent constraints on lifetimes of decaying DM for masses $\sim 10^6 - 10^9$ GeV. Future observations of high-energy diffuse gamma-ray emission can thus provide stronger limits or potentially discover heavy decaying dark matter.</description>

      <title>Testing Viability of Benchmark Dark Matter Models for the Galactic Center Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the status of benchmark simplified dark matter models that have been proposed to explain the GeV gamma-ray Galactic Center excess. We constrain the available parameter space using updated observations from indirect detection, cosmology, direct detection, and accelerators. We show that there is still unconstrained parameter space in both classes of models we consider (a secluded dark sector with a vector portal coupling, and a two-Higgs doublet with a pseudoscalar mediator), and discuss the prospects for potential improvement of these constraints in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Imaging the Jet-Induced Medium Response with Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quark-gluon plasma (QGP), when viewed at length scales of order the inverse of its temperature, behaves as a strongly-coupled liquid. However, when it is probed with sufficiently high momentum transfer, asymptotic freedom mandates the presence of quark- and gluon-like quasi-particles. High energy partons within jets can trigger these high-momentum exchanges, making jets valuable probes for revealing the presence of such quasi-particles. Such elastic scatterings are implemented in the Hybrid Model, where a jet parton that scatters is deflected, kicking a medium parton, which recoils. Before and after a scattering, as one and then both partons propagate through the medium, they lose energy and momentum, exciting wakes in the QGP droplet. We use two-point and three-point energy-energy correlators (EECs) to reveal the relevant angular regions at which (modified) parton showers and wakes in the QGP each dominate, offering a new way with which to visualize and constrain the corresponding dynamics. We compare our calculations to recent CMS and ALICE measurements of two-point EECs of charged-particle tracks in jets produced in PbPb collisions. We show that our calculations are closest to the experimental measurements when elastic scattering is included and when the elastically scattered recoil-partons produce their own wakes. We also propose a new variant of the measurement that is especially sensitive to jet wakes.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Generative Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative networks are perfect tools to enhance the speed and precision of LHC simulations. It is important to understand their statistical precision, especially when generating events beyond the size of the training dataset. We present two complementary methods to estimate the amplification factor without large holdout datasets. Averaging amplification uses Bayesian networks or ensembling to estimate amplification from the precision of integrals over given phase-space volumes. Differential amplification uses hypothesis testing to quantify amplification without any resolution loss. Applied to state-of-the-art event generators, both methods indicate that amplification is possible in specific regions of phase space, but not yet across the entire distribution.</description>

      <title>Constraining Effective Field Theories for dark matter candidates annihilating into gamma-ray lines with CTAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray lines constitute a smoking gun signature for annihilating dark matter particles. Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes and satellites have searched for such signals but null results have been reported thus far. We take advantage of the expected gamma-ray flux sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) toward the direction of the Galactic Centre and Dwarf Galaxies and its exquisite energy resolution to derive upper limits on fermionic and scalar dark matter annihilations into gamma-ray lines. We consider the lowest-order effective operators for scalar and fermion dark matter, and derive limits on the energy scale using the recent CTAO projected sensitivity. Putting our findings into perspective with existing limits from direct and indirect detection experiments, we conclude that CTAO will either play a complementary role or be a discovery channel for dark matter signals.</description>

      <title>Field-theoretic versus data-driven evaluations of electromagnetic corrections to hadronic vacuum polarization in $(g-2)_\mu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model prediction of the muon $g-2$ increasingly depends on lattice QCD computations of the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP), where the isospin-breaking (IB) effects remain a significant source of uncertainty. To complement the lattice QCD evaluations, the data-driven approach to HVP has been used to assess some of the electromagnetic IB effects, in particular from the channels with a photon in the final state, e.g., $e^+e^-\to\pi^0 \gamma$. Here we argue that such contributions are largely canceled by virtual electromagnetic corrections to the purely hadronic channels: $\pi^+ \pi^-$, $\pi^+ \pi^- \pi^0$, etc. We identify these leading corrections by performing a field-theoretical calculation in a vector-meson dominance model, thereby reconciling the timelike and spacelike approaches to electromagnetic effects. Although these virtual corrections are more difficult to extract in a systematic manner, addressing them is essential for the data-driven method to consistently complement the lattice QCD program.</description>

      <title>Flavor physics at high-energy muon colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flavor-breaking interactions due to heavy new physics can be probed at a 10 TeV muon collider in the high-energy production of quarks and leptons. The high collision energy mitigates the suppression of the new interactions, offering sensitivity to interaction scales well above 100 TeV both in the lepton and in the quark sector. We investigate all possible deformations of the Standard Model that produce quadratic growth with energy of the four-fermion scattering amplitudes at the muon collider, and we derive sensitivity projections. Electroweak radiation emission gives access to new observable final states like for instance the production of a charged pair of fermions by the emission of at least one $W$ boson. This, combined with jet flavor tagging, improves the sensitivity and the ability to disentangle different interactions. Currently, the best probes of flavor-breaking new physics are high-intensity low-energy measurements of lepton or hadron decays or oscillations. The high-energy probes of the same interactions at the muon collider are often competitive with current bounds and strongly superior for some class of transitions. The sensitivity extends to operators involving the top quark that cannot be tested at low energy. In addition, muon collider probes are generically less exposed to experimental or theoretical mismodeling uncertainties as they do not target the observation of extremely rare phenomena, nor they rely on extremely accurate measurements and theoretical predictions: the energy enhancement makes the putative effects relatively easy to observe. Muon collider measurements offer a novel pathway towards the exploration of flavor physics at the energy rather than at the intensity frontier.</description>

      <title>Affleck-Dine Leptoflavorgenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scenario to produce large primordial lepton flavor asymmetries with vanishing total lepton asymmetry, based on the Affleck-Dine mechanism with Q-ball formation. This scenario can produce large lepton flavor asymmetries while automatically maintaining the vanishing total lepton number without fine-tuning, evading the current BBN and the CMB constraints by neutrino oscillations at MeV temperature. The asymmetries can be produced at cosmic temperatures of $T\gtrsim 1\ {\rm GeV}$, early enough to have broad impacts from the early Universe to the present cosmology. This scenario could affect various aspects of early Universe cosmology simultaneously or separately: (i) explaining the observed baryon asymmetry by the same origin as the lepton flavor asymmetries, (ii) affecting the nature of the QCD transition, (iii) opening up a new parameter space of sterile neutrino dark matter by enhancing their production, and (iv) altering the abundance of the light elements, in particular, resolving the recently reported helium-4 anomaly.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass and mixing, resonant leptogenesis and charged lepton flavor violation in a minimal seesaw model with $S_4$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a minimal inverse seesaw model with $S_4$ symmetry for the Majorana neutrinos with only one real ($m_0$)-and two complex ($\alpha, \beta$) parameters in neutrino sector which gives reasonable predictions for the neutrino oscillation parameters, the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe and the charged lepton flavor violation. The resulting model reveals a favor for normal neutrino mass ordering, a higher octant of $\theta_{23}$ and a lower half-plane of Dirac CP violation phase. The predictions of the model for sum of neutrino masses and the effective Majorana neutrino mass are centered around 58.98 meV and 6.2 meV, respectively. The model also provides the predictions of the baryon asymmetry and charged lepton flavour violation processes which are consistent with the experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Oblique corrections in general dark $U(1)$ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dark Abelian gauge bosons on the electroweak precision measurements at the one-loop level. The dark gauge boson couples to the standard model fermions generally via two kinds of mixing with the electroweak gauge bosons: the kinetic mixing and the mass mixing. We solve the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the gauge boson propagators and derive a renormalization scheme-independent representation of the scattering amplitudes for four-fermion processes, including the full oblique corrections. We define the running parameters at the one-loop level and show that the leading new physics effects, including the mixing, in the electroweak precision observables can be described by the oblique parameters $S$, $T$, and $U$ as in the standard electroweak gauge theory when the new physics scale is sufficiently high and the dark gauge boson mass lies away from the $Z$ pole. We consider the dark doublet scalar boson as an example and numerically show that a novel one-loop effect can drastically change the parameter region allowed by the electroweak precision tests.</description>

      <title>$T \times \mu$ phase diagram from a fractal NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a $\mu$-dependent coupling for a fractal effective model (FNJL) to make the results for the phase diagram compatible with the experimental data and lattice QCD calculations. The $\mu$-dependence of the coupling, which accounts for gluon effects, is obtained by fitting the lattice QCD results for the pseudo-critical temperature with the fractal model. We then use the new effective coupling in order to compute the dynamical mass, the quark condensate, the thermal susceptibility and, finally, the $T\times\mu$ phase diagram. We consider both extensive and non-extensive statistics, and with a slight variation in the $\mu$-dependent coupling parameters we provide a single result for our model which is able to describe incredibly well the data from STAR, considering the simplicity of the effective model.</description>

      <title>Probing one-loop--induced decay channel $H^\pm \to W^\pm\gamma$ in the Two Higgs Doublet Models at muon-TeV colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the one-loop--induced decay channel $H^{\pm} \rightarrow W^{\pm}\gamma$ in the general $\mathcal{R}_{\xi}$ gauge within Two Higgs Doublet Models. We analytically verify the gauge invariance ($\xi$-independence), ultraviolet finiteness, and renormalization-scale independence of the one-loop form factors, thereby confirming the consistency of our calculations. On the phenomenological side, we perform a parameter scan of the Type-I THDM and, based on the viable parameter space, evaluate the branching ratios of this decay process. Furthermore, we investigate charged Higgs pair production at muon-TeV colliders through the representative processes $\mu^+\mu^- \rightarrow H^{+}H^{-} \rightarrow W^+W^- h\gamma$ and $\mu^+\mu^- \rightarrow \gamma\gamma \rightarrow H^{+}H^{-} \rightarrow W^+W^- h\gamma$, as typical applications of our results. The events for the processes are computed within the allowed parameter regions of the Type-I THDM. The corresponding signal significances are evaluated, including the relevant Standard Model backgrounds, at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 3$~TeV. With the high integrated luminosity expected at muon-TeV colliders, reaching up to $\mathcal{L} = 3000~\text{fb}^{-1}$, our analysis indicates that the signals can be detected with a statistical significance of $5\sigma$ for several benchmark scenarios in the viable parameter space of the Type-I THDM.</description>

      <title>Flavor constraints from $pp\to Vh$ and $pp\to VW$ at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of associated Higgs $pp\to Vh$ and diboson production $pp\to VW$ channels at the LHC (with $V=W,Z$) to constrain flavor-physics operators. Within a general Effective Field Theory (EFT) framework, we derive the helicity amplitudes for these processes at high energies and identify the leading contributions from dimension-six operators involving different quark flavors. Using available LHC data, we show that these processes are sensitive to non-trivial flavor structures and provide complementary constraints to those from low-energy observables. We illustrate this synergy through an explicit comparison between our LHC bounds with electroweak precision data, and with flavor limits derived from charged-current pion and kaon decays. In particular, we show that our HL-LHC projections can probe viable EFT scenarios proposed to accommodate the discrepancies in the extraction of the Cabibbo angle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The substantial data volumes encountered in modern particle physics and other domains of fundamental physics research allow (and require) the use of increasingly complex data analysis tools and workflows. While the use of machine learning (ML) tools for data analysis has recently proliferated, these tools are typically special-purpose algorithms that rely, for example, on encoded physics knowledge to reach optimal performance. In this work, we investigate a new and orthogonal direction: Using recent progress in large language models (LLMs) to create a team of agents -- instances of LLMs with specific subtasks -- that jointly solve data analysis-based research problems in a way similar to how a human researcher might: by creating code to operate standard tools and libraries (including ML systems) and by building on results of previous iterations. If successful, such agent-based systems could be deployed to automate routine analysis components to counteract the increasing complexity of modern tool chains. To investigate the capabilities of current-generation commercial LLMs, we consider the task of anomaly detection via the publicly available and highly-studied LHC Olympics dataset. Several current models by OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5) are investigated and their stability tested. Overall, we observe the capacity of the agent-based system to solve this data analysis problem. The best agent-created solutions mirror the performance of human state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>Integrated subtraction terms and finite remainders for arbitrary processes with massless partons at colliders in the nested soft-collinear subtraction scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present integrated subtraction terms and finite remainders for arbitrary processes with massless partons at hadron and lepton colliders in the context of the nested soft-collinear subtraction scheme. These results provide the very last ingredients needed to make this scheme a fully local, analytic and process-independent framework for treating infrared singularities at next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbative QCD. The explicit infrared finiteness of all required contributions, as well as their process-independence, puts these results on par with subtraction schemes developed for next-to-leading order computations and opens up a clear path towards the automation of next-to-next-to-leading order computations in QCD.</description>

      <title>Light Meson Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a modern pedagogical introduction to light mesons. We discuss their masses and widths, their classification into multiplets of isospin and flavor SU(3), as well as other quantum numbers, mixing schemes, observable states, and their disposition in Regge trajectories. We briefly introduce the relevant concepts of Quantum Chromodynamics, including confinement, chiral symmetry, and the relationship between poles and resonances. We discuss their interpretation in terms of quark-model ordinary quark-antiquark states or non-ordinary states like exotics, multiquarks, or glueballs. Finally, we comment on the open issues that are still under discussion.</description>

      <title>Probing the Axion-Photon-Dark Photon Interaction at Future $e^+e^-$ Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interaction between photons, dark photons, and axions at future lepton colliders, focusing on single-photon events with missing energy as the experimental signature. We find that future facilities such as the ILC, CEPC, and FCC-ee will be sensitive to the axion-photon-dark photon coupling down to the order of $10^{-4}\, {GeV}^{-1}$ for dark photon masses around $O(10~\mathrm{GeV})$, assuming that the axion is extremely light and escapes detection. Existing constraints from LEP II are analyzed for comparison. Furthermore, the mass of dark photon can be determined by measuring the sharp drop-off in the distribution of the recoil mass.</description>

      <title>Testing the Heterotic String with the Axion-Photon Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of an axion-like particle above the QCD line would rule out Grand Unified Theories, including the perturbative heterotic string with the Standard Model embedded in a single $E_8$ factor or $SO(32)$. In this work we study a possible loophole to this observation, given by compactifications of the $E_8\times E_8$ heterotic string with a non-standard embedding of the Standard Model into the 10-dimensional gauge group. If electromagnetism is embedded into both $E_8$ factors, axions can couple to photons via the anomaly without coupling to QCD. We obtain upper bounds to the coupling-to-mass ratio $g_{a\gamma}/m_a$ for these axion-like particles as a function of the supersymmetry breaking scale and the unified gauge coupling. To be compatible with the measured gauge couplings and the weak mixing angle $\sin^2\theta_w$ at low-energies, phenomenologically viable models with non-standard $U(1)_Y$ embedding require sizeable one-loop threshold corrections from string states and/or charged matter at intermediate energy scales. We study how these effects modify the tree-level upper bounds to $g_{a\gamma}/m_a$ and show that, in the perturbative regime, they reduce the leading order estimates. Axion-like particles far above the QCD line are only possible in certain models where perturbation theory is lost. The main conclusion is that the discovery of an axion violating the bounds found in this work would be incompatible with large classes of otherwise phenomenologically viable string models, including the perturbative heterotic $SO(32)$ and $E_8\times E_8$ string, the type-I string, and certain heterotic M-theories. The role of small gauge instantons and worldsheet instantons in making some of the axion-like particles heavy and cosmologically relevant is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Similarities in the evaporation of saturated solitons and black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested some time ago that many black hole properties are not specific to gravity, but rather are shared by a large class of objects, the so-called saturons, that saturate the quantum field theoretic upper bound on microstate degeneracy. By now, various aspects of this universality have been understood and demonstrated in a number of explicit examples. In the present paper, we add one more brick to the building by showing that the decay of a simple two-dimensional saturated soliton copies some key aspects of the black hole decay as well as of the information retrieval. In particular, we study the evaporation process of a classically-stable vacuum bubble of a spontaneously broken $SU(N)$-symmetry, coupled to massless fermions. We show that the decay rate as well as the characteristic energy of the emitted quanta are given by the inverse size of the object, in striking similarity with the Hawking evaporation of a black hole. The time-scale of information retrieval also matches the one previously suggested for a black hole by Page. We give the semiclassical derivation of the phenomenon as well as its fully quantum resolution as a decaying coherent state of Goldstone bosons. The universal nature of the effect and its microscopic understanding support the analogous quantum portrait of a black hole as a saturated coherent state of gravitons.</description>

      <title>Via Machinae 3.0: A search for stellar streams in Gaia with the CATHODE algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the model-agnostic anomaly detection method Cathode - originally developed for particle physics - to search for stellar streams in Gaia data. We combine Cathode with Via Machinae 3.0: a re-optimized version of the stellar stream detection method that was previously applied to Gaia data together with the related anomaly detection technique Anode. We demonstrate that the combination of Via Machinae 3.0 with Cathode, called VM3-C, not only re-discovers previously known streams, but also confirms many candidate streams identified in combination with Anode (denoted VM3-A). Compared to VM3-A, the number of stream candidates detected by VM3-C increases by around 10%. Moreover, both of the methods discover the same two large clusters of stream candidates in the Northern Galactic hemisphere. We dub these highly significant anomalous structures the Raritan stream and the Passaic stream. These two structures may indicate the presence of larger objects, such as dwarf galaxy streams, or non-trivial orbital dynamics resulting in bifurcation or fanning, and are promising and high-priority targets for further analysis.</description>

      <title>Wave-Breaking Phenomena in Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the onset of wave-breaking in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in heavy-ion collisions at both RHIC and the LHC. A nonlinear longitudinal color field is coupled to a three-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic background constrained by experimental conditions: Pb-Pb at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV (LHC) and Au-Au at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV (RHIC). The instantaneous wave-breaking threshold is determined from the in-medium plasma frequency, while the field evolution follows a nonlinear Landau equation with Debye screening and expansion damping. At the LHC, the higher initial temperature and density drive the system above the threshold within $\tau \lesssim $ 2.3 fm/$c$, whereas at RHIC the cooler and more dilute medium delays wave-breaking to $\tau \simeq 2.8$~fm/$c$. Scans over initial temperature, density, thermalization time, QGP lifetime, and collision system (RHIC vs LHC) confirm the robustness of this instability against parameter variations. These results identify wave-breaking as a universal microscopic mechanism for the early loss of coherence and rapid onset of hydrodynamics in the QGP, providing a common explanation for the fast equilibration observed at both RHIC and the LHC.</description>

      <title>The IBM Description of the B(E2) Anomaly: Dynamical Triaxiality and Configuration Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theoretical investigation has been carried out to examine the effects of dynamical triaxility and configuration mixing on the $B(E2)$ anomaly, characterized by $B_{4/2}=B(E2;4_1^+\rightarrow2_1^+)/B(E2;2_1^+\rightarrow0_1^+)&lt;1.0$ and $R_{4/2}=E(4_1^+)/E(2_1^+)\geq2.0$, within the framework of the interacting boson model (IBM). The results indicate that the effective $\gamma$ deformation may undergo substantial changes with increasing angular momentum in the $B(E2)$ anomaly system governed by an IBM Hamiltonian involving rotor-like terms. Further calculations reveal that mixing between normal and intruder states may facilitate the emergence of $B(E2)$ anomaly, thereby providing additional theoretical insights into this unusual phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Approximation in Lattice Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an approximation to the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations of the collective Coulomb field of the large $N$ homogeneous electron fluid. The large $N$ approximation transforms the infinite SD hierarchy is into a set of closed, equations for 1 and 2-pt correlators. In this paper, the dynamics of a toy model - a small square Euclidean lattice with periodic boundary conditions - are considered. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical method evaluated the 1 and 2-pt correlation functions on a $2 \times 2$ and $3 \times 3$ lattice. The derived equations are checked with the correlator values, and an agreement at $N \sim 10^3$ to order $10^{-3}$ was found. The agreement can be further strengthened by increasing runs in the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.</description>

      <title>Search for a photon peak from keV-scale dark matter annihilation with NuSTAR: Constraints on $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ after 11 years of observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report new constraints on the velocity-independent annihilation cross section $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ of keV-scale dark matter particles based on 11 years of observations with the NuSTAR X-ray telescope. Using the unfocused stray light mode of the instrument, which provides a wide field-of-view and a stable instrumental background, we perform a sensitive search for photon signatures from dark matter annihilation in the Galactic halo. We model the resulting diffuse X-ray spectrum over the 3-20 keV energy range and search for line-like spectral features that may arise from the annihilation of dark matter particles into photons. No statistically significant excess over the expected astrophysical background is found. We therefore place upper limits on $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ as a function of dark matter mass, assuming a velocity-independent s-wave annihilation and several Galactic dark matter profiles. Across most of the explored mass range our results provide the strongest X-ray constraints to date, reaching the level of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \lesssim 10^{-33}$ -- $10^{-34}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$, and they are complementary to the most recent bounds derived from SRG/ART-XC observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the motion of a particle in the geometry of a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a dark matter (DM) halo with Dehnen type density profile and calculate the orbital periods along with the evolution of the semi-latus rectum and eccentricity for extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Such a system emits gravitational waves (GWs), and the particle's orbit evolves under radiation reaction. We also consider the effects of dynamical friction and accretion of DM on the orbital parameters. We find that the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum decrease faster with respect to the case in which EMRI is in empty spacetime.</description>

Abstract: We present the first $\textit{ab initio}$ lattice calculations of the proton-rich tin isotopes $^{99}$Sn to $^{102}$Sn using nuclear lattice effective field theory with high-fidelity two- and three-nucleon forces. For a given set of three-nucleon couplings, we reproduce binding energies with $\sim 1\%$ accuracy for the even-even systems, and obtain energy splitting and two-nucleon separation energies in agreement with experiment. Our results confirm the $N=50$ shell closure and reveal that the binding energy of $^{99}$Sn lies below values extrapolated from heavier isotopes.</description>

Abstract: A calculation of the two-particle two-hole contribution to the semi-inclusive $(\nu_\mu,\mu^-N)$ cross section on carbon is performed in the framework of the relativistic Fermi gas model. The process is driven by meson-exchange currents encompassing all contributions involving the exchange of a single pion and the excitation of a $\Delta$ resonance. The calculation is validated against the inclusive $(\nu_\mu,\mu^-)$ response functions already existing in the literature, and then extended for the first time to the semi-inclusive channel. Results are presented both at fixed neutrino energy and folded with the T2K neutrino flux.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future gravitational wave observations are potentially sensitive to new physics corrections to the Higgs potential once the first-order electroweak phase transition arises. We study the SMEFT dimension-six operator effects on the Higgs potential, where three types of effects are taken into account: (i) SMEFT tree level effect on $\varphi^6$ operator, (ii) SMEFT tree level effect on the wave function renormalization of the Higgs field, and (iii) SMEFT top-quark one-loop level effect. The sensitivity of future gravitational wave observations to these effects is numerically calculated by performing a Fisher matrix analysis. We find that the future gravitational wave observations can be sensitive to (ii) and (iii) once the first-order electroweak phase transition arises from (i). The dimension-eight $\varphi^8$ operator effects on the first-order electroweak phase transition are also discussed. The sensitivities of the future gravitational wave observations are also compared with those of future collider experiments.</description>

Abstract: Atmospheric collisions can copiously produce dark sector particles in the invisible dark photon model, leading to detectable signals in underground neutrino detectors. We consider the dark photon model with the mass mixing mechanism and use the Super-K detector to detect the electron recoil events caused by the atmospherically produced dark sector particles within the model. We find that the combined data from four Super-K runs yield new leading constraints for the invisible dark photon in the mass range of $\sim(0.5-1.4)$ GeV, surpassing various previous constraints, including those from BaBar and NA64.</description>

      <title>A constraint to the uncertainty associated with the elements in the quark mixing matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00132v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extra condition by which the size of the uncertainty associated with the diagonal elements in the quark mixing matrix can be further constrained when the matrix is parameterized by a combination of three mixing angles and a Dirac phase. Then we discuss how the correlations among the uncertainties of the diagonal emenets can be used when we address issues such as the tension in the first row and the column of the matrix and discuss its implications.</description>

      <title>Warm and Fuzzy Dark Matter: Free Streaming of Wave Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wave or fuzzy dark matter that is produced with relativistic wavenumbers exhibits free streaming effects analogous to warm or hot particle dark matter with relativistic momenta. Axions produced after inflation provide such a warm or mildly relativistic candidate, where the enhanced suppression and observational bounds are only moderately stronger than that from wave propagation of initially cold axions. More generally, the free streaming damping also impacts isocurvature fluctuations from generation in causally disconnected patches. As coherent spatial fluctuations free stream away they leave incoherent and transient superpositions in their wakes. These multiple wave momentum streams are the wave analogue of particle phase space fluctuations or directional collisionless damping of massive neutrinos or hot dark matter. The observable impact on both adiabatic and isocurvature fluctuations of fuzzy dark matter can differ from their cold dark matter counterparts due to free streaming depending on how warm or hot is their momentum distribution.</description>

      <title>Scaling up to Multivariate Rational Function Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I present an algorithm for the reconstruction of multivariate rational functions from black-box probes. The arguably most important application in high-energy physics is the calculation of multi-loop and multi-leg amplitudes, where rational functions appear as coefficients in the integration-by-parts reduction to basis integrals. I show that for a dense coefficient the algorithm is nearly optimal, in the sense that the number of required probes is close to the number of unknowns.</description>

      <title>Decay behavior of hidden-strange hadronic molecular state $N(2270)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we systematically discuss the decay patterns of the hidden-strange hadronic molecular state $N(2270)$ which is assumed as an S-wave $K^\ast\Sigma^\ast$ shallow bound state with its possible quantum numbers $J^P$ which are ${1/2}^-$, ${3/2}^-$ and ${5/2}^-$. By using the effective Lagrangian approach and considering pseudo-scalar meson and vector meson exchanges, we have thoroughly calculated and discussed the decay behavior of the $N(2270)$ molecular state, including hadronic and radiative decay and the cutoff dependence, for different $J^P$ values. For all three cases, $K^\ast \Lambda$, $K^\ast \Sigma$, and $\rho N$ final states are always included as the main decay channels. However, the $K \Lambda$, $\pi N$ and $\pi \Delta$ final states exhibit notable differences. These different decay properties will provide valuable guidance for future experimental searches and aid in distinguishing different $J^P$ assumptions and understanding their internal structures.</description>

      <title>Dark plasmas in the nonlinear regime: constraints from particle-in-cell simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If the dark sector possesses long-range self-interactions, these interactions can source dramatic collective instabilities even in astrophysical settings where the collisional mean free path is long. Here, we focus on the specific case of dark matter halos composed of a dark $U(1)$ gauge sector undergoing a dissociative cluster merger. We study this by performing the first dedicated particle-in-cell plasma simulations of interacting dark matter streams, tracking the growth, formation, and saturation of instabilities through both the linear and nonlinear regimes. We find that these instabilities give rise to local (dark) electromagnetic inhomogeneities that serve as scattering sites, inducing an effective dynamic collisional cross-section. Mapping this effective cross-section onto existing results from large-scale simulations of the Bullet Cluster, we extend the limit on the dark charge-to-mass ratio by over ten orders of magnitude. Our results serve as a simple example of the rich phenomenology that may arise in a dark sector with long-range interactions and motivate future dedicated study of such ``dark plasmas.''</description>

      <title>Detecting gravitational signatures of dark matter with atom gradiometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the purely gravitational signatures of dark matter from the ultralight to the ultraheavy mass range in proposed long-baseline atom gradiometers, focusing on terrestrial designs, such as AION-km and MAGIS-km, as well as space-based concepts, such as MAGIS-space, AEDGE and AEDGE+. Due to its exceptional acceleration sensitivity and depending on astrophysical backgrounds, a detector similar to AEDGE+ could detect a dark matter subcomponent which constitutes $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ of the local dark matter energy density and is populated by compact clumps of mass between $10^6$~kg and $10^{10}$~kg ($10^{-25}~M_\odot\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{-21}~M_\odot$) in an otherwise unexplored region of dark matter model space. Furthermore, because the gravitational observable depends on the relative gravitational time delay measured by spatially separated atomic clouds, we find that atom gradiometers are parametrically more sensitive than laser interferometers, such as LIGO and LISA, to fast-oscillating spacetime perturbations sourced by energy density and pressure fluctuations of ultralight dark matter. Depending on astrophysical backgrounds, a detector akin to AEDGE+ could probe a DM overdensity of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ times the local dark matter energy density for masses $m\lesssim 10^{-17}$~eV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum tomography, as a tool to probe foundational aspects of quantum mechanics, relies on extracting spin information from angular distributions. This is inherently a leading-order technique, ill-defined when higher-order corrections are significant. For those cases, we propose to treat higher-order corrections as a background, to be modeled and subtracted from data in the same way as other backgrounds are. We illustrate this procedure for Higgs decays $H \to ZZ \to e^+ e^- \mu^+ \mu^-$, which is of high interest for upcoming qutrit entanglement tests at the Large Hadron Collider.</description>

      <title>RGE effects on new physics searches via gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13074v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations offer a promising probe of new physics associated with a first-order electroweak phase transition. Precision studies of the Higgs potential, including Fisher matrix analyses, have been extensively conducted in this context. However, significant theoretical uncertainties in the GW spectrum, particularly those due to renormalization scale dependence in the conventional daisy-resummed approach, have cast doubt on the reliability of such precision measurements. These uncertainties have been highlighted using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) as a benchmark. To address these issues, we revisit Fisher matrix analyses based on the daisy-resummed approach, explicitly incorporating renormalization scale uncertainties. We then reassess the prospects for precise new physics measurements using GW observations. Adopting the SMEFT as a benchmark, we study the effects of one-loop RGE running of dimension-six operators on the Higgs effective potential via the Higgs self-couplings, top Yukawa coupling, and gauge couplings, in addition to the SMEFT tree-level effects. We find that future GW observations can remain sensitive to various dimension-six SMEFT effects, even in the presence of renormalization scale uncertainties, provided that the SMEFT $(H^{\dagger}H)^3$ operator is precisely measured, e.g., by future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Fermion masses and mixings in supersymmetric SO(10) with third-generation quasi-Yukawa unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the charged and neutral fermion masses and mixings in a supersymmetric SO(10) model with a minimal Higgs sector consisting of the multiplets $10_H$, $45_H$, and $16_H + \overline{16}_H$. In addition to the renormalizable Yukawa couplings involving the Higgs 10-plet, we include non-renormalizable Yukawa couplings, which are important for reproducing with good accuracy the observed masses and mixings in the quark and lepton sectors. We identify a preferred solution which is compatible with third family quasi-Yukawa unification, namely $y_t \approx y_b \approx 0.73 y_{\tau}$ at the unification scale, with the MSSM parameter $\tan\beta \sim 58$. Acceptable solutions with lower $\tan\beta$ values are also realized in our framework, and we provide an example with $\tan \beta =10$. Based on our fits, the masses for the three right-handed neutrinos turn out to be $\left(M_1,M_2,M_3\right)\sim \left(10^9, 8\cdot 10^{12}, 9\cdot 10^{12}\right) \mathrm{GeV}$. We briefly discuss the metastable and quasistable string scenarios that can be realized in this class of supersymmetric SO(10) models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lepton flavor universality is a key prediction of the Standard Model of particle physics and any violation of it immediately indicates the existence of new physics. Given the recent more than $4\sigma$ discrepancy in charged current semileptonic B meson decays and the absence of evident signals at the large hadron collider, independent cross-checks become invaluable. In this context, $b \to c$ semileptonic sum rules based on heavy quark symmetry are interesting since they allow us to check the consistency of experimental results. In this paper, we report newly found sum rules among angular observables of mesonic and baryonic $b\to c l \overline{\nu}$ decays holding exactly in the large mass limit of heavy quarks. Moreover, we investigate corrections to the sum rule in realistic situations and discuss phenomenological implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the local equilibrium density operator, we develop a geometry-informed linear response theory that takes into account the parameterization of the freezeout hypersurface before the gradient expansion is carried out. Assuming local equilibrium on an iso-energy density hypersurface, we study the $\Lambda$ hyperon spin polarization, and compute corrections to the isothermal case due to finite density. We argue that corrections to isothermal freezeout should be small, and that even in heavy ion collisions with energy as low as $\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 11.5$ GeV they constitute at most a $10\%$ effect. They may, however, become relevant for local polarization observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent observation of toponium by CMS and ATLAS has renewed interest in top quark bound states. In this work, we present an exploratory but quantitative study of the hypothetical triple-top baryon, denoted as $\Omega_{ttt}$, the only baryon that is governed by ultraviolet freedom. Using a variational method with an effective potential of $ttt$ that includes QCD, Higgs, and QED contributions, we estimate its mass to be around 514 GeV with a binding energy of about 4 GeV. We further discuss its possible production at future high-energy colliders, finding that the cross sections are extremely suppressed. The dominant weak decay channel is identified as $\Omega_{ttt}\to W^+W^+W^+bbb$, leading to complex multi-lepton and multi-jet final states. Our analysis, though approximate, demonstrates the distinctive features of $\Omega_{ttt}$ compared with other triply-heavy baryons such as $\Omega_{ccc}$ and $\Omega_{bbb}$, and may serve as a starting point for more refined approaches, including lattice QCD or effective field theory. This work highlights both the theoretical challenges and the potential opportunities in probing the strong interaction at unprecedented mass scales.</description>

      <title>On-shell Matrix Elements of the EMT Trace in Gauge Theories and Heavy Quark Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel diagrammatic proof of the identity between the forward matrix element of the energy-momentum-tensor (EMT) trace operator over a single particle's on-shell state and its perturbative pole mass to any loop orders in perturbative gauge theories (with gauge bosons and fermions), without appealing to any pre-laid operator renormalization conditions or Ward identities. The proof is based on the equation of mass-dimensional analysis in dimensional regularization, the topological properties of contributing Feynman diagrams and the on-shell renormalization condition. Considering for definiteness perturbative QED and QCD with at most one fermion kept massive, we have verified the aforementioned identity, up to three loops, for all elementary particles through direct computation of dimensionally-regularized matrix elements of the relevant bare operators. We observe interestingly that the trace-anomaly contribution seemingly contains all leading-renormalon effects (explicitly verified up to three loops), and we propose accordingly a new scheme- and scale-independent trace-anomaly-subtracted mass definition for heavy $t$-,$\,b$-,$\,c$-quarks and electrons. A list of amusing numbers is subsequently presented for the composition of their perturbative pole masses.</description>

      <title>Exploring cosmological gravitational wave backgrounds through the synergy of LISA and ET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) interferometers LISA and ET are expected to be functional in the next decade(s), possibly around the same time. They will operate over different frequency ranges, with similar integrated sensitivities to the amplitude of a stochastic GW background (SGWB). We investigate the synergies between these two detectors, in terms of a multi-band detection of a cosmological SGWB characterised by a large amplitude, and a broad frequency spectrum. We develop the notion of integrated sensitivity and propose a novel signal-to-noise (SNR) optimal for characterization of the geometrical properties of the interferometer systems of LISA and ET operating simultaneously. By investigating various examples of SGWBs, such as those arising from cosmological phase transition, cosmic string, primordial inflation, we show that LISA and ET operating together will have the opportunity to assess more effectively the characteristics of the GW spectrum produced by the same cosmological source, but at separate frequency scales. Moreover, the two experiments in tandem can be sensitive to features of early universe cosmic expansion before big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), which affects the SGWB frequency profile, and which would not be possible to detect otherwise, since two different frequency ranges correspond to two different pre-BBN (or post-inflationary) epochs. Besides considering the GW spectrum, we additionally undertake a preliminary study of the sensitivity of LISA and ET to soft limits of higher order tensor correlation functions. Given that these experiments operate at different frequency bands, their synergy constitutes an ideal direct probe of squeezed limits of higher order GW correlators, which can not be measured operating with a single instrument only.</description>

      <title>Holographic Non-Hermitian Lattices and Junctions and their RG Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and study inhomogeneous non-Hermitian strongly coupled holographic field theories. We consider two models: a lattice where in each site there is some inflow/outflow of matter and a Hermitian/non-Hermitian/Hermitian junction. By tuning a complex external gauge field, we find a non-Hermitian model which can be mapped to a Hermitian one via a complexified U(1) gauge transformation. On the other hand, in the absence of the gauge field we find non-Hermitian solutions with a purely imaginary current. Despite this, all expectation values respect PT symmetry and thus we expect the system to feature unitary time evolution. Nonetheless, we have not found a map bringing these solutions to a Hermitian description. We study the RG flows of solutions with imaginary current finding that in the IR they can be mapped to a Hermitian conformal fixed point via a complexified U(1) transformation. Remarkably, we also obtain solutions where the null energy condition is violated near the boundary of the dual geometry.</description>

      <title>Gravothermalizing into primordial black holes, boson stars, and cannibal stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18948v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very little is known about the cosmological history from after the end of inflation until Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. Various well-motivated models predict that the universe could have undergone a period of matter domination in this early epoch. We demonstrate that if the particles causing matter domination have self-interactions, they can form halos that undergo a gravothermal collapse. We thus propose a novel scenario for the formation of primordial black holes, which in particular can lie within the asteroid-mass range. We also find that it is not only black holes that can form in the aftermath of a gravothermal evolution. We show that number-changing annihilations of the particles can create sufficient heat to halt the gravothermal evolution, thus forming a ``cannibal star''. Likewise, the pressure from the particle's repulsive self-interactions can form a boson star during a gravothermal evolution. Thus, our study highlights that structure formation in the early universe can have a rich phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Analytical modeling of the one-dimensional power spectrum of 21-cm forest based on a halo model method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 21-cm forest, composed of spectral absorption features from high-redshift background radio sources, provides a unique probe for studying small-scale structures during the epoch of reionization. It is particularly sensitive to detecting small-scale structures and early heating processes. Despite the rich information contained in the 21-cm forest signal, the complexity of directly modeling the signal has led to a lack of effective analytical models. However, the one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest contains valuable information about the matter power spectrum, making analytical modeling feasible. This work employs an analytical modeling approach based on the halo model, which links the distribution of matter to dark matter halos, allowing for effective predictions of cosmic structure formation and its impact on the 21-cm signal. By considering various parameter scenarios within the halo model framework, particularly different dark matter particle masses and varying levels of cosmic heating, we can capture the complexities of small-scale structures and make the 1D power spectrum modeling applicable across a wide range of parameters. This method not only enhances our understanding of the 21-cm forest signal but also provides theoretical support for future observational data. Observing the 21-cm forest with large radio telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array, is anticipated to enable simultaneous exploration of dark matter properties and the heating history of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Constraining Asymmetric DM Properties by Black Hole Formation in Neutron Stars and Population III Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we explore the potential for Neutron Stars (NSs) at the Galactic center and Population~III stars to constrain bosonic Asymmetric Dark Matter (ADM). We demonstrate that for NSs in an environment of sufficiently high DM density ($\rho_\chi\gtrsim10^{9}\text{GeV/cm}^3$), the effects of both multiscatter capture and DM evaporation cannot be neglected. Conversely, for Pop~III stars, we find they are excellent at probing low-mass ADM. For instance, the most easily observable Population III stars could be highly effective at constraining high-$\sigma$ low-$m_\chi$ DM, maintaining efficacy below $m_\chi=10^{-15}\text{GeV}$ (assuming a Bose Einstein Condensate(BEC) forms) thanks to their far lower value of $m_\chi$ at which capture saturates to the geometric limit. Finally, we derive closed-form approximations for the evaporation rate of DM from arbitrary polytropic objects and from DM particles in a BEC state.</description>

      <title>C-R-T Fractionalization in the First Quantized Hamiltonian Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research has revealed that the CRT symmetry for fermions exhibits a fractionalization distinct from the $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{C}}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{R}}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{T}}$ for scalar bosons. In fact, the CRT symmetry for fermions can be extended by internal symmetries such as fermion parity, thereby forming a group extension of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ direct product. Conventionally, a Majorana fermion is defined by one Dirac fermion with trivial charge conjugation. However, when the spacetime dimension $d+1=5,6,7\bmod8$, the real dimension of Majorana fermion (dim$_{\mathbb{R}}\chi_{\mathcal{C}\ell(d,0)}$) aligns with the real dimension of Dirac fermion (dim$_{\mathbb{R}}\psi_{\mathcal{C}\ell(d)}$), rather than being half, which necessitates the introduction of a symplectic Majorana fermion, defined by two Dirac fermions with trivial charge conjugation. To include these two types of Majorana fermions, we embed the theory in $n_{\mathbb{R}}$ and define the Majorana fermion field as a representation of the real Clifford algebra with 8-fold periodicity. Within the Hamiltonian formalism, we identify the 8-fold CRT-internal symmetry groups across general dimensions. Similarly, Dirac fermion field is defined as a representation of the complex Clifford algebra with 2-fold periodicity. Interestingly, we discover that the CRT-internal symmetry groups exhibit an 8-fold periodicity that is distinct from that of the complex Clifford algebra. In certain dimensions where distinct mass terms can span a mass manifold, the CRT-internal symmetries can act non-trivially upon this mass manifold. Employing domain wall reduction method, we are able to elucidate the relationships between symmetries across different dimensions.</description>

      <title>Resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamics without Amperes Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resistive magnetohydrodynamics is thought to play a key role in transient astrophysical phenomena such as black hole flares and neutron star magnetospheres. When performing numerical simulations of resistive magnetohydrodynamics, one is faced with the issue that Amperes law becomes stiff in the high conductivity limit which poses challenges to the numerical evolution. We show that using a description of resistive magnetohydrodynamics based on higher form symmetry, one can perform simulations with a generalized dual Faraday tensor without having to use Amperes Law, thereby avoiding the stiffness problem. We also explain the relation of this dual model to a traditional description of resistive magnetohydrodynamics and how causality is guaranteed by introducing second order corrections.</description>

      <title>Solar System Constraints on Light Propagation from Higher Derivative Corrections to General Relativity and Implications for Fundamental Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the two derivative action of gravitation is specified uniquely, higher derivative operators are also allowed with coefficients that are not specified uniquely by effective field theory. We focus on a four derivative operator in which the Riemann tensor couples directly to the electromagnetic field $a\,R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F^{\mu\nu}F^{\alpha\beta}$. We compute the corresponding corrections to the Shapiro time delay in the solar system and compare this to data from the Cassini probe. We place an observational upper bound on the coefficient $a$ at 95\% confidence $|a|&lt;26\,(1000\,\mbox{km})^2$. By way of motivation, we also compare this to a weak gravity conjecture (WGC) prediction of a bound on the coefficients $a,\,b$ of four derivative operators involving the graviton and the photon; this includes the above term $a\,R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F^{\mu\nu}F^{\alpha\beta}$ as well as $b\,F^4$. We show that by using the observed value of the $b$ coefficient from measurements of light by light scattering, which arises in the Standard Model from integrating out the electron, the WGC predicted bound for $a$ is $a\lesssim 7.8\,(1000\,\mbox{km})^2$. This is consistent with the above observational bound, but is intriguingly close and can be further probed in other observations.</description>

      <title>Resonant neutrino self-interactions: Insights from the full shape galaxy power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates resonant neutrino self-interactions in cosmology by employing, for the first time, the effective field theory of large-scale structure to model their impact on the matter distribution up to mildly nonlinear scales. We explore a broad range of mediator masses in two main analyses: one combining BOSS Full Shape (FS) galaxy clustering with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and another combining FS with Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Our results place the strongest cosmological constraints to date on the resonant self interactions when using FS+Planck data, reaching up to $g_\nu&lt; 10.8 \times 10^{-14}$ at $95\%$ confidence for the 1 eV mediator. Notably, FS+BBN can constrain the interaction for the 10 eV mediator independently of CMB data, yielding $g_\nu &lt; 7.33 \times 10^{-12}$ at $95\%$ confidence. Our results suggest that resonant neutrino self-interactions are unlikely to resolve existing cosmological tensions within the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework.</description>

      <title>Tidal Suppression of Fuzzy Dark Matter Heating in Milky Way Satellite Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many previous studies have imposed stringent constraints on the particle mass of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) by analyzing observations of Galactic satellite galaxies, which show no significant evidence of the heating effect predicted by FDM. However, these analyses have generally neglected the tidal influence of the Milky Way, which can substantially suppress the FDM-induced heating effect in satellites. This oversight arises from computational challenges of accurately capturing the tidal effects in FDM simulations. In this study, we present a novel simulation framework that, for the first time, enables the simulation of an FDM-stellar system within an observationally motivated gravitational potential of the Milky Way. This framework incorporates the diverse Galactic components, including the gravitational influence of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Using the Fornax dwarf galaxy as a case study, we demonstrate that tidal effects significantly alleviate the tension between observational data and the predicted heating effect for an FDM particle mass of $m_a\sim 10^{-22}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Benchmarks and applications of the nuclear deexcitation event generator NucDeEx</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron multiplicity is a key observable in recent neutrino experiments that can enhance the sensitivity of various neutrino physics searches. Nuclear deexcitation plays a significant role in neutron emissions associated with neutrino-nucleus interactions; therefore, precise prediction of this process is eessential. To address this need, a general-purpose nuclear deexcitation event generator \textsc{NucDeEx} was developed and released as an open-source package. The treatment of low-lying discrete excited states was updated to better reproduce experimental data. Benchmarks were conducted using existing nuclear deexcitation event generators and experimental data. Application to other simulators, neutrino event generator \textsc{NEUT} and general particle simulation tool \textsc{Geant4}, are also presented.</description>

      <title>Unitary and Analytic Renormalisation of Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Loop contributions to cosmological correlators and to the associated wavefunction are of key theoretical and phenomenological interest. Here, we investigate and compare different renormalisation schemes proposed in the literature to handle ultraviolet divergences and develop new schemes adapting $\eta$ regulators to de Sitter spacetime. We focus on one-loop contributions to the quadratic wavefunction coefficient of a shift-symmetric massless scalar in de Sitter spacetime, which is a good toy model of primordial curvature perturbations. We show that different implementations of dimensional regularisation agree with each other and with unitarity and scale invariance in the final renormalised result. Imposing unitarity in the form of the cosmological optical theorem, we define a class of unitary and analytic $\eta$ regulators that agree with dim reg but feature considerable technical and conceptual simplifications. We show that the imaginary part of all one-loop wavefunction coefficients is universally fixed in terms of the logarithmic running of the real part, under the assumptions of scale invariance, Bunch-Davies vacuum and light bulk fields. Our work resolves discrepancies in the literature, establishes regulator-independent predictions for the imaginary part at one loop, and provides a practical framework for computing quantum contributions to cosmological correlators.</description>
