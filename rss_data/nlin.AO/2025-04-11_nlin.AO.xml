      <title>Uncovering influence of football players' behaviour on team performance in ball possession through dynamical modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quest for uncovering influence of behaviour on team performance involves understanding individual behaviour, interactions with others and environment, variations across groups, and effects of interventions. Although insights into each of these areas have accumulated in sports science literature on football, it remains unclear how one can enhance team performance. We analyse influence of football players' behaviour on team performance in three-versus-one ball possession game by constructing and analysing a dynamical model. We developed a model for the motion of the players and the ball, which mathematically represented our hypotheses on players' behaviour and interactions. The model's plausibility was examined by comparing simulated outcomes with our experimental result. Possible influences of interventions were analysed through sensitivity analysis, where causal effects of several aspects of behaviour such as pass speed and accuracy were found. Our research highlights the potential of dynamical modelling for uncovering influence of behaviour on team effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Self-organisation of common good usage and an application to Internet services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural and human-made common goods present key challenges due to their susceptibility to degradation, overuse, or congestion. We explore the self-organisation of their usage when individuals have access to several available commons but limited information on them. We propose an extension of the Win-Stay, Lose-Shift (WSLS) strategy for such systems, under which individuals use a resource iteratively until they are unsuccessful and then shift randomly. This simple strategy leads to a distribution of the use of commons with an improvement against random shifting. Selective individuals who retain information on their usage and accordingly adapt their tolerance to failure in each common good improve the average experienced quality for an entire population. Hybrid systems of selective and non-selective individuals can lead to an equilibrium with equalised experienced quality akin to the ideal free distribution. We show that these results can be applied to the server selection problem faced by mobile users accessing Internet services and we perform realistic simulations to test their validity. Furthermore, these findings can be used to understand other real systems such as animal dispersal on grazing and foraging land, and to propose solutions to operators of systems of public transport or other technological commons.</description>

      <title>From empirical brain networks towards modeling music perception -- a perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This perspective article investigates how auditory stimuli influence neural network dynamics using the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model and empirical brain connectivity data. Results show that synchronization is sensitive to both the frequency and amplitude of auditory input, with synchronization enhanced when input frequencies align with the system's intrinsic frequencies. Increased stimulus amplitude broadens the synchronization range governed by a delicate interplay involving the network's topology, the spatial location of the input, and the frequency characteristics of the cortical input signals. This perspective article also reveals that brain activity alternates between synchronized and desynchronized states, reflecting critical dynamics and phase transitions in neural networks. Notably, gamma-band synchronization is crucial for processing music, with coherence peaking in this frequency range. The findings emphasize the role of structural connectivity and network topology in modulating synchronization, providing insights into how music perception engages brain networks. This perspective article offers a computational framework for understanding neural mechanisms in music perception, with potential implications for cognitive neuroscience and music psychology.</description>

      <title>Active Matter Flocking via Predictive Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding collective self-organization in active matter, such as bird flocks and fish schools, remains a grand challenge in physics. Alignment interactions are essential for flocking, yet alone, they are generally considered insufficient to maintain cohesion against noise, forcing traditional models to rely on artificial boundaries or added attractive forces. Here, we report the first model to achieve cohesive flocking using purely alignment interactions, introducing predictive alignment: agents orient based on the predicted future headings of their neighbors. Implemented in a discrete-time Vicsek-type framework, this approach delivers robust, noise-resistant cohesion without additional parameters. In the stable regime, flock size scales linearly with interaction radius, remaining nearly immune to noise or propulsion speed, and the group coherently follows a leader under noise. These findings reveal how predictive strategies enhance self-organization, paving the way for a new class of active matter models blending physics and cognitive-like dynamics.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Function Diversity and Specialization Across Socioeconomic and Biological Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Function diversity, or the range of tasks that individuals perform, is essential for productive organizations. In the absence of overarching principles, the characteristics of function diversity are seemingly unique to each domain. Here, we introduce an empirical framework and a mathematical model for the diversification of functions in a wide range of systems, such as bacteria, federal agencies, universities, corporations, and cities. Our findings reveal that the number of functions within these entities grows sublinearly with system size, with exponents ranging from 0.35 to 0.57, confirming Heaps' Law. In contrast, cities exhibit logarithmic growth in the occupation types. We generalize the Yule-Simon model to quantify a wide range of these empirical observations by introducing two new key attributes: a diversification parameter that characterizes the tendency for more populated functions to inhibit new function creation, and a specialization parameter that describes how a function's attractiveness depends on its abundance. These parameters allow us to position diverse systems, from microorganisms to metropolitan areas, within a two-dimensional abstract space. This mapping suggests underlying commonalities and differences in the foundational mechanisms that drive the growth of these systems.</description>
