      <title>Ionospheric Response to the May 11, 2024, Geomagnetic Superstorm over Ecuador</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of the G5 geomagnetic storm on Total Electron Content (TEC) derived from the Global Positioning System (GPS) in Gal\'apagos, Ecuador (geographic latitude 0.1807{\deg} S, longitude 78.4678{\deg} W) during May 10-13, 2024. Using vertical TEC (VTEC) data from a single pseudorandom noise (PRN) code, along with the average VTEC from the same PRN collected over the ten days before the storm, referred to as background TEC, to analyze the variations in TEC.
  Our findings indicate that during the main phase of the storm on May 10-11, 2024, TEC experienced a notable decrease, which contrasts with the typical responses observed in previous storms. This decrease can be attributed to rapid recombination processes and potential plasma instabilities triggered by the storm. In the recovery phase following the main storm, a gradual increase in TEC was observed, illustrating the complex dynamics of the ionosphere in response to geomagnetic disturbances.
  This study underscores the variability in TEC responses during geomagnetic storms. It highlights the importance of real-time monitoring to improve our understanding of the implications for satellite communication and navigation systems.</description>

      <title>Observations of Transition from Imbalanced to Balanced Kinetic Alfv\'enic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report observations of solar wind turbulence derived from measurements by the Parker Solar Probe. Our findings reveal the emergence of finite magnetic helicity within the transition range of the turbulence, aligning with signatures of kinetic Alfv\'en waves (KAWs). Notably, as the wave scale transitions from super-ion to sub-ion scales, the ratio of KAWs with opposing signs of magnetic helicity initially increases from approximately 1 to 6 before returning to 1. This observation provides, for the first time, compelling evidence for the transition from imbalanced kinetic Alfv\'enic turbulence to balanced kinetic Alfv\'enic turbulence.</description>

      <title>High-End Space Electronics: Active Shielding to Mitigate Catastrophic Single-Event Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operating electronic systems in space environments presents significant challenges due to continuous exposure to cosmic, solar, and trapped radiation, which can induce catastrophic single-event effects. This paper introduces a novel nonintrusive mitigation apparatus designed to protect high-end commercial off-the-shelf electronics in space. The apparatus incorporates an array of real-time particle detectors coupled with a mitigation algorithm. Upon identifying potentially harmful particles, the system power cycles affected electronics, preempting permanent damage. The apparatus was evaluated using GEANT4 simulations, which were compared with empirical data from the "COTS-Capsule" experiment aboard the International Space Station, demonstrating strong agreement. Key results indicate that the system achieves a 95% detection accuracy with a power cycle rate of once every seven hours per square centimeter of sensitive electronics. The COTS-Capsule represents a cost-effective, flexible solution for integrating modern, high-end, non-space-qualified electronics into a variety of space missions, addressing critical challenges in the new-space era.</description>

      <title>Intermittent, Reflection-Driven, Strong Imbalanced MHD Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a phenomenological model of strong imbalanced magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence that accounts for intermittency and the reflection of Alfven waves by spatial variations in the Alfven speed. Our model predicts the slopes of the inertial-range Elsasser power spectra, the scaling exponents of the higher-order Elsasser structure functions, and the way in which the parallel (to the magnetic field) length scale of the fluctuations varies with the perpendicular length scale. These predictions agree reasonably well with measurements of solar-wind turbulence from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). In contrast to previous models of intermittency in balanced MHD turbulence, we find that intermittency in reflection-driven MHD turbulence increases the parallel wave numbers of the energetically dominant fluctuations at small perpendicular length scales. This, like the PSP measurements with which our model agrees, suggests that turbulence in the solar wind and solar corona may lead to more ion cyclotron heating than previously realized.</description>

      <title>Solar flares as electron accelerators: toward a resolution of the acceleration efficiency issue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major open issue concerning the active Sun is the effectiveness with which magnetic reconnection accelerates electrons in flares. A paper published by {\em{Nature}} in 2022 used microwave observations to conclude that the Sun is an almost ideal accelerator, energizing nearly all electrons within a coronal volume to nonthermal energies. Shortly thereafter, a paper published in {\em{Astrophysical Journal Letters}} used hard X-ray measurements \emph{of the same event} to reach the contradictory conclusion that less than 1\% of the available electrons were accelerated. Here we address this controversy by using spatially resolved observations of hard X-ray emission and a spectral inversion method to determine the evolution of the electron spectrum throughout the flare. So we estimated the density of the medium where electrons accelerate and, from this, the ratio of accelerated to ambient electron densities. Results show that this ratio never exceeds a percent or so in the cases analyzed.</description>
