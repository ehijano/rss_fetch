      <title>Reconstruction of dynamic systems using genetic algorithms with dynamic search limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02894</link>

Abstract: Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool for describing, predicting, and understanding complex phenomena exhibited by real-world systems. However, identifying the equations that govern a system's dynamics from experimental data remains a significant challenge without a definitive solution. In this study, evolutionary computing techniques are presented to estimate the governing equations of a dynamical system using time-series data. The main approach is to propose polynomial equations with unknown coefficients, and subsequently perform a parametric estimation using genetic algorithms. Some of the main contributions of the present study are an adequate modification of the genetic algorithm to remove terms with minimal contributions, and a mechanism to escape local optima during the search. To evaluate the proposed method, we applied it to three dynamical systems: a linear model, a nonlinear model, and the Lorenz system. Our results demonstrate a reconstruction with an Integral Square Error below 0.22 and a coefficient of determination R-squared of 0.99 for all systems, indicating successful reconstruction of the governing dynamic equations.</description>

      <title>Stagnation points at grain contacts generate an elastic flow instability in 3D porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many environmental, energy, and industrial processes involve the flow of polymer solutions in three-dimensional (3D) porous media where fluid is confined to navigate through complex pore space geometries. As polymers are transported through the tortuous pore space, elastic stresses accumulate, leading to the onset of unsteady flow fluctuations above a threshold flow rate. How does pore space geometry influence the development and features of this elastic instability? Here, we address this question by directly imaging polymer solution flow in microfabricated 3D ordered porous media with precisely controlled geometries consisting of simple-cubic (SC) or body-centered cuboid (BC) arrays of spherical grains. In both cases, we find that the flow instability is generated at stagnation points arising at the contacts between grains rather than at the polar upstream/downstream grain surfaces, as is the case for flow around a single grain. The characteristics of the flow instability are strongly dependent on the unit cell geometry: in SC packings, the instability manifests through the formation of time-dependent, fluctuating 3D eddies, whereas in BC packings, it manifests as continual fluctuating 'wobbles' and crossing in the flow pathlines. Despite this difference, we find that characteristics of the transition from steady to unsteady flow with increasing flow rate have commonalities across geometries. Moreover, for both packing geometries, our data indicate that extensional flow-induced polymeric stresses generated by contact-associated stagnation points are the primary contributor to the macroscopic resistance to flow across the entire medium. Altogether, our work highlights the pivotal role of inter-grain contacts -- which are typically idealized as discrete points and therefore overlooked, but are inherent in most natural and engineered media -- in shaping elastic instabilities in porous media.</description>
