      <title>Linear inelastic kinetic equations modelling the spread of fake news and its interplay with personal awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a kinetic model which describes a learning process leading individuals to build personal awareness about fake news. Next, we embed the results of this model into another kinetic model, which describes the popularity gained by news on social media conditioned to the reliability of the disseminated information. Both models are formulated in terms of linear inelastic Boltzmann-type equations, of which we investigate the main analytical properties - existence and uniqueness of solutions, trend to equilibrium, identification of the equilibrium distributions - by employing extensively Fourier methods for kinetic equations. We also provide evidence of the analytical results by means of Monte Carlo numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>An Important Decision for Climate Change: Sequestering Carbon in Materials or Underground?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A first-order analysis concludes it is feasible to store the carbon needed to meet the Paris targets in structural materials and use less energy and at a lower cost than our use of extractive materials, steel, aluminum, and concrete. Switching to a synthetic material industry using CO2 from the air will stimulate economic growth and create increased equity while addressing the threat of climate change. The positive feedback between them will accelerate reaching a global accord to address the dual threats of climate change and equity and may, in fact, be needed to avoid the catastrophic consequences of failing to meet them on time.</description>

      <title>Super-exponential growth of epidemics in networks with cliques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many dynamic processes on complex networks, from disease outbreaks to cascading failures, can rapidly accelerate once a critical threshold is exceeded, potentially leading to severe social and economic costs. Therefore, in order to develop effective mitigation strategies, it is essential to understand how these catastrophic events occur. In this work, we investigate the dynamic of disease propagation on networks with fully connected sub-graphs (or cliques) using a susceptible-infected-quarantined (SIQ) model, and considering a scenario where only a proportion $f$ of the population has access to testing. For this model, we derive the time-evolution equations governing the spread of epidemics and show that the final proportion of infected individuals undergoes a sudden transition at a critical threshold $f_c$. Moreover, close to this transition point, our results on the time evolution of the SIQ model reveal that the number of new cases can exhibit a faster-than-exponential growth. This accelerated spread dynamics is more likely to occur in networks with larger cliques.</description>

      <title>The parenthood effect in urban mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modelling of human mobility is vital for the understanding of the complexity of urban dynamics and guiding effective interventions to improve quality of life. Traditional modelling approaches focus on `average citizens,' which overlook the multitude of experiences from distinct sociodemographic groups. Recent studies have unveiled significant variations in mobility patterns related to gender and socioeconomic status, yet the impact of parenthood remains under-explored. Parenthood brings profound changes to daily routines, influenced by factors such as increased caregiving responsibilities, altered work-life balance, and the need for family-friendly environments. Parents often prioritise considerations such as cost of living, social wellbeing, environmental quality, and safety. Quantifying how `friendly' a city is becomes more and more important for parents, especially in the context of rising remote work opportunities which, in turn, reverberate on the choices on where to settle. This work investigates whether these considerations lead to distinct mobility patterns between parents and non-parents, also accounting for the impact of partnership. Using extensive census data across American cities, we analyse how parenthood and partnership reshape their urban experiences. Our findings indicate that cities can indeed be classified by their level of friendliness towards parents and partners. For example, Dallas and Nashville can be more suited for single individuals, New York and Chicago can be more accommodating to parents, while Washington and Baltimore favour married people. These insights contribute to the growing body of research advocating for more nuanced and equitable urban planning. By recognising the diverse needs of different demographic groups, particularly parents, our study underscores the importance of tailored urban design strategies over universal solutions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Compactness for District Plans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern sampling methods create ensembles of district maps that score well on discrete compactness scores, whereas the Polsby-Popper and other shape-based scores remain highly relevant for building fair maps and litigating unfair ones. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce population-weighted versions of shape-based scores and show a precise sense in which this interpolates between shape-based and discrete scores. Second, we introduce a modification of the ReCom sampling method that produces ensembles of maps with improved shape-based compactness scores.</description>

      <title>Surfacic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surfacic networks are structures built upon a two-dimensional manifold. Many systems, including transportation networks and various urban networks, fall into this category. The fluctuations of node elevations imply significant deviations from typical plane networks and require specific tools to understand their impact. Here, we present such tools, including lazy paths that minimize elevation differences, graph arduousness which measures the tiring nature of shortest paths, and the excess effort, which characterizes positive elevation variations along shortest paths. We illustrate these measures using toy models of surfacic networks and empirically examine pedestrian networks in selected cities. Specifically, we examine how changes in elevation affect the spatial distribution of betweenness centrality. We also demonstrate that the excess effort follows a non-trivial power law distribution, with an exponent that is not universal, which illustrates that there is a significant probability of encountering steep slopes along shortest paths, regardless of the elevation difference between the starting point and the destination. These findings highlight the significance of elevation fluctuations in shaping network characteristics. Surfacic networks offer a promising framework for comprehensively analyzing and modeling complex systems that are situated on or constrained to a surface environment.</description>

      <title>Learning when to rank: Estimation of partial rankings from sparse, noisy comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common task arising in various domains is that of ranking items based on the outcomes of pairwise comparisons, from ranking players and teams in sports to ranking products or brands in marketing studies and recommendation systems. Statistical inference-based methods such as the Bradley-Terry model, which extract rankings based on an underlying generative model of the comparison outcomes, have emerged as flexible and powerful tools to tackle the task of ranking in empirical data. In situations with limited and/or noisy comparisons, it is often challenging to confidently distinguish the performance of different items based on the evidence available in the data. However, existing inference-based ranking methods overwhelmingly choose to assign each item to a unique rank or score, suggesting a meaningful distinction when there is none. Here, we address this problem by developing a principled Bayesian methodology for learning partial rankings -- rankings with ties -- that distinguishes among the ranks of different items only when there is sufficient evidence available in the data. Our framework is adaptable to any statistical ranking method in which the outcomes of pairwise observations depend on the ranks or scores of the items being compared. We develop a fast agglomerative algorithm to perform Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference of partial rankings under our framework and examine the performance of our method on a variety of real and synthetic network datasets, finding that it frequently gives a more parsimonious summary of the data than traditional ranking, particularly when observations are sparse.</description>

      <title>Making the Peers' Subjective Well-being Visible Impairs Cooperator-centered Experimental Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Past experiments show that reputation or the knowledge of peers' past cooperation can enhance cooperation in human social networks. On the other hand, the knowledge of peers' wealth undermines cooperativeness, and that of peers' interconnectedness and network structure does not affect it. However, it is unknown if making peers' subjective well-being (SWB) available or visible in social networks may enhance or undermine cooperation. Therefore, we implemented online network experiments (N = 662 in 50 networked groups with 15 rounds of interactions), in which study participants cooperated with or defected against connected peers through Public Goods Game, made and cut social ties with others, and rated their SWB. We manipulated the visibility of connected peers' SWB (25 visible vs. 25 invisible SWB networked groups) while keeping the connected peers' reputation and in-game wealth visible. Results show that making the peers/ SWB visible did not alter overall cooperativeness, wealth, inter-connectedness, or SWB. In contrast, the visible SWB networked groups exhibited a higher number of communities and lower transitivity (the proportion of the cases where a peer of a peer is also a peer) than the invisible SWB networked groups. These phenomena are explained by an altered decision-making pattern in the visible SWB networks: cooperators were less likely to connect with cooperators and more likely to connect with defectors, and consequently, cooperators could not maintain their popularity or stay in the center of the networks.</description>

      <title>Limiting distributions of generalized money exchange models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "Money Exchange Model" is a type of agent-based simulation model used to study how wealth distribution and inequality evolve through monetary exchanges between individuals. The primary focus of this model is to identify the limiting wealth distributions that emerge at the macroscopic level, given the microscopic rules governing the exchanges among agents. In this paper, we formulate generalized versions of the immediate exchange model and the uniform saving model both of which are types of money exchange models, as discrete-time interacting particle systems and characterize their stationary distributions. Furthermore, we prove that under appropriate scaling, the asymptotic wealth distribution converges to a Gamma distribution or an exponential distribution for both models. The limiting distribution depends on the weight function that affects the probability distribution of the number of coins exchanged by each agent. In particular, our results provide a mathematically rigorous formulation and generalization of the assertions previously predicted in studies based on numerical simulations and heuristic arguments.</description>

      <title>Heider balance on Archimedean lattices and cliques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the work function $U(T)$ for the Heider balance, driven by a thermal noise $T$, on several planar networks that contain separated triangles, pairs of triangles, chains of triangles and complex structures of triangles. In simulations, the heat-bath algorithm is applied. Two schemes of link values updating are considered: synchronous and asynchronous (sequential). The latter results are compared with analytical calculations for small cliques. We argue that the actual shape of $U(T)$ is a consequence of a local topology rather than of a macroscopic ordering. Finally, we present the mathematical proof that for any planar lattice, perfect structural (Heider) balance is unreachable at $T&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Coupling quantum-like cognition with the neuronal networks within generalized probability theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The past few years have seen a surge in the application of quantum theory methodologies and quantum-like modeling in fields such as cognition, psychology, and decision-making. Despite the success of this approach in explaining various psychological phenomena such as order, conjunction, disjunction, and response replicability effects there remains a potential dissatisfaction due to its lack of clear connection to neurophysiological processes in the brain. Currently, it remains a phenomenological approach. In this paper, we develop a quantum-like representation of networks of communicating neurons. This representation is not based on standard quantum theory but on generalized probability theory (GPT), with a focus on the operational measurement framework. Specifically, we use a version of GPT that relies on ordered linear state spaces rather than the traditional complex Hilbert spaces. A network of communicating neurons is modeled as a weighted directed graph, which is encoded by its weight matrix. The state space of these weight matrices is embedded within the GPT framework, incorporating effect observables and state updates within the theory of measurement instruments a critical aspect of this model. This GPT based approach successfully reproduces key quantum-like effects, such as order, non-repeatability, and disjunction effects (commonly associated with decision interference). Moreover, this framework supports quantum-like modeling in medical diagnostics for neurological conditions such as depression and epilepsy. While this paper focuses primarily on cognition and neuronal networks, the proposed formalism and methodology can be directly applied to a wide range of biological and social networks.</description>

      <title>The Role of Social Interactions in Mitigating Psychological Distress During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Study in Sri Lanka</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive changes in many aspects related to social groups of different socioeconomic backgrounds were caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and as a result, the overall state of mental health was severely affected globally. This study examined how the pandemic affected Sri Lankan citizens representing a range of socioeconomic backgrounds in terms of their mental health. The data used in this research was gathered from 3,020 households using a nationwide face-to-face survey, from which a processed dataset of 921 responses was considered for the final analysis. Four distinct factors were identified by factor analysis (FA) that was conducted and subsequently, the population was clustered using unsupervised clustering to determine which population subgroups were affected similarly. Two such subgroups were identified where the respective relationships to the retrieved principal factors and their demographics were thoroughly examined and interpreted. This resulted in the identification of contrasting perspectives between the two groups toward the maintenance and the state of social relationships during the pandemic, which revealed that one group was more 'socially connected' in nature resulting in their mental state being comparatively better in coping with the pandemic. The other group was seen to be more 'socially reserved' showing an opposite reaction toward social connections while their mental well-being declined showing symptoms such as loneliness, and emptiness in response to the pandemic. The study examined the role of social media, and it was observed that social media was perceived as a substitute for the lack of social connections or primarily used as a coping mechanism in response to the challenges of the pandemic</description>
