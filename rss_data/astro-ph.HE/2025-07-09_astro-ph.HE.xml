      <title>A new Bowen Fluorescence Flare and Extreme Coronal Line Emitter discovered by SRG/eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear transient eRASSt J012026.5-292727 (J012026 hereafter) was discovered in the second SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS2). The source appeared more than one order of magnitude brighter than the eRASS1 upper limits (peak eRASS2 0.2-2.3 keV flux of 1.14 x 10^-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1), and with a soft X-ray spectrum (photon index Gamma = 4.3). Over the following months, the X-ray flux started decaying, with significant flaring activity on both hour- and year-timescales. By inspecting the multiwavelength light curves of time-domain wide-field facilities, we detected a strong mid-infrared flare, evolving over 2 years, and a weaker optical counterpart. Follow-up optical spectroscopy revealed transient features, including redshifted Balmer lines (FWHM ~1500 km/s), strong Fe II emission, He II and Bowen lines, and high-ionization iron coronal lines. One spectrum showed a triple-peaked H-beta line, consistent with emission from a face-on elliptical disk. The spectroscopic features and the slow evolution of the event place J012026 within the classifications of Bowen fluorescence flares (BFFs) and extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs). BFFs have been associated with rejuvenated accreting SMBHs, although the mechanism triggering the onset of the new accretion flow is still unclear, while ECLEs have been linked to the disruption of stars in gas-rich environments. The association of J012026 to both classes, combined with the multi-wavelength information, suggests that BFFs could be, at least in some cases, due to tidal disruption events (TDEs). The observed X-ray variability, uncommon in standard TDEs, adds complexity to these families of nuclear transients. These results highlight the diverse phenomenology of nuclear accretion events and demonstrate the value of systematic X-ray surveys, such as eROSITA and Einstein Probe, for uncovering such transients and characterizing their physical origin.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the ZTF SLRN-2020 star-planet merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the optical and infrared transient ZTF SLRN-2020, previously associated with a star-planet merger. We consider the scenario in which orbital decay via tidal dissipation led to the merger, and find that tidal heating within the star was likely unobservable in the archival image of the system taken $12\mathrm{yr}$ before the merger. The observed dust formation months before the merger is consistent with a planet of mass $M_\mathrm{p} \gtrsim 5M_\mathrm{J}$ ejecting material as it skims the stellar surface. This interaction gradually intensifies, leading to significant mass ejection on a dynamical timescale ($ \approx $ hours) as the planet plunges into the stellar interior. Part of the recombination transient associated with this dynamical mass ejection might be inaccessible to the optical observations because its duration ($ \approx $ hours) is comparable to the cadence. Correspondingly, the observed duration of the transient $\approx100\mathrm{d}$ is inconsistent with a single episode of dynamical mass ejection. Instead, the transient could be powered by the recombination of $ \approx 3.4\times10^{-5}M_\odot $ of hydrogen in an outflow, or the contraction of an inflated envelope of mass $ \approx 10^{-6}M_\odot $ that formed during the merger. The observed ejecta mass $320\mathrm{d}$ after the peak of the optical transient is $ \approx 1.3\times10^{-4}M_\odot$, consistent with the idea that a fraction of the ejecta might be unobservable in the light curve. Energetically, this post-merger ejecta mass suggests a planet at least as massive as Jupiter. Our results suggest that ZTF SLRN-2020 was the result of a merger between a star close to the main sequence and a planet with mass at least several times that of Jupiter.</description>

      <title>Dynamical stability of hypermassive neutron stars against quasi-radial perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical stability of differentially rotating neutron stars, including hypermassive neutron stars, is of paramount importance in understanding the fate of the post-merger remnant of binary neutron stars mergers and the formation of a black hole during core collapse supernovae. We study systematically the dynamical stability of differentially rotating neutron stars within a broad range of masses, rotation rates and degrees of differential rotation, modeled as polytropes with $\Gamma=2$. We pay particular attention to quasi-toroidal configurations that are outside the parameter space region explored in previous works. We estimate the limits of the region of stability against quasi-radial perturbations by performing an extensive set of numerical simulations. We find that some of the stability criteria proposed in the past are not sufficient nor necessary to determine stability if differential rotation is present and propose a new more general criterion. We show that there is a large parameter space that allows for quasi-toroidal configurations that will not collapse immediately to a black hole and that can sustain masses up to $\sim 2.5$ times the maximum mass of a non-rotating neutron star.</description>

      <title>Type Ibn supernovae from ultra-stripped supernova progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-stripped supernovae are core-collapse supernovae from progenitors that lose a significant fraction of mass because of the binary interactions with their compact companion stars. Ultra-stripped supernovae have been connected to fast-evolving faint Type Ib or Ic supernovae. Here, we show that in some cases ultra-stripped supernovae can result in Type Ibn supernovae. Progenitors of ultra-stripped supernovae may trigger violent silicon burning shortly before the core collapse, leading to mass ejection that results in a dense circumstellar matter. By taking an ultra-stripped supernova progenitor that loses 0.2 Msun at 78 days before the core collapse, we compute the light-curve evolution of the ultra-stripped supernova within the dense circumstellar matter. The core collapse results in a supernova explosion with an ejecta mass of 0.06 Msun and an explosion energy of 9e49 erg. Because the dense circumstellar matter is more massive than the supernova ejecta, the ejecta are immediately decelerated and the light curve is powered mainly by the circumstellar interaction. Therefore, this ultra-stripped supernova is likely observed as a Type Ibn supernova. We suggest that some Type Ibn supernovae may originate from ultra-stripped supernova progenitors losing significant mass shortly before their explosion due to violent silicon burning.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR Analysis of the 2024 Periastron Passage of TeV Binary PSR B1259-63</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PSR B1259-63 is a well studied TeV binary, with an energetic pulsar in orbit around a Be star. Using NuSTAR observations during the 2024 passage of the pulsar through the circumstellar disk, we find the spectrum to be the most energetic ($\Gamma$ = 1.5) around 27 days after periastron, during the first of two variable, short-term emission episodes of a contemporaneous GeV flare. We discuss the variability in the X-ray flux and the hardening of the spectrum with time, and in the context of previous observations and what that means for the competing energy loss and acceleration timescales.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning for Identifying Transient Events in X-ray Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether a novel method of quantum machine learning (QML) can identify anomalous events in X-ray light curves as transient events and apply it to detect such events from the XMM-Newton 4XMM-DR14 catalog. The architecture we adopt is a quantum version of the long-short term memory (LSTM) where some fully connected layers are replaced with quantum circuits. The LSTM, making predictions based on preceding data, allows identification of anomalies by comparing predicted and actual time-series data. The necessary training data are generated by simulating active galactic nucleus-like light curves as the species would be a significant population in the XMM-Newton catalog. Additional anomaly data used to assess trained quantum LSTM (QLSTM) models are produced by adding flares like quasi-periodic eruptions to the training data. Comparing various aspects of the performances of the quantum and classical LSTM models, we find that QLSTM models incorporating quantum superposition and entanglement slightly outperform the classical LSTM (CLSTM) model in expressive power, accuracy, and true-positive rate. The highest-performance QLSTM model is then used to identify transient events in 4XMM-DR14. Out of 40154 light curves in the 0.2--12 keV band, we detect 113 light curves with anomalies, or transient event candidates. This number is $\approx$ 1.3 times that of anomalies detectable with the CLSTM model. By utilizing SIMBAD and four wide-field survey catalogs made by ROSAT, SkyMapper, Pan-STARRS, and WISE, no possible counterparts are found for 12 detected anomalies.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Rockets and Gaia Neutron Star Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the spin-aligned electromagnetic recoil force acting on a pulsar vanishes identically in Force-Free Electrodynamics. This contrasts with Hirai et al.'s recent argument that the rocket effect was important for explaining the eccentricity distribution of wide neutron star binaries found by Gaia. Our detailed analysis confirms that for a broad range of initial conditions and natal kick distributions, the rocket velocities of $v_r \gtrsim 30\, \mathrm{km/s}$ are required to account for the observed eccentricities. However, we find that in scenarios where the common envelope phase does not significantly shrink the initial orbit, and the natal kicks are drawn from Paczynski-type distribution, these eccentricities may arise without the influence of an EM rocket. If the natal kicks are perpendicular to the initial orbits, then explaining the Gaia neutron star eccentricities without invoking rockets additionally requires that the pre-supernova binaries avoid significant circularization, and that the mass loss during the supernova is minimal.
  The rocket effect can only be substantial in "weak" pulsars, where pair production near the light cylinder is suppressed and ${\bf E}\cdot{\bf B} \neq 0$ in the outer magnetosphere. We derive a rough estimate for a rocket force in a weak pulsar and relate it to the pulsar's radiative efficiency; simulations are needed to obtain numerically reliable expressions. If future observations prove that rockets are required to explain the data, this would imply that Gaia neutron stars are $\gtrsim $ Myr old, were previously rapidly spinning and are weakly magnetized, with a dipole field $\lesssim 10^{10}$ G and a relatively strong quadrupole component.</description>

      <title>Axion-like Particles and their Possible Impact on the Very High-Energy Spectrum of M87 Observed by LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of very high-energy (VHE) gamma rays from the active galaxy M87 by LHAASO, showing a possible spectral hardening around $20$ TeV, motivates the search for new physics beyond standard emission models. One promising candidate is axion-like particles (ALPs), hypothetical pseudo-scalar bosons that can oscillate into photons in the presence of cosmic magnetic fields. In this work, we investigate whether photon-ALP oscillations and an additional ALP-induced component can account for the tentative hardening observed in M87's VHE spectrum. We model the propagation of photons and ALPs through the jet, the Virgo cluster, the intergalactic medium, and the Galactic magnetic field, over a broad ALPs parameter space. Our statistical analysis finds that, with current LHAASO data, the inclusion of an ALPs component yields only a modest improvement over a standard scenario (maximum significance $\sim$1.56$\sigma$). However, if future observations transform current flux upper limits at tens of TeV into measured fluxes, the significance could reach $\sim$3$\sigma$, providing potential evidence for ALP-induced effects. Our results suggest that M87 remains a promising target to test fundamental physics, and upcoming VHE data could play a key role in probing ALPs parameter space.</description>

      <title>Analytical description of the radio Cherenkov cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio emissions from extensive air showers (EAS) provide a valuable tool for detecting ultra-high-energy (UHE) astroparticles. In this context, several radio arrays focus on detecting highly inclined EAS, as this enables the observation of Earth-skimming UHE neutrinos, in addition to cosmic rays and gamma rays. The reconstruction of such inclined events relies heavily on a thorough understanding of the radio features observed on the ground, with the Cherenkov cone being one of the most prominent. In this study, we demonstrate that the Cherenkov cone can be accurately described for inclined air showers using basic propagation principles. Furthermore, we have developed an analytical model that computes the expected opening angles of the cone and reproduces the asymmetry effects observed in simulations. The high accuracy of these computations can enhance current reconstruction methods and pave the way for the development of new ones.</description>

      <title>A New Search Pipeline for Short Gamma Ray Bursts in Fermi/GBM Data -- A 50% Increase in the Number of Detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the development and the results of a new search pipeline for short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) in the publicly available data from the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board the Fermi satellite. This pipeline uses rigorous statistical methods that are designed to maximize the information extracted from the Fermi/GBM detectors. Our approach differs substantially from existing search efforts in several aspects: The pipeline includes the construction of template banks, Poisson matched filtering, background estimation, background misestimation correction, automatic routines to filter contaminants, statistical estimation of the signal location and a quantitative estimator of the signal probability to be of a cosmological, terrestrial, or solar origin. Our analysis also includes operating the pipeline on "time-slided" copies of the data, which allows exact significance assessment and $p_{\text{astro}}$ computation, akin to the state-of-the-art gravitational waves (GW) data analysis pipelines. Depending on the spectral properties of the bursts, our pipeline achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement by a factor of 2 to 15 over the onboard GBM triggering algorithm. This enhancement increases the detectable volume for sGRBs and results in an approximate 50% increase in sGRB detections in the 2014 GBM dataset. As a further consequence of the sensitivity increase, we detect hundreds of soft gamma-ray flares of galactic origin. This improved sensitivity enhances the chances of detecting fainter, off-axis GRBs that would likely fall below the standard triggering thresholds. Applying this pipeline to the full GBM archive is expected to expand further the joint sGRB-GW detection volume.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the diffuse flux of multi-PeV astrophysical neutrinos obtained with the Baikal Gigaton Volume Detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various theoretical models predict cosmic neutrinos with multi-PeV energies. The recent detection of a ~10^17 eV neutrino in the KM3NeT experiment suggests that these energetic particles can be studied with present-day installations. Here, we present upper limits on the flux of astrophysical neutrinos with energies (10^15.5 - 10^20) eV obtained with the largest liquid-water neutrino telescope, Baikal Gigaton Volume Detector (GVD), using cascade-like events. We discuss astrophysical implications of these results and constrain several cosmogenic neutrino scenarios using a combination of Baikal-GVD, KM3NeT, IceCube and Auger data.</description>

      <title>Improved Gamma-Hadron Separation for PeV Photon Searches with IceCube (ICRC 2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IceTop, the km$^2$ surface array of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole, is sensitive to air showers of all primary particles, including gamma rays. In particular, in the PeV energy range, the combination of IceTop and IceCube's deep optical detector provides excellent gamma-hadron separation. Almost all air showers induced by cosmic-ray protons and heavier nuclei in this energy range contain high-energy muons detectable by the deep detector, while most photon-induced air showers do not. Therefore, IceCube's deep detector can be used to strongly suppress hadronic background in photon searches. Furthermore, the lateral distribution of the air-shower signal in IceTop provides additional gamma-hadron separation. In the PeV energy range, the gamma-hadron separation achieved is better than $10^{-3}$: air-shower events measured with IceCube are suppressed more than 1000 times stronger than photon-induced showers of the same energy simulated with Sibyll 2.3d. This improved gamma-hadron separation in combination with an extension of the energy range to lower energies provides discovery potential for future searches for PeV photon sources in IceCube's field of view.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Ray Physics in the PeV to EeV Energy Range with the IceCube-Gen2 Surface Array (ICRC 2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IceCube-Gen2 is a proposed neutrino observatory at the South Pole that will build on the success of IceCube and will also serve as a unique detector for cosmic-ray air showers. Analogous to the IceTop surface array over IceCube's deep optical detector, IceCube-Gen2 will also feature a surface array above the optical array deep in the ice. As improvement over IceTop, the IceCube-Gen2 surface array will be comprised of elevated detectors to avoid snow coverage, and will combine two types of detectors: scintillation panels that measure air-shower particles on ground and enable a low detection threshold, which is important to serve as a veto for selecting downgoing neutrino candidates, and radio antennas which increase the measurement accuracy for air showers by providing a calorimetric measurement of the electromagnetic shower component and its depth of maximum, $X_\mathrm{max}$. As another major advantage, the eight times larger surface area combined with a larger field of view will provide a 30-fold increase for the aperture of surface-deep coincident events. With these improvements in statistics and measurement accuracy, IceCube-Gen2 will thus make unique contributions to the particle physics and astrophysics of Galactic cosmic rays in the PeV to EeV energy range, including the search for PeV photon sources. This proceeding summarizes the technical design and science case enabled by the IceCube-Gen2 Surface Array.</description>

      <title>Search for Sub-Relativistic Magnetic Monopoles with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles are beyond standard model particles, predicted by Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) to be created during the early universe. At typical masses of the GUT-scale - above $10^{14}$ GeV - these particles would move at sub-relativistic speeds. The Rubakov-Callan effect predicts that magnetic monopoles can catalyze nucleon decays, in particular the decay of protons. This results in a unique signature of small particle cascades along the trajectory of the slow moving magnetic monopole. Since 2012, a dedicated Slow-Particle Filter has been implemented in the IceCube Neutrino Observatory for the detection of magnetic monopoles. Current limits set an upper bound for the monopole flux at $\Phi_{\mathrm{90}}\leq 10^{-17}$ to $10^{-18} \mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{sr}^{-1}$ depending on the catalysis cross section for the proton decay. A detection of the monopole flux thus requires exceptional background rejection and signal efficiency. This is accomplished using machine learning methods. In this analysis, we use a multi-level boosted decision tree classifier. We present the strategy behind the background and signal simulation, the classification efficiency, and IceCube's projected sensitivity for the detection of sub-relativistic magnetic monopoles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRANDProto300 (hereafter referred to as GP300) is a pioneering prototype array of the GRAND experiment. It consists of 300 radio antennas and will cover an area of 200 km$^2$ in a radio-quiet region of western China. Serving as a test bench for the GRAND experiment, GRANDProto300 aims to achieve autonomous radio detection and reconstruction of highly inclined air showers. It is designed to detect ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in the energy range of $10^{16.5}$-$10^{18}$ eV at a rate comparable to that of the Pierre Auger Observatory. Over the past two years, significant improvements have been made to both the hardware and firmware of GP300. Currently, 65 antenna units have been deployed at the site by June 2025. We present the current status of detector commissioning, including updates on hardware, calibration results such as GPS timing and antenna positioning. Additionally, we discuss the solar radio bursts associated with solar flares, the galactic radio emissions detected, and preliminary cosmic ray surveys.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the multi-TeV emission from GRB 221009A with a second electron component accelerated by turbulence in the jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of very high-energy (VHE) afterglow emission of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) provides a unique opportunity to probe particle acceleration in relativistic outflows. The hard spectrum at multi-TeV band cannot be fully explained by synchrotron-self-Compton radiation of the conventional one-zone afterglow model. In this work, we introduce a second component of relativistic electrons from stochastic acceleration via downstream turbulence of the external shock. Using a Fokker-Planck approach to model the evolution of protons and electrons, and the non-linear feedback of turbulence damping, we show that the inverse Compton radiation of the second electron component may harden the observed spectrum above multi-TeV energy, and significantly ameliorate the fitting to the spectral evolution measured by LHAASO without violating lower-energy observations. We also discuss the potential presence of the second electron component in other GRB afterglows, which may provide a possible observational signature for future studies.</description>

      <title>Localisation and host galaxy identification of new Fast Radio Bursts with MeerKAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05982v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately localising fast radio bursts (FRBs) is essential for understanding their birth environments and for their use as cosmological probes. Recent advances in radio interferometry, particularly with MeerKAT, have enabled the localisation of individual bursts with arcsecond precision. In this work, we present the localisation of 15 apparently non-repeating FRBs detected with MeerKAT. Two of the FRBs, discovered in 2022, were localised in 8 second images from the projects which MeerTRAP was commensal to, while eight were localised using the transient buffer pipeline, and another one through SeeKAT, all with arcsecond precision. Four additional FRBs lacked TB triggers and sufficient signal, limiting their localisation only to arcminute precision. For nine of the FRBs in our sample, we identify host galaxies with greater than 90% confidence, while two FRBs have ambiguous associations with two host galaxy candidates. We measured spectroscopic redshifts for six host galaxies, ranging from 0.33 to 0.85, demonstrating MeerKAT's sensitivity to high redshift FRBs. For galaxies with sufficient photometric coverage, we performed spectral energy those of known FRB hosts. This work represents one of the largest uniform samples of well-localised distant FRBs to date, laying the groundwork for using MeerKAT FRBs as cosmological probes and understand how FRB hosts evolve at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Diffuse Astrophysical Neutrino Spectrum above a TeV with All Flavor Starting Events in IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory utilizes the Cherenkov radiation emitted by charged secondary particles produced in interactions of neutrinos with ice nucleons to detect neutrino events. "Starting events", where this interaction vertex is contained inside the detector volume, can be used to distinguish neutrinos from the dominant background of atmospheric through-going muons. We present the Medium Energy Starting Events (MESE) selection, which employs a series of vetoes to obtain a neutrino-pure sample to measure the flux of diffuse extragalactic neutrinos from 1 TeV to 10 PeV from the entire sky. In this talk we will present a measurement of the spectrum of the diffuse flux of neutrinos, which demonstrates strong evidence for structure in the spectrum beyond a single power law, with a significance of $4.2\,\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Combining IceCube Muon Tracks and Cascades to measure the Galactic Diffuse Neutrino Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffuse Galactic neutrino flux is produced by cosmic rays interacting with the interstellar medium. The measurement of this flux can help to understand the distribution of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. The first observation of this neutrino flux was published in 2023 by the IceCube Collaboration. Here, plans for a new analysis combining different event topologies are presented. IceCube measures events in two main topologies. Tracks, originating in charged current $\nu_\mu$ interactions, provide a better angular resolution. In contrast, cascades, from most other possible interactions, provide a better energy resolution and are able to observe the Southern sky (and therefore the Galactic Center) despite the huge background of atmospheric muons. Combining both event topologies in one analysis exploits all these advantages. Sensitivities and model discrimination power of a combined measurement using a forward folding binned likelihood fit are discussed here.</description>

      <title>Constraining the contribution of Seyfert galaxies to the diffuse neutrino flux in light of point source observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the IceCube Collaboration reported evidence for TeV neutrino emission from several nearby Seyfert galaxies, with the highest significance found for NGC 1068. Assuming stochastic proton acceleration in magnetized turbulence inside the corona, we model the neutrino emission of Seyfert galaxies as a function of their X-ray luminosity. Applying our model to NGC 1068, we obtain a good fit to the public IceCube data and constrain the coronal radius to $\lesssim 5 R_S$ by comparing our MeV $\gamma$-ray predictions to Fermi-LAT observations. Extending to the full Seyfert population, we estimate their diffuse neutrino contribution and find that they can explain a significant fraction of the observed flux below $10\,\mathrm{TeV}$. However, scenarios with highly turbulent coronae and high cosmic-ray pressure across the population are ruled out. In particular, if all sources shared the best-fit parameters obtained for NGC 1068, their cumulative neutrino emission would exceed current upper limits at TeV energies by $3.8\sigma$. Our results, informed by both neutrino and $\gamma$-ray data, show that those Seyfert galaxies that emerge as neutrino point sources must be exceptionally efficient neutrino emitters and are not representative of the broader population.</description>

      <title>Observation of Broadband In-ice Radiation from Impacting High-Energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first experimental evidence for in-ice radiofrequency emission from high-energy particle cascades developing in the Antarctic ice sheet. In 208 days of data recorded with the phased-array trigger of the Askaryan Radio Array, we detect 13 events with impulsive radiofrequency pulses originating from below the ice surface. Considering only the arrival angles and timing properties, this rate is inconsistent with an a-posteriori background expectation for thermal noise events and on-surface events at the level of 3.5$\,\sigma$, which rises to 5.1$\,\sigma$ when additionally considering impulsivity. The observed event geometry, event rate, signal shape, spectral content, and electric field polarization are consistent with Askaryan radiation from cosmic ray air shower cores impacting the ice sheet. For the brightest events, the angular radiation pattern independently favors an extended cascade-like emitter over a pointlike source.</description>

      <title>12-Years Observation of Seasonal Variation of Atmospheric Neutrino Flux with IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy atmospheric muon neutrinos are detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory with a high rate of almost a hundred thousand events per year. Being mainly produced in meson decays in cosmic-ray-induced air showers in the upper atmosphere, the flux of these neutrinos is expected to depend on atmospheric conditions and thus features a seasonal variation. The correlation between temperature fluctuations and variations of the neutrino rates can be described with a slope parameter $\alpha$, whose previous measurement with 6 years of IceCube data indicated a discrepancy to theoretical expectations. In this work, we present an update of the previous analysis, extending the statistics to 12-years of IceCube data, as well as adding a region in the Northern Hemisphere to the analysis. We estimate the slope parameter in the Southern Hemisphere to be $\alpha=0.325\pm0.022$, which confirms the previous observation of the tension between the theoretical predictions and experimental measurements with significance $&gt;3\sigma$. Furthermore, the seasonal variation in the Northern Hemisphere has also been observed for the first time, with $\alpha=0.731\pm0.222$. Investigations into systematic effects reveal that the observations not only show a weaker correlation compared to the predictions, but also deviate from the expected linear relation between the atmospheric neutrino flux and the atmospheric temperature.</description>

      <title>IceCat-2: Updated IceCube Event Catalog of Alert Tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present preliminary results for IceCat-2, the second public catalog of IceCube Alert Tracks, which plans to build and improve upon the first release, IceCat-1. The initial catalog, last updated in October 2023, included all real-time alerts issued since 2016, as well as events observed by IceCube since the start of full-detector data collection in 2011 that would have triggered an alert if the program had been in place at that time. IceCat-2 plans to expand on this by incorporating all additional alerts since IceCat-1, and reprocessing all events with significantly improved reconstruction algorithms. A key advancement in IceCat-2 will come from an updated reconstruction technique introduced by the IceCube Collaboration in September 2024. This approach substantially enhances the angular resolution of muon track alerts, while also improving statistical coverage. With respect to IceCat-1, the 50%(90%) angular uncertainty on track alerts is expected to be reduced by a factor of approximately 5(4). These refined reconstructions will allow us to revisit possible correlations between past alerts and sources in gamma-ray and X-ray catalogs. The enhanced precision may uncover new astrophysical associations with known astrophysical sources, offering deeper insight into potential cosmic ray accelerators.</description>

      <title>JWST MIRI/MRS observations of hot molecular gas in an AGN host galaxy at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to play a central role in quenching star formation by removing or destroying molecular gas from host galaxies via radiation-pressure driven outflows and/or radio jets. Some studies of cold molecular gas in galaxies at Cosmic Noon ($z\sim2$) show that AGN have less cold gas ($&lt;$100 K) compared to mass-matched star-forming galaxies. However, cold gas could also be shock-heated to warmer phases, detectable via H$_{2}$ transitions in the rest-frame near- and mid-infrared spectra. The Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) of the Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) aboard JWST has opened a unique window to observe these emission lines in galaxies at Cosmic Noon. We present the first detection of hot molecular gas in cid_346, an X-ray AGN at $z\sim2.2$, via the H$_{2}$ ro-vibrational transition at 2.12 $\mu$m. We measure a hot molecular gas mass of $\sim 8.0 \times 10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$, which is $\sim 10^{5}-10^{6}$ times lower than the cold molecular gas mass. cid_346 is located in an environment with extended gas structures and satellite galaxies. This is supported by detection of hot and cold molecular gas out to distances $&gt;$10 kpc in MIRI/MRS and ALMA data, respectively and ancillary NIRCam imaging that reveals two satellite galaxies at distances of $\sim$0.4 arcsec (3.3 kpc) and $\sim$0.9 arcsec (7.4 kpc) from the AGN. Our results tentatively indicate that while the CO(3-2)-based cold gas phase dominates the molecular gas mass at Cosmic Noon, H$_{2}$ ro-vibrational transitions are effective in tracing hot molecular gas locally in regions that may lack CO emission.</description>

Abstract: A fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have double-peaked H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and Mg II broad lines attributed to emission from rotating gas in the accretion disk. Using optical spectroscopy of a flux-limited sample of AGN selected via ultrahard X-rays from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), we systematically identify 71 double-peaked emitters amongst 343 broad-line AGN with redshifts $0.004&lt;z&lt;0.297$ and 2-10 KeV X-ray luminosities of log 40-45.7 (erg/s), and provide their best-fit accretion disk geometry parameters. We find that ~21% of X-ray selected broad-line AGN are double-peaked emitters (DPEs), consistent with rates previously reported for $z&lt;0.2$ broad-line AGN selected for strong optical variability in ZTF. 11 of 71 DPEs (15%) exhibited a single-peaked Gaussian component to the broad line profile in addition to the double-peaked disk profile. In this sample, DPEs have intrinsically higher masses by ~0.4 dex and lower Eddington ratios by ~0.3 dex than other broad-line AGN, and have a preference for elliptical host galaxies, higher X-ray luminosities, and higher [OI] $\lambda$6302 to narrow H$\alpha$ flux ratios than other broad-line AGN. We find that DPEs are not segregated from other broad-line AGN in the $L_{\rm bol}$ vs $M_{\rm BH}$ relation or their X-ray to radio luminosity ratios, and do not show a preference for intermediate Seyfert types over Seyfert 1s. We do not find differences in a wide range of multi-wavelength properties when comparing DPEs to other broad-line AGN, including optical and mid-IR variability levels, and the rate of changing-look events. We discuss the two populations in the context of multi-component disk-wind models of the AGN broad line region and consider how unrecognized contributions of disk emission to the broad lines introduce biases in virial SMBH mass estimates.</description>

      <title>Dynamical scheme for computing the mass parameter of a system in a medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for extracting a mass parameter using time-dependent density functional theory for an arbitrary physical system, provided the adiabatic limit is achievable. This approach works for collective variables also in the presence of a medium, in particular for the nuclei interacting with a neutron background. We apply the method to extract mass parameters of impurities in the neutron star crust, like their inertial masses and quadrupole mass parameters. The extracted mass parameters at various depths of the inner crust are compared with other methods, including the hydrodynamic approach. The presented method opens avenues for the construction of an effective model of neutron star crust grounded in microscopic calculations.</description>

      <title>An optical to infrared study of type II SN2024ggi at nebular times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present 0.3-21mic observations at ~275d and ~400d for Type II supernova (SN) 2024ggi, combining ground-based optical and near-infrared data from the Keck I/II telescopes and space-based infrared data from the James Webb Space Telescope. Although the optical regions dominate the observed flux, SN2024ggi is bright at infrared wavelengths (65%/35% falls each side of 1mic). SN2024ggi exhibits a plethora of emission lines from H, He, intermediate-mass elements (O, Na, Mg, S, Ar, Ca), and iron-group elements (IGEs; Fe, Co, and Ni) -- all lines have essentially the same width, suggesting efficient macroscopic chemical mixing of the inner ejecta at &lt;~2000km/s and little mixing of 56Ni at larger velocities. Molecular emission in the infrared range is dominated by the CO fundamental, which radiates about 5% of the total SN luminosity. A molecule-free radiative-transfer model based on a standard red-supergiant star explosion (i.e., ~1e51erg, 0.06Msun of 56Ni from a 15.2Msun progenitor) yields a satisfactory match throughout the optical and infrared at both epochs. The SN2024ggi CO luminosity is comparable to the fractional decay-power absorbed in the model C/O-rich shell -- accounting for CO cooling would likely resolve the model overestimate of the [OI]0.632mic flux. The relative weakness of the molecular emission in SN2024ggi and the good overall match obtained with our molecule-free model suggests negligible microscopic mixing -- about 95% of the SN luminosity is radiated by atoms and ions. Lines from IGEs, which form from explosion ashes at such late times, are ideal diagnostics of the magnitude of 56Ni mixing in core-collapse SN ejecta. Stable Ni, clearly identified in SN2024ggi (e.g., [NiII]6.634mic), is probably a common product of massive-star explosions.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing PTA measurements via early seeding of supermassive black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing evidence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) being present in the early Universe poses challenges to their traditional formation pathways. Separately, studies suggest that merging SMBH binaries with total masses $\gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$ could be the primary sources of the nanohertz gravitational wave background detected by the Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). Owing to their extreme masses, these SMBHs have a higher probability of forming earlier than their lower-mass counterparts. In this work, we provide a formalism to calculate the implications of early seeded SMBHs for the PTA signal. As an application, we explore the two most prominent scenarios of high-$z$ SMBHs seeding mechanisms: direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) and collapse of supermassive dark stars (SMDSs). We show that SMDS-seeded SMBHs, with comoving seed number density of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) \, {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ can be the dominant contributor to the PTA signal, with mass $&gt; 10^9 M_\odot$ binaries acquiring a peak merger rate at $z&lt; 1$. By contrast, SMBHs seeded via the DCBH channel may contribute only sub-dominantly unless produced with a much larger number density than implied by numerical simulations. Our analysis further suggests that the seed number density should be $&lt; \mathcal{O}(10^{-1}) \, {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ in order to not over-predict the expected PTA signal.</description>

      <title>Can Orbital Decay of Accreting Binary Pulsars Probe Dark Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The merger of binary pulsars in dark matter (DM)-rich environments can result in DM particle accretion, leading to an increase in the individual pulsar masses. In this work, we investigate the effects of DM accretion on the change in orbital period rate of binary pulsars. Our analysis reveals that while DM accretion increases the system's mass, it may also modify the orbital evolution by enhancing the orbital decay rate. By comparing our results with existing binary pulsar data near Earth's location, we report that the current DM accretion rate is insufficient to place meaningful constraints on DM particle properties. However, we demonstrate that future observations of pulsar mergers in the high DM-density environment of the galactic center could offer a unique opportunity to probe DM microphysics through this mechanism.</description>

      <title>The dynamics and electromagnetic signatures of accretion in unequal mass binary black hole inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the gravitational wave (GW) driven inspirals of accreting black hole binaries with mass $M = 10^7 M_\odot$ and mass ratios between $10^{-3}$ and $10^{-1}$. Our results are based on analytic estimates, and grid-based hydrodynamics simulations run for many thousands of binary orbits before the merger. We show that the GW inspiral is evident in the light curves and color evolution of a binary-hosting quasar, over years to decades before a merger. The long-term electromagnetic (EM) signature is characterized by a gradual UV brightening, and X-ray dimming, followed by an X-ray disappearance hours to days before the GW burst, and finally a years-like re-brightening as the disk relaxes and refuels the remnant black hole. These timescales are surprisingly insensitive to the amplitude of viscous stress in the disk. The spectrum of quasi-thermal disk emission shows two peaks: one in the UV, and another in the X-ray, associated with the outer and circum-secondary disks respectively; emission from the inner disk is suppressed because the secondary consumes most of the inflowing gas. We discuss implications for real-time and archival EM followup of GW bursts detected by LISA.</description>

      <title>The curious case of EP241021a: Unraveling the mystery of its exceptional rebrightening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) are a rare and poorly understood phenomenon with a variety of possible progenitors. The launch of the Einstein Probe (EP) mission has facilitated a rapid increase in the real-time discovery and follow-up of FXTs. We focus on the recent EP discovered transient EP241021a, which shows a peculiar panchromatic behavior. We obtained optical and near-infrared multi-band imaging and spectroscopy with the Fraunhofer Telescope at Wendelstein Observatory, the Hobby-Eberly Telescope, and the Very Large Telescope over the first 100 days of its evolution. EP241021a was discovered by EP as a soft X-ray trigger, but was not detected at gamma-ray frequencies. The observed soft X-ray prompt emission spectrum is consistent with non-thermal radiation, which requires at least a mildly relativistic outflow with bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma \gtrsim 4$. The optical and near-infrared lightcurve has a two component behavior where an initially fading component $\sim t^{-1}$ turns to a rise steeper than $\sim t^{4}$ after a few days before peaking at $M_r\approx -21.8$ mag and quickly returning to the initial decay. The peak absolute magnitude is the most luminous optical emission associated to an FXT, superseding EP240414a. Standard supernova models are unable to reproduce either the absolute magnitude or rapid timescale ($&lt;2$ d) of the rebrightening. The X-ray, optical and near-infrared spectral energy distributions display a red color $r-J\approx 0.8$ mag, and point to a non-thermal origin ($\nu^{-1}$) for the broadband emission. By considering a gamma-ray burst as a plausible scenario, we favor a refreshed shock as the cause of the rebrightening. This is consistent with the inference of an at least mildly relativistic outflow based on the prompt trigger. Our results suggest a link between EP discovered FXTs and gamma-ray bursts.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Cyclic Spectroscopy in the Partial-Deconvolution Regime: Benefits &amp; Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore possible advantages of cyclic spectroscopy for observations of pulsars in instances where full cyclic deconvolution is not feasible. We compute cyclic merits and full-deconvolution regime boundaries for pulsars observed by NANOGrav and discuss which sources stand to benefit the most from using cyclic spectroscopy when observed with the Green Bank Telescope and DSA-2000 in a given frequency range. We compare data products, namely the wavefield, in both full-deconvolution and partial-deconvolution regimes to demonstrate what can be accomplished with incomplete phase retrieval. Additionally, we show how some phase retrieval can still be achieved in the partial-deconvolution regime and how this allows for additional information in scintillation-based data products, like the dynamic wavefield power, compared to what can be found in traditional dynamic spectra. An examination of dynamic wavefield phase as a function of observing frequency reveals more complete phase retrieval is achieved the closer one gets to the full deconvolution regime, agreeing with the expectations of cyclic merit. While we demonstrate that fragmentary recovery of the secondary wavefield can be accomplished in the partial-deconvolution regime, we advocate for a synergistic approach with phase retrieval methods like the $\theta-\theta$ transform, although we also provide discussion about shortcomings of this strategy. Finally, we use the combination of modest cyclic merit and lack of discernible results for PSR J1903$+$0327 to motivate the creation of an updated "cyclic merit 2.0", which relies on scintillation bandwidth instead of observing bandwidth.</description>

      <title>SRG/eROSITA No. 5: Discovery of quasi-periodic eruptions every ~3.7 days from a galaxy at z&gt;0.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are repeating soft X-ray bursts from the nuclei of galaxies, tantalizingly proposed to be extreme mass ratio inspirals. Here, we report the discovery of a new galaxy showing X-ray QPEs, the fifth found through a dedicated blind search in the \emph{SRG}/eROSITA all-sky survey data, hereafter named eRO-QPE5. Its QPE duration ($t_{\rm dur}\sim0.6$\,d), recurrence time ($t_{\rm recur}\sim3.7\,$d), integrated energy per eruption ($\sim3.4 \times 10^{47}\,$erg), and black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}=2.9^{+5.4}_{-2.2}\times10^7\,M_{\astrosun}$) sit at the high end of the known population. Like other eROSITA or X-ray-discovered QPEs, no previous or concurrent optical-IR transient is found in archival photometric datasets, and the optical spectrum looks almost featureless. With a spectroscopic redshift of $0.1155$, eRO-QPE5 is the most distant QPE source discovered to date. Given the number of recent discoveries, we test for possible correlations and confirm a connection between $t_{\rm dur}$ and $t_{\rm recur}$, while we do not find any significant correlation involving either $M_{\rm BH}$ or the QPE temperature. The slope of the $t_{\rm dur}-t_{\rm recur}$ relation ($1.14\pm0.16$) is roughly consistent with predictions from star-disk collision models, with a preference for those that suggest that QPEs are powered by stellar debris streams around the orbiter. Considering this and previous discoveries, eROSITA has proved extremely successful in finding many QPE candidates given its grasp, namely its sensitivity and large field of view, and scanning capabilities over the full sky. We advocate the need of sensitive wide-area and time-domain oriented surveys from future-generation soft X-ray missions.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified scheme of blazar evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques are increasingly used across astrophysics, enabled by the growing availability of data and improved acquisition methods. These approaches now support tasks from redshift estimation to source classification. In this work, we aim to (i) classify blazars from the Fermi 4LAC-DR3 catalogue, in particular to identify the likely origin of blazars of uncertain type (BCUs), and (ii) investigate the full blazar sample to study their structure and redshift-luminosity evolution. We focus especially on the transition region between Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs), which may yield insights into accretion disk evolution. We examine Changing-Look Blazars (CLBs) as potential intermediates in this transition. We implement a classification pipeline using both a strong benchmark model (XGBoost) and a foundation model pre-trained on millions of tabular datasets (TabPFN). By extracting and reducing the high-dimensional latent space of the best model, we provide a 2D representation of the blazar population. This reveals a continuum between FSRQs and BL Lacs, including CLBs as transitional sources. These results support a scenario of gradual evolution from radiatively efficient (FSRQ-like) to inefficient (BL Lac-like) accretion. Ultimately, we show that a single probability score, combined with the latent space, offers a new framework for interpreting blazar diversity beyond discrete classes.</description>

      <title>Dark Kinetic Heating of Exoplanets and Brown Dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark kinetic heating of neutron stars has been previously studied as a promising dark matter detection avenue. Kinetic heating occurs when dark matter is sped up to relativistic speeds in the gravitational well of high-escape velocity objects, and deposits kinetic energy after becoming captured by the object, thereby increasing its temperature. We show that dark kinetic heating can be significant even in objects with low-escape velocities, such as exoplanets and brown dwarfs, increasing the discovery potential of such searches. This can occur if there is a long-range dark force, creating a "dark escape velocity", leading to heating rates substantially larger than those expected from neutron stars. We consequently set constraints on dark sector parameters using Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and JWST data on Super-Jupiter WISE 0855-0714, and map out future sensitivity to the dark matter scattering cross section below $10^{-40}~{\rm cm}^2$. We compare dark kinetic heating rates of other lower escape velocity objects such as the Earth, Sun, and white dwarfs, finding complementary kinetic heating signals are possible depending on particle physics parameters.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Interactions in White Dwarfs: A Multi-Energy Approach to Capture Mechanisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs offer a compelling avenue for probing interactions of dark matter particles, particularly in the challenging sub-GeV mass regime. The constraints derived from these celestial objects strongly depend on the existence of high dark matter densities in the corresponding regions of the Universe, where white dwarfs are observed. This implies that excluding the parameter space using local white dwarfs would present a significant challenge, primarily due to the low dark matter density in the solar neighbourhood. This limitation prompts the exploration of alternative scenarios involving dark matter particles with a diverse spectrum of kinetic energies. In this work, we investigate how these dark matter particles traverse the star, interact with stellar matter, and ultimately get captured. To accomplish this, we approximate the dark matter flux as a delta function and inspired on the Three Portal Model, we assume that fermionic dark matter interacts with stellar matter either through a broken $U(1)$ gauge vector mediator or a scalar. In our computations, we consider how interactions might vary across different energy regimes, from high-energy deep inelastic scattering and inelastic scatterings via the production of $N-$ and $\Delta-$ resonances to lower-energy elastic interactions with nucleons and nuclei. Our study models these inelastic resonant interactions with dark matter and vector or scalar mediators for the very first time. We provide insights into the specific conditions required for successfully boosted dark matter capture in white dwarfs. We found that, in general, dark matter capture is most likely to occur at low energies, as expected. However, in the high-energy regime, there remains a small window for capture through resonant and deep inelastic scattering processes.</description>

Abstract: We investigate analogue gravity phenomena arising as a result of the linear perturbation of the spherically symmetric accretion flows onto non rotating black holes, where the gravitational field is determined by a set of post Newtonian pseudo Schwarzschild black hole potentials and the infaling matter is described by a relativistic multi-species equation of state. The stationary transonic integral accretion solutions corresponding to the steady state of aforementioned type of accreting systems are constructed and the stability analysis of such solutions are performed through the time dependent linear perturbation of the accretion flow. Such linear stability analysis leads to the formation of a black hole like sonic metric embedded within the infalling matter. The acoustic horizons are then identified by constructing the causal structure, i.e., the Carter-Penrose diagrams. The variation of the analogue surface gravity corresponding to the aforementioned sonic metric has been studied as a function of various parameters governing the accretion flow.</description>

      <title>Over-Luminous Type Ia Supernovae and Standard Candle Cosmology</title>

Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) serve as crucial cosmological distance indicators because of their empirical consistency in peak luminosity and characteristic light curve decline rates. These properties facilitate them to be standardized candles for the determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) within late-time universe cosmology. Nevertheless, a statistically significant difference persists between $H_0$ values derived from early and late-time measurements, a phenomenon known as the Hubble tension. Furthermore, recent observations have identified a subset of over-luminous SNe Ia, characterized by peak luminosities exceeding the nominal range and faster decline rates. These discoveries raise questions regarding the reliability of SNe Ia as standard candles for measuring cosmological distances. In this article, we present the Bayesian analysis of eight over-luminous SNe Ia and show that they yield a lower $H_0$ estimate, exhibiting closer concordance with $H_0$ estimates derived from early-universe data. This investigation potentially represents a step toward addressing the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Outliers: Low-Spin Halos Explain the Abundance, Compactness, and Redshift Evolution of the Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Little Red Dots (LRDs) are high-redshift galaxies uncovered by JWST, characterized by small effective radii ($R_{\rm eff} \sim 80-300$ pc), number densities that are intermediate between those of typical galaxies and quasars, and a redshift distribution peaked at $z \sim 5$. We present a theoretical model in which the LRDs descend from dark matter halos in the extreme low-spin tail of the angular momentum distribution. Within this framework, we explain their three key observational signatures: (i) abundance, (ii) compactness, and (iii) redshift distribution. Our model focuses on observed, not modeled, properties; it is thus independent of whether they are powered primarily by a black hole or stars. We find that the assumption that the prototypical LRD at $z\sim5$ originates from halos in the lowest $\sim 1\%$ of the spin distribution is sufficient to reproduce both their observed number densities and physical sizes. The redshift evolution of their observability is driven by the interplay between the evolving compact disk fraction and cosmological surface brightness dimming. This effect leads to a well-defined "LRDs Era" at $4&lt;z&lt;8$, during which the LRDs are common and detectable; at $z&lt;4$, they are bright but rare, while at $z&gt;8$, they are common but faint. Finally, we test the predicted redshift trend against observational data, finding excellent agreement. Additional observational support comes from their excess small-scale clustering and spectral signatures of extreme core densities, both of which are expected outcomes of galaxy formation in low-spin halos. These findings suggest that the LRDs are not a fundamentally distinct population but the natural manifestation of galaxies forming in the rarest, lowest angular momentum environments.</description>
