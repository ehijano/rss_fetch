      <title>Topological invariant of velocity field in quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the velocity field of the Bloch electrons and propose the velocity field approach to characterize the topological invariants of quantum states. We find that the zero modes of the velocity field flow play the roles of effective topological charges or defects. A key global property of the zero modes is topological invariant against the parameter deformation. These can be characterized by the Euler characteristic based on the Poincar\'{e}-Hopf theorem. We demonstrate the validity of this approach by using the quantum sphere and torus models. The topological invariants of the velocity field in the quantum sphere and torus are consistent with the mathematical results of the vector fields in the manifolds of the sphere and torus, Euler characteristic $\chi=2$ for sphere and $\chi=0$ for torus. We also discuss the non-Hermitian quantum torus model and compare differences in the topological invariants obtained using the velocity field and Chern number methods. The topological invariant characterized by the velocity field is homeomorphic in the Brillouin zone and the subbase manifold of the SU(2)-bundle of the system, whereas the Chern number characterizes a homotopic invariant that is associated with the exceptional points in the Brillouin zone. These results enrich the topological invariants of quantum states and provide novel insights into the topological invariants of quantum states.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Approach to Mitigate Errors in Linear Photonic Bell-State Measurement for Quantum Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical quantum information processing critically relies on Bell-state measurement, a ubiquitous operation for quantum communication and computing. Its practical realization involves the interference of optical modes and the detection of a single photon in an indistinguishable manner. Yet, in the absence of efficient photon-number resolution capabilities, errors arise from multi-photon components, decreasing the overall process fidelity. Here, we introduce a novel hybrid detection scheme for Bell-state measurement, leveraging both on-off single-photon detection and quadrature conditioning via homodyne detection. We derive explicit fidelities for quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping processes employing this strategy, demonstrating its efficacy. We also compare with photon-number resolving detectors and find a strong advantage of the hybrid scheme in a wide range of parameters. This work provides a new tool for linear optics schemes, with applications to quantum state engineering and quantum interconnects.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate GHZ Encoding Using All-to-all Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $N$-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state is an important resource for quantum technologies. We consider the task of GHZ encoding using all-to-all interactions, which prepares the GHZ state in a special case, and is furthermore useful for quantum error correction and enhancing the rate of qubit interactions. The naive protocol based on parallelizing CNOT gates takes $\mathrm{O}(1)$-time of Hamiltonian evolution. In this work, we propose a fast protocol that achieves GHZ encoding with high accuracy. The evolution time $\mathrm{O}(\log^2N/N)$ almost saturates the theoretical limit $\Omega(\log N/N)$. Moreover, the final state is close to the ideal encoded one with high fidelity $&gt; 1-10^{-3}$, up to large system sizes $N\lesssim 2000$. The protocol only requires a few stages of time-independent Hamiltonian evolution; the key idea is to use the data qubit as control, and to use fast spin-squeezing dynamics generated by e.g. two-axis-twisting.</description>

      <title>Phases and phase transition in Grover's algorithm with systematic noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While limitations on quantum computation by Markovian environmental noise are well-understood in generality, their behavior for different quantum circuits and noise realizations can be less universal. Here we consider a canonical quantum algorithm - Grover's algorithm for unordered search on $L$ qubits - in the presence of systematic noise. This allows us to write the behavior as a random Floquet unitary, which we show is well-characterized by random matrix theory (RMT). The RMT analysis enables analytical predictions for phases and phase transitions of the many-body dynamics. We find two separate transitions. At moderate disorder $\delta_{c,\mathrm{gap}}\sim L^{-1}$, there is a ergodicity breaking transition such that a finite-dimensional manifold remains non-ergodic for $\delta &lt; \delta_{c,\mathrm{gap}}$. Computational power is lost at a much smaller disorder, $\delta_{c,\mathrm{comp}} \sim L^{-1/2}2^{-L/2}$. We comment on relevance to non-systematic noise in realistic quantum computers, including cold atom, trapped ion, and superconducting platforms.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Tolerant Superconducting Spiral Resonators for Circuit QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spiral resonators of thin film niobium (Nb) that exhibit large geometric inductance, high critical magnetic fields and high single photon quality factors. These low loss geometric inductors can be a compelling alternative to kinetic inductors to create high-impedance superconducting devices for applications that require magnetic fields. By varying the spiral pitch, we realize resonators with characteristic impedances ranging from 3.25-7.09 k{\Omega}. We measure the temperature and magnetic field dependent losses and find that the high-impedance resonators maintain an intrinsic quality factor above {\sim} 10^5 for parallel magnetic fields of up to 1 T. These properties make spiral Nb resonators a promising candidate for quantum devices that require circuit elements with high impedance and magnetic field resilience.</description>

      <title>Reverse engineering control of relative phase and populations of two-level quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the simultaneous control of the relative phase and populations of two-level quantum systems by an external field. We apply a reverse engineering approach, which allows obtaining an analytical expression for the control field depending upon two user-defined functions that dictate the population and the relative phase dynamics. We show that, in general, the prescribed functions for the dynamics cannot be chosen arbitrarily. We implement the reverse engineering technique to reach several target states using different kinds of functions to specify the system dynamics. We show that by adjusting these dynamical functions, we can produce different kinds of control fields. These controls can be easily build, needing, apart from the dynamical function themselves, only their derivatives. The methodology presented here will certainly find many applications that go beyond simple two-level systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics aims to explore quantum features to enhance energy conversion beyond classical limits. While significant progress has been made, the understanding of caloric potentials in quantum systems remains incomplete. In this context, this study focuses on deriving general expressions for these caloric potentials by developing a quantum Maxwell relationship obtained from a thermal average form of the Ehrenfest theorem. Our results recover the classical cases and also reveal that the isothermal entropy change can be related to genuine quantum correlations in the system. Thus, this work provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the caloric behavior of quantum systems and their potential applications in caloric devices.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the quantum properties of ultralight dark matter -- an open quantum systems approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining insight into the constituents of dark matter and their interactions with normal matter has inspired a wide range of experimental efforts. Several approaches, particularly those involving searches for ultralight bosonic dark matter (UBDM) fields, involve the use of quantum systems or measurements performed at the limits imposed by quantum mechanics. While a classical treatment of UBDM and its detectors is satisfactory, a fully quantum description would assist in developing future detection strategies. Here, we present an open quantum systems approach that accomplishes this while providing intuition into the quantum nature of the detection process itself. Furthermore, we apply the quantum theory of optical coherence to characterize the statistical properties of the UBDM field. Using representative examples, we show that this theoretical treatment has implications in uncovering signatures of the cosmological production mechanism of the UBDM field and its galactic merger history. By adapting tools from quantum optics, this work will help facilitate the creation of novel methods to extract astrophysically relevant information from correlation measurements.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced quantum synchronization and maximally entangled mixed states in superconducting circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random fluctuations can lead to cooperative effects in complex systems. We here report the experimental observation of noise-induced quantum synchronization in a chain of superconducting transmon qubits with nearest-neighbor interactions. The application of Gaussian white noise to a single site leads to synchronous oscillations in the entire chain. We show that the two synchronized end qubits are entangled, with nonzero concurrence, and that they belong to a class of generalized Bell states known as maximally entangled mixed states, whose entanglement cannot be increased by any global unitary. We further demonstrate the stability against frequency detuning of both synchronization and entanglement by determining the corresponding generalized Arnold tongue diagrams. Our results highlight the constructive influence of noise in a quantum many-body system and uncover the potential role of synchronization for mixed-state quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Correlations enable lossless ergotropy transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "A battery powers a device" can be read as "work stored in the battery is being transported to the device." In quantum batteries, the total amount of stored work can be measured by ergotropy, which is the maximal work extractable by unitary operations. Transporting ergotropy is fundamentally different from transporting energy, and here we find that ergotropy can be gained even when the transmission channel is strictly energy conserving. We show that, generically, ergotropy transport is lossy whenever the two systems start uncorrelated. In contrast, for a large class of correlated initial states, transport can be gainful. Furthermore, a single correlated state can be used multiple times, allowing to transport without losses an order of magnitude more work than the battery capacity. Correlations are thus a useful resource for ergotropy transport, and we quantify how this resource is consumed during gainful transport.</description>

      <title>Complete Positivity and Thermal Relaxation in Quadratic Quantum Master Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a systematic method for deriving quantum master equations that satisfy the requirements of a completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) map, further describing thermal relaxation processes. In this paper, we assume that the quantum master equation is obtained through the canonical quantization of the generalized Brownian motion proposed in [Physics Letters A, 494, 129277 (2024)]. At least classically, this dynamics describes the thermal relaxation process regardless of the choice of the system Hamiltonian. The remaining task is to identify the parameters ensuring that the quantum master equation meets complete positivity. We limit our discussion to many-body quadratic Hamiltonians and establish a CPTP criterion for our quantum master equation. This criterion is useful for applying our quantum master equation to models with interaction such as a network model, which has been used to investigate how quantum effects modify heat conduction.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Entangled Quantum Noise Radar Over Order of Kilometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, for the first time to our knowledge, an explicit expression for the maximum detection range of an entangled quantum two-mode squeezed (QTMS) radar, in which a two-mode squeezed vacuum state of microwave electromagnetic fields is used, has been derived by considering both the quantum properties of the entangled microwave fields and radar parameters. By comparing this equation with that of traditional radars, we show that one can view a QTMS radar as a traditional radar with a reduced threshold signal-to-noise ratio. By discussing the current limitations, it has been shown that the critical parameter to achieve both simultaneous quantum advantage and substantial radar range is increasing the bandwidth of the generated output signal in the quantum entangled source. It has been demonstrated that, by considering the current feasible system parameters, it is possible to implement a QTMS radar with a maximum detection range of up to 2km, which is suitable for recognizing small unmanned aerial vehicles at urban distances. Moreover, based on the false alarm rate, we introduce two classes of early alarm and track QTMS radars. This approach can be generalized to other quantum radars with different types of quantum sources, such as electro-opto-mechanical sources, and may shed new light on investigating quantum radar systems for practical applications, such as far-distance ultrasensitive contactless vital sign detection and counter-Drone technology. Finally, we discuss potential outlooks to improve and develop quantum entangled radar systems to be practical from an engineering point of view.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Derivation of two-time second-order correlation function by following approaches such as stochastic differential equation, coherent-state propagator, and quasi-statistical distribution function is presented. In the process, the time dependence of the operators is transferred to the density operator by making use of trace operation in which the coherent state propagator and $Q$-function that represent the quantum system under consideration are expressed in terms of different time parameters. Even though the number of resulting integrations are found to be large, the accompanying implementation turns out to be straightforward in view that the associated $c$-number functions are Gaussian by nature. In relation to the asserted possibility of rewriting the result of one of the approaches in terms of the other, the presented derivation is expected to lay a strong foundation for viable technique of calculating correlations of various moments at different times that can be deployed in revealing quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Activation of post-quantum steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are possible physical theories that give greater violations of Bell's inequalities than the corresponding Tsirelson bound, termed post-quantum non-locality. Such theories do not violate special relativity, but could give an advantage in certain information processing tasks. There is another way in which entangled quantum states exhibit non-classical phenomena, with one notable example being Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering; a violation of a bipartite Bell inequality implies EPR steering, but the converse is not necessarily true. The study of post-quantum EPR steering is more intricate, but it has been shown that it does not always imply post-quantum non-locality in a conventional Bell test. In this work we show how to distribute resources in a larger network that individually do not demonstrate post-quantum non-locality but violate a Tsirelson bound for the network. That is, we show how to activate post-quantum steering so that it can now be witnessed as post-quantum correlations in a Bell scenario. One element of our work that may be of independent interest is we show how to self-test a bipartite quantum assemblage in a network, even assuming post-quantum resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent photon sources are key elements in different applications, ranging from quantum sensing to quantum computing. In the context of circuit quantum electrodynamics, there have been multiple proposals for potential coherent sources of photons, but a well established candidate is still missing. The possibility of designing and engineering superconducting circuits behaving like artificial atoms supports the realization of quantum optics protocols, including microwave photons generation. Here we propose and theoretically investigate a new design that allows a tunable photon injection directly on-chip. The scheme is based on initiating a population inversion in a superconducting circuit that will act as the photon source of one or multiple target resonators. The key novelty of the proposed layout consists in replacing the usual capacitive link between the source and the target cavity with a tunable coupler, with the advantage of having on-demand control on the injected steady-state photons. We validate the dynamical control of the generated coherent states under the effect of an external flux threading the tunable coupler and discuss the possibility of employing this scheme also in the context of multiple bosonic reservoirs.</description>

      <title>m-QMDS codes over mixed alphabets via orthogonal arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) with good parameters is a hot topic in the area of quantum information and quantum computing. Quantum maximum distance separable (QMDS) codes are optimal because the minimum distance cannot be improved for a given length and code size. The QMDS codes over mixed alphabets are rarely known even if the existence and construction of QECCs over mixed alphabets with minimum distance more than or equal to three are still an open question. In this paper, we define an $m$-QMDS code over mixed alphabets, which is a generalization of QMDS codes. We establish a relation between $m$-QMDS codes over mixed alphabets and asymmetrical orthogonal arrays (OAs) with orthogonal partitions. Using this relation, we propose a general method to construct $m$-QMDS codes. As applications of this method, numerous infinite families of $m$-QMDS codes over mixed alphabets can be constructed explicitly. Compared with existing codes, the constructed codes have more flexibility in the choice of parameters, such as the alphabet sizes, length and dimension of the encoding state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum computer offers significant advantages in simulating physical systems, particularly those with exponentially large state spaces, such as quantum systems. Stochastic reaction-diffusion systems, characterized by their stochastic nature, also exhibit exponential growth in the dimension of the state space, posing challenges for simulation at a probability distribution level. We explore the quantum simulation of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems on a digital quantum computer, directly simulating the system at the master equation level. Leveraging a spin representation of the system, we employ Trotterization and probabilistic imaginary time evolution (PITE) to simulate the probability distribution directly. We illustrate this approach through four diverse examples, ranging from simple single-lattice site generation-annihilation processes to a system featuring active-absorbing phase transition.</description>

      <title>Entanglement classification and \emph{non-k}-separability certification via Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-class fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body quantum systems can be characterised using the notions of \emph{k}-separability and entanglement depth. A quantum state is \emph{k}-separable if it can be expressed as a mixture of \emph{k} entangled subsystems, and its entanglement depth is given by the size of the largest entangled subsystem. In this paper we propose a multipartite entanglement measure that satisfies the following criteria: (i) it can be used with both pure and mixed states; (ii) it is encoded in a single element of the density matrix, so it does not require knowledge of the full spectrum of the density matrix; (iii) it can be applied to large systems; and (iv) it can be experimentally verified. The proposed method allows the certification of \emph{non-k}-separability of a given quantum state. We show that the proposed method successfully classifies three-qubit systems into known stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) classes, namely bipartite, \mbox{W-,} and GHZ-type entanglement. Furthermore, we characterise the \emph{non-k}-separability in known nine SLOCC classes of four-qubit states, absolutely maximally entangled states for five and six qubits and for arbitrary size qubit Dicke states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Equation-of-Motion Method with Single, Double, and Triple Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum equation-of-motion (qEOM) method with singles and doubles has been suggested to study electronically excited states while it fails to predict the excitation energies dominated by double excitations. In this work, we present an efficient implementation of the qEOM method with single, double and triple excitations. In order to reduce the computational complexity, we utilize the point group symmetry and perturbation theory to screen triple excitation operators, and the scaling is reduced from $N_o^6N_v^6$ to $N_o^5N_v^5$. Furthermore, we introduce a perturbation correction to the excitation energy to account for the effect of ignored triple excitation operators. We apply this method to study challenging cases, for which the qEOM-SD method exhibits large errors, such as the 2 $^1\Delta$ excited state of $\rm{CH}^+$ and the 2 $^1\Sigma$ state of $\rm{H}_8$ molecule. Our new method yields the energy errors less than 0.18 eV.</description>

      <title>Activation of post-quantumness in bipartite generalised EPR scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlations generated in generalised Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) scenarios are examples of non-signalling bipartite resources that can exhibit post-quantum behavior. There exist assemblages that, despite being post-quantum resources, can only generate quantum correlations in bipartite Bell-type scenarios. Here, we present a protocol for activation of post-quantumness in bipartite Bob-with-input, measurement-device-independent and channel EPR scenarios. By designing a protocol that involves distributing the assemblages in a larger network, we derive tailored Bell inequalities which can be violated beyond their quantum bound in this new set-up.</description>

      <title>Quantum Random Walks and Quantum Oscillator in an Infinite-Dimensional Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider quantum random walks in an infinite-dimensional phase space constructed using Weyl representation of the coordinate and momentum operators in the space of functions on a Hilbert space which are square integrable with respect to a shift-invariant measure. We study unitary groups of shift operators in the phase space and averaging of such shifts by Gaussian vectors, which form semigroups of self-adjoint contractions: we find conditions for their strong continuity and establish properties of their generators. Significant differences in their properties allow us to show the absence of the Fourier transform as a unitary transformation that implements the unitary equivalence of these compressive semigroups. Next, we prove the Taylor formula for a certain special subset of smooth functions for shifting to a non-finite vector. It allows us to prove convergence of quantum random walks in the coordinate representation to the evolution of a diffusion process, as well as convergence of quantum random walks in both coordinate and momentum representations to the evolution semigroup of a quantum oscillator in an infinite-dimensional phase space. We find the special essential common domain of generators of semigroups arising in averaging of random shift operators both in position and momentum representations. The invariance of this common domain with respect to both semigroups allows to establish properties of a convex combination of both generators. That convex combination are Hamiltonians of infinite-dimentional quantum oscillators. Thus, we obtain that a Weyl representation of a random walk in an infinite dimensional phase space describes the semigroup of self-adjoint contractions whose generator is the Hamiltonian of an infinite dimensional harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>A note on the emission spectrum and trapping states in the Jaynes-Cummings model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emission of light from an atom represents a fundamental process that provides valuable insights into the atom-light interaction. The Jaynes-Cummings model is one of the simplest fully quantized models to deal with these interactions, allowing for an analytical solution, while exhibiting notable non-trivial effects. We explore new features in the fluorescence emission spectrum for initial "trapping states", which suppress the atomic population inversion. Despite the seemingly dormant activity of the atom, the resulting emission spectra exhibit rich features, and using a dressed-state coordinates formalism, we are able to quantitatively explain the different profiles in the spectrum. We generalize the trapping conditions for non-zero atom-field detuning and also unveil two types of trapping states that lead to spectra with three peaks, in contrast to previously known states: a center peak and one secondary peak on each side. These are a trapping state formed by a Schr\"odinger cat state with Poissonian statistics (Yurke-Stoler state) and also a different type of "perfect trapping state".</description>

Abstract: We present some of the peculiar dynamics of two simple sans-entanglement quantum communication channels in a digestible form. Specifically, we contrast the classical gaussian additive channel to its quantum analogue and find that the quantum version features a capacity with interesting time dependence and counterintuitive effects of quantization.

      <title>Exponentially Enhanced Scheme for the Heralded Qudit GHZ State in Linear Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional multipartite entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum information science. However, existing schemes for generating such entanglement become increasingly complex and costly as the dimension of quantum units increases. In this work, we overcome the limitation by proposing a significantly enhanced linear optical heralded scheme that generates the $d$-level $N$-partite GHZ state with single-photon sources and their linear operations. Our scheme requires $dN$ photons to generate the target state with substantially improved success probability from previous schemes. It employs linear optical logic gates compatible with any qudit encoding system and can generate generalized GHZ states with installments of beamsplitters. With efficient generations of high-dimensional resource states, our work opens avenues for further exploration in high-dimensional quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Acceleration Noise Induced Decoherence in Stern-Gerlach Interferometers for Gravity Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stern-Gerlach interferometer (SGI) is a kind of matter-wave interferometer driven by magnetic field and has been proposed for many gravity experiments. Acceleration noises such as vibration and inertial forces, together with higher-order noises like the fluctuation of the gravity gradient or the magnetic field, can cause decoherence problems of SGI, including dephasing, loss of contrast and position localization decoherence. In this paper, I will theoretically study these mechanisms of decoherence based on the analytical time-evolution operator of an SGI modeled as a harmonic oscillator under acceleration noises described by Gaussian stochastic processes. As will be proved, for a single arm of an SGI, the shape of the Wigner function keeps invariant under an acceleration noise, although the phase and the coordinate in the classical phase space fluctuate as linear responses to the noise, and its density matrix also experiences a position localization decoherence due to the ensemble average. For the witness constructed in the spin space, the degrees of freedom in the classical phase space have to be traced out. Then acceleration noises can lead to dephasing effects on the witness, while the fluctuation on the trajectories in the phase space and position localization decoherence of the two arms will be canceled with each other. On the other hand, higher-order noises can be treated as non-uniform acceleration noises in the leading order, and they will cause decoherence in the spin space due to the contrast loss besides the dephasing. Remarkably, the randomness of the noise is essential for dephasing and position-localization decoherence, and these two mechanisms don't cause purity loss or entropy increase if the noise is monitored as a deterministic process during the experiment.</description>

      <title>Minimal evolution times for fast, pulse-based state preparation in silicon spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standing as one of the most significant barriers to reaching quantum advantage, state-preparation fidelities on noisy intermediate-scale quantum processors suffer from quantum-gate errors, which accumulate over time. A potential remedy is pulse-based state preparation. We numerically investigate the minimal evolution times (METs) attainable by optimizing (microwave and exchange) pulses on silicon hardware. We investigate two state preparation tasks. First, we consider the preparation of molecular ground states and find the METs for H$_2$, HeH$^+$, and LiH to be 2.4 ns, 4.4 ns, and 27.2 ns, respectively. Second, we consider transitions between arbitrary states and find the METs for transitions between arbitrary four-qubit states to be below 50 ns. For comparison, connecting arbitrary two-qubit states via one- and two-qubit gates on the same silicon processor requires approximately 200 ns. This comparison indicates that pulse-based state preparation is likely to utilize the coherence times of silicon hardware more efficiently than gate-based state preparation. Finally, we quantify the effect of silicon device parameters on the MET. We show that increasing the maximal exchange amplitude from 10 MHz to 1 GHz accelerates the METs, e.g., for H$_2$ from 84.3 ns to 2.4 ns. This demonstrates the importance of fast exchange. We also show that increasing the maximal amplitude of the microwave drive from 884 kHz to 56.6 MHz shortens state transitions, e.g., for two-qubit states from 1000 ns to 25 ns. Our results bound both the state-preparation times for general quantum algorithms and the execution times of variational quantum algorithms with silicon spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Ergodic repeated interaction quantum systems: Steady states and reducibility theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the time evolution of an open quantum system subject to a sequence of random quantum channels with a stationary distribution. This incorporates disorder into the repeated interactions (or, quantum collision models) approach to understanding open quantum dynamics. In the literature, various specific models of disorder in repeated interaction models have been considered, including the cases where the sequence of quantum channels form either i.i.d. or Markovian stochastic processes. In the present paper we consider the general structure of such models without any specific assumptions on the probability distribution, aside from stationarity (i.e., time-translation invariance). In particular, arbitrarily strong correlations between time steps are allowed. In 2021, Movassagh and Schenker (MS) introduced a unified framework in which one may study such randomized quantum dynamics, and, under a key strong decoherence assumption proved an ergodic theorem for a large class of physically relevant examples. Here, we recognize the decoherence assumption of MS as a kind of irreducibility and develop a reducibility theory for general stationary random repeated interaction models without this condition. Within this framework, we establish ergodic theorems extending of those obtained by MS to the general stationary setting.</description>

      <title>Expressibility of linear combination of ansatz circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolver is considered promising for medium-scale noisy quantum computers. Expressibility is an important metric for measuring the capability of a variational quantum Ansatz circuit. A commonly used method to increase expressibility is to increase the circuit depth. However, increasing the circuit depth also introduces more noise. We propose to use a linear combination of ansatzes to improve the expressibility of variational circuits, thus avoiding the increase of circuit depth. Concurrently, we introduce a novel measurement strategy that circumvents the necessity for the Hadamard test, thereby significantly diminishing the reliance on two-qubit gates, which are presently the predominant contributors to quantum noise. We also provide a corresponding gradient calculation method, which makes it convenient to update the parameters. Compared with the method of increasing the circuit depth, our method of improving expressibility is more practical. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Quantum coupon collector with mixed-state encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupon collector is a prototypical model for evaluating the number of samples for identifying a set. By superposing all elements in the set as a pure quantum state, a quantum version of the coupon collector aims to learn the state, which is shown to reduce the sample complexity. Here we propose a quantum coupon collector by encoding the set into a mixed state, where the information of missing elements are labelled with Pauli strings. Remarkably, the encoded mixed state has no quantum entangled state and is easy to prepare. With such mixed-state encoding, it can be efficient to learn the set by performing Bell measurements on two copies and then extracting the missing element by solving a series of equations obtained from the measurements. Our protocol further reduces the sample complexity from $O(n)$ in the case of pure-state encoding to $O(\log n)$ when the missing element is one, where $n$ is the number of elements in the set. The mixed-state encoding scheme provides a new avenue for quantum learning and enlarges the realm for exploring quantum advantages.</description>

      <title>Back to Bohr: Quantum Jumps in Schroedinger's Wave Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement problem of quantum mechanics concerns the question under which circumstances coherent wave evolution becomes disrupted to produce eigenstates of observables, instead of evolving superpositions of eigenstates. The problem needs to be addressed already within wave mechanics, before second quantization, because low-energy interactions can be dominated by particle-preserving potential interactions. We discuss a scattering array of harmonic oscillators which can detect particles penetrating the array through interaction with a short-range potential. Evolution of the wave function of scattered particles, combined with Heisenberg's assertion that quantum jumps persist in wave mechanics, indicates that the wave function will collapse around single oscillator sites if the scattering is inelastic, while it will not collapse around single sites for elastic scattering. The Born rule for position observation is then equivalent to the statement that the wave function for inelastic scattering amounts to an epistemic superposition of possible scattering states, in the sense that it describes a sum of probability amplitudes for inelastic scattering off different scattering centers, whereas at most one inelastic scattering event can happen at any moment in time. Within this epistemic interpretation of the wave function, the actual underlying inelastic scattering event corresponds to a quantum jump, whereas the continuously evolving wave function only describes the continuous evolution of probability amplitudes for scattering off different sites. Quantum jumps then yield definite position observations as defined by the spatial resolution of the oscillator array.</description>

      <title>Unclonable Secret Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unclonable cryptography utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to addresses cryptographic tasks that are impossible classically. We introduce a novel unclonable primitive in the context of secret sharing, called unclonable secret sharing (USS). In a USS scheme, there are $n$ shareholders, each holding a share of a classical secret represented as a quantum state. They can recover the secret once all parties (or at least $t$ parties) come together with their shares. Importantly, it should be infeasible to copy their own shares and send the copies to two non-communicating parties, enabling both of them to recover the secret.
  Our work initiates a formal investigation into the realm of unclonable secret sharing, shedding light on its implications, constructions, and inherent limitations. ** Connections: We explore the connections between USS and other quantum cryptographic primitives such as unclonable encryption and position verification, showing the difficulties to achieve USS in different scenarios.
  **Limited Entanglement: In the case where the adversarial shareholders do not share any entanglement or limited entanglement, we demonstrate information-theoretic constructions for USS.
  **Large Entanglement: If we allow the adversarial shareholders to have unbounded entanglement resources (and unbounded computation), we prove that unclonable secret sharing is impossible. On the other hand, in the quantum random oracle model where the adversary can only make a bounded polynomial number of queries, we show a construction secure even with unbounded entanglement.
  Furthermore, even when these adversaries possess only a polynomial amount of entanglement resources, we establish that any unclonable secret sharing scheme with a reconstruction function implementable using Cliffords and logarithmically many T-gates is also unattainable.</description>

Abstract: Composite pulses, which produce ultrabroadband, ultranarrowband and ultrapassband $x$-, $y$-) rotations by $\theta = \pi$ on the Bloch-Poincar\'e sphere, are presented. The first class plays a role for design of achromatic polarisation retarders, when the second class corresponds to chromatic polarisation filters. The third class is an assortment of the above two classes. Besides, composite pulses, which produce ultrabroadband $z$-) rotations by $\zeta = \pi$ on the same sphere, are presented. These phasal pulses coincide with achromatic polarisation $\pi$ rotators. On the quantum-classical analogy, we obtain ultrarobust, ultrasensitive and ultrasquare quantum control of a $X$ gate and ultrarobust quantum control of a $Z$ gate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clarifying the principles leading to complete decoherence is essential for understanding information loss in black hole formation. We employ strictly perturbative quantum master equations to compute the long-term decoherence rate in infrared-divergent qubit dynamics. In moderately sub-Ohmic dissipation, we find that this rate exceeds the Hubble's constant, meaning that infrared particles do not completely destroy quantum information at the universe's current age. Deep sub-Ohmic dissipation leads to infrared-divergent recovery of quantum coherence.</description>

      <title>Universal bound on Ergotropy and No-Go Theorem by the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the maximum extractable work (ergotropy) from a quantum many-body system is constrained by local athermality of an initial state and local entropy decrease brought about by quantum operations. The obtained universal bound on ergotropy implies that the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis prohibits work extraction from energy eigenstates by means of finite-time unitary operations. This no-go property implies that Planck's principle, a form of the second law of thermodynamics, holds even for pure quantum states. Our result bridges two independently studied concepts of quantum thermodynamics, the second law and thermalization, via intrasystem correlations in many-body systems as a resource for work extraction.</description>

      <title>CP conditions for GKSL-like master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complete positivity (CP) of a quantum dynamical map (QDM) is, in general, difficult to show when its master equation (ME) does not conform to the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) form. The GKSL ME describes the Markovian dynamics, comprising a unitary component with time-independent Hermitian operators and a non-unitary component with time-independent Lindblad operators and positive time-independent damping rates. Recently, the non-Markovian dynamics has received growing attention, and the various types of GKSL-like MEs with time-dependent operators are widely discussed; however, rigorous discussions on their CP conditions remain limited. This paper presents conditions for QDMs to be CP, whose MEs take the GKSL-like form with arbitrary time dependence. One case considered is where its ME takes the time-local integro-differential GKSL-like form, which includes CP-divisible cases. Another case considered is where the ME is time-non-local but can be approximated to be time-local in the weak-coupling regime. As a special case of the time-non-local case, the same discussion holds for the time-convoluted GKSL-like form, which should be compared to previous studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) technology, quantum devices present new avenues for addressing complex, real-world challenges including potentially NP-hard optimization problems. This work aims to showcase how the inherent noise in NISQ devices can be leveraged to solve such real-world problems effectively. Utilizing a D-Wave quantum annealer and IonQ's gate-based NISQ computers, we generate and analyze solutions for managing train traffic under stochastic disturbances. Our case study focuses on the Baltimore Light RailLink, which embodies the characteristics of both tramway and railway networks. We explore the feasibility of using NISQ technology to model the stochastic nature of disruptions in these transportation systems. Our research marks the inaugural application of both quantum computing paradigms to tramway and railway rescheduling, highlighting the potential of quantum noise as a beneficial resource in complex optimization scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quantum Property Testing Algorithm for the Concatenation of Two Palindromes Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a quantum property testing algorithm for recognizing a context-free language that is a concatenation of two palindromes $L_{REV}$. The query complexity of our algorithm is $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}n^{1/3}\log n)$, where $n$ is the length of an input. It is better than the classical complexity that is $\Theta^*(\sqrt{n})$.
  At the same time, in the general setting, the picture is different a little. Classical query complexity is $\Theta(n)$, and quantum query complexity is $\Theta^*(\sqrt{n})$. So, we obtain polynomial speed-up for both cases (general and property testing).</description>

      <title>Simulation of chiral motion of excitation within the ground-state manifolds of neutral atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-induced gauge fields in neutral atoms serve as a means of mimicking the effects of a magnetic field, providing researchers with a platform to explore behaviors analogous to those observed in condensed matter systems under real magnetic fields. Here, we propose a method to generate chiral motion in atomic excitations within the neutral atomic ground-state manifolds. This is achieved through the application of polychromatic driving fields coupled to the ground-Rydberg transition, along with unconventional Rydberg pumping. The scheme offers the advantage of arbitrary adjustment of the effective magnetic flux by setting the relative phases between different external laser fields. Additionally, the effective interaction strength between the atomic ground states can be maintained at 10 kHz, surpassing the capabilities of the previous approach utilizing Floquet modulation. Notably, the proposed method can be readily extended to implement a hexagonal neutral atom lattice, serving as the fundamental unit in realizing the Haldane model.</description>

      <title>Mask-coding-assisted continuous-variable quantum direct communication with orbital angular momentum multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) is a approach of communication to transmit secret messages base on quantum mechanics. Different from the quantum key distribution, secret messages can be transmitted directly on quantum channel with QSDC. Higher channel capacity and noise suppression capabilities are key to achieving long-distance quantum communication. Here we report a continuous-variable QSDC scheme based on mask-coding and orbital angular momentum, in which the mask-coding is employed to protect the security of the transmitting messages and to suppression the influence of excess noise. And the combination of orbital angular momentum and the information block transmission can effectively improve the secrecy capacity. In the 800 information blocks * 1310 bits length 10-km experiment, the results show that the statistical average of bit error rate has decreased by 36% and reached 0.38% comparing to existing solutions, and the system excess noise is 0.0184 SNU, and the final secrecy capacity is 6.319 * 106 bps. Therefore, this scheme reduces error bits while increasing secrecy capacity, providing a solution for long-distance large-scale quantum communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers have attracted much attention in recent years. This may be because the development of the actual quantum machine is accelerating. Research on how to use quantum computers is active in the fields such as quantum chemistry and machine learning, where vast amounts of computation are required. However, in weather and climate simulations, less research has been done despite similar computational demands. In this study, a quantum computing algorithm was applied to a problem of the atmospheric science to demonstrate that it can achieve the same simulations as a conventional algorithm designed for the classical computers. More specifically, the stochastic nature of a multi-cloud model was reproduced by utilizing probabilistic outputs of computed quantum states. Our results demonstrate that quantum computers can suitably solve some problems in atmospheric and oceanic phenomena, in which stochasticity is widely inherent.</description>

Abstract: We present a framework for the implementation of quantum finite automata algorithms designed for the language $ MOD_p = \{ a^{i\cdot p } \mid i \geq 0 \}$ on gate-based quantum computers. First, we compile the known theoretical results from the literature to reduce the number of CNOT gates. Second, we demonstrate techniques for modifying the algorithms based on the basis gates of available quantum hardware in order to reduce circuit depth. Lastly, we explore how the number of CNOT gates may be reduced further if the topology of the qubits is known.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the amount of complementarity that a quantum system can exhibit depends on which complementary properties one is considering. Consider a set of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) which corresponds to the spectral decomposition of some maximally complementary properties: The perfect knowledge of one, i.e. the state of the system is one of the basis states, implies that all the others are completely unknown, namely the measurement of another property will find any of its possible outcomes with uniform probability. We show that, depending on which three of the MUBs we choose, a 5-dimensional system can have different degrees of complementarity, measured using the minimum over all the system states of the sum of the entropies and of the variances of the measurement outcomes related to the three chosen observables. This property was first found experimentally, and demonstrates that an experimental discovery can disclose quantum information effects.</description>

      <title>Quantum versus classical quenches and the broadening of wave packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time dependence of one-dimensional quantum mechanical probability densities is presented when the potential in which a particle moves is suddenly changed, called a quench. Quantum quenches are mainly addressed but a comparison with results for the dynamics in the framework of classical statistical mechanics is useful. Analytical results are presented when the initial and final potentials are harmonic oscillators. When the final potential vanishes the problem reduces to the broadening of wave packets. A simple introduction to the concept of the Wigner function is presented which allows a better understanding of the dynamics of general wave packets. It is pointed out how special the broadening of Gaussian wave packets is, the only example usually presented in quantum mechanics textbooks.</description>

      <title>Attention-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Qubit Allocation in Modular Quantum Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular, distributed and multi-core architectures are currently considered a promising approach for scalability of quantum computing systems. The integration of multiple Quantum Processing Units necessitates classical and quantum-coherent communication, introducing challenges related to noise and quantum decoherence in quantum state transfers between cores. Optimizing communication becomes imperative, and the compilation and mapping of quantum circuits onto physical qubits must minimize state transfers while adhering to architectural constraints. The compilation process, inherently an NP-hard problem, demands extensive search times even with a small number of qubits to be solved to optimality. To address this challenge efficiently, we advocate for the utilization of heuristic mappers that can rapidly generate solutions. In this work, we propose a novel approach employing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods to learn these heuristics for a specific multi-core architecture. Our DRL agent incorporates a Transformer encoder and Graph Neural Networks. It encodes quantum circuits using self-attention mechanisms and produce outputs through an attention-based pointer mechanism that directly signifies the probability of matching logical qubits with physical cores. This enables the selection of optimal cores for logical qubits efficiently. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed method can outperform baseline approaches in terms of reducing inter-core communications and minimizing online time-to-solution. This research contributes to the advancement of scalable quantum computing systems by introducing a novel learning-based heuristic approach for efficient quantum circuit compilation and mapping.</description>

      <title>Unbounded sequential multipartite nonlocality via violation of Mermin inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum nonlocality is a significant feature in quantum information theory, prompting recent investigations into the potential reuse of post-measurement states to uncover nonlocality among sequentially measuring observers. While prior studies primarily focused on bipartite or tripartite systems and observers with one chain, such as multiple Bobs with a single Alice or multiple Charlies with a single Alice and Bob, our work extends beyond this framework. We explore sequential nonlocality in systems comprising more parties and observer chains. Our findings reveal that in $n$-partite systems, regardless of whether it is a single-chain or double-chain scenario, there exist unbounded sequential observers capable of detecting nonlocality through violations of the Mermin inequality. In contrast to the conjecture that sequential Bell nonlocality cannot manifest with multiple Alices and Bobs in bipartite systems (i.e., the double-chain setting)[Phys. Rev. A 104, L060201 (2021)], our results suggest that increasing the number of subsystems may enable more observer chains to detect nonlocality alongside single observers. Our study advances research on sequential nonlocality, providing valuable insights into its detection across diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Subspace Expansion Using Classical Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a post-processing technique for classical shadow measurement data that enhances the precision of ground state estimation through high-dimensional subspace expansion; the dimensionality is only limited by the amount of classical post-processing resources rather than by quantum resources. Crucial steps of our approach are the efficient identification of useful observables from shadow data, followed by our regularised subspace expansion that is designed to be numerically stable even when using noisy data. We analytically investigate noise propagation within our method, and upper bound the statistical fluctuations due to the limited number of snapshots in classical shadows. In numerical simulations, our method can achieve a reduction in the energy estimation errors in many cases, sometimes by more than an order of magnitude. We also demonstrate that our performance improvements are robust against both coherent errors (bad initial state) and gate noise in the state-preparation circuits. Furthermore, performance is guaranteed to be at least as good - and in many cases better - than direct energy estimation without using additional quantum resources and the approach is thus a very natural alternative for estimating ground state energies directly from classical shadow data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many quantum algorithms rely on a quality initial state for optimal performance. Preparing an initial state for specific applications can considerably reduce the cost of probabilistic algorithms such as the well studied quantum phase estimation (QPE). Fortunately, in the application space of quantum chemistry, generating approximate wave functions for molecular systems is well studied, and quantum computing algorithms stand to benefit from importing these classical methods directly into a quantum circuit. In this work, we propose a state preparation method based on coupled cluster (CC) theory, which is a pillar of quantum chemistry on classical computers, by incorporating mid-circuit measurements into the circuit construction. Currently, the most well studied state preparation method for quantum chemistry on quantum computers is the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) with a unitary-CC with single- and double-electron excitation terms (UCCSD) ansatz whose operations are limited to unitary gates. We verify the accuracy of our state preparation protocol using mid-circuit measurements by performing energy evaluation and state overlap computation for a set of small chemical systems. We further demonstrate that our approach leads to a reduction of the classical computation overhead, and the number of CNOT and T gates by 28% and 57% on average when compared against the standard VQE-UCCSD protocol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for the analysis of amplitude transfer in Quantum Variational Algorithms (QVAs) for combinatorial optimisation with mixing unitaries defined by vertex-transitive graphs, based on their continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW) representation and the theory of graph automorphism groups. This framework leads to a heuristic for designing efficient problem-specific QVAs. Using this heuristic, we develop novel algorithms for unconstrained and constrained optimisation. We outline their implementation with polynomial gate complexity and simulate their application to the parallel machine scheduling and portfolio rebalancing combinatorial optimisation problems, showing significantly improved convergence over preexisting QVAs. Based on our analysis, we derive metrics for evaluating the suitability of graph structures for specific problem instances, and for establishing bounds on the convergence supported by different graph structures. For mixing unitaries characterised by a CTQW over a Hamming graph on $m$-tuples of length $n$, our results indicate that the amplification upper bound increases with problem size like $\mathcal{O}(e^{n \log m})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of correlated states and measurements promises improvements in the accuracy of frequency metrology and the stability of atomic clocks. However, developing strategies robust against dominant noise processes remains challenging. We address the issue of decoherence due to spontaneous decay and show that Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, in conjunction with a correlated measurement and nonlinear estimation strategy, achieve gains comparable to fundamental bounds for ensembles of up to 40 atoms. This result is surprising since GHZ states do not provide any enhancement under dephasing noise compared to the standard quantum limit of uncorrelated states. The gain arises from a veto signal, which allows for the detection and mitigation of errors caused by spontaneous emission events. Through comprehensive Monte-Carlo simulations of atomic clocks, we demonstrate the robustness of the GHZ protocol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two methods for quantum process and detector tomography. In the quantum process tomography method, we develop an analytical procedure for projecting the linear inversion estimation of a quantum channel onto the set of completely positive trace-preserving matrices. By integrating this method with alternate projection techniques, we achieve a three-order-of-magnitude improvement in approximating the closest quantum channel to an arbitrary Hermitian matrix compared to existing methods without compromising computational efficiency. Our second method extends this approach to quantum detector tomography, demonstrating superior efficiency compared to current techniques. Through numerical simulations, we evaluate our protocols across channels of up to four qubits in quantum process tomography and systems of up to six qubits in quantum detector tomography, showcasing superior precision and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Neural Quantum State Study of Fracton Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fracton models host unconventional topological orders in three and higher dimensions and provide promising candidates for quantum memory platforms. Understanding their robustness against quantum fluctuations is an important task but also poses great challenges due to the lack of efficient numerical tools. In this work, we establish neural quantum states (NQS) as new tools to study phase transitions in these models. Exact and efficient parametrizations are derived for three prototypical fracton codes - the checkerboard and X-cube model, as well as Haah's code - both in terms of a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and a correlation-enhanced RBM. We then adapt the correlation-enhanced RBM architecture to a perturbed checkerboard model and reveal its strong first-order phase transition between the fracton phase and a trivial field-polarizing phase. To this end, we simulate this highly entangled system on lattices of up to 512 qubits with high accuracy, representing a cutting-edge application of variational neural-network methods. Our work demonstrates the remarkable potential of NQS in studying complicated three-dimensional problems and highlights physics-oriented constructions of NQS architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wave function Ansatze are crucial in the context of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). In the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era, the design of low-depth wave function Ansatze is of great importance for executing quantum simulations of electronic structure on noisy quantum devices. In this work, we present a circuit-efficient implementation of two-body Qubit-Excitation-Based (QEB) operator for building shallow-circuit wave function Ansatze within the framework of Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Pseudo-Trotter (ADAPT) VQE. This new algorithm is applied to study ground- and excited-sate problems for small molecules, demonstrating significant reduction of circuit depths compared to fermionic excitation-based and QEB ADAPT-VQE algorithms. This circuit-efficient algorithm shows great promise for quantum simulations of electronic structures, leading to improved performance on current quantum hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate a method to directly measure the phase of biphoton states using an entangled mode as a collinear reference. The technique is demonstrated with entangled photonic spatial modes in the Laguerre-Gaussian basis, and it is applicable to any pure quantum system containing an exploitable reference state in its entanglement spectrum. As one particularly useful application, we use the new methodology to directly measure the geometric phase accumulation of entangled photons.</description>

      <title>Critical Fermions are Universal Embezzlers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal embezzlers are bipartite quantum systems from which any entangled state may be extracted to arbitrary precision using local operations while perturbing the state of the system arbitrarily little. Here, we show that universal embezzlers are ubiquitous in many-body physics: The ground state sector of every local, translation-invariant, and critical free-fermionic many-body system on a one-dimensional lattice is a universal embezzler if bi-partitioned into two half-chains. The same property holds in locally-interacting, dual spin chains via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. Universal embezzlement manifests already for finite system sizes, not only in the thermodynamic limit: For any finite error and any targeted entangled state, a finite length of the chain is sufficient to embezzle said state within the given error. On a technical level, our main result establishes that the half-chain observable algebras associated with ground state sectors of the given models are type III$_1$ factors.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of RIP gates in a quantum processor with negligible transverse coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we report the experimental demonstration of a novel multi-mode linear bus interferometer (LBI) coupler in a six qubit superconducting quantum processor. A key feature of this coupler is an engineered multi-path interference which eliminates transverse coupling between qubits over a wide frequency range. This negligible static coupling is achieved without any flux bias tuning, and greatly reduces the impact of qubit frequency collisions. We achieve good simultaneous single qubit gate operation and low ZZ rates (below 600 Hz) across the device without staggering qubit frequencies, even in cases where qubits are as close as 10 MHz. Multi-qubit interactions are still possible through the coupler using microwave-driven resonator induced phase gates, which we utilize to demonstrate simultaneous two qubit gates with fidelities as high as 99.4%</description>

Abstract: Simon's algorithm was one of the first problems to demonstrate a genuine quantum advantage. The algorithm, however, assumes access to noise-free qubits. In our work we use Simon's algorithm to benchmark the error rates of devices currently available in the "quantum cloud." As a main result we obtain an objective comparison between the different physical platforms made available by IBM and IonQ. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the device architectures and chip topologies when transpiling quantum algorithms onto hardware. For instance, we demonstrate that two-qubit operations on spatially separated qubits on superconducting chips should be avoided.</description>

      <title>Holographic Classical Shadow Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce "holographic shadows", a new class of randomized measurement schemes for classical shadow tomography that achieves the optimal scaling of sample complexity for learning geometrically local Pauli operators at any length scale, without the need for fine-tuning protocol parameters such as circuit depth or measurement rate. Our approach utilizes hierarchical quantum circuits, such as tree quantum circuits or holographic random tensor networks. Measurements within the holographic bulk correspond to measurements at different scales on the boundary (i.e. the physical system of interests), facilitating efficient quantum state estimation across observable at all scales. Considering the task of estimating string-like Pauli observables supported on contiguous intervals of $k$ sites in a 1D system, our method achieves an optimal sample complexity scaling of $\sim d^k\mathrm{poly}(k)$, with $d$ the local Hilbert space dimension. We present a holographic minimal cut framework to demonstrate the universality of this sample complexity scaling and validate it with numerical simulations, illustrating the efficacy of holographic shadows in enhancing quantum state learning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Quantum metrology with a squeezed Kerr oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the squeezing dynamics in a Kerr-nonlinear oscillator, and quantify the metrological usefulness of the resulting states. Even if the nonlinearity limits the attainable squeezing by making the evolution non-Gaussian, the states obtained still have a high quantum Fisher information for sensing displacements. However, contrary to the Gaussian case, the amplitude of the displacement cannot be estimated by simple quadrature measurements. Therefore, we propose the use of a measurement-after-interaction protocol where a linear quadrature measurement is preceded by an additional nonlinear evolution, and show the significant sensitivity enhancement that can be obtained. Our results are robust when considering realistic imperfections such as energy relaxation, and can be implemented in state-of-the-art experimental setups.</description>

      <title>Effective Faraday interaction between light and nuclear spins of Helium-3 in its ground state: a semiclassical study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the semiclassical evolution equations for a system consisting of helium-3 atoms in the $2^3S$ metastable state interacting with a light field far-detuned from the $2^3S-2^3P$ transition, in the presence of metastability exchange collisions with ground state helium atoms and a static magnetic field. For two configurations, each corresponding to a particular choice of atom-light detuning in which the contribution of either the metastable level $F=1/2$ or $F=3/2$ is dominant, we derive a simple model of three coupled collective spins from which we can analytically extract an effective coupling constant between the collective nuclear spin and light. In these two configurations, we compare the predictions of our simplified model with the full model.</description>

      <title>Bell inequalities as a tool to probe quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a permutationally invariant multipartite Bell inequality for many-body three-level systems and use it to explore a possible connection between the presence of nonlocality and quantum chaos. For this, we interpret the Bell operator resulting from fixing the measurement settings as a system Hamiltonian and explore the energy level spacing distribution for different measurement choices and SU(3) irreducible representations. Interestingly, we find that in every irreducible representation displaying nonlocality, the measurement settings yielding maximal violation result in a Bell operator whose energy level spacing distribution signals the absence of quantum chaos. This situation changes when the measurement settings slightly depart from the optimal ones, as we generally observe a level spacing distribution characteristic of chaotic systems. Our work suggests an intriguing connection between Bell nonlocality, quantum chaos and random matrix theory. These subjects belonged to the beloved areas of the late Fritz Haake, and we dedicate this paper to his memory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present strategies to derive Bell inequalities valid for systems composed of many three-level parties. This scenario is formalized by a Bell experiment with $N$ observers, each of which performs one out of two possible three-outcome measurements on their share of the system. As the complexity of the set of classical correlations prohibits its full characterization in this multipartite scenario, we consider its projection to a lower dimensional subspace spanned by permutationally invariant one- and two-body observables. This simplification allows us to formulate two complementary methods for detecting nonlocality in multipartite three-level systems, both having a complexity independent of $N$. Our work can have interesting applications in the detection of Bell correlations in paradigmatic spin-1 models, as well as in experiments with solid-state systems or atomic ensembles.</description>

      <title>Predicting quantum learnability from landscape fluctuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tradeoff between trainability and expressibility is a central challenge faced by today's variational quantum computing. Recent studies indicate that resolving this dilemma necessitates designing specific parametrized quantum circuits (PQC) tailored for specific problems, which urgently needs a general and efficient method to assess the learnability of PQCs regarding a given target. In this Letter, we demonstrate a simple and efficient metric for learnability by comparing the fluctuations of the given training landscape with standard learnable landscapes. This metric shows surprising effectiveness in predicting learnability as it unifies the effects of insufficient expressibility, barren plateaus, bad local minima, and overparametrization. Importantly, it does not require actual training and can be estimated efficiently on classical computers via Clifford sampling. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to validate its effectiveness regarding both physical and random Hamiltonians. We also prove a compact lower bound for the metric in locally scrambled circuits as analytical guidance. Our findings enable efficient predictions of learnability, allowing fast selection of suitable PQCs for a given problem without training, which can improve the efficiency of variational quantum computing especially when access to quantum devices is limited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Routing classical and quantum information is a fundamental task for most quantum information technologies and processes. Here, we consider information encoded in the position of a quantum walker on a graph, and design an optimal structure to achieve perfect quantum routing exploiting chirality and weighting of the edges. The topology, termed the {\em Lily Graph}, enables perfect (i.e., with fidelity one) and robust routing of classical (localized) or quantum (superposition) states of the walker to $n$ different, orthogonal, spatial regions of the graph, corresponding to the $n$ possible outputs of the device. The routing time is independent of the input signal and the number of outputs, making our scheme a robust and scalable solution for quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlation plenoptic imaging is a procedure to perform light-field imaging without spatial resolution loss, by measuring second-order spatio-temporal correlations of light. We investigate the possibility to use correlation plenoptic imaging to mitigate the effect of a phase disturbance in the propagation from the object to the main lens. We assume that this detrimental effect, that can be due to a turbulent medium, is localized at a specific distance from the lens, and is slowly varying in time. The mitigation of turbulence effects has already fostered the development of both light-field imaging and correlation imaging procedures. Here, we aim at merging these aspects, proposing a correlation light-field imaging method to overcome the effects of slowly varying turbulence, without the loss of lateral resolution, typical of traditional plenoptic imaging devices.</description>

      <title>Green's function approach to interacting lattice polaritons and optical nonlinearities in subwavelength arrays of quantum emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-wavelength arrays of quantum emitters offer an efficient free-space approach to coherent light-matter interfacing, using ultracold atoms or two-dimensional solid-state quantum materials. The combination of collectively suppressed photon-losses and emerging optical nonlinearities due to strong photon-coupling to mesoscopic numbers of emitters holds promise for generating nonclassical light and engineering effective interactions between freely propagating photons. While most studies have thus far relied on numerical simulations, we describe here a diagrammatic Green's function approach that permits analytical investigations of nonlinear processes. We illustrate the method by deriving a simple expression for the scattering matrix that describes photon-photon interactions in an extended two-dimensional array of quantum emitters, and reproduces the results of numerical simulations of coherently driven arrays. The approach yields intuitive insights into the nonlinear response of the system and offers a promising framework for a systematic development of a theory for interacting photons and many-body effects on collective radiance in two-dimensional arrays of quantum emitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the photonic spin Hall effect (SHE), also known as transverse shift, incident light photons with opposite spins are spatially separated in the transverse direction due to the spin-orbit interaction of light. Here, we propose a gain-assisted model to control the SHE in the reflected probe light. In this model, a probe light is incident on a cavity containing a three-level dilute gaseous atomic medium, where the interaction between the atom and the control field follows two-photon Raman transitions. We show that the direction of photonic spin accumulations can be switched between positive and negative values across the Brewster angle in both the anomalous and normal dispersion regimes. For the same magnitude of control fields, the peak value of the photonic SHE is higher in the anomalous dispersion region compared to the normal dispersion regime. Additionally, the angular range around the Brewster angle is wider in the normal dispersion regime than in the anomalous dispersion region. Furthermore, the peak value of the photonic SHE and the angular range is controllable by changing the Rabi frequencies of the control fields and the probe field detuning. The measurement of photonic SHE based on gain assistance may enable spin-related applications such as optical sensing.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As of now, the phenomenological classical Landau-Lifshitz (LL) damping of magnetic order is not linked to the established quantum theory of dissipation based on the Lindbladian master equation. This is an unsatisfactory conceptual caveat for the booming research on magnetic dynamics. Here, it is shown that LL dynamics can be systematically derived from Lindbladian dynamics. Thereby, the successful LL approach is set generally on a firm quantum basis. The key aspect is that the Lindbladian relaxation must be adapted to the Hamiltonian $H(t)$ at each instant of time in time-dependent non-equilibrium systems. It is conjectured that this idea holds true well beyond the damping of magnetic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Chip-scale generation of 60-mode continuous-variable cluster states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasing the number of entangled entities is crucial for achieving exponential computational speedups and secure quantum networks. Despite recent progress in generating large-scale entanglement through continuous-variable (CV) cluster states, translating these technologies to photonic chips has been hindered by decoherence, limiting the number of entangled entities to 8. Here, we demonstrate 60-mode CVcluster states in a chip-based optical microresonator pumped by chromatic lasers. Resonantly-enhanced four-wave mixing processes establish entanglement between equidistant spectral quantum modes (qumodes), forming a quantum analogue of optical frequency combs. Decoherence is minimized to achieve unprecedented two-mode raw squeezing (&gt;3 dB) from a chip. Using bichromatic and trichromatic pump lasers, we realize one- and two-dimensional cluster states with up to 60 qumodes. Our work provides a compact and scalable platform for constructing large-scale entangled quantum resources, which are appealing for performing computational and communicational tasks with quantum advantages.</description>

      <title>Majorana qubit readout by a point-contact detector under finite bias voltages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we revisit the problem of four Majorana-zero-modes (4-MZMs) qubit readout by a point-contact (PC) detector. The logic states of the 4-MZMs qubit are converted to different charge occupations of a tunnel-coupled quantum dot (QD), which is further measured by a nearby PC detector. This type of measurement in principle requires that the PC detector is to be biased at small voltages, which should be comparable to the energy scales of the QD level and its coupling to the qubit. Going beyond existing studies on this problem, we present a unified treatment for both the steady-state current and the current power spectrum, which allow us to infer the qubit state information from either the QD occupation or the characteristic peak at the oscillation frequency. Moreover, we carry out the peak-to-pedestal ratio of each single characteristic peak (associated with each logic state of the qubit) and the signal-to-noise ratio of the two peaks. From these two figures of merit, we reveal the optimal bias voltage window for the PC detector at low temperature limit.</description>

      <title>Selection rules of linear and nonlinear polarization-selective absorption in optically dressed matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical symmetries of laser-dressed matter determine selection rules that determine its absorption spectrum. We explore selection rules for polarization-sensitive absorption in Floquet matter, using Floquet group theory in synthetic dimensions. We present comprehensive tables of selection rules that polarization-structured light impose on Floquet dark states and Floquet dark bands. Notably, our tables encompass nonlinear absorption, to all nonlinear orders, revealing that different nonlinear orders follow distinct polarization selection rules, potentially leading to polarization-tunable optical filters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review some classic works on ground state entanglement entropy in $(1+1)$-dimensional free scalar field theory. We point out identifications between the methods for the calculation of entanglement entropy and we show how the formalism developed for the discretized theory can be utilized in order to obtain results in the continuous theory. We specify the entanglement spectrum and we calculate the entanglement entropy for the theory defined on an interval of finite length $L$. Finally, we derive the modular Hamiltonian directly, without using the modular flow, via the continuous limit of the expressions obtained in the discretized theory. In a specific coordinate system, the modular Hamiltonian assumes the form of a free field Hamiltonian on the Rindler wedge.</description>

      <title>Precision measurement for open systems by non-hermitian linear response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lower bound of estimated accuracy for a parameter unitarily encoded in closed systems has been obtained, and both optimal initial states and detection operators can be designed guided by the lower bound. In this letter, we demonstrate that the lower bound of estimated accuracy for a dissipative parameter non-unitarily encoded in open systems based on the non-hermitian linear response theory. This lower bound is related to the correlation of the encoding dissipative operator for open systems in contrast to the fluctuation of the encoding operator for closed systems. We also explicitly calculate the estimated accuracy for dissipative parameters corresponding to three different kinds of non-unitarily encoding processes, including particle loss, relaxation, and dephasing, which further confirm this lower bound. We finally compare the lower bound with the quantum Fisher information obtained by tomography, and we find they are consistent under suitable initial states and detection operators. This lower bound can guide us to find the optimal initial states and detection operators to significantly simplify the measurement process.</description>

      <title>Brownian Gaussian Unitary Ensemble: non-equilibrium dynamics, efficient $k$-design and application in classical shadow tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct and extensively study a Brownian generalization of the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (BGUE). Our analysis begins with the non-equilibrium dynamics of BGUE, where we derive explicit analytical expressions for various one-replica and two-replica variables at finite $N$ and $t$. These variables include the spectral form factor and its fluctuation, the two-point function and its fluctuation, out-of-time-order correlators (OTOC), the second R\'enyi entropy, and the frame potential for unitary 2-designs. We discuss the implications of these results for hyperfast scrambling, emergence of tomperature, and replica-wormhole-like contributions in BGUE. Next, we investigate the low-energy physics of the effective Hamiltonian for an arbitrarily number of replicas, deriving long-time results for the frame potential. We conclude that the time required for the BGUE ensemble to reach $k$-design is linear in $k$, consistent with previous findings in Brownian SYK models. Finally, we apply the BGUE model to the task of classical shadow tomography, deriving analytical results for the shadow norm and identifying an optimal time that minimizes the shadow norm, analogous to the optimal circuit depth in shallow-circuit shadow tomography.</description>

      <title>Coherence of an Electronic Two-Level System under Continuous Charge Sensing by a Quantum Dot Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate experimentally the quantum coherence of an electronic two-level system in a double quantum dot under continuous charge detection. The charge-state of the two-level system is monitored by a capacitively coupled single quantum dot detector that imposes a back-action effect to the system. The measured back-action is well described by an additional decoherence rate, approximately linearly proportional to the detector electron tunneling rate. We provide a model for the decoherence rate arising due to level detuning fluctuations induced by detector charge fluctuations. The theory predicts a factor of two lower decoherence rate than observed in the experiment, suggesting the need for a more elaborate theory accounting for additional sources of decoherence.</description>

      <title>Bloch sphere representation for Rabi oscillation driven by Rashba field in the two-dimensional harmonic confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the dynamical properties of Rabi oscillations driven by an alternating Rashba field applied to a two-dimensional (2D) harmonic confinement system. We solve the time-dependent (TD) Schr\"{o}dinger equation numerically and rewrite the resulting TD wavefunction onto the Bloch sphere (BS) using two BS parameters of the zenith ($\theta_B$) and azimuthal ($\phi_B$) angles, extracting the phase information $\phi_B$ as well as the mixing ratio $\theta_B$ between the two BS-pole states.
  We employed a two-state rotating wave (TSRW) approach and studied the fundamental features of $\theta_B$ and $\phi_B$ over time. The TSRW approach reveals a triangular wave formation in $\theta_B$. Moreover, at each apex of the triangular wave, the TD wavefunction passes through the BS pole, and the state is completely replaced by the opposite spin state. The TSRW approach also elucidates a linear change in $\phi_B$. The slope of $\phi_B$ vs. time is equal to the difference between the dynamical terms, leading to a confinement potential in the harmonic system. The TSRW approach further demonstrates a jump in the phase difference by $\pi$ when the wavefunction passes through the BS pole.
  The alternating Rashba field causes multiple successive Rabi transitions in the 2D harmonic system. We then introduce the effective BS (EBS) and transform these complicated transitions into an equivalent "single" Rabi one. Consequently, the EBS parameters $\theta_B^{\mathrm{eff}}$ and $\phi_B^{\mathrm{eff}}$ exhibit mixing and phase difference between two spin states $\alpha$ and $\beta$, leading to a deep understanding of the TD features of multi-Rabi oscillations. Furthermore, the combination of the BS representation with the TSRW approach successfully reveals the dynamical properties of the Rabi oscillation, even beyond the TSRW approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the 1980s, Viennot developed a combinatorial approach to studying mixed moments of orthogonal polynomials using Motzkin paths. Recently, an alternative combinatorial model for these mixed moments based on lecture hall paths was introduced in arXiv:2311.12761. For sequences of orthogonal polynomials, we establish here a bijection between the Motzin paths and the lecture hall paths via a novel symmetric lecture hall graph. We use this connection to calculate the moments of the position operator in various separable quantum systems, such as the quantum harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom, showing that they may be expressed as generating functions of Motzkin paths and symmetric lecture hall paths, thereby providing a quantum interpretation for these paths. Our approach can be extended to other quantum systems where the wavefunctions are expressed in terms of orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>Dissecting van der Waals interactions with Density Functional Theory -- Wannier-basis approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new scheme for the computation of dispersive interactions from first principles is presented. This cost-effective approach relies on a Wannier function representation compatible with density function theory descriptions. This is an electronic-based many-body method that captures the full electronic and optical response properties of the materials. It provides the foundation to discern van der Waals and induction energies as well as the role of anisotropy and different stacking patterns when computing dispersive interactions in systems. Calculated results for binding energies in layered materials, such as graphite, hBN, and MoS$_2$ give encouraging comparisons with available experimental data. Strategies for broadened computational descriptions of dispersive interactions are also discussed. Our investigation aims at stimulating new experimental studies to measure van der Waals energies in a wider range of materials, especially in layered systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.09888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dyson series is an infinite sum of multi-dimensional time-ordered integrals, which serves as a formal representation of the quantum time-evolution operator in the interaction-picture. Using the mathematical tool of divided differences, we introduce an alternative representation for the series that is entirely free from both time ordering and integrals. In this new formalism, the Dyson expansion is given as a sum of efficiently-computable divided differences of the exponential function, considerably simplifying the calculation of the Dyson expansion terms, while also allowing for time-dependent perturbation calculations to be performed directly in the Schr{\"o}dinger-picture. We showcase the utility of this novel representation by studying a number of use cases. We also discuss several immediate applications.</description>

Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of antilinear superoperators and their applications in studying open quantum systems, particularly focusing on quantum geometric invariance, entanglement distribution, and symmetry. We study several crucial classes of antilinear superoperators, including antilinear quantum channels, antilinearly unital superoperators, antiunitary superoperators, and generalized $\Theta$-conjugation. Using the Bloch representation, we present a systematic investigation of quantum geometric transformations in higher-dimensional quantum systems. By choosing different generalized $\Theta$-conjugations, we obtain various metrics for the space of Bloch space-time vectors, including the Euclidean and Minkowskian metrics. Utilizing these geometric structures, we then investigate the entanglement distribution over a multipartite system constrained by quantum geometric invariance. The strong and weak antilinear superoperator symmetries of the open quantum system are also discussed. Additionally, Kramers' degeneracy and conserved quantities are examined in detail.</description>

      <title>Generation of Maximally Entangled States by Lyapunov Control Based on Entanglement Measure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.00182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maximally entangled states (MES) are highly valued in quantum information processing. In quantum control, the creation of MES is typically treated as a state transfer problem with a predefined MES as the target. However, this approach is limited by the requirement to predetermine the MES structure. This paper introduces an improved quantum Lyapunov control approach that relies on the quantum entanglement measure to construct the Lyapunov function, instead of using the distance between quantum states. This strategy enables the preparation of any MES, regardless of whether its structure is known beforehand, using a single control scheme. The proposed entanglement control technique is unaffected by the number of entangled subsystems since it targets the entanglement measure as a scalar. Initially applied to bipartite pure states, this method demonstrates its capability to generate Bell states and their equivalents. Subsequent applications to bipartite mixed states and multipartite systems illustrate that the technique can produce MES with unspecified structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.08080v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important step towards a comprehensive understanding of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems is the identification of unifying features that are independent of microscopic details of the system. We experimentally observe such robust features in the magnetization relaxation dynamics of disordered Heisenberg XX-, XXZ- and Ising Hamiltonians. We realize these Heisenberg spin models with tunable anisotropy parameter and power-law interactions in an ensemble of Rydberg atoms by encoding the spin in suitable Rydberg state combinations. We consistently observe stretched-exponential relaxation of magnetization for all considered spin models, collapsing onto a single curve after appropriate rescaling of time. This robust short-time relaxation behavior is explained by a perturbative treatment that exploits the strong disorder in pairwise couplings, which leads to a description in terms of approximately independent pairs of spins. In numerical simulations of small systems, we show that these pairs of spins constitute approximate local integrals of motion, which remain at least partially conserved on a timescale exceeding the duration of the relaxation dynamics of the magnetization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the notion of quantum state designs to infinite-dimensional spaces. We first prove that, under the definition of continuous-variable (CV) state $t$-designs from Comm. Math. Phys. 326, 755 (2014), no state designs exist for $t\geq2$. Similarly, we prove that no CV unitary $t$-designs exist for $t\geq 2$. We propose an alternative definition for CV state designs, which we call rigged $t$-designs, and provide explicit constructions for $t=2$. As an application of rigged designs, we develop a design-based shadow-tomography protocol for CV states. Using energy-constrained versions of rigged designs, we define an average fidelity for CV quantum channels and relate this fidelity to the CV entanglement fidelity. As an additional result of independent interest, we establish a connection between torus $2$-designs and complete sets of mutually unbiased bases.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computational chemistry has emerged as an important application of quantum computing. Hybrid quantum-classical computing methods, such as variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE), have been designed as promising solutions to quantum chemistry problems, yet challenges due to theoretical complexity and experimental imperfections hinder progress in achieving reliable and accurate results. Experimental works for solving electronic structures are consequently still restricted to nonscalable (hardware efficient) or classically simulable (Hartree-Fock) ansatz, or limited to a few qubits with large errors. The experimental realisation of scalable and high-precision quantum chemistry simulation remains elusive. Here, we address the critical challenges {associated with} solving molecular electronic structures using noisy quantum processors. Our protocol presents significant improvements in the circuit depth and running time, key metrics for chemistry simulation. Through systematic hardware enhancements and the integration of error mitigation techniques, we push forward the limit of experimental quantum computational chemistry and successfully scale up the implementation of VQE with an optimised unitary coupled-cluster ansatz to 12 qubits. We produce high-precision results of the ground-state energy for molecules with error suppression by around two orders of magnitude. We achieve chemical accuracy for H$_2$ at all bond distances and LiH at small bond distances in the experiment, even beyond the two recent concurrent works. Our work demonstrates a feasible path towards a scalable solution to electronic structure calculation, validating the key technological features and identifying future challenges for this goal.</description>

Abstract: Matchgates are a family of parity-preserving two-qubit gates, nearest-neighbour circuits of which are known to be classically simulable in polynomial time. In this work, we present a simulation method to classically simulate an $\boldsymbol{n}$-qubit circuit containing $\boldsymbol{N}$ gates, $\boldsymbol{m}$ of which are universality-enabling gates and $\boldsymbol{N-m}$ of which are matchgates, in the setting of single-qubit Pauli measurements and product state inputs. The universality-enabling gates we consider include the SWAP, CZ, and CPhase gates. For fixed $\boldsymbol{m}$ as $\boldsymbol{n} \rightarrow \boldsymbol{\infty}$, the resource cost, $\boldsymbol{T}$, scales as $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{O}\left(\left(\frac{en}{m+1}\right)^{2m+2}\right)}$. For $\boldsymbol{m}$ scaling as a linear function of $\boldsymbol{n}$, however, $\boldsymbol{T}$ scale as $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{O}\left(2^{2nH\left(\frac{m+1}{n}\right)}\right)}$, where $\boldsymbol{H}(\lambda)$ is the binary entropy function.</description>

      <title>Topological Quantum Teleportation and Superdense Coding -- Without Braiding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the teleportation and superdense coding protocols for a family of anyon theories coming from Tambara-Yamagami categories, of which the lowest rank theories describe Ising anyons. In contrast to the usual approach to anyonic computation, we relax the requirement that we should be able to braid anyons. This is motivated by the goal of designing basic protocols that require less control over quasiparticles, and which may therefore be amenable to realisation in near-term systems. Since these implementations are braid-free, they are also compatible with Majorana modes on a 1d quantum wire.</description>

      <title>Neural-Shadow Quantum State Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is the art of reconstructing an unknown quantum state through measurements. It is a key primitive for developing quantum technologies. Neural network quantum state tomography (NNQST), which aims to reconstruct the quantum state via a neural network ansatz, is often implemented via a basis-dependent cross-entropy loss function. State-of-the-art implementations of NNQST are often restricted to characterizing a particular subclass of states, to avoid an exponential growth in the number of required measurement settings. To provide a more broadly applicable method for efficient state reconstruction, we present "neural-shadow quantum state tomography" (NSQST)-an alternative neural network-based QST protocol that uses infidelity as the loss function. The infidelity is estimated using the classical shadows of the target state. Infidelity is a natural choice for training loss, benefiting from the proven measurement sample efficiency of the classical shadow formalism. Furthermore, NSQST is robust against various types of noise without any error mitigation. We numerically demonstrate the advantage of NSQST over NNQST at learning the relative phases of three target quantum states of practical interest, as well as the advantage over direct shadow estimation. NSQST greatly extends the practical reach of NNQST and provides a novel route to effective quantum state tomography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the set of real and complex Hadamard matrices with additional symmetry constrains. In particular, we link the problem of existence of maximally entangled multipartite states of $2k$ subsystems with $d$ levels each to the set of complex Hadamard matrices of order $N=d^k$. To this end, we investigate possible subsets of such matrices which are, dual, strongly dual ($H=H^{\rm R}$ or $H=H^{\rm\Gamma}$), two-unitary ($H^R$ and $H^{\Gamma}$ are unitary), or $k$-unitary. Here $X^{\rm R}$ denotes reshuffling of a matrix $X$ describing a bipartite system, and $X^{\rm \Gamma}$ its partial transpose. Such matrices find several applications in quantum many-body theory, tensor networks and classification of multipartite quantum entanglement and imply a broad class of analytically solvable quantum models in $1+1$ dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Current quantum technologies are at the cusp of becoming useful, but still face formidable obstacles such as noise. Noise severely limits the ability to scale quantum devices to the point that they would offer an advantage over classical devices. To understand the sources of noise it is necessary to fully characterise the quantum processes occurring across many time steps; only this would reveal any time-correlated noise called non-Markovian. Previous efforts have attempted such a characterisation but obtained only a limited reconstruction of such multi-time processes. In this work, we fully characterise a multi-time quantum process on superconducting hardware using in-house and cloud-based quantum processors. We achieve this by employing sequential measure-and-prepare operations combined with post-processing. Employing a recently developed formalism for multi-time processes, we detect general multi-time correlated noise. We also detect quantum correlated noise which demonstrates that part of the noise originates from quantum sources, such as physically nearby qubits on the chip. Our findings and techniques are expected to advance error-mitigation techniques in current quantum hardware, a necessary component to scale up the technology and achieve its true potential.</description>

Abstract: The electron bubble in superfluid helium has two degrees of freedom that may offer exceptionally low dissipation: the electron's spin and the bubble's motion. If these degrees of freedom can be read out and controlled with sufficient sensitivity, they would provide a novel platform for realizing a range of quantum technologies and for exploring open questions in the physics of superfluid helium. Here we propose a practical scheme for accomplishing this by trapping an electron bubble inside a superfluid-filled opto-acoustic cavity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating expectation values is a key subroutine in quantum algorithms. Near-term implementations face two major challenges: a limited number of samples required to learn a large collection of observables, and the accumulation of errors in devices without quantum error correction. To address these challenges simultaneously, we develop a quantum error-mitigation strategy called ``symmetry-adjusted classical shadows,'' by adjusting classical-shadow tomography according to how symmetries are corrupted by device errors. As a concrete example, we highlight global $\mathrm{U(1)}$ symmetry, which manifests in fermions as particle number and in spins as total magnetization, and illustrate their group-theoretic unification with respective classical-shadow protocols. We establish rigorous sampling bounds under readout errors obeying minimal assumptions, and perform numerical experiments with a more comprehensive model of gate-level errors derived from existing quantum processors. Our results reveal symmetry-adjusted classical shadows as a low-cost strategy to mitigate errors from noisy quantum experiments in the ubiquitous presence of symmetry.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement and interference are both hallmark effects of quantum physics. Particularly rich dynamics arise when multiple (at least partially) indistinguishable particles are subjected to either of these phenomena. By combining both entanglement and many-particle interference, we propose an interferometric setting through which N-particle interference can be observed, while any interference of lower orders is strictly suppressed. We experimentally demonstrate this effect in a four-photon interferometer, where the interference is nonlocal, in principle, as only pairs of photons interfere at two separate and independent beam splitters. A joint detection of all four photons identifies a high-visibility interference pattern varying as a function of their collective four-particle phase, a genuine four-body property.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for the Pathwise Lasso</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel quantum high-dimensional linear regression algorithm with an $\ell_1$-penalty based on the classical LARS (Least Angle Regression) pathwise algorithm. Similarly to available classical algorithms for Lasso, our quantum algorithm provides the full regularisation path as the penalty term varies, but quadratically faster per iteration under specific conditions. A quadratic speedup on the number of features $d$ is possible by using the quantum minimum-finding routine from D\"urr and Hoyer (arXiv'96) in order to obtain the joining time at each iteration. We then improve upon this simple quantum algorithm and obtain a quadratic speedup both in the number of features $d$ and the number of observations $n$ by using the approximate quantum minimum-finding routine from Chen and de Wolf (ICALP'23). As one of our main contributions, we construct a quantum unitary to approximately compute the joining times to be searched over by the approximate quantum minimum finding. Since the joining times are no longer exactly computed, it is no longer clear that the resulting approximate quantum algorithm obtains a good solution. As our second main contribution, we prove, via an approximate version of the KKT conditions and a duality gap, that the LARS algorithm (and thus our quantum algorithm) is robust to errors. This means that it still outputs a path that minimises the Lasso cost function up to a small error if the joining times are approximately computed. Moreover, we show that, when the observations are sampled from a Gaussian distribution, our quantum algorithm's complexity only depends polylogarithmically on $n$, exponentially better than the classical LARS algorithm, while keeping the quadratic improvement on $d$. Finally, we propose a dequantised algorithm that also retains the polylogarithmic dependence on $n$, albeit with the linear scaling on $d$ from the standard LARS algorithm.</description>

Abstract: In this Article we perform a systematic study of the global entanglement and exciton coherence length dynamics coherence in natural light-harvesting system Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex across various parameters of a dissipative environment from low to high temperatures, weak to strong system-environment coupling, and non-Markovian environments. A non-perturbative numerically exact hierarchical equations of motions method is employed to propagate the dynamics of the system. We found that entanglement is driven primarily by the strength of interaction between the system and environment, and it is modulated by the interplay between temperature and non-Markovianity. In contrast, coherence length is found to be insensitive to non-Markovianity. Furthermore, our results do not show the direct correlation between global entanglement and the efficiency of the excitation energy transfer in the FMO complex</description>

Abstract: The Knill-Laflamme (KL) conditions distinguish exact quantum error correction codes, and it has played a critical role in the discovery of state-of-the-art codes. However, the family of exact codes is a very restrictive one and does not necessarily contain the best-performing codes. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a generalized and quantitative performance metric. In this Letter, we derive the near-optimal channel fidelity, a concise and optimization-free metric for arbitrary codes and noise. The metric provides a narrow two-sided bound to the optimal code performance, and it can be evaluated with exactly the same input required by the KL conditions. We demonstrate the numerical advantage of the near-optimal channel fidelity through multiple qubit code and oscillator code examples. Compared to conventional optimization-based approaches, the reduced computational cost enables us to simulate systems with previously inaccessible sizes, such as oscillators encoding hundreds of average excitations. Moreover, we analytically derive the near-optimal performance for the thermodynamic code and the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code. In particular, the GKP code's performance under excitation loss improves monotonically with its energy and converges to an asymptotic limit at infinite energy, which is distinct from other oscillator codes.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing devices require exceptional control of their experimental parameters to prepare quantum states and simulate other quantum systems. Classical optimization procedures used to find such optimal control parameters, have further been shown in idealized settings to exhibit different regimes of learning. Of interest in this work is the overparameterization regime, where for systems with a sufficient number of parameters, global optima for prepared state and compiled unitary fidelities may potentially be reached exponentially quickly. Here, we study the robustness of overparameterization phenomena in the presence of experimental constraints on the controls, such as bounding or sharing parameters across operators, as well as in the presence of noise inherent to experimental setups. We observe that overparameterization phenomena are resilient in these realistic settings at short times, however fidelities decay to zero past a critical simulation duration due to accumulation of either quantum or classical noise. This critical depth is found to be logarithmic in the scale of noise, and optimal fidelities initially increase exponentially with depth, before decreasing polynomially with depth, and with noise. Our results demonstrate that parameterized ansatze can mitigate entropic effects from their environment, offering tantalizing opportunities for their application and experimental realization in near term quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although coherent manipulation of electronic states can be achieved in quantum dot (QD) devices by harnessing nanofabrication tools, it is often hard to fathom the extent to which these nanoelectronic devices can behave quantum mechanically. Witnessing their nonclassical nature would thus remain of paramount importance in the emerging world of quantum technologies, since the coherent dynamics of electronic states plays there a crucial role. Against this backdrop, we resort to the general framework of Leggett-Garg inequalities (LGI) as it allows for distinguishing the classical and quantum transport through nanostructures by way of various two-time correlation functions. Using the local charge detection at two different time, we investigate here theoretically whether any quantum violation of the original LGI exists with varying device configurations and parameters under both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Two-time correlators within LGI are derived in terms of the non-equilibrium Green's functions (NEGFs) by exactly solving the quantum Langevin equations. The present study of non-Markovian dynamics of quantum systems interacting with reservoirs is significant for understanding the relaxation phenomenon in the ultrafast transient regime to especially mimic what happens to high-speed quantum devices. We can potentially capture the effect of finite reservoir correlation time by accounting for level broadening at the electrodes along with non-Markovian memory effects. Furthermore, the large bias restriction is no longer imposed in our calculations so that we can safely consider a finite bias between the electronic reservoirs. Our approach is likely to open up new possibilities of witnessing the quantumness for other quantum many-body systems as well that are driven out of the equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of the non-Hermitian Floquet Wannier-Stark system in the framework of the tight-binding approximation, where the hopping strength is a periodic function of time with Floquet frequency $\omega$. It is shown that the energy level of the instantaneous Hamiltonian is still equally spaced and independent of time $t$ and the Hermiticity of the hopping term. In the case of off resonance, the dynamics are still periodic, while the occupied energy levels spread out at the resonance, exhibiting $t^z$ behavior. Analytic analysis and numerical simulation show that the level-spreading dynamics for real and complex hopping strengths exhibit distinct behaviors and are well described by the dynamical exponents $z=1$ and $z=1/2$, respectively.</description>

Abstract: Kibble-Zurek mechanism relates the domain of non-equilibrium dynamics with the critical properties at equilibrium. It establishes a power law connection between non-equilibrium defects quenched through a continuous phase transition and the quench rate via the scaling exponent. We present a novel numerical scheme to estimate the scaling exponent wherein the notion of defects is mapped to errors, previously introduced to quantify a variety of gapped quantum phases. To demonstrate the versatility of our method we conduct numerical experiments across a broad spectrum of spin-half models hosting local and symmetry protected topological order. Furthermore, an implementation of the quench dynamics featuring a topological phase transition on a digital quantum computer is proposed to quantify the associated criticality.</description>

Abstract: Achieving fast and precise initialization of qubits is a critical requirement for the successful operation of quantum computers. The combination of engineered environments with all-microwave techniques has recently emerged as a promising approach for the reset of superconducting quantum devices. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the utilization of a single-junction quantum-circuit refrigerator (QCR) for an expeditious removal of several excitations from a transmon qubit. The QCR is indirectly coupled to the transmon through a resonator in the dispersive regime, constituting a carefully engineered environmental spectrum for the transmon. Using single-shot readout, we observe excitation stabilization times down to roughly $500$ ns, a $20$-fold speedup with QCR and a simultaneous two-tone drive addressing the $e$-$f$ and $f0$-$g1$ transitions of the system. Our results are obtained at a $48$-mK fridge temperature and without postselection, fully capturing the advantage of the protocol for the short-time dynamics and the drive-induced detrimental asymptotic behavior in the presence of relatively hot other baths of the transmon. We validate our results with a detailed Liouvillian model truncated up to the three-excitation subspace, from which we estimate the performance of the protocol in optimized scenarios, such as cold transmon baths and fine-tuned driving frequencies. These results pave the way for optimized reset of quantum-electric devices using engineered environments and for dissipation-engineered state preparation.</description>

      <title>Dual frame optimization for informationally complete quantum measurements</title>

Abstract: Randomized measurement protocols such as classical shadows represent powerful resources for quantum technologies, with applications ranging from quantum state characterization and process tomography to machine learning and error mitigation. Recently, the notion of measurement dual frames, in which classical shadows are generalized to dual operators of POVM effects, resurfaced in the literature. This brought attention to additional degrees of freedom in the post-processing stage of randomized measurements that are often neglected by established techniques. In this work, we leverage dual frames to construct improved observable estimators from informationally complete measurement samples. We introduce novel classes of parametrized frame superoperators and optimization-free dual frames based on empirical frequencies, which offer advantages over their canonical counterparts while retaining computational efficiency. Remarkably, this comes at almost no quantum or classical cost, thus rendering dual frame optimization a valuable addition to the randomized measurement toolbox.</description>

      <title>Mixed Integer Linear Programming Solver Using Benders Decomposition Assisted by Neutral Atom Quantum Processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new hybrid classical-quantum approach to solve Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) using neutral atom quantum computations. We apply Benders decomposition (BD) to segment MILPs into a master problem (MP) and a subproblem (SP), where the MP is addressed using a neutral-atom device, after being transformed into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model, with an automatized procedure. Our MILP to QUBO conversion tightens the upper bounds of the involved continuous variables, positively impacting the required qubit count, and the convergence of the algorithm. To solve the QUBO, we develop a heuristic for atom register embedding and apply a variational algorithm for pulse shaping. In addition, we implement a Proof of Concept (PoC) that outperforms existing solutions. We also conduct preliminary numerical results: in a series of small MILP instances our algorithm identifies over 95 percent of feasible solutions of high quality, outperforming classical BD approaches where the MP is solved using simulated annealing. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to utilize a neutral atom quantum processor in developing an automated, problem-agnostic framework for solving MILPs through BD.</description>

      <title>Observation of a phase transition from a continuous to a discrete time crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete (DTCs) and continuous time crystals (CTCs) are novel dynamical many-body states, that are characterized by robust self-sustained oscillations, emerging via spontaneous breaking of discrete or continuous time translation symmetry. DTCs are periodically driven systems that oscillate with a subharmonic of the external drive, while CTCs are continuously driven and oscillate with a frequency intrinsic to the system. Here, we explore a phase transition from a continuous time crystal to a discrete time crystal. A CTC with a characteristic oscillation frequency $\omega_\mathrm{CTC}$ is prepared in a continuously pumped atom-cavity system. Modulating the pump intensity of the CTC with a frequency $\omega_{\mathrm{dr}}$ close to $2\,\omega_\mathrm{CTC}$ leads to robust locking of $\omega_\mathrm{CTC}$ to $\omega_{\mathrm{dr}}/2$, and hence a DTC arises. This phase transition in a quantum many-body system is related to subharmonic injection locking of non-linear mechanical and electronic oscillators or lasers.</description>

      <title>Directional emission of a readout resonator for qubit measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate transmission-based dispersive readout of a superconducting qubit using an all-pass resonator, which preferentially emits readout photons toward the output. This is in contrast to typical readout schemes, which intentionally mismatch the feedline at one end so that the readout signal preferentially decays toward the output. We show that this intentional mismatch creates scaling challenges, including larger spread of effective resonator linewidths due to non-ideal impedance environments and added infrastructure for impedance matching. A future architecture using multiplexed all-pass readout resonators would avoid the need for intentional mismatch and potentially improve the scaling prospects of quantum computers. As a proof-of-concept demonstration of "all-pass readout," we design and fabricate an all-pass readout resonator that demonstrates insertion loss below 1.17 dB at the readout frequency and a maximum insertion loss of 1.53 dB across its full bandwidth for the lowest three states of a transmon qubit. We demonstrate qubit readout with an average single-shot fidelity of 98.1% in 600 ns; to assess the effect of larger dispersive shift, we implement a shelving protocol and achieve a fidelity of 99.0% in 300 ns.</description>

      <title>Fidelity of Wormhole Teleportation in Finite-qubit Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid development of quantum science and technology is leading us into an era where quantum many-body systems can be comprehended through quantum simulations. Holographic duality, which states gravity and spacetime can emerge from strongly interacting systems, then offers a natural avenue for the experimental study of gravity physics without delving into experimentally infeasible high energies. A prominent example is the simulation of traversable wormholes through the wormhole teleportation protocol, attracting both theoretical and experimental attention. In this work, we develop the theoretical framework for computing the fidelity of wormhole teleportation in $N$-qubit systems with all-to-all interactions, quantified by mutual information and entanglement negativity. The main technique is the scramblon effective theory, which captures universal out-of-time-order correlations in generic chaotic systems. We clarify that strong couplings between the two systems are essential for simulating the probe limit of semi-classical traversable wormholes using strongly interacting systems with near-maximal chaos. However, the teleportation signal diminishes rapidly when reducing the system size $N$, requiring a large number of qubits to observe a sharp signature of emergent geometry by simulating the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. This includes both the causal time-order of signals and the asymmetry of the teleportation signal for coupling with different signs. As a comparison, the teleportation signal increases when reducing $N$ in weakly interacting systems. We also analyze the fidelity of the generalized encoding scheme in fermionic string operators.</description>

      <title>Fast quantum integer multiplication with zero ancillas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multiplication of superpositions of numbers is a core operation in many quantum algorithms. The standard method for multiplication (both classical and quantum) has a runtime quadratic in the size of the inputs. Quantum circuits with asymptotically fewer gates have been developed, but generally exhibit large overheads, especially in the number of ancilla qubits. In this work, we introduce a new paradigm for sub-quadratic-time quantum multiplication with zero ancilla qubits -- the only qubits involved are the input and output registers themselves. Our algorithm achieves an asymptotic gate count of $\mathcal{O}(n^{1+\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$; with practical choices of parameters, we expect scalings as low as $\mathcal{O}(n^{1.3})$. Used as a subroutine in Shor's algorithm, our technique immediately yields a factoring circuit with $\mathcal{O}(n^{2+\epsilon})$ gates and only $2n + \mathcal{O}(\log n)$ qubits; to our knowledge, this is by far the best qubit count of any factoring circuit with a sub-cubic number of gates. Used in Regev's recent factoring algorithm, the gate count is $\mathcal{O}(n^{1.5+\epsilon})$. Finally, we demonstrate that our algorithm has the potential to outperform previous proposals at problem sizes relevant in practice, including yielding the smallest circuits we know of for classically-verifiable quantum advantage.</description>

Abstract: Dense atom ensembles with Rydberg excitations display intriguing collective effects mediated by their strong, long-range dipole-dipole interactions. These collective effects, often modeled using Rydberg superatoms, have gained significant attention across various fields due to their potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum optics. In this review article, we delve into the theoretical foundations of Rydberg interactions and explore experimental techniques for their manipulation and detection. We also discuss the latest advancements in harnessing Rydberg collective effects for quantum computation and optical quantum technologies. By synthesizing insights from theoretical studies and experimental demonstrations, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of this rapidly evolving field and its potential impact on the future of quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: In a recent paper (Heras in Eur. Phys. J. Plus 138: 329, 2023), we have demonstrated that when a dyon encircles an infinitely long solenoid enclosing electric and magnetic fluxes, its wave function accumulates a quantum phase invariant under electromagnetic duality transformations. In this paper, we show that this phase, in conjunction with the Witten effect, gives rise to a topological phase proportional to the vacuum angle $\theta$ and thereby connected with CP violation. We show that this phase becomes quantised in a vacuum state $\delta_{\theta}=n\theta$ and that the most general vacuum state associated with this quantisation identifies with an Abelian form of the $\theta$-vacua. We discuss two hypothetical interference effects in the vacuum where the angle $\theta$ could manifest.</description>

Abstract: Distributed quantum entanglement plays a crucial role in realizing networks that connect quantum devices. However, sharing entanglement between distant nodes by means of photons is a challenging process primary due to unavoidable losses in the linking channels. In this paper, we propose a simple loss-tolerant protocol for the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state distribution. We analyze the distribution rate under feasible experimental conditions and demonstrate the advantages of rate-loss scaling with respect to direct transmission. Our protocol does not use quantum repeaters and is achievable with current quantum optics technology. The result has direct application to tasks such as conference key agreement or distributed sensing. Moreover, it reduces the requirements for implementing distributed quantum error correction codes such as the surface code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in the field of quantum machine learning have promoted the idea of incorporating physical symmetries in the structure of quantum circuits. A crucial milestone in this area is the realization of $S_{n}$-permutation equivariant quantum neural networks (QNN) that are equivariant under permutations of input objects. In this work, we focus on encoding the rotational symmetry of point cloud datasets into the QNN. The key insight of the approach is that all rotationally invariant functions with vector inputs are equivalent to a function with inputs of vector inner products. We provide a novel structure of QNN that is exactly invariant to both rotations and permutations, with its efficacy demonstrated numerically in the problems of two-dimensional image classifications and identifying high-energy particle decays, produced by proton-proton collisions, with the $SO(1,3)$ Lorentz symmetry.</description>

      <title>Crossing The Gap Using Variational Quantum Eigensolver: A Comparative Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the evolving domain of quantum computational chemistry, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) has been developed to explore not only the ground state but also the excited states of molecules. In this study, we compare the performance of Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) and Subspace-Search Variational Quantum Eigensolver (SSVQE) methods in determining the low-lying excited states of $LiH$. Our investigation reveals that while VQD exhibits a slight advantage in accuracy, SSVQE stands out for its efficiency, allowing the determination of all low-lying excited states through a single parameter optimization procedure. We further evaluate the effectiveness of optimizers, including Gradient Descent (GD), Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG), and Adam optimizer, in obtaining $LiH$'s first excited state, with the Adam optimizer demonstrating superior efficiency in requiring the fewest iterations. Moreover, we propose a novel approach combining Folded Spectrum VQE (FS-VQE) with either VQD or SSVQE, enabling the exploration of highly excited states. We test the new approaches for finding all three $H_4$'s excited states. Folded Spectrum SSVQE (FS-SSVQE) can find all three highly excited states near $-1.0$ Ha with only one optimizing procedure, but the procedure converges slowly. In contrast, although Folded spectrum VQD (FS-VQD) gets highly excited states with individual optimizing procedures, the optimizing procedure converges faster.</description>

      <title>Bell Nonlocality from Wigner Negativity in Qudit Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlocality is an essential concept that distinguishes quantum from classical models and has been extensively studied in systems of qubits. For higher-dimensional systems, certain results for their two-level counterpart, like Bell violations with stabilizer states and Clifford operators, do not generalize. On the other hand, similar to continuous variable systems, Wigner negativity is necessary for nonlocality in qudit systems. We propose a family of Bell inequalities that inquire correlations related to the Wigner negativity of stabilizer states under the adjoint action of a generalization of the qubit $\pi/8$ gate, which, in the bipartite case, is an abstraction of the CHSH inequality. The classical bound is simple to compute, and a specified stabilizer state maximally violates the inequality among all qudit states based on the Wigner negativity and an inequality between the 1-norm and the maximum norm. The Bell operator not only serves as a measure for the singlet fraction but also quantifies the volume of Wigner negativity. Furthermore, we give deterministic Bell violations, as well as violations with a constant number of measurements, for the Bell state relying on operators innate to higher-dimensional systems than the qudit at hand.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Optimal Control (QOC) supports the advance of quantum technologies by tackling its problems at the pulse level: Numerical approaches iteratively work towards a given target by parametrising the applied time-dependent fields with a finite set of variables. The effectiveness of the resulting optimisation depends on the complexity of the problem and the number of variables. We consider different parametrisations in terms of basis functions, asking whether the choice of the applied basis affects the quality of the optimisation. Furthermore, we consider strategies to choose the most suitable basis. For the comparison, we test three different randomisable bases - introducing the sinc and sigmoid bases as alternatives to the Fourier basis - on QOC problems of varying complexity. For each problem, the basis-specific convergence rates result in a unique ranking. Especially for expensive evaluations, e.g., in closed-loop, a potential speed-up by a factor of up to 10 may be crucial for the optimisation's feasibility. We conclude that a problem-dependent basis choice is an influential factor for QOC efficiency and provide advice for its approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multifractal properties in time evolution of a single particle subject to repeated measurements. For quantum systems, we consider circuit models consisting of local unitary gates and local projective measurements. For classical systems, we consider models for estimating the trajectory of a particle evolved under local transition processes by partially measuring particle occupations. In both cases, multifractal behaviors appear in the ensemble of wave functions or probability distributions conditioned on measurement outcomes after a sufficiently long time. While the nature of particle transport (diffusive or ballistic) qualitatively affects the multifractal properties, they are even quantitatively robust to the measurement rate or specific protocols. On the other hand, multifractality is generically lost by generalized measurements allowing erroneous outcomes or by postselection of the outcomes with no particle detection. We demonstrate these properties by numerical simulations and also propose several simplified models, which allow us to analytically obtain multifractal properties in the monitored single-particle systems.</description>

Abstract: Bell's theorem supposedly demonstrates an irreconcilable conflict between quantum mechanics and local, realistic hidden variable theories. In this paper we show that all experiments that aim to prove Bell's theorem do not actually achieve this goal. Our conclusions are based on a straightforward statistical analysis of the outcomes of these experiments. The key tool in our study is probability theory and, in particular, the concept of sample space for the dichotomic random variables that quantifies the outcomes of such experiments. We also show that an experimental proof of Bell's theorem is not, in principle, impossible, but it would require a completely different experimental apparatus than those commonly used to allegedly achieve this objective. The main consequence of our work is that we cannot dismiss local realistic hidden variable theories on the basis of currently available experimental data.</description>

Abstract: We give a new nonstandard proof of the well-known theorem that the generator $L$ of a quantum dynamical semigroup $\exp(tL)$ on a finite-dimensional quantum system has a specific form called a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) generator (also known as a Lindbladian) and vice versa. The proof starts from the Kraus representation of the quantum channel $\exp (\delta t L)$ for an infinitesimal hyperreal number $\delta t&gt;0$ and then estimates the orders of the traceless components of the Kraus operators. The jump operators naturally arise as the standard parts of the traceless components of the Kraus operators divided by $\sqrt{\delta t}$. We also give a nonstandard proof of a related fact that close completely positive maps have close Kraus operators.</description>

      <title>MEMO-QCD: Quantum Density Estimation through Memetic Optimisation for Quantum Circuit Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a strategy for efficient quantum circuit design for density estimation. The strategy is based on a quantum-inspired algorithm for density estimation and a circuit optimisation routine based on memetic algorithms. The model maps a training dataset to a quantum state represented by a density matrix through a quantum feature map. This training state encodes the probability distribution of the dataset in a quantum state, such that the density of a new sample can be estimated by projecting its corresponding quantum state onto the training state. We propose the application of a memetic algorithm to find the architecture and parameters of a variational quantum circuit that implements the quantum feature map, along with a variational learning strategy to prepare the training state. Demonstrations of the proposed strategy show an accurate approximation of the Gaussian kernel density estimation method through shallow quantum circuits illustrating the feasibility of the algorithm for near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Does the full configuration interaction method based on quantum phase estimation with Trotter decomposition satisfy the size consistency condition?</title>

Abstract: Electronic structure calculations of atoms and molecules are expected to be a promising application for quantum computers, and two important algorithms, the quantum phase estimation (QPE) and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), have been widely studied. The condition that the energy of the dimer consisting of two monomers separated by a large distance should be twice of the energy of the monomer, known as a size consistency, is very important in quantum chemical calculations. Recently, we reported that the size consistency condition can be broken by the Trotterization in the unitary coupled cluster singles and doubles (UCCSD) ansatz in VQE, when the molecular orbitals delocalized to the dimer are used (K. Sugisaki et al., J. Comput. Chem., published online; DOI: 10.1002/jcc.27438). It is well known that the full configuration interaction (full-CI) energy is invariant with arbitrary rotations of molecular orbitals, and therefore the QPE-based full-CI in principle satisfies the size consistency. However, Trotterization of the time evolution operator has a chance to break the size consistency conditions. In this work, we investigated whether or not the size consistency condition can be maintained by the Trotterization of the time evolution operator in the QPE-based full-CI calculations. Our numerical simulations revealed that the size consistency of the QPE-based full-CI is not automatically violated by using the molecular orbitals delocalized to the dimer, but the use of an appropriate Trotter decomposition condition is crucial to satisfy the size consistency condition. Acceleration of the QPE simulations with sequential addition of ancillary qubits is also reported.</description>

Abstract: We simulate quench dynamics of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain on the IBM quantum computers, calculating the R\'enyi entanglement entropy, the twist order parameter and the Berry phase. The latter two quantities can be deduced from a slow-twist operator defined in the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem. The R\'enyi entropy is obtained using a recently developed randomized measurement scheme. The twist order parameter and the Berry phase are measured without the need for additional gates or ancilla qubits. We consider quench protocols in which a trivial initial state evolves dynamically in time under the topological SSH Hamiltonian in the fully dimerized limit (the flat-band limit). During these quenches, there are persistent and periodic oscillations in the time evolution of both entanglement entropy and twist order parameter. Through the implementation of error mitigation techniques using a global depolarizing ansatz and postselection, our simulations on the IBM devices yield results that closely match exact solutions.</description>

Abstract: Evidence is growing for the theory of embodied cognition, which posits that action and perception co-determine each other, forming an action-perception loop. This suggests that we humans somehow participate in what we perceive. So, how can scientists escape the action-perception loop to obtain an observer-independent description of the world? Here we present a set of conjectures informed by the philosophy of mind and a reverse-engineering of science and quantum physics to explore this question. We argue that embodiment, as traditionally understood, can manifest aspects of imaginary-time quantum dynamics. We then explore what additional constraints are required to obtain aspects of genuine, real-time quantum dynamics. In particular, we conjecture that an embodied scientist doing experiments must be described from the perspective of another scientist, which is ignored in traditional approaches to embodied cognition, and that observers play complementary roles as both objects experienced by other observers and ``subjects'' that experience other objects.</description>

      <title>Boundary deconfined quantum criticality at transitions between symmetry-protected topological chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decades of research have revealed a deep understanding of topological quantum matter with protected edge modes. We report that even richer physics emerges when tuning between two topological phases of matter whose respective edge modes are incompatible. The frustration at the edge leads to novel boundary physics, such as symmetry-breaking phases with exotic non-Landau transitions -- even when the edge is zero-dimensional. As a minimal case study we consider spin chains with $\mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry, exhibiting two nontrivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. At the bulk 1+1D critical transition between these SPT phases, we find two stable 0+1D boundary phases, each spontaneously breaking one of the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetries. Furthermore, we find that a single boundary parameter tunes a non-Landau boundary critical transition between these two phases. This constitutes a 0+1D version of an exotic phenomenon driven by charged vortex condensation known as deconfined quantum criticality. This work highlights the rich unexplored physics of criticality between nontrivial topological phases and provides insights into the burgeoning field of gapless topological phases.</description>

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of matter whose low-energy physics is described as the deconfined phase of an emergent gauge theory. With recent theory proposals and an experiment showing preliminary signs of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order [G. Semeghini et al., Science 374, 1242 (2021)], Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a promising platform to realize a quantum spin liquid. In this work, we propose a way to realize a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid in three spatial dimensions, described by the deconfined phase of $U(1)$ gauge theory in a pyrochlore lattice Rydberg atom array. We study the ground state phase diagram of the proposed Rydberg system as a function of experimentally relevant parameters. Within our calculation, we find that by tuning the Rabi frequency, one can access both the confinement-deconfinement transition driven by a proliferation of "magnetic" monopoles and the Higgs transition driven by a proliferation of "electric" charges of the emergent gauge theory. We suggest experimental probes for distinguishing the deconfined phase from ordered phases. This work serves as a proposal to access a confinement-deconfinement transition in three spatial dimensions on a Rydberg-based quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>Anyon Quantum Dimensions from an Arbitrary Ground State Wave Function</title>

Abstract: Realizing topological orders and topological quantum computation is a central task of modern physics. An important but notoriously hard question in this endeavor is how to diagnose topological orders that lack conventional order parameters. A breakthrough in this problem is the discovery of topological entanglement entropy, which can be used to detect nontrivial topological order from a ground state wave function, but is far from enough for fully determining the topological order. In this work, we take a key step further in this direction: We propose a simple entanglement-based protocol for extracting the quantum dimensions of all anyons from a single ground state wave function in two dimensions. The choice of the space manifold and the ground state is arbitrary. This protocol is both validated in the continuum and verified on lattices, and we anticipate it to be realizable in various quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Fermion-parity qubit in a proximitized double quantum dot</title>

Abstract: Bound states in quantum dots coupled to superconductors can be in a coherent superposition of states with different electron number but with the same fermion parity. Electrostatic gating can tune this superposition to a sweet spot, where the quantum dot has the same mean electric charge independent of its electron-number parity. Here, we propose to encode quantum information in the local fermion parity of two tunnel-coupled quantum dots embedded in a Josephson junction. At the sweet spot, the qubit states have zero charge dipole moment. This protects the qubit from dephasing due to charge noise acting on the potential of each dot, as well as fluctuations of the (weak) inter-dot tunneling. At weak inter-dot tunneling, relaxation is suppressed because of disjoint qubit states. On the other hand, for strong inter-dot tunneling the system is protected against noise affecting each quantum dot separately (energy level noise, dot-superconductor tunneling fluctuations, and hyperfine interactions). Finally, we describe initialization and readout as well as single-qubit and two-qubit gates by pulsing gate voltages.</description>

Abstract: Achieving dynamic manipulation and control of single molecules at high spatio-temporal resolution is pivotal for advancing atomic-scale computing and nanorobotics. However, this endeavour is critically challenged by complex nature of atomic and molecular interactions, high-dimensional characteristics of nanoscale systems, and scarcity of experimental data. Here, we present a toy model for controlling single-molecule diffusion by harnessing electrostatic forces arising from elementary surface charges within a lattice structure, mimicking embedded charges on a surface. We investigate the interplay between quantum mechanics and electrostatic interactions in single molecule diffusion processes using a combination of state-dependent diffusion equations and Green's functions. We find that surface charge density critically influences diffusion coefficients, exhibiting linear scaling akin to Coulombic forces. We achieve accurate predictions of experimental diffusion constants and extending the observed range to values reaching up to 6000 $\mu\text{m}^2\text{ms}^{-1}$ and 80000 $\mu\text{m}^2\text{ms}^{-1}$. The molecular trajectories predicted by our model bear resemblance to planetary motion, particularly in their gravity-assisted acceleration-like behaviour. It holds transformative implications for nanorobotics, motion control at the nanoscale, and computing applications, particularly in the areas of molecular and quantum computing where the trapping of atoms and molecules is essential. Beyond the state-of-the-art optical lattice and scanning tunnelling microscopy for atomic/molecular manipulation, our findings give unambiguous advantage of precise control over single-molecule dynamics through quantum manipulation at the angstrom scale.</description>

Abstract: Eigenvector continuation is a computational method for parametric eigenvalue problems that uses subspace projection with a basis derived from eigenvector snapshots from different parameter sets. It is part of a broader class of subspace-projection techniques called reduced-basis methods. In this colloquium article, we present the development, theory, and applications of eigenvector continuation and projection-based emulators. We introduce the basic concepts, discuss the underlying theory and convergence properties, and present recent applications for quantum systems and future prospects.</description>

      <title>Koopmon trajectories in nonadiabatic quantum-classical dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to alleviate the computational costs of fully quantum nonadiabatic dynamics, we present a mixed quantum-classical (MQC) particle method based on the theory of Koopman wavefunctions. Although conventional MQC models often suffer from consistency issues such as the violation of Heisenberg's principle, we overcame these difficulties by blending Koopman's classical mechanics on Hilbert spaces with methods in symplectic geometry. The resulting continuum model enjoys both a variational and a Hamiltonian structure, while its nonlinear character calls for suitable closures. Benefiting from the underlying action principle, here we apply a regularization technique previously developed within our team. This step allows for a singular solution ansatz which introduces the trajectories of computational particles - the koopmons - sampling the Lagrangian classical paths in phase space. In the case of Tully's nonadiabatic problems, the method reproduces the results of fully quantum simulations with levels of accuracy that are not achieved by standard MQC Ehrenfest simulations. In addition, the koopmon method is computationally advantageous over similar fully quantum approaches, which are also considered in our study. As a further step, we probe the limits of the method by considering the Rabi problem in both the ultrastrong and the deep strong coupling regimes, where MQC treatments appear hardly applicable. In this case, the method succeeds in reproducing parts of the fully quantum results.</description>

Abstract: Many-body entanglement unveils additional aspects of quantum matter and offers insights into strongly correlated physics. While ground-state entanglement has received much attention in the past decade, the study of mixed-state quantum entanglement using negativity in interacting fermionic systems remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate that the partially transposed density matrix of interacting fermions, similar to their reduced density matrix, can be expressed as a weighted sum of Gaussian states describing free fermions, enabling the calculation of rank-$n$ R\'{e}nyi negativity within the determinant quantum Monte Carlo framework. We conduct the first calculation of the rank-two R\'{e}nyi negativity for the half-filled Hubbard model and the spinless $t$-$V$ model. Our calculation reveals that the area law coefficient of the R\'{e}nyi negativity for the spinless $t$-$V$ model has a logarithmic finite-size scaling at the finite-temperature transition point. Our work contributes to the calculation of entanglement and sets the stage for future studies on quantum entanglement in various fermionic many-body mixed states.</description>

Abstract: In this work, the term ``quantum chaos'' refers to spectral correlations similar to those found in the random matrix theory. Quantum chaos can be diagnosed through the analysis of level statistics using e.g.~the spectral form factor, which detects both short- and long-range level correlations. The spectral form factor corresponds to the Fourier transform of the two-point spectral correlation function and exhibits a typical slope-dip-ramp-plateau structure (aka correlation hole) when the system is chaotic. We discuss how this structure could be detected through the quench dynamics of two physical quantities accessible to experimental many-body quantum systems: the survival probability and the spin autocorrelation function. The survival probability is equivalent to the spectral form factor with an additional filter. When the system is small, the dip of the correlation hole reaches sufficiently large values at times which are short enough to be detected with current experimental platforms. As the system is pushed away from chaos, the correlation hole disappears, signaling integrability or localization. We also provide a relatively shallow circuit with which the correlation hole could be detected with commercially available quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: The Schrodinger equation with a Yukawa type of potential is solved analytically. When different boundary conditions are taken into account, a series of solutions are indicated as Bessel function, the first kind of Hankel function and the second kind of Hankel function, respectively. Subsequently, the scattering processes of $K \bar{K}^*$ and $D \bar{ D}^*$ are investigated. In the $K \bar{K}^*$ sector, the $f_1(1285)$ particle is treated as a $K \bar{K}^*$ bound state, therefore, the coupling constant in the $K \bar{K}^*$ Yukawa potential can be fixed according to the binding energy of the $f_1(1285)$ particle. Consequently, a $K \bar{K}^*$ resonance state is generated by solving the Schrodinger equation with the outgoing wave condition, which lie at $1417-i18$MeV on the complex energy plane. It is reasonable to assume that the $K \bar{K}^*$ resonance state at $1417-i18$MeV might correspond to the $f_1(1420)$ particle in the review of Particle Data Group(PDG).In the $D \bar{D}^*$ sector, since the $X(3872)$ particle is almost located at the $D \bar{ D}^*$ threshold, the binding energy of it equals to zero approximately. Therefore, the coupling constant in the $D \bar{ D}^*$ Yukawa potential is determined, which is related to the first zero point of the zero order Bessel function. Similarly to the $K \bar{K}^*$ case, four resonance states are produced as solutions of the Schrodinger equation with the outgoing wave condition. It is assumed that the resonance states at $3885-i1$MeV, $4029-i108$ MeV, $4328-i191$MeV and $4772-i267$MeV might be associated with the $Zc(3900)$, the $X(3940)$, the $\chi_{c1}(4274)$ and $\chi_{c1}(4685)$ particles, respectively. It is noted that all solutions are isospin degenerate.</description>

Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical framework to solve the elastic scattering phase shift of two well-bound nuclei in an uncoupled channel. Within this framework, we develop a many-body formalism in which the continuum scattering states of the two colliding nuclei are regulated by a weak external harmonic oscillator potential with varying strength. Based on our formalism, we propose an approach to compute the eigenenergies of the low-lying scattering states of the relative motion of the colliding nuclei as a function of the oscillator strength of the confining potential. Utilizing the modified effective range expansion, we extrapolate the elastic scattering phase shift of the colliding nuclei from these eigenenergies to the limit when the external potential vanishes. In our hybrid approach, we leverage the advantage of quantum computing to solve for these eigenenergies from a set of many-nucleon Hamiltonian eigenvalue problems. These eigenenergies are inputs to classical computers to obtain the phase shift. We demonstrate our framework with two simple problems, where we implement the rodeo algorithm to solve the relevant eigenenergies with the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator. The results of both the spectra and the elastic scattering phase shifts agree well with other theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Influence of catastrophes and hidden dynamical symmetries on ultrafast backscattered photoelectrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the effect of using potentials with a Coulomb tail and different degrees of softening in the photoelectron momentum distributions (PMDs) using the recently implemented hybrid forward-boundary CQSFA (H-CQSFA). We show that introducing a softening in the Coulomb interaction influences the ridges observed in the PMDs associated with backscattered electron trajectories. In the limit of a hard-core Coulomb interaction, the re-scattering ridges close along the polarization axis, while for a soft-core potential, they are interrupted at ridge-specific angles. We analyze the momentum mapping of the different orbits leading to the ridges. For the hard-core potential, there exist two types of saddle-point solutions that coalesce at the ridge. By increasing the softening, we show that two additional solutions emerge as the result of breaking a hidden dynamical symmetry associated exclusively with the Coulomb potential. Further signatures of this symmetry breaking are encountered in subsets of momentum-space trajectories. Finally, we use scattering theory to show how the softening affects the maximal scattering angle and provide estimates that agree with our observations from the CQSFA. This implies that, in the presence of residual binding potentials in the electron's continuum propagation, the distinction between purely kinematic and dynamic caustics becomes blurred.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Wigner function of electron beams based on coherence measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We developed a reconstruction method for the density matrix and Wigner function of electron beams through analysis of the Airy pattern intensity profile. The density matrix in a transmission electron microscope object plane was calculated using the coherence function and the electron wave amplitude and phase distributions. The Wigner function was then reconstructed using the matrix elements. Based on the Wigner function at the origin of the phase space, we derived a formula to calculate the axial brightness, and then determined the axial brightness of a Schottky field emission gun, which reflects the emitter performance more accurately and precisely than the conventional mean brightness measurements.</description>

      <title>L0-regularized compressed sensing with Mean-field Coherent Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent Ising Machine (CIM) is a network of optical parametric oscillators that solves combinatorial optimization problems by finding the ground state of an Ising Hamiltonian. As a practical application of CIM, Aonishi et al. proposed a quantum-classical hybrid system to solve optimization problems of L0-regularization-based compressed sensing (L0RBCS). Gunathilaka et al. has further enhanced the accuracy of the system. However, the computationally expensive CIM's stochastic differential equations (SDEs) limit the use of digital hardware implementations. As an alternative to Gunathilaka et al.'s CIM SDEs used previously, we propose using the mean-field CIM (MF-CIM) model, which is a physics-inspired heuristic solver without quantum noise. MF-CIM surmounts the high computational cost due to the simple nature of the differential equations (DEs). Furthermore, our results indicate that the proposed model has similar performance to physically accurate SDEs in both artificial and magnetic resonance imaging data, paving the way for implementing CIM-based L0RBCS on digital hardware such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Momentum Spectra of pair created in a pulsed field at finite times: Are Oscillations "Real"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the mechanism of production of electron-positron pairs from the vacuum in a time-varying, spatially uniform pulsed electric field. We analytically compute the probability of $(e^+ e^-) $pair production in momentum space using the exact solution of the one-particle time-dependent Dirac equation and compare the result with quantum kinetic theory (QKT). Both approaches allow us to study the particle momentum spectrum at any instant in time and can potentially unveil valuable information regarding quantum non-equilibrium physics. We analyze both approaches' momentum spectra of the created particles at any instant. We observe a multi-profile structure in the LMS. This multi-profile structure clearly illustrates the quantum interference effects associated with pair production. It is worth noting that both approaches exhibit quantum interference patterns at finite times, manifested as oscillations observed in the LMS. We highlight that this quantum signature is a universal behavior seen in the momentum spectra at finite times, where the electric field is nearly zero.</description>

      <title>Geodesic nature and quantization of shift vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the geodesic nature and quantization of geometric shift vector in quantum systems, with the parameter space defined by the Bloch momentum, using the Wilson loop approach. Our analysis extends to include bosonic phonon drag shift vectors with non-vertical transitions. We demonstrate that the gauge invariant shift vector can be quantized as integer values, analogous to the Euler characteristic based on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for a manifold with a smooth boundary. We reveal intricate relationships among geometric quantities such as the shift vector, Berry curvature, and quantum metric. Our findings demonstrate that the loop integral of the shift vector in the quantized interband formula contributes to the non-quantized component of the trace of conductivity in the circular photogalvanic effect. The Wilson loop method facilitates first-principles calculations, providing insights in the geometric underpinnings of these interband gauge invariant quantities and shedding light on their nonlinear optical manifestations in real materials.</description>

      <title>Kondo-Zeno crossover in the dynamics of a monitored quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a quantum dot coupled to a metallic bath and subject to continuous monitoring of its charge density. The dynamics averaged over measurement noise is described by a dissipative Anderson impurity model with local Markovian dephasing, that we solve using an extension of the Non-Crossing Approximation in the vectorized Hilbert space. We show that the decay time scale of an initially polarised spin which is suddenly coupled to the bath and to the monitoring protocol displays a crossover from Kondo screening, with a lifetime controlled by interactions, to Quantum Zeno effect, with a lifetime which decreases with bare dissipation as the dephasing or monitoring rate is increased. Using a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation on the Lindbladian we derive an effective model for the long-time dynamics which is described at weak dissipation by a non-Hermitian Kondo model with complex-valued spin-spin exchange. As the dephasing is increased heating due to doublon production takes over and control the spin decay.</description>
