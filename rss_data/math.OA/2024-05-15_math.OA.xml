      <title>Continuous Krishna-Parthasarathy Entropic Uncertainty Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2002, Krishna and Parthasarathy [\textit{Sankhy\={a} Ser. A}] derived discrete quantum version of Maassen-Uffink [\textit{Phys. Rev. Lett., 1988}] entropic uncertainty principle. In this paper, using the notion of continuous operator-valued frames, we derive an entropic uncertainty principle for arbitrary family of operators indexed by measure spaces having finite measure. We give an application to the special case of compact groups.</description>

      <title>Free extreme points span generalized free spectrahedra given by compact coefficients</title>

Abstract: Matrix convexity generalizes convexity to the dimension free setting and has connections to many mathematical and applied pursuits including operator theory, quantum information, noncommutative optimization, and linear control systems. In the setting of classical convex sets, extreme points are central objects which exhibit many important properties. For example, the Minkowski theorem shows that any element of a closed bounded convex set can be expressed as a convex combination of extreme points. Extreme points are also of great interest in the dimension free setting of matrix convex sets; however, here the situation requires more nuance.
  In the dimension free setting, there are many different types of extreme points. Of particular importance are free extreme points, a highly restricted type of extreme point that is closely connected to the dilation theoretic Arveson boundary. If free extreme points span a matrix convex set through matrix convex combinations, then they satisfy a strong notion of minimality in doing so. However, not all closed bounded matrix convex sets even have free extreme points. Thus, a major goal is to determine which matrix convex sets are spanned by their free extreme points.
  Building on a recent work of J. W. Helton and the author which shows that free spectrahedra, i.e., dimension free solution sets to linear matrix inequalities, are spanned by their free extreme points, we establish two additional classes of matrix convex sets which are the matrix convex hull of their free extreme points. Namely, we show that closed bounded free spectrahedrops, i.e, closed bounded projections of free spectrahedra, are the span of their free extreme points. Furthermore, we show that if one considers linear operator inequalities that have compact operator defining tuples, then the resulting ``generalized" free spectrahedra are spanned by their free extreme points.</description>

      <title>Drazin and group invertibility in algebras spanned by two idempotents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For two given idempotents $p\text{ and }q$ from an associative algebra $\mathcal{A},$ in this paper, we offer a comprehensive classification of algebras spanned by the idempotents $p\text{ and }q$. This classification is based on the condition that $p\text{ and }q$ are not tightly coupled and satisfies $(pq)^{m-1}=(pq)^{m}$ but $(pq)^{m-2}p\neq (pq)^{m-1}p$ for some $m(\geq2)\in\mathbb{N}.$ Subsequently, we categorized all the group invertible elements and established an upper bound for Drazin index of any elements in these algebras spanned by $p,q$. Moreover, we formulate a new representation for the Drazin inverse of $(\alpha p+q)$ under two different assumptions, $(pq)^{m-1}=(pq)^m$ and $\lambda(pq)^{m-1}=(pq)^m,$ here $\alpha$ is a non-zero and $\lambda$ is a non-unit real or complex number.</description>
