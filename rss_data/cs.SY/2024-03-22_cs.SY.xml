      <title>Optimal State Estimation in the Presence of Non-Gaussian Uncertainty via Wasserstein Distance Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel distribution-agnostic Wasserstein distance-based estimation framework. The goal is to determine an optimal map combining prior estimate with measurement likelihood such that posterior estimation error optimally reaches the Dirac delta distribution with minimal effort. The Wasserstein metric is used to quantify the effort of transporting from one distribution to another. We hypothesize that minimizing the Wasserstein distance between the posterior error and the Dirac delta distribution results in optimal information fusion and posterior state uncertainty. Framework validation is demonstrated by the successful recovery of the classical Kalman filter for linear systems with Gaussian uncertainties. Notably, the proposed Wasserstein filter does not rely on particle representation of uncertainty. Furthermore, the classical result for the Gaussian Sum Filter (GSF) is retrieved from the Wasserstein framework. This approach analytically exhibits the suboptimality of GSF and enables the use of nonlinear optimization techniques to enhance the accuracy of the Gaussian sum estimator.</description>

      <title>Clustering Heuristics for Robust Energy Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (ECVRP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents an approach to solving the Robust Energy Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (RECVRP), focusing on electric vehicles and their limited battery capacity. A finite number of customers, each with their own demand, have to be serviced by an electric vehicle fleet while ensuring that none of the vehicles run out of energy. The time and energy it takes to travel between any two points is modeled as a random variable with known distribution. We propose a Mixed Integer Program (MIP) for computing an exact solution and introduce clustering heuristics to enhance the solution speed. This enables efficient re-planning of routes in dynamic scenarios. The methodology transforms the RECVRP into smaller problems, yielding good quality solutions quickly compared to existing methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using a well-known benchmark problem set as well as a set of randomly generated problems.</description>

      <title>Credit vs. Discount-Based Congestion Pricing: A Comparison Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tolling, or congestion pricing, offers a promising traffic management policy for regulating congestion, but has also attracted criticism for placing outsized financial burdens on low-income users. Credit-based congestion pricing (CBCP) and discount-based congestion pricing (DBCP) policies, which respectively provide travel credits and toll discounts to low-income users on tolled roads, have emerged as promising mechanisms for reducing traffic congestion without worsening societal inequities. However, the optimal design of CBCP and DBCP policies, as well as their relative advantages and disadvantages, remain poorly understood. To address this, we study the effects of implementing CBCP and DBCP policies to route users on a network of multi-lane highways with tolled express lanes. We formulate a non-atomic routing game framework in which a subset of eligible users is granted toll relief in the form of a fixed budget or toll discount, while the remaining ineligible users must pay out-of-pocket. We prove the existence of Nash equilibrium traffic flow patterns corresponding to any given CBCP or DBCP policy. Under the additional assumption that eligible users have time-invariant VoTs, we provide a convex program to efficiently compute these equilibria. For networks consisting of a single edge, we identify conditions under which CBCP policies outperform DBCP policies (and vice versa), in the sense of improving eligible users' access to the express lane. Finally, we present empirical results from a CBCP pilot study of the San Mateo 101 Express Lane Project in California. Our empirical results corroborate our theoretical analysis of the impact of deploying credit-based and discount-based policies, and lend insights into the sensitivity of their impact with respect to the travel demand and users' VoTs.</description>

      <title>When are Lossy Energy Storage Optimization Models Convex?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of optimization problems involving the optimal operation of a single lossy energy storage system that incurs energy loss when charging or discharging. Such inefficiencies in the energy storage dynamics are known to result in a nonconvex set of feasible charging and discharging power profiles. In this letter, we provide an equivalent reformulation for this class of optimization problems, along with sufficient conditions for the convexity of the proposed reformulation. The conditions provided generalize existing conditions for convexity in the literature.</description>

      <title>A Unified Toll Lane Framework for Autonomous and High-Occupancy Vehicles in Interactive Mixed Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a toll lane framework that optimizes the mixed flow of autonomous and high-occupancy vehicles on freeways, where human-driven and autonomous vehicles of varying commuter occupancy share a segment. Autonomous vehicles, with their ability to maintain shorter headways, boost traffic throughput. Our framework designates a toll lane for autonomous vehicles with high occupancy to use free of charge, while others pay a toll. We explore the lane choice equilibria when all vehicles minimize travel costs, and characterize the equilibria by ranking vehicles by their mobility enhancement potential, a concept we term the mobility degree. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate the framework's utility in addressing design challenges such as setting optimal tolls, determining occupancy thresholds, and designing lane policies, showing how it facilitates the integration of high-occupancy and autonomous vehicles. We also propose an algorithm for assigning rational tolls to decrease total commuter delay and examine the effects of toll non-compliance. Our findings suggest that self-interest-driven behavior mitigates moderate non-compliance impacts, highlighting the framework's resilience. This work presents a pioneering comprehensive analysis of a toll lane framework that emphasizes the coexistence of autonomous and high-occupancy vehicles, offering insights for traffic management improvements and the integration of autonomous vehicles into existing transportation infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Performance-Guaranteed Solutions for Multi-Agent Optimal Coverage Problems using Submodularity, Curvature, and Greedy Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of multi-agent optimal coverage problems where the goal is to determine the optimal placement of a group of agents in a given mission space such that they maximize a joint ``coverage'' objective. This class of problems is extremely challenging due to the non-convex nature of the mission space and of the coverage objective. With this motivation, we propose to use a greedy algorithm as a means of getting feasible coverage solutions efficiently. Even though such greedy solutions are suboptimal, the submodularity (diminishing returns) property of the coverage objective can be exploited to provide performance bound guarantees - not only for the greedy solutions but also for any subsequently improved solutions. Moreover, we show that improved performance bound guarantees (beyond the standard (1-1/e) performance bound) can be established using various curvature measures that further characterize the considered coverage problem. In particular, we provide a brief review of all existing popular curvature measures found in the submodular maximization literature, including a recent curvature measure that we proposed, and discuss in detail their applicability, practicality, and effectiveness in the context of optimal coverage problems. Moreover, we characterize the dependence of the effectiveness of different curvature measures (in providing improved performance bound guarantees) on the agent sensing capabilities. Finally, we provide several numerical results to support our findings and propose several potential future research directions.</description>

      <title>LR-FHSS Transceiver for Direct-to-Satellite IoT Communications: Design, Implementation, and Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a long range-frequency hopping spread spectrum (LR-FHSS) transceiver design for the Direct-to-Satellite Internet of Things (DtS-IoT) communication system. The DtS-IoT system has recently attracted attention as a promising nonterrestrial network (NTN) solution to provide high-traffic and low-latency data transfer services to IoT devices in global coverage. In particular, this study provides guidelines for the overall DtS-IoT system architecture and design details that conform to the Long Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN). Furthermore, we also detail various DtS-IoT use cases. Considering the multiple low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, we developed the LR-FHSS transceiver to improve system efficiency, which is the first attempt in real satellite communication systems using LR-FHSS. Moreover, as an extension of our previous work with perfect synchronization, we applied a robust synchronization scheme against the Doppler effect and co-channel interference (CCI) caused by LEO satellite channel environments, including signal detection for the simultaneous reception of numerous frequency hopping signals and an enhanced soft-output-Viterbi-algorithm (SOVA) for the header and payload receptions. Lastly, we present proof-of-concept implementation and testbeds using an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chipset and a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) that verify the performance of the proposed LR-FHSS transceiver design of DtS-IoT communication systems. The laboratory test results reveal that the proposed LR-FHSS-based framework with the robust synchronization technique can provide wide coverage, seamless connectivity, and high throughput communication links for the realization of future sixth-generation (6G) networks.</description>

      <title>Lane level joint control of off-ramp and main line speed guidance on expressway in rainy weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the upstream of the exit ramp of the expressway, the speed limit difference leads to a significant deceleration of the vehicle in the area adjacent to the off-ramp. The friction coefficient of the road surface decreases under rainy weather, and the above deceleration process can easily lead to sideslip and rollover of the vehicle. Dynamic speed guidance is an effective way to improve the status quo. Currently, there is an emerging trend to utilize I2V technology and high-precision map technology for lane level speed guidance control. This paper presents an optimized joint control strategy for main line-off-ramp speed guidance, which can adjust the guidance speed in real time according to the rainfall intensity. At the same time, this paper designs a progressive deceleration strategy, which works together with the speed guidance control to ensure the safe deceleration of vehicles. The simulation results show that the proposed control strategy outperforms the fixed speed limit control in terms of improving the total traveled time (TTT), total traveled distance (TTD) and standard deviation of speed (SD). Sensitivity analysis shows that the proposed control strategy can improve performance with the increase of the compliance rate of drivers. The speed guidance control method established in this paper can improve the vehicle operation efficiency in the off-ramp area of the expressway and reduce the speed difference of each vehicle in rainy weather, which guarantee the safety of expressway driving in the rainy day.</description>

      <title>Conservative Linear Envelopes for High-Dimensional, Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability for Nonlinear Systems via the Hopf Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) analysis provides a value function that encodes (1) the set of states from which a nonlinear system with bounded control inputs can reach a goal (or avoid a failure set) despite any bounded disturbance, and (2) the corresponding optimal control policy to reach (or avoid). Though powerful, traditional methods for HJR rely on dynamic programming and suffer from exponential computation growth with respect to state dimension. The recently favored Hopf formula mitigates this ''curse of dimensionality'' by providing an efficient and space-parallelizable approach for solving the reachability problem. However, the Hopf formula can only be applied to linear time-varying systems. To overcome this limitation, we show that the error between a nonlinear system and a linear model can be transformed into an adversarial bounded artificial disturbance, making an envelope of the true value. One may then solve the dimension-robust Hopf formula for a linear game with this ''antagonistic error" to perform guaranteed conservative reachability analysis and control synthesis of nonlinear systems; this can be done for problem formulations in which no other HJR method is both computationally feasible and guaranteed. In addition, we offer several technical methods for reducing conservativeness in the analysis. We demonstrate the theory by solving the safe linear envelope in the controlled Van der Pol system, where the true reachable set may be observed, and by solving a 5 agent (15D) pursuit-evasion game with Dubins cars.</description>

      <title>Event-triggered Boundary Control of Mixed-autonomy Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control problems of mixed-autonomy traffic system consisting of both Human-driven Vehicles (HV) and Autonomous Vehicles (AV) have gained increasing attention. This paper is focused on suppressing traffic oscillations of the mixed-autonomy traffic system using boundary control design. The mixed traffic dynamics are described by a 4 x 4 hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDE) which governs propagation of four properties in traffic including density of HV, density of AV, friction between two classes of vehicles from driving interactions, and averaged velocity. We propose event-triggered boundary control design since control signal of traffic light on ramp or varying speed limit cannot be updated in a continuous time fashion. We apply event-triggered mechanism for a PDE backstepping controller and obtain dynamic triggering condition. Lyapunov analysis is conducted to prove the exponential stability of the closed loop system with the event-triggered controller. Numerical simulation demonstrates how car-following spacing of AV affects event-triggering mechanism of control input in mixed-autonomy traffic.</description>

      <title>Transformation-Free Fixed-Structure Model Reduction for LPV Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a model reduction technique for linear parameter varying (LPV) systems based on available tools for fixed-structure controller synthesis. We start by transforming a model reduction problem into an equivalent controller synthesis problem by defining an appropriate generalized plant. The controller synthesis problem is then solved by using gradient-based tools available in the literature. Owing to the flexibility of the gradient-based synthesis tools, we are able to impose a desired structure on the obtained reduced model. Additionally, we obtain a bound on the approximation error as a direct output of the optimization problem. The proposed methods are applied on a benchmark mechanical system of interconnected masses, springs and dampers. To evaluate the effect of the proposed model-reduction approach on controller design, LPV controllers designed using the reduced models (with and without an imposed structure) are compared in closed-loop with the original model.</description>

      <title>A Control Barrier Function Composition Approach for Multi-Agent Systems in Marine Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The agents within a multi-agent system (MAS) operating in marine environments often need to utilize task payloads and avoid collisions in coordination, necessitating adherence to a set of relative-pose constraints, which may include field-of-view, line-of-sight, collision-avoidance, and range constraints. A nominal controller designed for reference tracking may not guarantee the marine MAS stays safe w.r.t. these constraints. To modify the nominal input as one that enforces safety, we introduce a framework to systematically encode the relative-pose constraints as nonsmooth control barrier functions (NCBFs) and combine them as a single NCBF using Boolean composition, which enables a simplified verification process compared to using the NCBFs individually. While other relative-pose constraint functions have explicit derivatives, the challenging line-of-sight constraint is encoded with the minimum distance function between the line-of-sight set and other agents, whose derivative is not explicit. Hence, existing safe control design methods that consider composite NCBFs cannot be applied. To address this challenge, we propose a novel quadratic program formulation based on the dual of the minimum distance problem and develop a new theory to ensure the resulting control input guarantees constraint satisfaction. Lastly, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework on a simulated large-scale marine MAS and a real-world marine MAS comprising one Unmanned Surface Vehicle and two Unmanned Underwater Vehicles.</description>

      <title>A Benchmark for the Application of Distributed Control Techniques to the Electricity Network of the European Economic Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The European Economic Area Electricity Network Benchmark (EEA-ENB) is a multi-area power system representing the European network of transmission systems for electricity to facilitate the application of distributed control techniques. In the EEA-ENB we consider the Load Frequency Control (LFC) problem in the presence of renewable energy sources (RESs), and energy storage systems (ESSs). RESs are known to cause instability in power networks due to their inertia-less and intermittent characteristics, while ESSs are introduced as a resource to mitigate the problem. In the EEA-ENB, particular attention is dedicated to Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC), whose application is often limited to small and homogeneous test cases due to the lack of standardized large-scale scenarios for testing, and due to the large computation time required to obtain a centralized MPC action for performance comparison with DMPC strategies under consideration. The second problem is exacerbated when the scale of the system grows. To address these challenges and to provide a real-world-based and control-independent benchmark, the EEA-ENB has been developed. The benchmark includes a centralized MPC strategy providing performance and computation time metrics to compare distributed control within a repeatable and realistic simulation environment.</description>

      <title>A new control-oriented METANET model to encompass service stations on highways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the METANET with service station (METANET-s) model, a second-order macroscopic traffic model that, compared to the classical METANET, incorporates the dynamics of service stations on highways. Specifically, we employ the (so-called) store-and-forward links to model the stop of vehicles and the possible queue forming in the process of merging back into the highway mainstream. We explore the capability of the METANET-s to capture well both traffic back propagation and capacity drops, which are typically caused by the presence of vehicles joining again the mainstream traffic from the service station. Therefore, capturing these effects is crucial to improving the model's predictive capabilities. Finally, we perform a comparative analysis with the Cell Transmission Model with service station (CTM-s), showcasing that the METANET-s describes the traffic evolution much better than its first-order counterpart.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Over-The-Air Consensus for Collision Avoidance and Formation Control in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a distributed control method for multi-agent robotic systems employing Over the Air Consensus (OTA-Consensus). Designed for agents with decoupled single-integrator dynamics, this approach aims at efficient formation achievement and collision avoidance. As a distinctive feature, it leverages OTA's ability to exploit interference in wireless channels, a property traditionally considered a drawback, thus enhancing communication efficiency among robots. An analytical proof of asymptotic convergence is established for systems with time-varying communication topologies represented by sequences of strongly connected directed graphs. Comparative evaluations demonstrate significant efficiency improvements over current state-of-the-art methods, especially in scenarios with a large number of agents.</description>

      <title>On the continuity and smoothness of the value function in reinforcement learning and optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The value function plays a crucial role as a measure for the cumulative future reward an agent receives in both reinforcement learning and optimal control. It is therefore of interest to study how similar the values of neighboring states are, i.e., to investigate the continuity of the value function. We do so by providing and verifying upper bounds on the value function's modulus of continuity. Additionally, we show that the value function is always H\"older continuous under relatively weak assumptions on the underlying system and that non-differentiable value functions can be made differentiable by slightly "disturbing" the system.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing Controller for Safe Navigation using Control Density Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of navigating a nonlinear dynamical system from some initial set to some target set while avoiding collision with an unsafe set. We extend the concept of density function to control density function (CDF) for solving navigation problems with safety constraints. The occupancy-based interpretation of the measure associated with the density function is instrumental in imposing the safety constraints. The navigation problem with safety constraints is formulated as a quadratic program (QP) using CDF. The existing approach using the control barrier function (CBF) also formulates the navigation problem with safety constraints as QP. One of the main advantages of the proposed QP using CDF compared to QP formulated using CBF is that both the convergence/stability and safety can be combined and imposed using the CDF. Simulation results involving the Duffing oscillator and safe navigation of Dubin car models are provided to verify the main findings of the paper.</description>

      <title>Meta-learning of data-driven controllers with automatic model reference tuning: theory and experimental case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven control offers a viable option for control scenarios where constructing a system model is expensive or time-consuming. Nonetheless, many of these algorithms are not entirely automated, often necessitating the adjustment of multiple hyperparameters through cumbersome trial-and-error processes and demanding significant amounts of data. In this paper, we explore a meta-learning approach to leverage potentially existing prior knowledge about analogous (though not identical) systems, aiming to reduce both the experimental workload and ease the tuning of the available degrees of freedom. We validate this methodology through an experimental case study involving the tuning of proportional, integral (PI) controllers for brushless DC (BLDC) motors with variable loads and architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of designing output feedback controllers that use measurements from a set of landmarks to navigate through a cell-decomposable environment using duality, Control Lyapunov and Barrier Functions (CLF, CBF), and Linear Programming. We propose two objectives for navigating in an environment, one to traverse the environment by making loops and one by converging to a stabilization point while smoothing the transition between consecutive cells. We test our algorithms in a simulation environment, evaluating the robustness of the approach to practical conditions, such as bearing-only measurements, and measurements acquired with a camera with a limited field of view.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to improve the percentage of packets meeting their deadline in discrete-time M/M/1 queues with infrequent monitoring. More specifically, we look into policies that only monitor the system (and subsequently take actions) after a packet arrival. We model the system as an MDP and provide the optimal policy for some special cases. Furthermore, we introduce a heuristic algorithm called "AB-n" for general deadlines. Finally, we provide numerical results demonstrating the desirable performance of "AB-n" policies.</description>

      <title>Learning Hierarchical Control Systems for Autonomous Systems with Energy Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the design of hierarchical control architectures for autonomous systems with energy constraints. We focus on systems where energy storage limitations and slow recharge rates drastically affect the way the autonomous systems are operated. Using examples from space robotics and public transportation, we motivate the need for formally designed learning hierarchical control systems. We propose a learning control architecture which incorporates learning mechanisms at various levels of the control hierarchy to improve performance and resource utilization. The proposed hierarchical control scheme relies on high-level energy-aware task planning and assignment, complemented by a low-level predictive control mechanism responsible for the autonomous execution of tasks, including motion control and energy management. Simulation examples show the benefits and the limitations of the proposed architecture when learning is used to obtain a more energy-efficient task allocation.</description>

      <title>Control of Medical Digital Twins with Artificial Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of personalized medicine is to tailor interventions to an individual patient's unique characteristics. A key technology for this purpose involves medical digital twins, computational models of human biology that can be personalized and dynamically updated to incorporate patient-specific data collected over time. Certain aspects of human biology, such as the immune system, are not easily captured with physics-based models, such as differential equations. Instead, they are often multi-scale, stochastic, and hybrid. This poses a challenge to existing model-based control and optimization approaches that cannot be readily applied to such models. Recent advances in automatic differentiation and neural-network control methods hold promise in addressing complex control problems. However, the application of these approaches to biomedical systems is still in its early stages. This work introduces dynamics-informed neural-network controllers as an alternative approach to control of medical digital twins. As a first use case for this method, the focus is on agent-based models, a versatile and increasingly common modeling platform in biomedicine. The effectiveness of the proposed neural-network control method is illustrated and benchmarked against other methods with two widely-used agent-based model types. The relevance of the method introduced here extends beyond medical digital twins to other complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The maritime industry's continuous commitment to sustainability has led to a dedicated exploration of methods to reduce vessel fuel consumption. This paper undertakes this challenge through a machine learning approach, leveraging a real-world dataset spanning two years of a ferry in west coast Canada. Our focus centers on the creation of a time series forecasting model given the dynamic and static states, actions, and disturbances. This model is designed to predict dynamic states based on the actions provided, subsequently serving as an evaluative tool to assess the proficiency of the ferry's operation under the captain's guidance. Additionally, it lays the foundation for future optimization algorithms, providing valuable feedback on decision-making processes. To facilitate future studies, our code is available at \url{https://github.com/pagand/model_optimze_vessel/tree/AAAI}</description>

      <title>Safety-Aware Perception for Autonomous Collision Avoidance in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous collision avoidance requires accurate environmental perception; however, flight systems often possess limited sensing capabilities with field-of-view (FOV) restrictions. To navigate this challenge, we present a safety-aware approach for online determination of the optimal sensor-pointing direction $\psi_\text{d}$ which utilizes control barrier functions (CBFs). First, we generate a spatial density function $\Phi$ which leverages CBF constraints to map the collision risk of all local coordinates. Then, we convolve $\Phi$ with an attitude-dependent sensor FOV quality function to produce the objective function $\Gamma$ which quantifies the total observed risk for a given pointing direction. Finally, by finding the global optimizer for $\Gamma$, we identify the value of $\psi_\text{d}$ which maximizes the perception of risk within the FOV. We incorporate $\psi_\text{d}$ into a safety-critical flight architecture and conduct a numerical analysis using multiple simulated mission profiles. Our algorithm achieves a success rate of $88-96\%$, constituting a $16-29\%$ improvement compared to the best heuristic methods. We demonstrate the functionality of our approach via a flight demonstration using the Crazyflie 2.1 micro-quadrotor. Without a priori obstacle knowledge, the quadrotor follows a dynamic flight path while simultaneously calculating and tracking $\psi_\text{d}$ to perceive and avoid two static obstacles with an average computation time of 371 $\mu$s.</description>

      <title>Sensory Glove-Based Surgical Robot User Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic surgery has reached a high level of maturity and has become an integral part of standard surgical care. However, existing surgeon consoles are bulky and take up valuable space in the operating room, present challenges for surgical team coordination, and their proprietary nature makes it difficult to take advantage of recent technological advances, especially in virtual and augmented reality. One potential area for further improvement is the integration of modern sensory gloves into robotic platforms, allowing surgeons to control robotic arms directly with their hand movements intuitively. We propose one such system that combines an HTC Vive tracker, a Manus Meta Prime 3 XR sensory glove, and God Vision wireless smart glasses. The system controls one arm of a da Vinci surgical robot. In addition to moving the arm, the surgeon can use fingers to control the end-effector of the surgical instrument. Hand gestures are used to implement clutching and similar functions. In particular, we introduce clutching of the instrument orientation, a functionality not available in the da Vinci system. The vibrotactile elements of the glove are used to provide feedback to the user when gesture commands are invoked. A preliminary evaluation of the system shows that it has excellent tracking accuracy and allows surgeons to efficiently perform common surgical training tasks with minimal practice with the new interface; this suggests that the interface is highly intuitive. The proposed system is inexpensive, allows rapid prototyping, and opens opportunities for further innovations in the design of surgical robot interfaces.</description>

      <title>Carbon Footprint Reduction for Sustainable Data Centers in Real-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As machine learning workloads significantly increase energy consumption, sustainable data centers with low carbon emissions are becoming a top priority for governments and corporations worldwide. This requires a paradigm shift in optimizing power consumption in cooling and IT loads, shifting flexible loads based on the availability of renewable energy in the power grid, and leveraging battery storage from the uninterrupted power supply in data centers, using collaborative agents. The complex association between these optimization strategies and their dependencies on variable external factors like weather and the power grid carbon intensity makes this a hard problem. Currently, a real-time controller to optimize all these goals simultaneously in a dynamic real-world setting is lacking. We propose a Data Center Carbon Footprint Reduction (DC-CFR) multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework that optimizes data centers for the multiple objectives of carbon footprint reduction, energy consumption, and energy cost. The results show that the DC-CFR MARL agents effectively resolved the complex interdependencies in optimizing cooling, load shifting, and energy storage in real-time for various locations under real-world dynamic weather and grid carbon intensity conditions. DC-CFR significantly outperformed the industry standard ASHRAE controller with a considerable reduction in carbon emissions (14.5%), energy usage (14.4%), and energy cost (13.7%) when evaluated over one year across multiple geographical regions.</description>

Abstract: Matrix analysis plays a crucial role in the field of control engineering, providing a powerful mathematical framework for the analysis and design of control systems. This research report explores various applications of matrix analysis in control engineering, focusing on its contributions to system modeling, stability analysis, controllablity, observability, and optimization. The report also discusses specific examples and case studies to illustrate the practical significance of matrix analysis in addressing real-world control engineering challenges Analyze controllability. Informally, a system is controllable if we can construct a set of inputs that will drive the system to any given state. Analyze observability. Informally, observability means that by controlling the inputs and watching the outputs of a system we can determine what the states were. Optimal Control is a control method that aims to find the optimal control input to achieve the best performance of the system under certain constraints. This performance index can be the system output, energy consumption, time, etc.</description>

      <title>Constrained Reinforcement Learning with Smoothed Log Barrier Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely applied to many control tasks and substantially improved the performances compared to conventional control methods in many domains where the reward function is well defined. However, for many real-world problems, it is often more convenient to formulate optimization problems in terms of rewards and constraints simultaneously. Optimizing such constrained problems via reward shaping can be difficult as it requires tedious manual tuning of reward functions with several interacting terms. Recent formulations which include constraints mostly require a pre-training phase, which often needs human expertise to collect data or assumes having a sub-optimal policy readily available. We propose a new constrained RL method called CSAC-LB (Constrained Soft Actor-Critic with Log Barrier Function), which achieves competitive performance without any pre-training by applying a linear smoothed log barrier function to an additional safety critic. It implements an adaptive penalty for policy learning and alleviates the numerical issues that are known to complicate the application of the log barrier function method. As a result, we show that with CSAC-LB, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on several constrained control tasks with different levels of difficulty and evaluate our methods in a locomotion task on a real quadruped robot platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel data-driven hierarchical control scheme for managing a fleet of nonlinear, capacity-constrained autonomous agents in an iterative environment. We propose a control framework consisting of a high-level dynamic task assignment and routing layer and low-level motion planning and tracking layer. Each layer of the control hierarchy uses a data-driven MPC policy, maintaining bounded computational complexity at each calculation of a new task assignment or actuation input. We utilize collected data to iteratively refine estimates of agent capacity usage, and update MPC policy parameters accordingly. Our approach leverages tools from iterative learning control to integrate learning at both levels of the hierarchy, and coordinates learning between levels in order to maintain closed-loop feasibility and performance improvement of the connected architecture.</description>

      <title>SDP Synthesis of Maximum Coverage Trees for Probabilistic Planning under Control Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents Maximal Covariance Backward Reachable Trees (MAXCOVAR BRT), which is a multi-query algorithm for planning of dynamic systems under stochastic motion uncertainty and constraints on the control input with explicit coverage guarantees. In contrast to existing roadmap-based probabilistic planning methods that sample belief nodes randomly and draw edges between them \cite{csbrm_tro2024}, under control constraints, the reachability of belief nodes needs to be explicitly established and is determined by checking the feasibility of a non-convex program. Moreover, there is no explicit consideration of coverage of the roadmap while adding nodes and edges during the construction procedure for the existing methods. Our contribution is a novel optimization formulation to add nodes and construct the corresponding edge controllers such that the generated roadmap results in provably maximal coverage under control constraints as compared to any other method of adding nodes and edges. We characterize formally the notion of coverage of a roadmap in this stochastic domain via introduction of the h-$\operatorname{BRS}$ (Backward Reachable Set of Distributions) of a tree of distributions under control constraints, and also support our method with extensive simulations on a 6 DoF model.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of stabilizing a leader-follower formation specified by a set of bearing constraints and being disturbed by unknown uniformly bounded disturbance. A set of leaders are positioned at the desired positions, while each follower agent is modeled by a single integrator with disturbance of which the upper bound is unavailable for the control design. Adaptive variable-structure formation control laws using only displacements or bearing vectors are provided to stabilize the agents to a desired formation. Thanks to the adaptive mechanism, the control laws require neither the information of the bearing Laplacian nor the directions and the upper bounds of the disturbance. It is further proved that when the leaders are moving with the same bounded uniformly continuous velocity, the moving target formation can still be achieved under the proposed control laws. Simulation results are also given to support the stability analysis.</description>

      <title>Application of tropical optimization for solving multicriteria problems of pairwise comparisons using log-Chebyshev approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a decision-making problem to find absolute ratings of alternatives that are compared in pairs under multiple criteria, subject to constraints in the form of two-sided bounds on ratios between the ratings. Given matrices of pairwise comparisons made according to the criteria, the problem is formulated as the log-Chebyshev approximation of these matrices by a common consistent matrix (a symmetrically reciprocal matrix of unit rank) to minimize the approximation errors for all matrices simultaneously. We rearrange the approximation problem as a constrained multiobjective optimization problem of finding a vector that determines the approximating consistent matrix. The problem is then represented in the framework of tropical algebra, which deals with the theory and applications of idempotent semirings and provides a formal basis for fuzzy and interval arithmetic. We apply methods and results of tropical optimization to develop a new approach for handling the multiobjective optimization problem according to various principles of optimality. New complete solutions in the sense of the max-ordering, lexicographic ordering and lexicographic max-ordering optimality are obtained, which are given in a compact vector form ready for formal analysis and efficient computation. We present numerical examples of solving multicriteria problems of rating four alternatives from pairwise comparisons to illustrate the technique and compare it with others.</description>

      <title>Deep learning reduces sensor requirements for gust rejection on a small uncrewed aerial vehicle morphing wing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a growing need for uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) to operate in cities. However, the uneven urban landscape and complex street systems cause large-scale wind gusts that challenge the safe and effective operation of UAVs. Current gust alleviation methods rely on traditional control surfaces and computationally expensive modeling to select a control action, leading to a slower response. Here, we used deep reinforcement learning to create an autonomous gust alleviation controller for a camber-morphing wing. This method reduced gust impact by 84%, directly from real-time, on-board pressure signals. Notably, we found that gust alleviation using signals from only three pressure taps was statistically indistinguishable from using six signals. This reduced-sensor fly-by-feel control opens the door to UAV missions in previously inoperable locations.</description>

      <title>Input-output linearization and decoupling of mechanical control systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a problem of simultaneous input-output feedback linearization and decoupling (non-interacting) for mechanical control systems with outputs. We show that the natural requirement of preserving mechanical structure of the system and of transformations imposes supplementary conditions when compared to the classical solution of the same problem for general control systems. These conditions can be expressed using objects on the configuration space only. We illustrate our results with several examples of mechanical control systems.</description>

      <title>Tropical modeling of battery swapping and charging station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and investigate a queueing model of a battery swapping and charging station (BSCS) for electric vehicles (EVs). A new approach to the analysis of the queueing model is developed, which combines the representation of the model as a stochastic dynamic system with the use of the methods and results of tropical algebra, which deals with the theory and applications of algebraic systems with idempotent operations. We describe the dynamics of the queueing model by a system of recurrence equations that involve random variables (RVs) to represent the interarrival time of incoming EVs. A performance measure for the model is defined as the mean operation cycle time of the station. Furthermore, the system of equations is represented in terms of the tropical algebra in vector form as an implicit linear state dynamic equation. The performance measure takes on the meaning of the mean growth rate of the state vector (the Lyapunov exponent) of the dynamic system. By applying a solution technique of vector equations in tropical algebra, the implicit equation is transformed into an explicit one with a state transition matrix with random entries. The evaluation of the Lyapunov exponent reduces to finding the limit of the expected value of norms of tropical matrix products. This limit is then obtained using results from the tropical spectral theory of deterministic and random matrices. With this approach, we derive a new exact formula for the mean cycle time of the BSCS, which is given in terms of the expected value of the RVs involved. We present the results of the Monte Carlo simulation of the BSCS's operation, which show a good agreement with the exact solution. The application of the obtained solution to evaluate the performance of one BSCS and to find the optimal distribution of battery packs between stations in a network of BSCSs is discussed.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Electrical Interface for Large-Scale Color-Center Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum processors based on color centers in diamond are promising candidates for future large-scale quantum computers thanks to their flexible optical interface, (relatively) high operating temperature, and high-fidelity operation. Similar to other quantum-computing platforms, the electrical interface required to control and read out such qubits may limit both the performance of the whole system and its scalability. To address this challenge, this work analyzes the requirements of the electrical interface and investigates how to efficiently implement the electronic controller in a scalable architecture comprising a large number of identical unit cells. Among the different discussed functionalities, a specific focus is devoted to the generation of the static and dynamic magnetic fields driving the electron and nuclear spins, because of their major impact on fidelity and scalability. Following the derived requirements, different system architectures, such as a qubit frequency-multiplexing scheme, are considered to identify the most power efficient approach, especially in the presence of inhomogeneity of the qubit Larmor frequency across the processor. As a result, a non-frequency-multiplexed, 1-mm$^2$ unit-cell architecture is proposed as the optimal solution, able to address up to one electron-spin qubit and 9 nuclear-spin qubits within a 3-mW average power consumption, thus establishing the baseline for the scalable electrical interface for future large-scale color-center quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Attacks and Defenses in Automated Control Systems: A Comprehensive Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating machine learning into Automated Control Systems (ACS) enhances decision-making in industrial process management. One of the limitations to the widespread adoption of these technologies in industry is the vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial attacks. This study explores the threats in deploying deep learning models for fault diagnosis in ACS using the Tennessee Eastman Process dataset. By evaluating three neural networks with different architectures, we subject them to six types of adversarial attacks and explore five different defense methods. Our results highlight the strong vulnerability of models to adversarial samples and the varying effectiveness of defense strategies. We also propose a novel protection approach by combining multiple defense methods and demonstrate it's efficacy. This research contributes several insights into securing machine learning within ACS, ensuring robust fault diagnosis in industrial processes.</description>
