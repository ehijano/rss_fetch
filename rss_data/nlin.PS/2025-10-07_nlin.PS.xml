      <title>Field observation of soliton gases in the deep open ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soliton gases are large ensembles of random solitons with distinct characteristics arising from integrable system dynamics. They have been widely studied in theory and experiments, and were observed in natural lagoons. However, it remains an open question whether they occur naturally in the open ocean. Nonlinear ocean states containing solitons have been observed in the literature, but the dominance of solitons over other wave components required for a soliton gas has not been demonstrated. Our study provides the first field evidence of soliton gas sea states in the deep ocean, measured in Taiwan waters. The soliton energy ratio derived from the nonlinear Fourier transform (NFT) is employed as a key parameter to quantify how close sea states are to soliton gases. We identify eleven measurements with extremely high soliton energy ratios. They are characterized by short-period waves with relatively small wave heights, accompanied by extreme steepness and Benjamin-Feir Index (BFI) values. These states are exceptionally rare, representing only 0.054 percent of our dataset. Since directional interference can artificially increase the soliton energy ratio, we furthermore apply a probabilistic directional filtering method to remove the directional interference. Three wave records from the Eluanbi station are found to retain high soliton energy ratios after the directional interference has been removed, confirming that they are indeed soliton gases.</description>

      <title>XG-Attention-WGAN PIC: Utilizing XGboost-Attention-WGAN for Photonics Integrated Circuit Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) are fundamental for optical computing, communication, quantum information processing, and precision sensing. However, traditional numerical simulations for designing PIC components are computationally intensive and struggle with high-dimensional parameter spaces. This paper introduces XG-Attention-WGAN PIC, a novel framework that synergistically combines Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs) with eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to enhance parameter prediction and inverse design in PICs. We utilize Finite-Difference Time-Domain simulations to generate high-fidelity training data, which is augmented by WGAN-generated synthetic data, yielding a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.26089. When integrated with XGBoost, this error is reduced to 0.008. The integration of a 64-head self-attention mechanism within the WGAN generator significantly improves data quality and model efficiency over 1000 training epochs. Demonstrated on microring resonators, our approach not only achieves superior prediction accuracy and design optimization but also autonomously discovers a novel, experimentally realizable geometry with enhanced Q-factor performance. The proposed framework provides a scalable, data-driven strategy for developing high-performance PIC components, with promising implications for quantum computing and advanced optical systems.</description>

      <title>Roton-mediated soliton bound states in binary dipolar condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of bound states between dark-antidark solitary waves in two-component dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates. The excitation spectrum contains density and spin branches, and a rotonic feature of the spin branch enables long-range soliton interactions, giving rise to multiple bound states for a single pair, each with a distinct separation. We show that these bound states originate from periodic modulations of the inter-soliton potential, while individual solitons are surrounded by spatial spin-density oscillations. Both features provide direct signatures of the spin roton. Collisions between unbound solitons probe this potential, with dipolar interactions enforcing universal bouncing at low velocities, independent of soliton sign, whereas nondipolar solitons may either transmit or bounce. This distinct behavior offers a realistic path to confirming spin rotons experimentally.</description>

      <title>Long-time behaviour of sphalerons in $\phi^4$ models with a false vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sphalerons in nonlinear Klein-Gordon models are unstable lump-like solutions that arise from a saddle point between true and false vacua in the energy functional. Numerical simulations are presented which show the sphaleron evolving into an accelerating kink-antikink pair whose separation approaches the speed of light asymptotically at large times. Utilizing a nonlinear collective coordinate method, an approximate analytical solution is derived for this evolution. These results indicate that an exact solution is expected to exhibit a gradient blow-up for large times,caused by energy concentrating at the flanks of the kink-antikink pair.</description>

      <title>One- and two-dimensional solitons under the action of the inverted cubic-quintic nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The usual cubic-quintic (CQ) nonlinearity is proved to sustain one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) broad (flat-top) solitons. In this work, we demonstrate that 1D and 2D soliton families can be supported, in the semi-infinite bandgap (SIBG), by the interplay of a lattice potential and the nonlinearity including self-defocusing cubic and self-focusing quintic terms, with the sign combination inverted with respect to the usual CQ nonlinearity. The families include fundamental and dipole solitons in 1D, and fundamental, quadrupole, and vortex solitons in 2D. The power, shapes, and stability of the solitons are reported. The results are strongly affected by the positions of the solitons in SIBG, the families being unstable very close to or very far from the SIBG's edge. The inverted CQ nonlinearity, considered in this work, sustains sharp 1D and 2D stable solitons, which can be naturally used as bit pixels in photonic data-processing applications.</description>

      <title>Active pattern formation emergent from single-species nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions violating Newton's third law are common in a plethora of nonequilibrium situations ranging from predator-prey systems to the swarming of birds and effective colloidal interactions under flow. While many recent studies have focused on two species with nonreciprocal coupling, less is examined for the basic single-component system breaking the actio and reactio equality of force within the same species. Here, we systematically derive a field theory for the case of single-species nonreciprocal interactions from the microscopic particle dynamics, leading to a generic continuum model termed Active Model N (N denoting nonreciprocity). We explore the rich dynamics of pattern formation in this nonreciprocal system and the emergence of self-traveling states with persistent variation and flowing of active branched patterns. One particular new characteristic pattern is an interwoven self-knitting "yarn" structure with a unique feature of simultaneous development of micro- and bulk phase separations. The growth dynamics of a "ball-of-wool" active droplet towards these self-knitted yarn or branched states exhibits a crossover between different scaling behaviors. The mechanism underlying this distinct class of active phase separation is attributed to the interplay between nonreciprocity and competition of interparticle forces. Our predictions can be applied to various biological and artificial active matter systems controlled by single-species nonreciprocity.</description>

      <title>Magnetic monopoles with an internal degree of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of spontaneously broken $SU(2)$ gauge theories with adjoint scalar and look for exact magnetic monopole solutions in the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) limit. We find that some of the resulting solutions exhibit a new internal degree of freedom (a moduli space parameter) that controls the energy density profile of the monopole while keeping the total energy (mass) constant.</description>
