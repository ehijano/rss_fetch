      <title>Correcting model error bias in estimations of neuronal dynamics from time series observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuron models built from experimental data have successfully predicted observed voltage oscillations within and beyond training range. A tantalising prospect is the possibility of estimating the unobserved dynamics of ion channels which is largely inaccessible to experiment, from membrane voltage recordings. The main roadblock here is our lack of knowledge of the equations governing biological neurons which forces us to rely on surrogate models and parameter estimates biassed by model error. Error correction algorithms are therefore needed to infer both observed and unobserved dynamics, and ultimately the actual parameters of a biological neuron. Here we use a recurrent neural network to correct the outputs of a surrogate Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model. The reservoir-surrogate HH model hybrid was trained on the voltage oscillations of a reference HH model and its driving current waveform. Out of the six reservoir-surrogate model architectures investigated, we identify one that most accurately recovers the reference membrane voltage and ion channel dynamics. The reservoir was thus effective in correcting model error in an externally driven nonlinear oscillator and in reconstructing the dynamics of both observed and unobserved state variables from the reference model mimicking an actual neuron.</description>

      <title>Alljoined-1.6M: A Million-Trial EEG-Image Dataset for Evaluating Affordable Brain-Computer Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new large-scale electroencephalography (EEG) dataset as part of the THINGS initiative, comprising over 1.6 million visual stimulus trials collected from 20 participants, and totaling more than twice the size of the most popular current benchmark dataset, THINGS-EEG2. Crucially, our data was recorded using a 32-channel consumer-grade wet electrode system costing ~$2.2k, around 27x cheaper than research-grade EEG systems typically used in cognitive neuroscience labs. Our work is one of the first open-source, large-scale EEG resource designed to closely reflect the quality of hardware that is practical to deploy in real-world, downstream applications of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). We aim to explore the specific question of whether deep neural network-based BCI research and semantic decoding methods can be effectively conducted with such affordable systems, filling an important gap in current literature that is extremely relevant for future research. In our analysis, we not only demonstrate that decoding of high-level semantic information from EEG of visualized images is possible at consumer-grade hardware, but also that our data can facilitate effective EEG-to-Image reconstruction even despite significantly lower signal-to-noise ratios. In addition to traditional benchmarks, we also conduct analyses of EEG-to-Image models that demonstrate log-linear decoding performance with increasing data volume on our data, and discuss the trade-offs between hardware cost, signal fidelity, and the scale of data collection efforts in increasing the size and utility of currently available datasets. Our contributions aim to pave the way for large-scale, cost-effective EEG research with widely accessible equipment, and position our dataset as a unique resource for the democratization and development of effective deep neural models of visual cognition.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Fidelity for Functional Neural Network Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuroscientists face challenges in analyzing high-dimensional neural recording data of dense functional networks. Without ground-truth reference data, finding the best algorithm for recovering neurologically relevant networks remains an open question. We implemented hybrid quantum algorithms to construct functional networks and compared them with the results of documented classical techniques. We demonstrated that our quantum state fidelity methods can provide competitive alternatives to classical metrics by revealing distinct functional networks. Our results suggest that quantum computing offers a viable and potentially advantageous alternative for data-driven modeling in neuroscience, underscoring its broader applicability in high-dimensional graph inference and complex system analysis.</description>
