      <title>Geometric Quantum States Beyond AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the quantum states dual to entanglement wedges in arbitrary spacetimes, in settings where the matter entropy can be neglected compared to the geometric entropy. In AdS/CFT, such states obey special entropy inequalities known as the holographic entropy cone. In particular, the mutual information of CFT subregions is monogamous (MMI). We extend this result to arbitrary spacetimes, using a recent proposal for the generalized entanglement wedge e(a) of a gravitating region a. Given independent input regions a, b, and c, we prove MMI: Area[e(a)]+Area[e(b)]+Area[e(c)]-Area[e(ab)]-Area[e(bc)]-Area[e(ca)]+Area[e(abc)] $\leq$ 0. We expect that the full holographic entropy cone can be extended to arbitrary spacetimes using similar methods.</description>

      <title>Pions from higher-dimensional gluons: general realizations and stringy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit the general phenomenon that scattering amplitudes of pions can be obtained from "dimensional reduction" of gluons in higher dimensions in a more general context. We show that such "dimensional reduction" operations universally turn gluons into pions regardless of details of interactions: under such operations any amplitude that is gauge invariant and contains only local simple poles becomes one that satisfies Adler zero in the soft limit. As two such examples, we show that starting from gluon amplitudes in both superstring and bosonic string theories, the operations produce "stringy" completion of pion scattering amplitudes to all orders in $\alpha'$, with leading order given by non-linear sigma model amplitudes. Via Kawai-Lewellen-Tye relations, they give closed-stringy completion for Born-Infeld theory and the special Galileon theory, which are directly related to gravity amplitudes in closed-string theories. We also discuss how they naturally produce stringy models for mixed amplitudes of pions and colored scalars.</description>

      <title>On the Geometry of N=2 Minkowski Vacua of Gauged N=2 Supergravity Theories in Four Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauging isometries of four-dimensional N=2 supergravity theories yields an N=2 supersymmetric theory with a scalar potential. In this note, we study the well-known constraints for four-dimensional N=2 Minkowski vacua of such theories. We propose that classically a projective special K\"ahler submanifold of the projective K\"ahler target space of the ungauged theory describes the moduli space of the complex scalar fields of massless vector multiplets for N=2 Minkowski vacua configurations, which then receives quantum corrections from integrating out massive fields. Subloci of projective special K\"ahler manifolds appear as supersymmetric flux vacua in the context of type IIB Calabi-Yau threefold compactifications with background fluxes as well. While these flux vacua equations arise from the critical locus of an N=1 superpotential, we show that these equations can also be obtained from the N=2 supersymmetric Minkowski vacuum equations of gauged N=2 supergravity theories upon gauging suitable isometries in the semi-classical universal hypermultiplet sector of type IIB string Calabi-Yau threefold compactifications. Thus, we give an intrinsic N=2 supersymmetric interpretation to the flux vacua equations.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Symmetry Preserving Gapped Phases from Coupling Constant Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we will characterize constraints on the possible IR phases of a given QFT by anomalies in the space of coupling constants. We will give conditions under which a coupling constant anomaly cannot be matched by a continuous family of symmetry preserving gapped phases, in which case the theory is either gapless, or exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking or a phase transition. We additionally demonstrate examples of theories with coupling constant anomalies which can be matched by a family of symmetry preserving gapped phases without a phase transition and comment on the interpretation of our results for the spontaneous breaking of "$(-1)$-form global symmetries."</description>

      <title>What if string theory has a de Sitter excited state?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose precise effective field theory criteria to obtain a four-dimensional de Sitter space within M-theory. To this effect, starting with the state space described by the action of metric perturbations, fluxes etc over the supersymmetric Minkowski vacuum in eleven-dimensions, we discuss the most general low energy effective action in terms of the eleven-dimensional fields including non-perturbative and non-local terms. Given this, our criteria to obtain a valid four-dimensional de Sitter solution at far IR involve satisfying the Schwinger-Dyson equations of the associated path integral, as well as obeying positivity constraints on the dual IIA string coupling and its time derivative. For excited states, the Schwinger-Dyson equations imply an effective emergent potential different from the original potential. We show that while vacuum solutions and arbitrary coherent states fail to satisfy these criteria, a specific class of excited states called the Glauber-Sudarshan states obey them. Using the resurgent structure of observables computed using the path integral over the Glauber-Sudarshan states, four-dimensional de Sitter in the flat slicing can be constructed using a Glauber-Sudarshan state in M-theory.
  Among other novel results, we discuss the smallness of the positive cosmological constant, including the curious case where the cosmological constant is very slowly varying with time. We also discuss the resolution of identity with the Glauber-Sudarshan states, generation and the convergence properties of the non-perturbative and the non-local effects, the problems with the static patch and other related topics. We analyze briefly the issues related to the compatibility of the Wilsonian effective action with Borel resummations and discuss how they influence the effective field theory description in a four-dimensional de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>On the electromagnetic interaction and the anomalous term in the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of vectorial mesons embedded in an electromagnetic field via Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) formalism is reinvestigated. Considering the electromagnetic interaction as a minimal coupling, an incorrect value $(g=1)$ is identified for the gyromagnetic factor ($g$-factor). Furthermore, it is shown that is cumbersome to find analytical solutions due to the presence of the so-called anomalous term for the spin-1 sector of the DKP theory. Suspecting that the anomalous term results from an incomplete version of the DKP equation to describe the electromagnetic interaction, we consider the addition of a non-minimal coupling. This leads to the correct $g$-factor $(g=2)$, and as a consequence, the anomalous term becomes proportional to an external four current. As an application, the DKP equation with a static uniform magnetic field is considered, yielding the corresponding Landau levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work deals with Abelian Chern-Simons vortices interacting with magnetic impurities. We compute static solutions with winding numbers zero and one. Then, we develop a numerical algorithm to simulate their collisions. Collisions between a vortex with winding number two and a magnetic impurity are also performed. All scattering results are interpreted in terms of the moduli space approximation and compared with the Abelian Maxwell-Higgs model.</description>

      <title>On Machine Learning Complete Intersection Calabi-Yau 3-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression, Kernel Support Vector Regression, the random forest, extreme gradient boosting and the generalized linear model algorithms are applied to data of Complete Intersection Calabi-Yau 3-folds. It is shown that Gaussian process regression is the most suitable for learning the Hodge number h^(2,1)in terms of h^(1,1). The performance of this regression algorithm is such that the Pearson correlation coefficient for the validation set is R^2 = 0.9999999995 with a Root Mean Square Error RMSE = 0.0002895011. As for the calibration set, these two parameters are as follows: R^2 = 0.9999999994 and RMSE = 0.0002854348. The training error and the cross-validation error of this regression are 10^(-9) and 1.28 * 10^(-7), respectively. Learning the Hodge number h^(1,1)in terms of h^(2,1) yields R^2 = 1.000000 and RMSE = 7.395731 * 10^(-5) for the validation set of the Gaussian Process regression.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Renormalization for Quantum Field Theories with Discrete Wavelet Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an adaptation of Entanglement Renormalization for quantum field theories that, through the use of discrete wavelet transforms, strongly parallels the tensor network architecture of the \emph{Multiscale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz} (a.k.a. MERA). Our approach, called wMERA, has several advantages of over previous attempts to adapt MERA to continuum systems. In particular, (i) wMERA is formulated directly in position space, hence preserving the quasi-locality and sparsity of entanglers; and (ii) it enables a built-in RG flow in the implementation of real-time evolution and in computations of correlation functions, which is key for efficient numerical implementations. As examples, we describe in detail two concrete implementations of our wMERA algorithm for free scalar and fermionic theories in (1+1) spacetime dimensions. Possible avenues for constructing wMERAs for interacting field theories are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Casimir Effect and Holographic Dual of Wedges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Casimir effect of a wedge and its holographic dual. We prove that the displacement operator universally determines the wedge Casimir effect in the smooth limit. Besides, we argue that the wedge Casimir energy increases with the opening angle and test it with several examples. Furthermore, we construct the holographic dual of wedges in AdS/BCFT in general dimensions. We verify that our proposal can produce universal relations within smooth and singular limits. We find that the negative brane tension tends to yield smaller wedge Casimir energy. Next, we discuss the wedge contribution to holographic entanglement entropy and find it increases with the opening angle, similar to the wedge Casimir energy. Finally, we briefly discuss the holographic polygon in AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$ and its generalization to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Nakanishi covariant operator formalism for higher derivative systems: Vector spin-$0$ dual model as a prelude to generalized QED$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we extend the Kugo-Ojima-Nakanishi covariant operator formalism to quantize two higher derivative systems, taking into account their extended phase space structures. More specifically, the one describing spin-$0$ particles by a vector field and the generalized electrodynamics. We investigate the commutator structure of these theories and present the definition of their physical Hilbert subspaces. Remarkably, the establishment of a second-class nature for the primary constraints of such models demands a higher derivative structure for the auxiliary field Lagrangian following previous claims. Regarding the first model, it presents a reducible gauge symmetry implying the necessity of two sets of auxiliary fields. We also discuss its massless limit. For the case of the generalized QED$_4$, we derive a set of suitable definitions for the positive-definite Hilbert subspace in order to eliminate contributions from spurious modes and also the problematic negative norm transverse excitation. We show that the Hamiltonian operator taken within the domain of this subspace presents no instabilities. Finally, a set of discussions on the interacting regime are developed to ensure that the scattering processes restricted to the physical Hilbert subspace remain unitary even at this context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define a model of non-interacting quantum fields satisfying $(\Delta_g-\lambda^2)\phi=0$ on a Riemannian scattering space $(M,g)$ with two boundary components, i.e. a manifold with two asymptotically conic ends (meaning asymptotic to the "large end" of a cone). Our main result describes a canonical construction of two-point functions satisfying a version of the Hadamard condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the last of the series investigating renormalization group aspects of stochastic random matrices, including a Wigner-like disorder. We consider the equilibrium dynamics formalism that can be merged with the Ward identities arising from the large N effective kinetics. We construct a regulator that does not break time-reversal symmetry and show that the resulting flow equations reduce to the equilibrium flow built in our previous works. Finally, we investigate the flow equations beyond the equilibrium dynamics assumption and study the stability of the perturbation around the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Inflation and Dark Sector from 11D Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore compactifications of the form of three tori and one circle in the framework of 11D supergravity. By imposing suitable gauge conditions and boundary conditions, we find that the four-dimensional FRW universe emerges as a solution representing cosmological D3-branes in the eleven-dimensional bulk. These specific compactification methods can produce cosmological inflation that aligns with the observational constraints set by the 2021 BICEP/Keck and Planck 2018 results. In the cosmological inflation models we construct, the inflaton can be interpreted as the conformal vibrations of extra dimensions with a size around 10^5 times the reduced Planck length. Additionally, we offer the theoretical predictions for the mass of the inflaton, and the tree-level Newton's gravity law between two massive point particles surrounded by a spherically symmetric distribution of the inflaton, which can reproduce the Tully-Fisher relation and explain the flat rotation curves of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Odd-Derivative Couplings in Heterotic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, our focus is on exploring the gauge invariant basis for bosonic couplings within the framework of heterotic string theories, specifically examining 3-, 5-, and 7-derivative terms. We thoroughly analyze the invariance of these couplings under T-duality transformations and make a notable observation: the T-duality constraint enforces the vanishing of these couplings. We speculate that this result likely holds true for all higher odd-derivative couplings as well. This is unlike the result in type I superstring theory, where, for example, the couplings of 5 Yang-Mills field strength are non-zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing interest in celestial holography, which is holography in asymptotic flat spacetimes. This holographic duality exhibits numerous mysterious and fruitful features, particularly on the dual CFT side. In this paper, we present the candidate of dual CFT of Minkowski spacetime extracted from $SL(2,\mathbb{C})/SU(2)\cong H^+_3$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model, the simplest non-compact CFT. We demonstrate that it reproduces the well-known principal series and correlation functions dual to the bulk scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A solitonic ground state called a chiral soliton lattice (CSL) is realized in a supersymmetric theory with background magnetic field and finite chemical potential. To this end, we construct, in the superfield formalism, a supersymmetric chiral sine-Gordon model as a neutral pion sector of a supersymmetric two-flavor chiral Lagrangian with a Wess-Zumino-Witten term. The CSL ground state appears in the presence of either a strong magnetic field and/or large chemical potential, or a background fermionic condensate in the form of a fermion bilinear consisting of the gaugino and a superpartner of a baryon gauge field.</description>

      <title>Higgs Inflation in Unimodular Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of Higgs mechanism within the context of spontaneous symmetry breaking has offered a new perspective on the early time cosmic inflation and also on the relationship between elementary particles and dark energy, believed to drive the universe's accelerating expansion. We suggest an inflation scenario driven by the Higgs boson within the framework of unimodular gravity, where the Higgs field acts as the inflaton and has a significant non-minimal coupling to the gravity. We present a detailed analysis of the problem in the Jordan and then Einstein frame for a unimodular Higgs inflation, followed by a comparison of our findings with the Cosmic Microwave Background observations made by the Planck Collaboration and other joint data sets. Therefore, new constraints are imposed on the non-minimal coupling parameter, $\xi$, by determining the magnitudes required for effective cosmic inflation. We demonstrate that a substantial non-minimal coupling of order $\xi\sim 10^{2}-10^{4}$ is required for this model to match with the observed primordial spectrum.</description>

      <title>Functional formulation of quantum theory of a scalar field in a metric with Lorentzian and Euclidean signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum field theory (QFT) in its functional formulation. In this approach quantum correlation functions can be expressed as classical expectation values over (complex) stochastic processes. We obtain a stochastic representation of the Schr\"odinger time evolution on Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) states by means of the Wiener integral. We discuss QFT in a flat expanding metric and in de Sitter space-time. We calculate the evolution kernel in an expanding flat metric in the real time formulation. We discuss a field interaction in pseudoRiemannian and Riemannian metrics showing that an inversion of the signature leads to some substantial simplifications of the singularity problems in QFT.</description>

      <title>Ward Identities in a Two-Dimensional Gravitational Model: Anomalous Amplitude Revisited Using a Completely Regularization-Independent Mathematical Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of the anomalous gravitational amplitude in a simple two-dimensional model with Weyl fermions. We employ a mathematical strategy that completely avoids any regularization prescription for handling divergent perturbative amplitudes. This strategy relies solely on the validity of the linearity of the integration operation and avoids modifying the amplitudes during intermediate calculations, unlike studies using regularization methods. Additionally, we adopt arbitrary routings for internal loop momenta, representing the most general analysis scenario. As expected, we show that surface terms play a crucial role in both preserving the symmetry properties of the amplitude and ensuring the mathematical consistency of the results. Notably, our final perturbative amplitude can be converted into the form obtained using any specific regularization prescription. We consider three common scenarios, one of which recovers the traditional results for gravitational anomalies. However, we demonstrate that this scenario inevitably breaks the linearity of integration, leading to an undesirable mathematical situation. This clean and transparent conclusion, enabled by the general nature of our strategy, would not be apparent in similar studies using regularization techniques.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we discuss how to use arborescent knots to construct entangled multi-qubit states. We show that Bell-states, GHZ-states and cluster states can be constructed from such knots. The latter are particularly interesting since they form a base for the measurement-based quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore new aspects of internal fermionic shifting symmetries, present in physical systems such as free Dirac spinors and p-form tensor-spinor fields. We propose a novel procedure to gauge these global symmetries, which also introduces a new St\"uckelberg mechanism to give a mass to free fermionic fields. Furthermore, we find new magnetic fermionic symmetries in these physical systems whose charged objects are disorder operators. For the case of a Dirac spinor, we discuss an dual description, where the magnetic symmetry acts on the holonomies of a dual 2-form tensor-spinor. Further generalizations such as higher-group-like structures are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a quantum scalar field in a classical (Euclidean) De Sitter background, whose radius is fixed dynamically by Einstein's equations. In the case of a free scalar, it has been shown by Becker and Reuter that if one regulates the quantum effective action by putting a cutoff $N$ on the modes of the quantum field, the radius is driven dynamically to infinity when $N$ tends to infinity. We show that this result holds also in the case of a self-interacting scalar, both in the symmetric and broken-symmetry phase. Furthermore, when the gravitational background is put on shell, the quantum corrections to the mass and quartic self-coupling are found to be finite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper (Heras in $\href{https://doi.org/10.1140/epjp/s13360-023-03914-5}{{\rm Eur. Phys. J. Plus\, 138: 329, 2023}}$), we have demonstrated that when a dyon encircles an infinitely long solenoid enclosing electric and magnetic fluxes, its wave function accumulates a quantum phase invariant under electromagnetic duality transformations. In this paper, we show that this phase, in conjunction with the Witten effect, gives rise to a topological phase proportional to the vacuum angle $\theta$ and thereby connected with CP violation. We show that this phase becomes quantised in a vacuum state $\delta_{\theta}=n\theta$ and that the most general vacuum state associated with this quantisation identifies with an Abelian form of the $\theta$-vacua. We discuss two hypothetical interference effects in the vacuum where the angle $\theta$ could manifest.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Raychaudhuri equation remains invariant for certain solutions of scalar fields $\phi$ whose Lagrangian is non-canonical and of the form $\mathcal{L}(X,\phi)=-V(\phi)F(X)$, with $X=\frac{1}{2} g_{\mu\nu} \nabla^{\mu}\phi \nabla^{\nu} \phi$, $V(\phi)$ the potential. Solutions exist for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous fields and are reminiscent of inflaton scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Field Theory Axiverse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion and axion-like particles (ALPs) are a prominent candidate for physics beyond the Standard Model, and can play an important role in cosmology, serving as dark matter or dark energy, or both, drawing motivation in part from the string theory axiverse. Axion-like particles (ALPs) can also arise as composite degrees of freedom following chiral symmetry breaking in a dark confining gauge theory, analogous to the Standard Model (SM) pion. A dark sector with arbitrary $N_f$ flavors of dark quarks leads to $N_f^2-1$ axion-like states, effectively a field theory axiverse (or '$\pi$-axiverse'). A portal to the visible sector can be achieved through the standard kinetic mixing between the dark photon and SM photon, generating millicharges for the dark quarks and consequently couplings, both parity-even and parity-odd, between the SM and the dark pions. This scenario has been studied for the $N_f=2$ case and more recently for a dark Standard Model with $N_f=6$. In this work, we study the spectrum of this field theory axiverse for an arbitrary number of flavors, and apply this to the example $N_f=10$. We calculate the couplings to the SM photon analogous to the conventional axion-photon coupling, including the $N_f$ and $N_c$ dependence, and compute the present and future constraints on the $N_f=10$, $N_c=3$, $\pi$-axiverse. We elucidate the accompanying 'bary-verse' of superheavy dark baryons, namely an ensemble of charged and neutral dark baryons with a mass set by the dark pion decay constant.</description>

      <title>Mass-Assisted Local Deconfinement in a Confined $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confinement is a prominent phenomenon in condensed matter and high-energy physics that has recently become the focus of quantum-simulation experiments of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). As such, a theoretical understanding of the effect of confinement on LGT dynamics is not only of fundamental importance, but can lend itself to upcoming experiments. Here, we show how confinement in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT can be \textit{locally} avoided by proximity to a resonance between the fermion mass and the electric field strength. Furthermore, we show that this local deconfinement can become global for certain initial conditions, where information transport occurs over the entire chain. In addition, we show how this can lead to strong quantum many-body scarring starting in different initial states. Our findings provide deeper insights into the nature of confinement in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs and can be tested on current and near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Dirac spin liquid as an "unnecessary" quantum critical point on square lattice antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of quantum matter especially pertinent to many modern condensed matter systems. Dirac spin liquids (DSLs) are a class of gapless quantum spin liquids that do not have a quasi-particle description and are potentially realized in a wide variety of spin $1/2$ magnetic systems on $2d$ lattices. In particular, the DSL in square lattice spin-$1/2$ magnets is described at low energies by $(2+1)d$ quantum electrodynamics with $N_f=4$ flavors of massless Dirac fermions minimally coupled to an emergent $U(1)$ gauge field. The existence of a relevant, symmetry-allowed monopole perturbation renders the DSL on the square lattice intrinsically unstable. We argue that the DSL describes a stable continuous phase transition within the familiar Neel phase (or within the Valence Bond Solid (VBS) phase). In other words, the DSL is an "unnecessary" quantum critical point within a single phase of matter. Our result offers a novel view of the square lattice DSL in that the critical spin liquid can exist within either the Neel or VBS state itself, and does not require leaving these conventional states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past three decades, it has been shown that discrete and continuous media can support topologically nontrivial modes. Recently, it was shown that the same is true of the vacuum, namely, right (R) and left (L) circularly polarized photons are topologically nontrivial. Here, we study the topology of another class of massless particles, namely the gravitons. Working in the transverse-traceless gauge and the limit of weak gravity, we show that the collection of all gravitons forms a rank-two vector bundle over the lightcone. We prove the graviton bundle is topologically trivial, allowing us to discover a globally smooth basis for gravitons. It has often been assumed that there exists such a global basis consisting of linear polarized gravitons. We prove that this stronger assumption is false--the graviton bundle has no linearly polarized subbundles. While the total graviton bundle can be decomposed into trivial line bundles, it also breaks apart into two nontrivial $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ invariant subbundles, consisting of the R and L gravitons. Unlike the bundles in the trivial decomposition, the R and L gravitons are in fact irreducible bundle representations of the Poincar\'{e} group, and are thus elementary particles. The nontrivial topologies of the R and L gravitons are fully characterized by the Chern numbers $\mp 4$. These topologies differ from those of the R and L photons, which are characterized by the Chern numbers $\mp 2$. This nontrivial topology obstructs the splitting of graviton angular momentum into spin and orbital angular momentum.</description>

Abstract: The Polynomial Affine Gravity is an alternative gravitational model, where the interactions are mediated solely by the affine connection, instead of the metric tensor. In this paper, we explore the space of solutions to the field equations when the torsion fields are turned on, in a homogeneous and isotropic (cosmological) scenario. We explore various metric structures that emerge in the space of solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper combines the post-Minkowskian expansion of general relativity with the language of intersection theory. Due to the nature of the soft limit inherent to the post-Minkowskian expansion, the intersection-based approach is of enhanced utility in that theory compared to a generic QFT. In the language of intersection theory, Feynman integrals are rephrased in terms of twisted cocycles. The intersection number is a pairing between two such cocycles and its existence allows for the direct projection onto a basis of master integrals. In this paper we use this approach to compute the 2PM contribution to the scattering of two compact astronomical objects, getting results in agreement with previous findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ Hubble data and Gaussian Processes in order to reconstruct the dynamical connection function in $f(Q)$ cosmology beyond the coincident gauge. In particular, there exist three branches of connections that satisfy the torsionless and curvatureless conditions, parameterized by a new dynamical function $\gamma$. We express the redshift dependence of $\gamma$ in terms of the $H(z)$ function and the $f(Q)$ form and parameters, and then we reconstruct it using 55 $H(z)$ observation data. Firstly, we investigate the case where ordinary conservation law holds, and we reconstruct the $f(Q)$ function, which is very well described by a quadratic correction on top of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity. Proceeding to the general case, we consider two of the most studied $f(Q)$ models of the literature, namely the square-root and the exponential one. In both cases we reconstruct $\gamma(z)$, and we show that according to AIC and BIC information criteria its inclusion is favoured compared to both $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, as well as to the same $f(Q)$ models under the coincident gauge. This feature acts as an indication that $f(Q)$ cosmology should be studied beyond the coincident gauge.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Buchdahl transformations: New static and rotating black holes in vacuum, double copy, and hairy extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates Buchdahl transformations within the framework of Einstein and Einstein-Scalar theories. Specifically, we establish that the recently proposed Schwarzschild-Levi-Civita spacetime can be obtained by means of a Buchdahl transformation of the Schwarschild metric along the spacelike Killing vector. The study extends Buchdahl's original theorem by combining it with the Kerr-Schild representation. In doing so, we construct new vacuum-rotating black holes in higher dimensions which can be viewed as the Levi-Civita extensions of the Myers-Perry geometries. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the double copy scheme within these new generated geometries still holds, providing an example of an algebraically general double copy framework. In the context of the Einstein-Scalar system, the paper extends the corresponding Buchdahl theorem to scenarios where a static vacuum seed configuration, transformed with respect to a spacelike Killing vector, generates a hairy black hole spacetime. We analyze the geometrical features of these spacetimes and investigate how a change of frame, via conformal transformations, leads to a new family of black hole spacetimes within the Einstein-Conformal-Scalar system.</description>

Abstract: We construct a (quantum mechanically) modified model for the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse scenario where the exterior of the collapsing dust ball is a Hayward black hole spacetime and the interior is a dust Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology. This interior cosmology is entirely determined by the junction conditions with the exterior black hole. It turns out to be non-singular, displaying a power-law contraction which precedes a de Sitter phase or, reversely, a power-law expansion followed by a de Sitter era. We also analyse the global causal structure and the viability of the model.</description>

      <title>Dirac Spectral Density in $N_f = 2+1$ QCD at $T = 230$ MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the renormalized Dirac spectral density in $N_f = 2+1$ QCD at physical quark masses, temperature $T = 230$ MeV and system size $L_s = 3.4$ fm. To that end, we perform a point-wise continuum limit of the staggered density in lattice QCD with staggered quarks. We find, for the first time, that a clear infrared structure (IR peak) emerges in the density of Dirac operator describing dynamical quarks. Features of this structure are consistent with those previously attributed to the recently-proposed IR phase of thermal QCD. Our results (i) provide solid evidence that these IR features are stable and physical; (ii) improve the upper bound for IR-phase transition temperature $T_{\mathrm{IR}}$ so that the new window is $200 &lt; T_{\mathrm{IR}} &lt; 230\,$MeV; (iii) support non-restoration of anomalous U$_{\mathrm A}$(1) symmetry (chiral limit) below $T \!=\! 230\,$MeV.</description>

      <title>Area laws from classical entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The area law-like scaling of local quantum entropies is the central characteristic of the entanglement inherent in quantum fields, many-body systems, and spacetime. Whilst the area law is primarily associated with the entanglement structure of the underlying quantum state, we here show that it equally manifests in classical entropies over measurement distributions when vacuum contributions dictated by the uncertainty principle are subtracted. Using the examples of the Gaussian ground and thermal states, but also the non-Gaussian particle state of a relativistic scalar field, we present analytical and numerical area laws for the entropies of various distributions and unveil how quantities of widespread interest such as the central charge and the (local) temperature are encoded in classical observables. With our approach, quantum entropies are no longer necessary to probe quantum phenomena, thereby rendering area laws and other quantum features directly accessible to theoretical models of high complexity as well as state-of-the-art experiments.</description>

      <title>The Sine-Gordon QFT in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the massless Sine-Gordon model in de Sitter spacetime, in the regime $\beta^2 &lt; 4 \pi$ and using the framework of perturbative algebraic quantum field theory. We show that a Fock space representation exists for the free massless field, but that the natural one-parameter family of vacuum-like states breaks the de Sitter boost symmetries. We prove convergence of the perturbative series for the S matrix in this representation, and construct the interacting Haag-Kastler net of local algebras from the relative S matrices. We show that the net fulfills isotony, locality and de Sitter covariance (in the algebraic adiabatic limit), even though the states that we consider are not invariant. We furthermore prove convergence of the perturbative series for the interacting field and the vertex operators, and verify that the interacting equation of motion holds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the differential equations for the two remaining integral topologies contributing to the leading colour two-loop amplitudes for $pp \rightarrow t\bar{t}j$. We derive differential equations for the master integrals by solving the integration-by-parts identities over finite fields. Of the two systems of differential equations, one is presented in canonical '${\rm d} \log$' form, while the other is found to have an elliptic sector. For the elliptic topology we identify the relevant elliptic curve, and present the differential equations in a more general form which depends quadratically on $\epsilon$ and contains non-logarithmic one-forms in addition to the canonical ${\rm d} \log$'s. We solve the systems of differential equations numerically using generalised series expansions with the boundary terms obtained using the auxiliary mass flow method. A summary of all one-loop and two-loop planar topologies is presented including the list of alphabet letters for the '${\rm d} \log$' form systems and high-precision boundary values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rigorously prove, for the first time, that the non-hydrodynamic sector is gapless in any relativistic kinetic theory whose scattering cross-section decays to zero at large energies. In fact, if particles with very high energy (compared to the temperature) are free streaming, we can use them to build hot non-hydrodynamic waves, which live longer than any hydrodynamic wave. Since many standard cross-sections in quantum field theory vanish at high energies, the existence of these non-thermal long-lived waves is a rather general feature of relativistic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: False vacuum decay and nucleation offer the opportunity to study non-equilibrium dynamical phenomena in quantum many-body systems with confinement. Recent work has examined false vacuum decay in 1D ferromagnetic Ising spins and superfluids. In this paper, we study false vacuum nucleation dynamics in 1D antiferromagnetic neutral atom chains with Rydberg interactions, using both numerical simulations and analytic modeling. We apply a staggered local detuning field to generate the false and true vacuum states. Our efforts focus on two dynamical regimes: decay and annealing. In the first, we corroborate the phenomenological decay rate scaling and determine the associated parameter range for the decay process; in the second, we uncover and elucidate a procedure to anneal the false vacuum from the initial to the final system, with intermediate nucleation events. We further propose experimental protocols to prepare the required states and perform quenches on near-term neutral atom quantum simulators, examining the experimental feasibility of our proposed setup and parameter regime.</description>

Abstract: Metastable false vacuum states arise in a range of quantum systems and can be observed in various dynamical scenarios, including decay, bubble nucleation, and long-lived oscillations. False vacuum phenomenology has been examined in quantum many-body systems, notably in 1D ferromagnetic Ising spin systems and superfluids. In this paper, we study long-lived oscillations of false and true vacuum states in 1D antiferromagnetic neutral atom chains with long-range Rydberg interactions. We use a staggered local detuning field to achieve confinement. Using theoretical and numerical models, we identify novel spectral signatures of quasiparticle oscillations distinct to antiferromagnetic neutral atom systems and interpret them using a classical energy model of deconfinement from Rydberg tails. Finally, we evaluate the experimental accessibility of our proposed setup on current neutral-atom platforms and discuss experimental feasibility and constraints.</description>

Abstract: We study classical M5 brane solutions in the probe limit in the $AdS_7 \times S^4$ spacetime geometry with worldvolume 3-form flux. These solutions describe the holography of codimension-4 defects in the 6d boundary dual $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ supersymmetric gauge theories. Starting from some half-BPS solutions which follow stricter BPS conditions, we find a general $\frac{1}{16}$-BPS solution. We show how some of the \textit{giant-like} M5 brane solutions here may be related to the codimension-2 surface operators in the 4d gauge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extension to arbitrary dimensions of a worldline path integral approach to one-loop quantum gravity, which was previously formulated in four spacetime dimensions. By utilizing this method, we recalculate gauge invariant coefficients related to the UV divergences of quantum gravity. These gauge invariant coefficients were previously obtained in arbitrary dimensions through two alternative techniques: the quantization of the N=4 spinning particle that propagates the graviton on Einstein spaces and the more conventional heat kernel approach. Our worldline path integrals are closer to the latter method and are employed to compute the trace of the heat kernel.</description>

      <title>Chaotic LLM billiards</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study null geodesics of the ten-dimensional LLM geometries. In particular, we show that there are a subset of these null geodesics that are confined to the LLM plane. The effective dynamics of these in-plane geodesics is that of a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom (a phase space of dimension 4). We show that these are chaotic. In the two-coloring of the LLM plane, if they start in the empty region, they cannot penetrate the filled region and viceversa. The dynamical problem is therefore very similar to that of a billiards problem with fixed obstacles. We study to what extent LLM geometries with many droplets may be treated as an incipient black hole and draw analogies with the fuzzball proposal.
  We argue that for in-plane null geodesics deep in the interior of a region with a lot of droplets, in order to exit towards the $AdS$ boundary they will need to undergo a process that resembles diffusion. This mechanism can account for signals getting lost in the putative black hole for a very long time.</description>

      <title>Large black hole entropy from the giant brane expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of large supersymmetric black holes in AdS$_5\times S^5$ emerges from remarkable cancellations in the giant graviton expansions recently proposed by Imamura, and Gaiotto and Lee, independently. A similar cancellation mechanism is shown to happen in the exact expansion in terms of free fermions recently put-forward by Murthy. These two representations can be understood as sums over independent systems of giant D3-branes and free fermions, respectively. At large charges, the free energy of each independent system localizes to its asymptotic expansion near the leading singularity. The sum over the independent systems maps their localized free energy to the localized free energy of the superconformal index of $U(N)$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. This result constitutes a non-perturbative test of the giant graviton expansion valid at any value of $N$. Moreover, in the holographic scaling limit $N\to\infty$ at fixed ratio $\frac{\text{Entropy}}{N^2}\,$, it recovers the 1/16 BPS black hole entropy by a saddle-point approximation of the giant graviton expansion.</description>

Abstract: In a previous paper we presented the renormalization of Einstein-Hilbert gravity under inclusion of higher derivative terms and proposed a projection down to the physical state space of Einstein-Hilbert. In the present paper we describe this procedure in more detail via decomposing the original double-pole field $h^{\mu\nu}$ in the bilinear field sector into a massless and a massive spin two field. Those are associated with the poles at zero mass resp. at non-zero mass of $h$ in the tree approximation. We show that the massive fields have no poles in higher orders hence do not correspond to particles. $S$-matrix unitarity is violated only in tree approximation. On the way to these results we derive finiteness properties which are valid in the Landau gauge. Those simplify the renormalization group analysis of the model considerably. We also establish a rigid Weyl identity which represents a proper substitute for a Callan-Symanzik equation in flat spacetime.</description>

Abstract: The warped conformal symmetries have been found in the covariant phase space of a set of non-trivial diffeomorphism near the Kerr black hole horizon. In this paper, we consider the retarded Green's function and the absorption probability for the scalar and higher spin perturbations on a generic non-extreme Kerr black hole background, and perform their holographic calculations in terms of the warped CFT. This provide further evidence on the conjecture that the warped CFT is relevant to the microstate description of the Kerr black hole.</description>

      <title>On gravity unification in SL(2N,C) gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local $SL(2N,C)$ symmetry is shown to provide, when appropriately constrained, a viable framework for a consistent unification of the known elementary forces, including gravity. Such a covariant constraint implies that an actual gauge field multiplet in the $SL(2N,C)$ theory is ultimately determined by the associated tetrad fields which not only specify the geometric features of spacetime but also govern which local internal symmetries are permissible within it. As a consequence, upon the covariant removal of all "redundant" gauge field components, the entire theory only exhibits the effective $SL(2,C)\times SU(N)$ symmetry, comprising $SL(2,C)$ gauge gravity on one hand and $SU(N)$ grand unified theory on the other. Given that all states involved in the $SL(2N,C)$ theories are additionally classified according to their spin values, many potential $SU(N)$ GUTs, including the conventional $SU(5)$ theory, appear to be irrelevant for standard spin $1/2$ quarks and leptons. Meanwhile, applying the $SL(2N,C)$ symmetry to the model of composite quarks and leptons with constituent chiral preons in its fundamental representations reveals, under certain natural conditions, that among all accompanying $SU(N)_{L}\times SU(N)_{R}$ chiral symmetries of preons and their composites only the $SU(8)_{L}\times SU(8)_{R}$ meets the anomaly matching condition ensuring masslessness of these composites at large distances. This, in turn, identifies $SL(16,C)$ with the effective $SL(2,C)\times SU(8)$ symmetry, accommodating all three families of composite quarks and leptons, as the most likely candidate for hyperunification of the existing elementary forces.</description>

Abstract: Conformal field theory (CFT) plays a key role in modern theoretical physics. Through CFT we describe real physical systems at criticality and fixed points of the renormalization group flow. It is also central in the study of quantum gravity, thanks to the AdS/CFT correspondence. This thesis originates in the context of the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, which represents the CFT side of this correspondence. This work mainly revolves around the supersymmetric Wilson line and its interpretation as a conformal defect in N=4 SYM. Particularly, we focus on excitations localized on the defect called insertions, whose correlators are described by a one-dimensional CFT. The first main result of this work is an efficient algorithm for computing multipoint correlation functions of scalar insertions on the Wilson line, consisting of recursion relations up to next-to-leading order at weak coupling. We show various computations of such four-, five- and six-point correlators, and discuss their properties. Moreover, we use the four-point function case to illustrate the power of the Ward identities, which are crucial in deriving a next-to-next-to-leading order result. Thanks to these perturbative results, we find a family of differential operators annihilating our correlation functions, which we conjecture to be a multipoint extension of the Ward identities satisfied by the four-point functions. These non-perturbative constraints are shown to be fundamental ingredients in the bootstrap of a five-point function at strong coupling. To conclude, we define an inherently one-dimensional Mellin amplitude at the non-perturbative level with appropriate subtractions and analytical continuations. The efficiency of the 1d Mellin formalism is manifest at the perturbative level. We find a closed-form expression for the Mellin transform of leading order contact interactions and use it to extract CFT data.</description>

Abstract: Although General Relativity (GR) is a very successful theory of gravity, it cannot explain every observational phenomenon. People have tried many kinds of modified gravity theory to explain these phenomena which GR cannot explain very well, such as string theory. In recent years Double Field Theory (DFT) has been an exciting research area in string theory. The most general, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat, static vacuum solution to D = 4 double field theory has been derived by S.M. Ko, J.H. Park and M. Suh. In this article, we calculate the minor corrections to the three predictions in GR: optical deflation, planet precession and gravitational redshift. These three predictions should be able to tested by observations and find the discrepancies between GR and DFT in the future.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we compute the two observables, impulse and waveform, in a black hole scattering event for the Scalar-Tensor theory of gravity with a generic scalar potential using the techniques of Worldline Quantum Field Theory. We mainly investigate the corrections to the above mentioned observables due to the extra scalar degree of freedom. For the computation of impulse, we consider the most general scenario by making the scalar field massive and then show that each computed diagram has a smooth massless limit. We compute the waveform for scalar and graviton up to 2PM, taking the scalar as massless. Furthermore, we discuss if the scalar has mass and how the radiation integrals get more involved than the massless case. We also arrive at some analytical results using stationary phase approximation.</description>

      <title>New Rotating Black Hole Solutions With Imperfect Fluid Energy-Momentum Tensor In $f(R)$ Gravity</title>

Abstract: We find a new class of exact solutions for rotating black holes in $f(R)$ gravity in presence of imperfect fluid. We find that the exact solutions are holographically dual to a hidden conformal field theory. Moreover we consider another class of exact solutions for rotating black holes in $f(R)$ gravity, which is obtained through a Lorentz boost transformation on a static spherical symmetry solutions in $f(R)$ gravity. We also find that the boosted exact solutions are holographically dual to a hidden conformal field theory. Comparing the CFT temperatures and the mode numbers of the two CFTs, we suggest a conjecture that, "Two identical rotating black holes (the same mass and the horizon) in $f(R)$ theory could be distinguished by looking at their dual CFT temperatures, and the dual CFT mode numbers. The rotating black hole in the presence of matter has higher CFT temperatures and higher CFT mode numbers, compared to the vacuum boosted rotating black hole".</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{N}=2$ SYK models with dynamical bosons and fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of SYK models with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry, described by $N$ fermions in chiral Fermi multiplets, as well as $\alpha N$ first-order bosons in chiral multiplets. The interactions are characterised by two integers $(p,q)$. We focus on the large $N$ and low energy limit of these models. Despite the presence of dynamical bosons, we find conformal behaviour akin to the standard SYK model. We use $\mathcal{I}$-extremization of a Witten index to study the supersymmetric solutions. In particular, we find an exact expression for the entropy, which matches the numerical solutions to the Schwinger-Dyson equations. We further solve the model both in the large $p$ and large $p,q$ limits. Numerically, we verify our analytical results and obtain estimates for the Schwarzian coupling in the near zero-temperature limit. We also study the low-lying spectrum of operators to determine the parameter ranges where the Schwarzian mode dominates the IR dynamics. Lastly, we study out-of-time-ordered correlators to show that the model is maximally chaotic.</description>

      <title>Universal Bound on Effective Central Charge and Its Saturation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective central charge (denoted by $c_{\text{eff}}$) is a measure of entanglement through a conformal interface, while the transmission coefficient (encoded in the coefficient $c_{LR}$ of the two-point function of the energy-momentum tensor across the interface) is a measure of energy transmission through the interface. It has been pointed out that these two are generally different. In this article, we propose the inequalities, $0 \leq c_{LR} \leq c_{\text{eff}} \leq \min (c_L,c_R)$. They have the simple but important implication that the amount of energy transmission can never exceed the amount of information transmission. We verify them using the AdS/CFT correspondence, using the perturbation method, and in examples beyond holography. We also show that these inequalities are sharp by constructing a class of interfaces that saturate them.</description>

      <title>The Schwarzian from gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continuum of holographic dual gravitational charges is recovered out of the discrete spectrum of $U(N)$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM on $\mathbb{R}\times S^3\,$. In such a limit, the free energy of the free gauge theory is computed up to logarithmic contributions and exponentially suppressed contributions. Assuming the supergravity dual prediction to correctly capture strong-coupling results in field theory, the answer is bound to encode a complete low-temperature expansion of the Gibbons-Hawking gravitational on-shell action, valid well beyond the vicinity of supersymmetric black hole solutions. The formula recovers the long awaited Schwarzian contribution at low enough temperatures. The computed mass-gap matches the conjectured strong-coupling result obtained by Boruch, Heydeman, Iliesiu and Turiaci in supergravity. The emergent reparameterizations, broken by the Schwarzian, correspond to redefinitions of the relevant cutoff scale. Observations are made regarding the existence of $\frac{1}{8}$-BPS black holes and how this is in tension with BPS inequalities. The RG-flow procedure leading to these results opens the way to understanding the emergence of chaos in gauge theories and its relation to non-extremal and non-supersymmetric black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Emergent factorization of Hilbert space at large $N$ and black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emergent factorization of Hilbert space in the low-energy description of matrix models, addressing key aspects of the black hole information paradox. We examine the collective description for the low-energy sector of $SU(N)$ matrix model, characterized by a factorized Hilbert space composed of a finite number of boxes and anti-boxes. This factorization leads us to examine the emergence of thermofield dynamics (TFD) state in the low energy sector from a fine-tuned state. In addition, we study the collective Hamiltonian of the $U(N)$ matrix model for the semi-classical description of "particle-hole" fluctuations around a background Young tableau. Our investigation of these matrix models elucidates a concrete mechanism for constructing the truncated algebra of accessible observables, thereby facilitating an understanding of black hole complementarity. In the context of the black hole information paradox, we discuss the origin of the island appearing inside the black hole and provide a reinterpretation of the recent proposal -- the holography of information.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Supersymmetric Systems and the Cohomology Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.00011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the complexity of the local Hamiltonian problem in the context of fermionic Hamiltonians with $\mathcal N=2 $ supersymmetry and show that the problem remains $\mathsf{QMA}$-complete. Our main motivation for studying this is the well-known fact that the ground state energy of a supersymmetric system is exactly zero if and only if a certain cohomology group is nontrivial. This opens the door to bringing the tools of Hamiltonian complexity to study the computational complexity of a large number of algorithmic problems that arise in homological algebra, including problems in algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and group theory. We take the first steps in this direction by introducing the $k$-local Cohomology problem and showing that it is $\mathsf{QMA}_1$-hard and, for a large class of instances, is contained in $\mathsf{QMA}$. We then consider the complexity of estimating normalized Betti numbers and show that this problem is hard for the quantum complexity class $\mathsf{DQC}1$, and for a large class of instances is contained in $\mathsf{BQP}$. In light of these results, we argue that it is natural to frame many of these homological problems in terms of finding ground states of supersymmetric fermionic systems. As an illustration of this perspective we discuss in some detail the model of Fendley, Schoutens, and de Boer consisting of hard-core fermions on a graph, whose ground state structure encodes $l$-dimensional holes in the independence complex of the graph. This offers a new perspective on existing quantum algorithms for topological data analysis and suggests new ones.</description>

      <title>Remote detectability from entanglement bootstrap I: Kirby's torus trick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remote detectability is often taken as a physical assumption in the study of topologically ordered systems, and it is a central axiom of mathematical frameworks of topological quantum field theories. We show under the entanglement bootstrap approach that remote detectability is a necessary property; that is, we derive it as a theorem. Starting from a single wave function on a topologically-trivial region satisfying the entanglement bootstrap axioms, we can construct states on closed manifolds. The crucial technique is to immerse the punctured manifold into the topologically trivial region and then heal the puncture. This is analogous to Kirby's torus trick. We then analyze a special class of such manifolds, which we call pairing manifolds. For each pairing manifold, which pairs two classes of excitations, we identify an analog of the topological $S$-matrix. This pairing matrix is unitary, which implies remote detectability between two classes of excitations. These matrices are in general not associated with the mapping class group of the manifold. As a by-product, we can count excitation types (e.g., graph excitations in 3+1d). The pairing phenomenon occurs in many physical contexts, including systems in different dimensions, with or without gapped boundaries. We provide a variety of examples to illustrate its scope.</description>

      <title>Geometric quantum complexity of bosonic oscillator systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the pioneering work of Nielsen and collaborators, the length of the minimal geodesic in a geometric realization of a suitable operator space provides a measure of the quantum complexity of an operation. Compared with the original concept of complexity based on the minimal number of gates required to construct the desired operation as a product, this geometrical approach amounts to a more concrete and computable definition, but its evaluation is nontrivial in systems with a high-dimensional Hilbert space. The geometrical formulation can more easily be evaluated by considering the geometry associated with a suitable finite-dimensional group generated by a small number of relevant operators of the system. In this way, the method has been applied in particular to the harmonic oscillator, which is also of interest in the present paper. However, subtle and previously unrecognized issues of group theory can lead to unforeseen complications, motivating a new formulation that remains on the level of the underlying Lie algebras for most of the required steps. Novel insights about complexity can thereby be found in a low-dimensional setting, with the potential of systematic extensions to higher dimensions as well as interactions. Specific examples include the quantum complexity of various target unitary operators associated with a harmonic oscillator, inverted harmonic oscillator, and coupled harmonic oscillators. The generality of this approach is demonstrated by an application to an anharmonic oscillator with a cubic term.</description>

      <title>Full range spectral correlations and their spectral form factors in chaotic and integrable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlations between the eigenenergies of a system's spectrum can be a defining feature of quantum chaos. We characterize correlations between energies for all spectral distances by studying the distributions of $k$-th neighbor level spacings ($k$nLS) and compute their associated $k$-th neighbor spectral form factor ($k$nSFF). Specifically, we find analytical expressions for these signatures in paradigmatic models of quantum chaos, namely the three Gaussian ensembles of random matrix theory, and in integrable models, taken as systems with completely uncorrelated spectra (the Poissonian ensemble). The spectral distance decomposition of the SFF allows us to probe the contribution of each individual $k$nLS to the ramp. The latter is a characteristic feature of quantum chaos, and we show how each spectral distance participates in building it -- the linear ramp cannot be formed by short-range energy correlations only. We illustrate our findings in the XXZ spin chain with disorder, which interpolates between chaotic and integrable behavior.</description>

      <title>A relation between Krylov and Nielsen complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity and Nielsen complexity are successful approaches to quantifying quantum evolution complexity that have been actively pursued without much contact between the two lines of research. The two quantities are motivated by quantum chaos and quantum computation, respectively, while the relevant mathematics is as different as matrix diagonalization algorithms and geodesic flows on curved manifolds. We demonstrate that, despite these differences, there is a relation between the two quantities. Namely, the time average of Krylov complexity of state evolution can be expressed as a trace of a certain matrix, which also controls an upper bound on Nielsen complexity with a specific custom-tailored penalty schedule adapted to the Krylov basis.</description>

      <title>Closed 4-braids and the Jones unknot conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jones problem is a question whether there is a non-trivial knot with the trivial Jones polynomial in one variable $q$. The answer to this fundamental question is still unknown despite numerous attempts to explore it. In braid presentation the case of 4-strand braids is already open. S. Bigelow showed in 2000 that if the Burau representation for four-strand braids is unfaithful, then there is an infinite number of non-trivial knots with the trivial two-variable HOMFLY-PT polynomial and hence, with the trivial Jones polynomial, since it is obtained from the HOMFLY-PT polynomial by the specialisation of one of the variables $A=q^2$.
  In this paper, we study four-strand braids and ask whether there are non-trivial knots with the trivial Jones polynomial but a non-trivial HOMFLY-PT polynomial. We have discovered that there is a whole 1-parameter family, parameterised by the writhe number, of 2-variable polynomials that can be HOMFLY-PT polynomials of some knots. We explore various properties of the obtained hypothetical HOMFLY-PT polynomials and suggest several checks to test these formulas. A generalisation is also proposed for the case of a large number of strands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel asymptotically anti-de Sitter black hole solution with conformally-coupled scalar fields in the first-order formalism of gravity in four dimensions. To do so, we consider a one-parameter extension of conformal transformations by exploiting the fact that the vielbein and spin connection are regarded as independent fields. We solve the field equations analytically and obtain a static black hole solution with nontrivial torsion sourced by the conformal coupling between the scalar field and geometry. The presence of torsion renders the scalar field everywhere regular, while the curvature and torsion singularities coalesce into the origin. We show that this configuration is continuously connected to previously reported solutions in the limit of vanishing torsion and analyze its main properties, focusing on the consequences of the torsional singularity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a recipe for B-model computation of genus 1 Gromov-Witten invariants of Calabi-Yau and Fano Projective Hypersurfaces. Our formalism can be applied equally to both Calabi-Yau and Fano cases. In Calabi-Yau case, drastic cancellation of terms used in our formalism occurs and it results in another representation of BCOV-Zinger formula for projective Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces.</description>
