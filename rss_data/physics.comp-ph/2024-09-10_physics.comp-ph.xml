      <title>A robust fourth-order finite-difference discretization for the strongly anisotropic transport equation in magnetized plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a second-order temporally implicit, fourth-order-accurate spatial discretization scheme for the strongly anisotropic heat transport equation characteristic of hot, fusion-grade plasmas. Following [Du Toit et al., Comp. Phys. Comm., 228 (2018)], the scheme transforms mixed-derivative diffusion fluxes (which are responsible for the lack of a discrete maximum principle) into nonlinear advective fluxes, amenable to nonlinear-solver-friendly monotonicity-preserving limiters. The scheme enables accurate multi-dimensional heat transport simulations with up to seven orders of magnitude of heat-transport-coefficient anisotropies with low cross-field numerical error pollution and excellent algorithmic performance, with the number of linear iterations scaling very weakly with grid resolution and grid anisotropy, and scaling with the square-root of the implicit timestep. We propose a multigrid preconditioning strategy based on a second-order-accurate approximation that renders the scheme efficient and scalable under grid refinement. Several numerical tests are presented that display the expected spatial convergence rates and strong algorithmic performance, including fully nonlinear magnetohydrodynamics simulations of kink instabilities in a Bennett pinch in 2D helical geometry and of ITER in 3D toroidal geometry.</description>

      <title>FEAST nonlinear eigenvalue algorithm for $GW$ quasiparticle equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of Green's function in quantum many-body theory often leads to nonlinear eigenvalue problems, as Green's function needs to be defined in energy domain. The $GW$ approximation method is one of the typical examples. In this article, we introduce a method based on the FEAST eigenvalue algorithm for accurately solving the nonlinear eigenvalue $G_0W_0$ quasiparticle equation, eliminating the need for the Kohn-Sham wavefunction approximation. Based on the contour integral method for nonlinear eigenvalue problem, the energy (eigenvalue) domain is extended to complex plane. Hypercomplex number is introduced to the contour deformation calculation of $GW$ self-energy to carry imaginary parts of both Green's functions and FEAST quadrature nodes. Calculation results for various molecules are presented and compared with a more conventional graphical solution approximation method. It is confirmed that the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) from the Kohn-Sham equation is very close to that of $GW$, while the Least Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) shows noticeable differences.</description>

      <title>Perfectly Matched Layer implementation for E-H fields and Complex Wave Envelope propagation in the Smilei PIC code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of absorbing boundary conditions (ABC) in a numerical simulation is a challenging task. In the best cases, spurious reflections remain for some angles of incidence or at certain wave lengths. In the worst, ABC are not even possible for the set of equations and/or numerical schemes used in the simulation and reflections can not be avoided at all. Perflectly Matched Layer (PML) are layers of absorbing medium which can be added at the simulation edges in order to significantly damp both outgoing and reflected waves, thus effectively playing the role of an ABC. They are able to absorb waves and prevent reflections for all angles and frequencies at a modest computational cost. It increases the simulation accuracy and negates the need of oversizing the simulation usually imposed by ABC and leading to a waste of computational resources and power. PML for finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) schemes in Particle-In-cell (PIC) codes are presented for both Maxwell's equations and, for the first time, the envelope wave equation. Being of the second order, the latter requires significant evolutions with respect to the former. It applies in particular to simulations of lasers propagating in plasmas using the reduced Complex Envelope model. The implementation is done in the open source code Smilei for both Cartesian and azimuthal modes (AM) decomposition geometries.</description>

      <title>nekCRF: A next generation high-order reactive low Mach flow solver for direct numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exascale computing enables high-fidelity simulations of chemically reactive flows in practical geometries and conditions, and paves the way for valuable insights that can optimize combustion processes, ultimately reducing emissions and improving fuel combustion efficiency. However, this requires software that can fully leverage the capabilities of current high performance computing systems. The paper introduces nekCRF, a high-order reactive low Mach flow solver specifically designed for this purpose. Its capabilities and efficiency are showcased on the pre-exascale system JUWELS Booster, a GPU-based supercomputer at the J\"{u}lich Supercomputing Centre including a validation across diverse cases of varying complexity.</description>

      <title>Simulating real-time molecular electron dynamics efficiently using the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compared to ground state electronic structure optimizations, accurate simulations of molecular real-time electron dynamics are usually much more difficult to perform. To simulate electron dynamics, the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TDDMRG) has been shown to offer an attractive compromise between accuracy and cost. However, many simulation parameters significantly affect the quality and efficiency of a TDDMRG simulation. So far, it is unclear whether common wisdom from ground state DMRG carries over to the TDDMRG, and a guideline on how to choose these parameters is missing. Here, in order to establish such a guideline, we investigate the convergence behavior of the main TDDMRG simulation parameters, such as time integrator, the choice of orbitals, and the choice of MPS representation for complex-valued non-singlet states. In addition, we propose a method to select orbitals that are tailored to optimize the dynamics. Lastly, we showcase the TDDMRG by applying it to charge migration ionization dynamics in furfural, where we reveal a rapid conversion from an ionized state with a $\sigma$ character to one with a $\pi$ character within less than a femtosecond.</description>

      <title>Constructing multicomponent cluster expansions with machine-learning and chemical embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cluster expansions are commonly employed as surrogate models to link the electronic structure of an alloy to its finite-temperature properties. Using cluster expansions to model materials with several alloying elements is challenging due to a rapid increase in the number of fitting parameters and training set size. We introduce the embedded cluster expansion (eCE) formalism that enables the parameterization of accurate on-lattice surrogate models for alloys containing several chemical species. The eCE model simultaneously learns a low dimensional embedding of site basis functions along with the weights of an energy model. A prototypical senary alloy comprised of elements in groups 5 and 6 of the periodic table is used to demonstrate that eCE models can accurately reproduce ordering energetics of complex alloys without a significant increase in model complexity. Further, eCE models can leverage similarities between chemical elements to efficiently extrapolate into compositional spaces that are not explicitly included in the training dataset. The eCE formalism presented in this study unlocks the possibility of employing cluster expansion models to study multicomponent alloys containing several alloying elements.</description>

      <title>Differentiable programming across the PDE and Machine Learning barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combination of machine learning and physical laws has shown immense potential for solving scientific problems driven by partial differential equations (PDEs) with the promise of fast inference, zero-shot generalisation, and the ability to discover new physics. Examples include the use of fundamental physical laws as inductive bias to machine learning algorithms, also referred to as physics-driven machine learning, and the application of machine learning to represent features not represented in the differential equations such as closures for unresolved spatiotemporal scales. However, the simulation of complex physical systems by coupling advanced numerics for PDEs with state-of-the-art machine learning demands the composition of specialist PDE solving frameworks with industry-standard machine learning tools. Hand-rolling either the PDE solver or the neural net will not cut it. In this work, we introduce a generic differentiable programming abstraction that provides scientists and engineers with a highly productive way of specifying end-to-end differentiable models coupling machine learning and PDE-based components, while relying on code generation for high performance. Our interface automates the coupling of arbitrary PDE-based systems and machine learning models and unlocks new applications that could not hitherto be tackled, while only requiring trivial changes to existing code. Our framework has been adopted in the Firedrake finite-element library and supports the PyTorch and JAX ecosystems, as well as downstream libraries.</description>

      <title>Configuration Interaction Guided Sampling with Interpretable Restricted Boltzmann Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven approach using a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) to solve the Schr\"odinger equation in configuration space. Traditional Configuration Interaction (CI) methods, while powerful, are computationally expensive due to the large number of determinants required. Our approach leverages RBMs to efficiently identify and sample the most significant determinants, accelerating convergence and reducing computational cost. This method achieves up to 99.99\% of the correlation energy even by four orders of magnitude less determinants compared to full CI calculations and up to two orders of magnitude less than previous state of the art works. Additionally, our study demonstrate that the RBM can learn the underlying quantum properties, providing more detail insights than other methods . This innovative data-driven approach offers a promising tool for quantum chemistry, enhancing both efficiency and understanding of complex systems.</description>

      <title>SeeBand: A highly efficient, interactive tool for analyzing electronic transport data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linking the fundamental physics of band structure and scattering theory with macroscopic features such as measurable bulk thermoelectric transport properties is indispensable to a thorough understanding of transport phenomena and ensures more targeted and efficient experimental research. Here, we introduce SeeBand, a highly efficient and interactive fitting tool based on Boltzmann transport theory. A fully integrated user interface and visualization tool enable real-time comparison and connection between the electronic band structure (EBS) and microscopic transport properties. It allows simultaneous analysis of data for the Seebeck coefficient $S$, resistivity $\rho$ and Hall coefficient $R_\text{H}$ to identify suitable EBS models and extract the underlying microscopic material parameters and additional information from the model. Crucially, the EBS can be obtained by directly fitting the temperature-dependent properties of a single sample, which goes beyond previous approaches that look into doping dependencies. Finally, the combination of neural-network-assisted initial guesses and an efficient subsequent fitting routine allows for a rapid processing of big datasets, facilitating high-throughput analyses to identify underlying, yet undiscovered dependencies, thereby guiding material design.</description>

      <title>Simulating continuous-space systems with quantum-classical wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most non-relativistic interacting quantum many-body systems, such as atomic and molecular ensembles or materials, are naturally described in terms of continuous-space Hamiltonians. The simulation of their ground-state properties on digital quantum computers is challenging because current algorithms require discretization, which usually amounts to choosing a finite basis set, inevitably introducing errors. In this work, we propose an alternative, discretization-free approach that combines classical and quantum resources in a global variational ansatz, optimized using the framework of variational Monte Carlo. We introduce both purely quantum as well as hybrid quantum-classical ansatze and benchmark them on three paradigmatic continuous-space systems that are either very challenging or beyond the reach of current quantum approaches: the one-dimensional quantum rotor model, a system of Helium-3 particles in one and two dimensions, and the two-dimensional homogeneous electron gas. We embed relevant constraints such as the antisymmetry of fermionic wave functions directly into the ansatz. Many-body correlations are introduced via backflow transformations represented by parameterized quantum circuits. We demonstrate that the accuracy of the simulation can be systematically improved by increasing the number of circuit parameters and study the effects of shot noise. Furthermore, we show that the hybrid ansatz improves the ground-state energies obtained using the purely classical wave function.</description>

Abstract: The effect of Diabatisation is reported in the excited argon isomers using the Diatomic-In-Molecules (DIM) method. In previous work using DIM, the lowest energy isomers of Ar$_N^*$ were shown as Ar$_3^*-$Ar$_{N-3}$, however, using the Hole-Particle-Psedopotential (HPP) method, it was shown that the excitation is localised over dimer not trimer; Ar$_2^*-$Ar$_{N-2}$. In this work we improve the DIM calculations by including previously ignored strongly avoided crossing between 3p4s and 3p4p $^{1,3}\Sigma$ states.</description>

      <title>Learning local and semi-local density functionals from exact exchange-correlation potentials and energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding accurate exchange-correlation (XC) functionals remains the defining challenge in density functional theory (DFT). Despite 40 years of active development, the desired chemical accuracy is still elusive with existing functionals. We present a data-driven pathway to learn the XC functionals by utilizing the exact density, XC energy, and XC potential. While the exact densities are obtained from accurate configuration interaction (CI), the exact XC energies and XC potentials are obtained via inverse DFT calculations on the CI densities. We demonstrate how simple neural network (NN) based local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA), trained on just five atoms and two molecules, provide remarkable improvement in total energies, densities, atomization energies, and barrier heights for hundreds of molecules outside the training set. Particularly, the NN-based GGA functional attains similar accuracy as the higher rung SCAN meta-GGA, highlighting the promise of using the XC potential in modeling XC functionals. We expect this approach to pave the way for systematic learning of increasingly accurate and sophisticated XC functionals.</description>

      <title>A Primer on Variational Inference for Physics-Informed Deep Generative Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational inference (VI) is a computationally efficient and scalable methodology for approximate Bayesian inference. It strikes a balance between accuracy of uncertainty quantification and practical tractability. It excels at generative modelling and inversion tasks due to its built-in Bayesian regularisation and flexibility, essential qualities for physics related problems. Deriving the central learning objective for VI must often be tailored to new learning tasks where the nature of the problems dictates the conditional dependence between variables of interest, such as arising in physics problems. In this paper, we provide an accessible and thorough technical introduction to VI for forward and inverse problems, guiding the reader through standard derivations of the VI framework and how it can best be realized through deep learning. We then review and unify recent literature exemplifying the creative flexibility allowed by VI. This paper is designed for a general scientific audience looking to solve physics-based problems with an emphasis on uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>A Journey with THeSeuSS: Automated Python Tool for Modeling IR and Raman Vibrational Spectra of Molecules and Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vibrational spectroscopy is an indispensable analytical tool that provides structural fingerprints for molecules, solids, and interfaces thereof. This study introduces THeSeuSS (THz Spectra Simulations Software) - an automated computational platform that efficiently simulates IR and Raman spectra for both periodic and non-periodic systems. Utilizing DFT and DFTB, THeSeuSS offers robust capabilities for detailed vibrational spectra simulations. Our extensive evaluations and benchmarks demonstrate that THeSeuSS accurately reproduces both previously calculated and experimental spectra, enabling precise comparisons and interpretations of vibrational features across various test cases, including H2O and glycine molecules in the gas phase, as well as solid ammonia and solid ibuprofen. Designed with a user-friendly interface and seamless integration with existing computational chemistry tools, THeSeuSS enhances the accessibility and applicability of advanced spectroscopic simulations, supporting research and development in chemical, pharmaceutical, and material sciences. Future updates aim to expand its methodological diversity by incorporating machine learning techniques to analyze larger and more complex systems, solidifying THeSeuSS's role as an essential tool in the computational chemist's arsenal.</description>

Abstract: The radial time-independent Schr\"odinger equation is solved for the diatomic molecules: H2, LiH, HCl, CO, VH, CrH, CuLi, TiC, NiC, and ScN using the recently developed Nikiforov-Uvarov Functional Analysis (NUFA) method. The Modified-Morse potential is considered and the Pekeris approximation is used to accommodate the centrifugal term. Accurate energy eigenvalues and eigenfunction solutions are obtained for vibrational ($\mathit{n}$) and rotational ($\ell$) states. For \ce{H2}, LiH, HCl, and CO, excellent agreement is observed between present values and literature, provided that the Pekeris approximation remains valid. For other molecules, a collection of low and high-lying states not found in literature are reported. The NUFA method is a simple, general and accurate approach that may be applied to other interatomic potentials.</description>

      <title>Monitoring of water volume in a porous reservoir using seismic data: Validation of a numerical model with a field experiment</title>

Abstract: As global groundwater levels continue to decline rapidly, there is a growing need for advanced techniques to monitor and manage aquifers effectively. This study focuses on validating a numerical model using seismic data from a small-scale experimental setup designed to estimate water volume in a porous reservoir. Expanding on previous work with synthetic data, we analyze seismic data acquired from a controlled experimental site in Laukaa, Finland. By employing neural networks, we directly estimate water volume from seismic responses, bypassing the traditional need for separate determinations, for example, of reservoir water table level and porosity. The study models wave propagation through a coupled poroviscoelastic-viscoelastic medium using a three-dimensional discontinuous Galerkin method. The proposed methodology is validated against experimental data, aiming to improve precision in mapping current water volumes and contributing to the development of sustainable groundwater management practices.</description>

      <title>Radiative hydrodynamic equations with nonequilibrium radiative transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a kinetic model for the coupled evolution of radiation, electrons, and ions in a radiation plasma system. The model is solved using two methods. The gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) for electron and ion hydrodynamics and the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) for non-equilibrium radiative transfer. The UGKS accurately captures multiscale photon transport from free streaming to diffusion across varying fluid opacities. This approach enables the scheme to model equilibrium plasma with non-equilibrium radiation transport. The model is validated through several test cases, including radiative transfer in kinetic and diffusion regimes, Marshak wave, Radiative shock, 3T double lax shock tube problem, two-dimensional Sedov blast wave, and two-dimensional tophat based problem. These tests demonstrate the current scheme's capability to handle diverse radiation plasma scenarios.</description>

      <title>A framework to compute resonances arising from multiple scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous natural and technological phenomena are governed by resonances. In nanophotonics, resonances often result from the interaction of several optical elements. Controlling these resonances is an excellent opportunity to provide light with properties on demand for applications ranging from sensing to quantum technologies. The inverse design of large, distributed resonators, however, is typically challenged by high computational costs when discretizing the entire system in space. Here, this limitation is overcome by harnessing prior knowledge about the individual scatterers that form the resonator and their interaction. In particular, a transition matrix multi-scattering framework is coupled with the state-of-the-art adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA) algorithm to identify complex poles of the optical response function. A sample refinement strategy suitable for accurately locating a large number of poles is introduced. We tie the AAA algorithm into an automatic differentiation framework to efficiently differentiate multi-scattering resonance calculations. The resulting resonance solver allows for efficient gradient-based optimization, demonstrated here by the inverse design of an integrated exciton-polariton cavity. This contribution serves as an important step towards efficient resonance calculations in a variety of multi-scattering scenarios, such as inclusions in stratified media, periodic lattices, and scatterers with arbitrary shapes.</description>

      <title>Learning force laws in many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific laws describing natural systems may be more complex than our intuition can handle, thus how we discover laws must change. Machine learning (ML) models can analyze large quantities of data, but their structure should match the underlying physical constraints to provide useful insight. While progress has been made using simulated data where the underlying physics is known, training and validating ML models on experimental data requires fundamentally new approaches. Here we demonstrate and experimentally validate an ML approach that incorporates physical intuition to infer force laws in dusty plasma, a complex, many-body system. Trained on 3D particle trajectories, the model accounts for inherent symmetries, non-identical particles, and learns the effective non-reciprocal forces between particles with exquisite accuracy (R^2&gt;0.99). We validate the model by inferring particle masses in two independent yet consistent ways. The model's accuracy enables precise measurements of particle charge and screening length, discovering violations of common theoretical assumptions. Our ability to identify new physics from experimental data demonstrates how ML-powered approaches can guide new routes of scientific discovery in many-body systems. Furthermore, we anticipate our ML approach to be a starting point for inferring laws from dynamics in a wide range of many-body systems, from colloids to living organisms.</description>

      <title>Coherence properties of NV-center ensembles in diamond coupled to an electron-spin bath</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate nitrogen-vacancy center (NV) ensembles in diamond under the influence of strongly-correlated electron-spin baths. We thoroughly calculate the decoherence properties of the NV central spin for bath concentrations of 0.1-100 ppm using the cluster-correlation expansion (CCE) method. We systematically analyze possible origins of the significant deviations in the values of the $T_2$ coherence time reported in literature. We demonstrate that significant variations can originate from the choice of averaging and fitting procedures used for the ensemble average and we point out the respective aspects that need to be considered, when comparing the various theoretical studies. Our study may ease readers to perform reliable and fast simulations on the central spin problem. It provides an understanding and interpretation of the outcome parameters describing the dynamics of the local bath spins.</description>

      <title>Equivalence analysis between Quasi-coarse-grained and Atomistic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, simulation methods based on the scaling of atomic potential functions, such as quasi-coarse-grained dynamics and coarse-grained dynamics, have shown promising results for modeling crystalline systems at multiple scales. However, this letter presents evidence suggesting that the spatiotemporal trajectories of coarse-grained systems generated by such simulation methods exhibit a complete correspondence with those of specific molecular dynamics systems. In essence, current coarse-grained simulation methods involve a direct amplification of the results obtained from molecular dynamics simulations across spatial and temporal scales, yet they may lack the capability to adequately capture authentic scale effects. Consequently, the findings of related studies warrant careful re-evaluation. Furthermore, this study underscores the importance of not only verifying the consistency of mesoscale simulation methods with microscopic simulations but also meticulously assessing their capability to accurately forecast mesoscale physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Revealing the molecular structures of a-Al2O3(0001)-water interface by machine learning based computational vibrational spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solid-water interfaces are crucial to many physical and chemical processes and are extensively studied using surface-specific sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy. To establish clear correlations between specific spectral signatures and distinct interfacial water structures, theoretical calculations using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are required. These MD simulations typically need relatively long trajectories (a few nanoseconds) to achieve reliable SFG response function calculations via the dipole-polarizability time correlation function. However, the requirement for long trajectories limits the use of computationally expensive techniques such as ab initio MD (AIMD) simulations, particularly for complex solid-water interfaces. In this work, we present a pathway for calculating vibrational spectra (IR, Raman, SFG) of solid-water interfaces using machine learning (ML)-accelerated methods. We employ both the dipole moment-polarizability correlation function and the surface-specific velocity-velocity correlation function approaches to calculate SFG spectra. Our results demonstrate the successful acceleration of AIMD simulations and the calculation of SFG spectra using ML methods. This advancement provides an opportunity to calculate SFG spectra for the complicated solid-water systems more rapidly and at a lower computational cost with the aid of ML.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann Model for Transonic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic limit of a discrete kinetic equation is intrinsically connected with the symmetry of the lattices used in construction of a discrete velocity model. On mixed lattices composed of standard lattices the sixth-order (and higher) moment is often not isotropic and thus they are insufficient to ensure correct imposition of the hydrodynamic moments. This makes the task of developing lattice Boltzmann model for transonic flows quite challenging. We address this by decoupling the physical space lattice from the velocity space lattice to construct a lattice Boltzmann model with very high isotropy. The model is entirely on-lattice like the isothermal models, achieves a Mach number of two with only $81$ discrete velocities, and admits a simple generalization of equilibrium distribution used in isothermal equilibrium. We also present a number of realistic benchmark problems to show that the lattice Boltzmann model with a limited number of velocities is not only feasible for transonic flow but is also quite simple and efficient like its subsonic counterpart.</description>
