      <title>What Lives? A meta-analysis of diverse opinions on the definition of life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of "what is life?" has challenged scientists and philosophers for centuries, producing an array of definitions that reflect both the mystery of its emergence and the diversity of disciplinary perspectives brought to bear on the question. Despite significant progress in our understanding of biological systems, psychology, computation, and information theory, no single definition for life has yet achieved universal acceptance. This challenge becomes increasingly urgent as advances in synthetic biology, artificial intelligence, and astrobiology challenge our traditional conceptions of what it means to be alive. We undertook a methodological approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze a set of definitions of life provided by a curated set of cross-disciplinary experts. We used a novel pairwise correlation analysis to map the definitions into distinct feature vectors, followed by agglomerative clustering, intra-cluster semantic analysis, and t-SNE projection to reveal underlying conceptual archetypes. This methodology revealed a continuous landscape of the themes relating to the definition of life, suggesting that what has historically been approached as a binary taxonomic problem should be instead conceived as differentiated perspectives within a unified conceptual latent space. We offer a new methodological bridge between reductionist and holistic approaches to fundamental questions in science and philosophy, demonstrating how computational semantic analysis can reveal conceptual patterns across disciplinary boundaries, and opening similar pathways for addressing other contested definitional territories across the sciences.</description>

      <title>Inkspot: A stress-resilient, anthocyanin rich, dwarf tomato variant for off-world cultivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As humanity prepares for sustained off-world habitation, the development of regolith-based agriculture (RBA) is essential for achieving self-sufficiency in space crop production. However, lunar regolith's alkaline pH, poor water retention, and high metal content pose severe physiological and biochemical challenges to plant growth. This study evaluates the performance of Solanum lycopersicum 'Inkspot', a stress-adaptive, anthocyanin-rich tomato variant, in comparison to its progenitor 'Tiny Tim', under control and simulated lunar regolith (LHS-2) conditions. A randomized complete block design was used to assess germination dynamics, morphology, fruit quality, antioxidant activity, and root architecture across 80 replicates over 65 days in controlled chambers. Inkspot maintained high germination rates (85% in regolith) with low variation (CV = 14%) and showed only moderate reductions in height and biomass, while Tiny Tim suffered a 45% biomass reduction and 60% fruit yield loss. Inkspot fruits increased anthocyanin content 2.5-fold in regolith, functioning as a stress-response mechanism and potential bioindicator. Physiological assessments revealed greater retention of chlorophyll, Fv/Fm efficiency, and stomatal conductance in Inkspot, correlated with higher SOD and CAT enzyme activity and lower lipid peroxidation. Root imaging showed Inkspot developed a significantly larger, more complex root system, while Tiny Tim's roots contracted under stress. These findings highlight Inkspot's abiotic stress tolerance and potential as a candidate for closed-loop life support and in-situ resource utilization strategies in RBA systems.</description>

      <title>Open and Sustainable AI: challenges, opportunities and the road ahead in the life sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently seen transformative breakthroughs in the life sciences, expanding possibilities for researchers to interpret biological information at an unprecedented capacity, with novel applications and advances being made almost daily. In order to maximise return on the growing investments in AI-based life science research and accelerate this progress, it has become urgent to address the exacerbation of long-standing research challenges arising from the rapid adoption of AI methods. We review the increased erosion of trust in AI research outputs, driven by the issues of poor reusability and reproducibility, and highlight their consequent impact on environmental sustainability. Furthermore, we discuss the fragmented components of the AI ecosystem and lack of guiding pathways to best support Open and Sustainable AI (OSAI) model development. In response, this perspective introduces a practical set of OSAI recommendations directly mapped to over 300 components of the AI ecosystem. Our work connects researchers with relevant AI resources, facilitating the implementation of sustainable, reusable and transparent AI. Built upon life science community consensus and aligned to existing efforts, the outputs of this perspective are designed to aid the future development of policy and structured pathways for guiding AI implementation.</description>

      <title>The concentration and energetic content of floral nectar sugars: calculation, conversions, and common confusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sugar concentration of floral nectar is a key metric for describing nectar composition and a major factor influencing pollinator visitation to flowers. Across pollination biology research there are multiple approaches in use for describing nectar sugar concentration. With these different approaches there are several potential sources of confusion which, if not accounted for, can lead to errors. Further potential for error arises if researchers wish to make comparisons between the energetic content of nectars containing different ratios of sucrose, fructose and glucose. Regardless of whether concentration is measured per mole or per unit mass, the energetic content differs between the hexose sugars (glucose and fructose) and sucrose. Appropriate conversion is needed for direct comparison. Here we address these two issues with the following aims. We consolidate the literature on this topic with examples of the different methods for reporting nectar sugar concentrations, provide insight into potential sources of error, and derive equations for converting between the different ways of expressing sugar concentration for the three primary nectar sugars: sucrose, glucose and fructose. Second, we discuss the relative energetic content of sucrose, glucose, and fructose, and rationalise adjustment of "energetic value" rather than reporting concentration directly. In this way, we hope to harmonise ongoing work in pollination ecology.</description>
