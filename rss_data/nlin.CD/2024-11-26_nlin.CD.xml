      <title>Devil's staircase inside shrimps reveals periodicity of plateau spikes and bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Slow-fast dynamics are intrinsically related to complex phenomena, and are responsible for many of the homeostatic dynamics that keep biological systems healthfully functioning. We study a discrete-time membrane potential model that can generate a diverse set of spiking behavior depending on the choice of slow-fast time scales, from fast spiking to bursting, or plateau action potentials -- also known as cardiac spikes, since they are characteristic in heart myocytes. The plateau of cardiac spikes may lose stability, generating early or delayed afterdepolarizations (EAD and DAD, respectively), both of which are related to cardiac arrhythmia. We show the periodicity changes along the transition from the healthy action potentials to these impaired spikes. We show that while EADs are mainly periodic attractors, DAD usually comes with chaos. EADs are found inside shrimps -- isoperiodic structures of the parameter space. However, in our system, the shrimps have an internal structure made of multiple periodicities, revealing a complete devil's staircase. Understanding the periodicity of plateau attractors in slow-fast systems could come in handy to unveil the features of heart myocytes behavior that are linked to cardiac arrhythmias.</description>

      <title>Pitchfork Bifurcation In A Coupled Cell System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various biological phenomena, like cell differentiation and pattern formation in multicellular organisms, are explained using the bifurcation theory. Molecular network motifs like positive feedback and mutual repressor exhibit bifurcation and are responsible for the emergence of diverse cell types. Mathematical investigations of such problems usually focus on bifurcation in a molecular network in individual cells. However, in a multicellular organism, cells interact, and intercellular interactions affect individual cell dynamics. Therefore, the bifurcation in an ensemble of cells could differ from that for a single cell. This work considers a ring of identical cells. When independent, each cell exhibits supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. Using analytical and numerical tools, we investigate the bifurcation in this ensemble when cells interact through positive and negative coupling. We show that within a specific parameter zone, an ensemble of positively coupled cells behaves like a single cell with supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. In this regime, all cells are synchronized and have the same steady state. However, this unique behaviour is lost when cells interact through negative coupling. Apart from the synchronized (or homogenous) states, cell-cell coupling leads to certain heterogeneous steady states with unique patterns. We also investigate the distribution of such heterogeneous states under positive and negative coupling.</description>

      <title>Relativistically Magnetized Collisionless Shocks in Pair Plasma: I. Solitons, Chaos, and Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the first in a series, we present a new theoretical model for the global structure and dissipation of relativistically magnetized collisionless shock waves. Quite remarkably, we find that in contrast to unmagnetized shocks, energy dissipation does not involve collective plasma interactions. Rather, it is a consequence of nonlinear particle dynamics. We demonstrate that the kinetic-scale shock transition can be modeled as a stationary system consisting of a large set of cold beams coupled through the magnetic field. The fundamental mechanism governing shock dissipation relies on the onset of chaos in orbital dynamics within quasiperiodic solitonic structures. We discuss the impact of upstream temperature and magnetization on the shock profile, recovering the magnetic field compression, downstream velocities, and heating expected from the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions. We deduce a rate of entropy generation from the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents and discuss the thermalization of the beam distribution. Our model provides a general framework to study magnetized collisionless shock structures.</description>

      <title>Sequential data assimilation for PDEs using shape-morphing solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shape-morphing solutions (also known as evolutional deep neural networks, reduced-order nonlinear solutions, and neural Galerkin schemes) are a new class of methods for approximating the solution of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). Here, we introduce a sequential data assimilation method for incorporating observational data in a shape-morphing solution (SMS). Our method takes the form of a predictor-corrector scheme, where the observations are used to correct the SMS parameters using Newton-like iterations. Between observation points, the SMS equations (a set of ordinary differential equations) are used to evolve the solution forward in time. We prove that, under certain conditions, the data assimilated SMS (DA-SMS) converges uniformly towards the true state of the system. We demonstrate the efficacy of DA-SMS on three examples: the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a two-dimensional advection-diffusion equation. Our numerical results suggest that DA-SMS converges with relatively sparse observations and a single iteration of the Newton-like method.</description>

      <title>Deformation of invariant tori under perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study extends the functional perturbation theory~(FPT) of dynamical systems, which was initially developed for investigating the shifts of magnetic field line trajectories within the chaotic edge region of plasma when subjected to global perturbations. By contrast, invariant tori reside in the ordered regions of phase space. In magnetic confinement fusion (MCF) devices, these tori manifest as closed flux surfaces, with their nested structure governing radial transport and thus playing a critical role in confinement performance. Using the method of variation as a mathematical foundation, this Letter derives formulae that characterize the deformation of invariant tori under perturbation. These results provide new tools for targeted topology control in tokamak operations and for optimizing stellarator designs by enhancing predictive capability for flux surface behaviour.</description>

      <title>Statistics for Differential Topological Properties between Data Sets with an Application to Reservoir Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is common for researchers to record long, multiple time series from experiments or calculations. But sometimes there are no good models for the systems or no applicable mathematical theorems that can tell us when there are basic relationships between subsets of the time series data such as continuity, differentiability, embeddings, etc. The data is often higher dimensional and simple plotting will not guide us. At that point fitting the data to polynomials, Fourier series, etc. becomes uncertain. Even at the simplest level, having data that shows there is a function between the data subsets is useful and a negative answer means that more particular data fitting or analysis will be suspect and probably fail. We show here statistics that test time series subsets for basic mathematical properties and relations between them that not only indicate when more specific analyses are safe to do, but whether the systems are operating correctly. We apply these statistics to examples from reservoir computing where an important property of reservoir computers is that the reservoir system establishes an embedding of the drive system in order to make any other calculations with the reservoir computer successful.</description>

      <title>Extending 1089 attractor to any number of digits and any number of steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-known 1089 trick reflects an amazing trait of digital reversal process and reminisces of a limiting attractor in dynamical systems even though it takes only two steps. It is natural to consider the situations when the number of digits is beyond three as in the original 1089 trick, as well as situations when the number of steps is beyond two. The first part has been mostly done by Webster which we will reproduce. After two steps, the resulting integers are called Papadakis-Webster integers (PWI), which is always divisible by 99, and the resulting quotients consist of only 0's and 1's, which we name Papadakis-Webster binary strings (PWBS). Not all binary strings could be PWBS, and we define the hairpin pairing rule to determine if a binary string is a PWBS. For the second part, we propose a two-option iteration system named iterative digital reversal (IDR) suitably interweaving additions and subtractions. The simplest limiting behavior of IDR is 2-cycles. The elements in an IDR 2-cycle are all composed of repetitions of the 10(9)$_L$89 (L&gt;=0) motif, and are all PWIs. The lower 2-cycle elements after division of 99 belong to the subset of PWBS that are palindromic and consist of 0- and 1-blocks with a minimal length of two. IDR also has higher p-cycles (p=10,12,71) whose elements seem to contain at least one PWI. Another interesting finding about IDR is that it contains non-periodic and diverging trajectories, as the integer values grow to infinity. In these diverging trajectories, while the number of flanking digits around the middle point increases by the iteration, the middle part has an 8-cycle rhythm or signature which has been found in all diverging trajectories. Overall, the generalization of the original 1089 trick in both space and time leads to new patterns in integers and new phenomenology in dynamics.</description>

      <title>On building the state error covariance from a state estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently found with the aid of machine learning that for a variety of toy data assimilation systems with chaotic Lorenz-96 model it is possible to achieve a nearly-optimal data assimilation without carrying the state error covariance between cycles. This result does not look surprising on its own because not carrying covariance is the approach taken by standard 4D-Var, but it was found ``astonishing'' in the context of the machine learning-based system trained on the ensemble Kalman filter. This note proposes two algorithms for building the state error covariance from a state estimate that yield good performance and could be worked out by the deep learning-based system.</description>

      <title>Limitations of the Generalized Pareto Distribution-based estimators for the local dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two dynamical indicators, the local dimension and the extremal index, used to quantify persistence in phase space have been developed and applied to different data across various disciplines. These are computed using the asymptotic limit of exceedances over a threshold, which turns to be a Generalized Pareto Distribution in many cases. However the derivation of the asymptotic distribution requires mathematical properties which are not present even in highly idealized dynamical systems, and unlikely to be present in real data. Here we examine in detail issues that arise when estimating these quantities for some known dynamical systems with a particular focus on how the geometry of an invariant set can affect the regularly varying properties of the invariant measure. We demonstrate that singular measures supported on sets of non-integer dimension are typically not regularly varying and that the absence of regular variation makes the estimates resolution dependent. We show as well that the most common extremal index estimation method is ambiguous for continuous time processes sampled at fixed time steps, which is an underlying assumption in its application to data.</description>
