      <title>Integrated Communication, Localization, and Sensing in 6G D-MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future generations of mobile networks call for concurrent sensing and communication functionalities in the same hardware and/or spectrum. Compared to communication, sensing services often suffer from limited coverage, due to the high path loss of the reflected signal and the increased infrastructure requirements. To provide a more uniform quality of service, distributed multiple input multiple output (D-MIMO) systems deploy a large number of distributed nodes and efficiently control them, making distributed integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) possible. In this paper, we investigate ISAC in D-MIMO through the lens of different design architectures and deployments, revealing both conflicts and synergies. In addition, simulation and demonstration results reveal both opportunities and challenges towards the implementation of ISAC in D-MIMO.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-Loveland betting strategies lose the Betting game on open sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If Kolmogorov-Loveland randomness (KLR) is the same as Martin-L\"of randomness (MLR) is a major open problem in the study of algorithmic randomness. More general classes of betting strategies than Kolmogorov-Loveland ones have been studied in \cite{MMS, Rute, TP} and in each case it was proven that the class induces a notion of randomness equivalent to MLR. In all of those proofs it was shown that the class contains a finite set of betting strategies such that for any given bound, when betting on a binary sequence contained in an effective open set of small enough measure, at least one of the betting strategies in the set earns capital larger than the bound. We show that the class of Kolmogorov-Loveland betting strategies does not have this property.</description>

      <title>Jamming Intrusions in Extreme Bandwidth Communication: A Comprehensive Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the evolution of wireless communication progresses towards 6G networks, extreme bandwidth communication (EBC) emerges as a key enabler to meet the ambitious key performance indicator set for this next-generation technology. 6G aims for peak data rates of 1 Tb/s, peak spectral efficiency of 60 b/s/Hz, maximum bandwidth of 100 GHz, and mobility support up to 1000 km/h, while maintaining a high level of security. The capability of 6G to manage enormous data volumes introduces heightened security vulnerabilities, such as jamming attacks, highlighting the critical need for in-depth research into jamming in EBC. Understanding these attacks is vital for developing robust countermeasures, ensuring 6G networks can maintain their integrity and reliability amidst these advanced threats. Recognizing the paramount importance of security in 6G applications, this survey paper explores prevalent jamming attacks and the corresponding countermeasures in EBC technologies such as millimeter wave, terahertz, free-space optical, and visible light communications. By comprehensively reviewing the literature on jamming in EBC, this survey paper aims to provide a valuable resource for researchers, engineers, and policymakers involved in the development and deployment of 6G networks. Understanding the nuances of jamming in different EBC technologies is essential for devising robust security mechanisms and ensuring the success of 6G communication systems in the face of emerging threats.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Framework for Out-of-Distribution Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization in machine learning and propose a general framework that provides information-theoretic generalization bounds. Our framework interpolates freely between Integral Probability Metric (IPM) and $f$-divergence, which naturally recovers some known results (including Wasserstein- and KL-bounds), as well as yields new generalization bounds. Moreover, we show that our framework admits an optimal transport interpretation. When evaluated in two concrete examples, the proposed bounds either strictly improve upon existing bounds in some cases or recover the best among existing OOD generalization bounds.</description>

      <title>Joint Training and Reflection Pattern Optimization for Non-Ideal RIS-Aided Multiuser Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technique to improve the performance of future wireless communication systems at low energy consumption. To reap the potential benefits of RIS-aided beamforming, it is vital to enhance the accuracy of channel estimation. In this paper, we consider an RIS-aided multiuser system with non-ideal reflecting elements, each of which has a phase-dependent reflecting amplitude, and we aim to minimize the mean-squared error (MSE) of the channel estimation by jointly optimizing the training signals at the user equipments (UEs) and the reflection pattern at the RIS. As examples the least squares (LS) and linear minimum MSE (LMMSE) estimators are considered. The considered problems do not admit simple solution mainly due to the complicated constraints pertaining to the non-ideal RIS reflecting elements. As far as the LS criterion is concerned, we tackle this difficulty by first proving the optimality of orthogonal training symbols and then propose a majorization-minimization (MM)-based iterative method to design the reflection pattern, where a semi-closed form solution is obtained in each iteration. As for the LMMSE criterion, we address the joint training and reflection pattern optimization problem with an MM-based alternating algorithm, where a closed-form solution to the training symbols and a semi-closed form solution to the RIS reflecting coefficients are derived, respectively. Furthermore, an acceleration scheme is proposed to improve the convergence rate of the proposed MM algorithms. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the performance advantages of our proposed joint training and reflection pattern designs.</description>

      <title>Secure Full-Duplex Communication via Movable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates physical layer security (PLS) for a movable antenna (MA)-assisted full-duplex (FD) system. In this system, an FD base station (BS) with multiple MAs for transmission and reception provides services for an uplink (UL) user and a downlink (DL) user. Each user operates in half-duplex (HD) mode and is equipped with a single fixed-position antenna (FPA), in the presence of a single-FPA eavesdropper (Eve). To ensure secure communication, artificial noise (AN) is transmitted to obstruct the interception of Eve. The objective of this paper is to maximize the sum secrecy rate (SSR) of the UL and DL users by jointly optimizing the beamformers of the BS and the positions of MAs. This paper also proposes an alternating optimization (AO) method to address the non-convex problem, which decomposes the optimization problem into three subproblems and solves them iteratively. Simulation results demonstrate a significant performance gain in the SSR achieved by the proposed scheme compared to the benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>A Signature Based Approach Towards Global Channel Charting with Ultra Low Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel charting, an unsupervised learning method that learns a low-dimensional representation from channel information to preserve geometrical property of physical space of user equipments (UEs), has drawn many attentions from both academic and industrial communities, because it can facilitate many downstream tasks, such as indoor localization, UE handover, beam management, and so on. However, many previous works mainly focus on charting that only preserves local geometry and use raw channel information to learn the chart, which do not consider the global geometry and are often computationally intensive and very time-consuming. Therefore, in this paper, a novel signature based approach for global channel charting with ultra low complexity is proposed. By using an iterated-integral based method called signature transform, a compact feature map and a novel distance metric are proposed, which enable channel charting with ultra low complexity and preserving both local and global geometry. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method using synthetic and open-source real-field datasets.</description>

      <title>Recovery Sets of Subspaces from a Simplex Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovery sets for vectors and subspaces are important in the construction of distributed storage system codes. These concepts are also interesting in their own right. In this paper, we consider the following very basic recovery question: what is the maximum number of possible pairwise disjoint recovery sets for each recovered element? The recovered elements in this work are d-dimensional subspaces of a $k$-dimensional vector space over GF(q). Each server stores one representative for each distinct one-dimensional subspace of the k-dimensional vector space, or equivalently a distinct point of PG(k-1,q). As column vectors, the associated vectors of the stored one-dimensional subspaces form the generator matrix of the $[(q^k -1)/(q-1),k,q^{k-1}]$ simplex code over GF(q). Lower bounds and upper bounds on the maximum number of such recovery sets are provided. It is shown that generally, these bounds are either tight or very close to being tight.</description>

      <title>Minimizing End-to-End Latency for Joint Source-Channel Coding Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While existing studies have highlighted the advantages of deep learning (DL)-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) schemes in enhancing transmission efficiency, they often overlook the crucial aspect of resource management during the deployment phase. In this paper, we propose an approach to minimize the transmission latency in an uplink JSCC-based system. We first analyze the correlation between end-to-end latency and task performance, based on which the end-to-end delay model for each device is established. Then, we formulate a non-convex optimization problem aiming at minimizing the maximum end-to-end latency across all devices, which is proved to be NP-hard. We then transform the original problem into a more tractable one, from which we derive the closed form solution on the optimal compression ratio, truncation threshold selection policy, and resource allocation strategy. We further introduce a heuristic algorithm with low complexity, leveraging insights from the structure of the optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that both the proposed optimal algorithm and the heuristic algorithm significantly reduce end-to-end latency. Notably, the proposed heuristic algorithm achieves nearly the same performance to the optimal solution but with considerably lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Sensing and Communication for ISAC Networks: Performance Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks intending to effectively balance sensing and communication (S&amp;C) performance at the network level. Through the simultaneous utilization of multi-point (CoMP) coordinated joint transmission and distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar techniques, we propose a cooperative networked ISAC scheme to enhance both S&amp;C services. Then, the tool of stochastic geometry is exploited to capture the S&amp;C performance, which allows us to illuminate key cooperative dependencies in the ISAC network. Remarkably, the derived expression of the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the localization accuracy unveils a significant finding: Deploying $N$ ISAC transceivers yields an enhanced sensing performance across the entire network, in accordance with the $\ln^2N$ scaling law. Simulation results demonstrate that compared to the time-sharing scheme, the proposed cooperative ISAC scheme can effectively improve the average data rate and reduce the CRLB.</description>

      <title>Multi-Antenna Dual-Blind Deconvolution for Joint Radar-Communications via SoMAN Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In joint radar-communications (JRC) applications such as secure military receivers, often the radar and communications signals are overlaid in the received signal. In these passive listening outposts, the signals and channels of both radar and communications are unknown to the receiver. The ill-posed problem of recovering all signal and channel parameters from the overlaid signal is termed as \textit{dual-blind deconvolution} (DBD). In this work, we investigate DBD for a multi-antenna receiver. We model the radar and communications channels with a few (sparse) \textit{continuous-valued} parameters such as time delays, Doppler velocities, and directions-of-arrival (DoAs). To solve this highly ill-posed DBD, we propose to minimize the sum of multivariate atomic norms (SoMAN) that depend on unknown parameters. To this end, we devise an exact semidefinite program using theories of positive hyperoctant trigonometric polynomials (PhTP). Our theoretical analyses show that the minimum number of samples and antennas required for perfect recovery is logarithmically dependent on the maximum of the number of radar targets and communications paths rather than their sum. We show that our approach is easily generalized to include several practical issues such as gain/phase errors and additive noise. Numerical experiments show the exact parameter recovery for different JRC scenarios.</description>

      <title>Greedy Poisson Rejection Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15313v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-shot channel simulation is a fundamental data compression problem concerned with encoding a single sample from a target distribution $Q$ using a coding distribution $P$ using as few bits as possible on average. Algorithms that solve this problem find applications in neural data compression and differential privacy and can serve as a more efficient alternative to quantization-based methods. Sadly, existing solutions are too slow or have limited applicability, preventing widespread adoption. In this paper, we conclusively solve one-shot channel simulation for one-dimensional problems where the target-proposal density ratio is unimodal by describing an algorithm with optimal runtime. We achieve this by constructing a rejection sampling procedure equivalent to greedily searching over the points of a Poisson process. Hence, we call our algorithm greedy Poisson rejection sampling (GPRS) and analyze the correctness and time complexity of several of its variants. Finally, we empirically verify our theorems, demonstrating that GPRS significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art method, A* coding. Our code is available at https://github.com/gergely-flamich/greedy-poisson-rejection-sampling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galois self-orthogonal (SO) codes are generalizations of Euclidean and Hermitian SO codes. Algebraic geometry (AG) codes are the first known class of linear codes exceeding the Gilbert-Varshamov bound. Both of them have attracted much attention for their rich algebraic structures and wide applications in these years. In this paper, we consider them together and study Galois SO AG codes. A criterion for an AG code being Galois SO is presented. Based on this criterion, we construct several new classes of maximum distance separable (MDS) Galois SO AG codes from projective lines and several new classes of Galois SO AG codes from projective elliptic curves, hyper-elliptic curves and hermitian curves. In addition, we give an embedding method that allows us to obtain more MDS Galois SO codes from known MDS Galois SO AG codes.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Distortion: Unifying Fidelity and Realism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a distortion measure for images, Wasserstein distortion, that simultaneously generalizes pixel-level fidelity on the one hand and realism or perceptual quality on the other. We show how Wasserstein distortion reduces to a pure fidelity constraint or a pure realism constraint under different parameter choices and discuss its metric properties. Pairs of images that are close under Wasserstein distortion illustrate its utility. In particular, we generate random textures that have high fidelity to a reference texture in one location of the image and smoothly transition to an independent realization of the texture as one moves away from this point. Wasserstein distortion attempts to generalize and unify prior work on texture generation, image realism and distortion, and models of the early human visual system, in the form of an optimizable metric in the mathematical sense.</description>

      <title>Length 3 Check Digit Codes with Grouped Tags and Disjoint Coding Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1969 J. Verhoeff provided the first examples of a decimal error detecting code using a single check digit to provide protection against all single, transposition, and adjacent twin errors. The three codes he presented are length 3-digit codes with 2 information digits. To date, the existence of a length 4-digit code with 3 information digits having these properties remains an open question. Existence of a 4-digit code would imply the existence of 10 disjoint 3-digit codes. Apparently, no pair of such disjoint 3-digit codes is known. Phonetic errors, where 2-digit pairs of the forms X0 and 1X are interchanged, are language dependent, but can often be eliminated.
  Alternate 3-digit codes are developed here which enhance the level of protection beyond Verhoeff's codes while still optionally providing protection against phonetic errors. Through almost-disjoint coding schemes, it is shown how copies of these new codes can fill in the gap between such 3 and 4-digit codes. The results are extended to other useful alphabet sizes such as 26 and 36 with stronger permutation of digits error detection, and to "tag codes" where digits are grouped.</description>

      <title>Power-Aware Sparse Reflect Beamforming in Active RIS-aided Interference Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has attracted significant attention in wireless communications, due to its reflecting elements (REs) capable of reflecting incident signals with not only phase shifts but also amplitude amplifications. In this paper, we are interested in active RIS-aided interference channels in which $K$ user pairs share the same time and frequency resources with the aid of active RIS. Thanks to the promising amplitude amplification capability, activating a moderate number of REs, rather than all of them, is sufficient for the active RIS to mitigate cross-channel interferences. Motivated by this, we propose a power-aware sparse reflect beamforming design for the active RIS-aided interference channels, which allows the active RIS to flexibly adjust the number of activated REs for the sake of reducing hardware and power costs. Specifically, we establish the power consumption model in which only those activated REs consume the biasing and operation power that supports the amplitude amplification, yielding an $\ell_0$-norm power consumption function. Based on the proposed model, we investigate a sum-rate maximization problem and an active RIS power minimization problem by carefully designing the sparse reflect beamforming vector. To solve these problems, we first replace the nonconvex $\ell_0$-norm function with an iterative reweighted $\ell_1$-norm function. Then, fractional programming is used to solve the sum-rate maximization, while semidefinite programming together with the difference-of-convex algorithm (DCA) is used to solve the active RIS power minimization. Numerical results show that the proposed sparse designs can notably increase the sum rate of user pairs and decrease the power consumption of active RIS in interference channels.</description>

Abstract: We study sheaves on posets, showing that cosystolic expansion of such sheaves can be derived from local expansion conditions of the sheaf and the poset (typically a high dimensional expander). When the poset at hand is a cell complex, a sheaf on it may be thought of as generalizing coefficient groups used for defining homology and cohomology, by letting the coefficient group vary along the cell complex. Previous works established local criteria for cosystolic expansion only for simplicial complexes and with respect to constant coefficients. Cosystolic expansion of sheaves is related to property testing. We use this relation and our local criterion for cosystolic expansion to give two applications to locally testable codes (LTCs).
  First, we show the existence of good $2$-query LTCs. These codes are related to the recent good $q$-query LTCs of Dinur et. al and Panteleev-Kalachev, being the formers' so-called line codes, but we get them from a new, more illuminating perspective, namely, by realizing them as cocycle codes of sheaves over posets. We then derive their good properties directly from our criterion for cosystolic expansion.
  Second, we give a local criterion for a a lifted code (with some auxiliary structure) to be locally testable. This improves on a previous work of Dikstein et. al, where it was shown that one can obtain local testability of lifted codes from a mixture of local and global conditions.</description>
