      <title>Theory for Quantum Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.13436v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum gravity (or quantum spacetime) is to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics into a single theoretical framework and presented as the most important open puzzle in fundamental physics. The development of a microscopic theory of quantum spacetime becomes the key problem about quantum gravity. This paper is the solution to this problem. The starting point of this paper is very simple -- physical variant with higher-order variability (see the below discussion). Based on this simple starting point, a microscopic theory for quantum spacetime is developed, including its matrix representation for quantum states, its time evolution, its geometry quantization, its generalized symmetry, its canonical quantization, and the uncertainty principle, black hole, AdS/CFT correspondence, scattering amplitudes of gravitons... The result leads to a great unification of matter and spacetime -- the particles constitute the basic blocks of spacetime and spacetime is really a multi-particle system that is made of matter. As a result, this work would help researchers to understand the mysteries in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Test of a theory of the Mott quantum-measurement problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mott problem asks: Is there a microphysical mechanism - based only on Schroedinger's equation - that explains why an alpha particle emitted in a spherically symmetric nuclear decay produces a non-spherically-symmetric single track in a cloud chamber? This is a variant of the more general quantum measurement problem. Earlier, I proposed such a mechanism, drawing on quantum-mechanical Coulomb scattering and the thermal behavior of supersaturated vapors. I found that the probability that a track originates at distance R from the decay source is proportional to 1/R^2, with a proportionality constant that I expressed in terms of more fundamental parameters but was unable to estimate at the time. I tested the 1/R^2 law opportunistically using cloud chamber video from the Internet. Here, I draw on chemical physics to independently estimate the proportionality constant. The estimate is within a factor 1-2 of a value extracted directly from the data.</description>

      <title>Quantum Physics -- A Theory of Dynamics for "Space" on Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Till now, the foundation of quantum physics is still mysterious. To explore the mysteries in the foundation of quantum physics, people always take it for granted that quantum processes must be some types of fields/objects on a rigid space. In this paper, we give a new idea -- the space is no more rigid and the matter is the certain changing of "space" itself rather than extra things on it. Based on this starting point, we develop a new framework based on quantum and classical mechanics. Now, physical laws emerge from different changings of regular changings on spacetime. Then, both quantum mechanics and classical mechanics become phenomenological theories and are interpreted by using the concepts of the microscopic properties of a single physical framework. In particular, the expanding/contracting dynamics for "space" leads to quantum physics. This will have a far-reaching impact on modern physics in the future.</description>

      <title>Estimated scale of Born rule violation in superconducting qubit measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I estimate the size of expected Born rule violation for a two-level superconducting qubit with dispersive readout. The estimate is based on extrapolating from an earlier analysis of experimental data on cloud chamber detection. That analysis made no explicit use of quantum measurement axioms and found indication that the Born rule breaks down when it would otherwise naively predict extremely small measurement probabilities. In such cases, the Born rule significantly over-predicts the number of measurement events. The level of breakdown that I estimate here for the two-level qubit may be too small to have a meaningful impact on practical quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between the pair correlation functions of primes and of spins in a two-dimensional Ising model with randomly distributed competing interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we prove the equivalence between the pair correlation functions of primes, and of spins in a two-dimensional (2D) Ising model with a mixture of ferromagnetic and randomly distributed competing interactions. At first, we prove that the correlation function between a pair of spins in a distance l within the 2D Ising model is larger than zero at whole temperature region. Second, we prove that the pair correlation function of spins in the model is equivalent to the pair correlation function of its energy levels. Third, we prove that the energy-energy correlation function of the model is equivalent to the pair correlation function of nontrivial zeros of the Dirichlet function (including the Riemann zeta function). Fourth, we prove that the pair correlation function between the nontrivial zeros of the Dirichlet function is equivalent to the correlation function between a pair of primes p and p+q for every even q. In a conclusion, we have proven that the pair correlation function of primes p and p+q for every even q is larger than zero.</description>
