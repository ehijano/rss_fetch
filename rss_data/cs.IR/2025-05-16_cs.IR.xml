      <title>The Impact of International Collaborations with Highly Publishing Countries in Computer Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes international collaborations in Computer Science, focusing on three major players: China, the European Union, and the United States. Drawing from a comprehensive literature review, we examine collaboration patterns, research impact, retraction rates, and the role of the Development Index in shaping research outcomes. Our findings show that while China, the EU, and the US lead global research efforts, other regions are narrowing the gap in publication volume. Collaborations involving these key regions tend to have lower retraction rates, reflecting stronger adherence to scientific standards. We also find that countries with a Very High Development Index contribute to research with higher citation rates and fewer retractions. Overall, this study highlights the value of international collaboration and the importance of inclusive, ethical practices in advancing global research in Computer Science.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Large Language Models in Multimodal Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal recommender systems (MRS) integrate heterogeneous user and item data, such as text, images, and structured information, to enhance recommendation performance. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) introduces new opportunities for MRS by enabling semantic reasoning, in-context learning, and dynamic input handling. Compared to earlier pre-trained language models (PLMs), LLMs offer greater flexibility and generalisation capabilities but also introduce challenges related to scalability and model accessibility. This survey presents a comprehensive review of recent work at the intersection of LLMs and MRS, focusing on prompting strategies, fine-tuning methods, and data adaptation techniques. We propose a novel taxonomy to characterise integration patterns, identify transferable techniques from related recommendation domains, provide an overview of evaluation metrics and datasets, and point to possible future directions. We aim to clarify the emerging role of LLMs in multimodal recommendation and support future research in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Beyond Pairwise Learning-To-Rank At Airbnb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are three fundamental asks from a ranking algorithm: it should scale to handle a large number of items, sort items accurately by their utility, and impose a total order on the items for logical consistency. But here's the catch-no algorithm can achieve all three at the same time. We call this limitation the SAT theorem for ranking algorithms. Given the dilemma, how can we design a practical system that meets user needs? Our current work at Airbnb provides an answer, with a working solution deployed at scale. We start with pairwise learning-to-rank (LTR) models-the bedrock of search ranking tech stacks today. They scale linearly with the number of items ranked and perform strongly on metrics like NDCG by learning from pairwise comparisons. They are at a sweet spot of performance vs. cost, making them an ideal choice for several industrial applications. However, they have a drawback-by ignoring interactions between items, they compromise on accuracy. To improve accuracy, we create a "true" pairwise LTR model-one that captures interactions between items during pairwise comparisons. But accuracy comes at the expense of scalability and total order, and we discuss strategies to counter these challenges. For greater accuracy, we take each item in the search result, and compare it against the rest of the items along two dimensions: (1) Superiority: How strongly do searchers prefer the given item over the remaining ones? (2) Similarity: How similar is the given item to all the other items? This forms the basis of our "all-pairwise" LTR framework, which factors in interactions across all items at once. Looking at items on the search result page all together-superiority and similarity combined-gives us a deeper understanding of what searchers truly want. We quantify the resulting improvements in searcher experience through offline and online experiments at Airbnb.</description>

      <title>Boosting Text-to-Chart Retrieval through Training with Synthesized Semantic Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charts are crucial for data analysis and decision-making.Text-to-chart retrieval systems have become increasingly important for Business Intelligence (BI), where users need to find relevant charts that match their analytical needs. These needs can be categorized into precise queries that are well-specified and fuzzy queries that are more exploratory -- both require understanding the semantics and context of the charts. However, existing text-to-chart retrieval solutions often fail to capture the semantic content and contextual information of charts, primarily due to the lack of comprehensive metadata (or semantic insights). To address this limitation, we propose a training data development pipeline that automatically synthesizes hierarchical semantic insights for charts, covering visual patterns (visual-oriented), statistical properties (statistics-oriented), and practical applications (task-oriented), which produces 207,498 semantic insights for 69,166 charts. Based on these, we train a CLIP-based model named ChartFinder to learn better representations of charts for text-to-chart retrieval. Our method leverages rich semantic insights during the training phase to develop a model that understands both visual and semantic aspects of charts.To evaluate text-to-chart retrieval performance, we curate the first benchmark, CRBench, for this task with 21,862 charts and 326 text queries from real-world BI applications, with ground-truth labels verified by the crowd workers.Experiments show that ChartFinder significantly outperforms existing methods in text-to-chart retrieval tasks across various settings. For precise queries, ChartFinder achieves up to 66.9% NDCG@10, which is 11.58% higher than state-of-the-art models. In fuzzy query tasks, our method also demonstrates consistent improvements, with an average increase of 5% across nearly all metrics.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs Memorize Recommendation Datasets? A Preliminary Study on MovieLens-1M</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly central to recommendation scenarios due to their remarkable natural language understanding and generation capabilities. Although significant research has explored the use of LLMs for various recommendation tasks, little effort has been dedicated to verifying whether they have memorized public recommendation dataset as part of their training data. This is undesirable because memorization reduces the generalizability of research findings, as benchmarking on memorized datasets does not guarantee generalization to unseen datasets. Furthermore, memorization can amplify biases, for example, some popular items may be recommended more frequently than others.
  In this work, we investigate whether LLMs have memorized public recommendation datasets. Specifically, we examine two model families (GPT and Llama) across multiple sizes, focusing on one of the most widely used dataset in recommender systems: MovieLens-1M. First, we define dataset memorization as the extent to which item attributes, user profiles, and user-item interactions can be retrieved by prompting the LLMs. Second, we analyze the impact of memorization on recommendation performance. Lastly, we examine whether memorization varies across model families and model sizes. Our results reveal that all models exhibit some degree of memorization of MovieLens-1M, and that recommendation performance is related to the extent of memorization. We have made all the code publicly available at: https://github.com/sisinflab/LLM-MemoryInspector</description>

      <title>Signed Latent Factors for Spamming Activity Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the increasing trend of performing spamming activities (e.g., Web spam, deceptive reviews, fake followers, etc.) on various online platforms to gain undeserved benefits, spam detection has emerged as a hot research issue. Previous attempts to combat spam mainly employ features related to metadata, user behaviors, or relational ties. These studies have made considerable progress in understanding and filtering spamming campaigns. However, this problem remains far from fully solved. Almost all the proposed features focus on a limited number of observed attributes or explainable phenomena, making it difficult for existing methods to achieve further improvement. To broaden the vision about solving the spam problem and address long-standing challenges (class imbalance and graph incompleteness) in the spam detection area, we propose a new attempt of utilizing signed latent factors to filter fraudulent activities. The spam-contaminated relational datasets of multiple online applications in this scenario are interpreted by the unified signed network. Two competitive and highly dissimilar algorithms of latent factors mining (LFM) models are designed based on multi-relational likelihoods estimation (LFM-MRLE) and signed pairwise ranking (LFM-SPR), respectively. We then explore how to apply the mined latent factors to spam detection tasks. Experiments on real-world datasets of different kinds of Web applications (social media and Web forum) indicate that LFM models outperform state-of-the-art baselines in detecting spamming activities. By specifically manipulating experimental data, the effectiveness of our methods in dealing with incomplete and imbalanced challenges is validated.</description>

      <title>SAKR: Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Streaming Algorithm and K-Means Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21300v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has achieved significant success in information retrieval to assist large language models LLMs because it builds an external knowledge database. However, it also has many problems, it consumes a lot of memory because of the enormous database, and it cannot update the established index database in time when confronted with massive streaming data. To reduce the memory required for building the database and maintain accuracy simultaneously, we proposed a new approach integrating a streaming algorithm with k-means clustering into RAG. Our approach applied a streaming algorithm to update the index dynamically and reduce memory consumption. Additionally, the k-means algorithm clusters highly similar documents, and the query time would be shortened. We conducted comparative experiments on four methods, and the results indicated that RAG with streaming algorithm and k-means clusters outperforms traditional RAG in accuracy and memory, particularly when dealing with large-scale streaming data.</description>

      <title>FedPCL-CDR: A Federated Prototype-based Contrastive Learning Framework for Privacy-Preserving Cross-domain Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to improve recommendation accuracy in sparse domains by transferring knowledge from data-rich domains. However, existing CDR approaches often assume that user-item interaction data across domains is publicly available, neglecting user privacy concerns. Additionally, they experience performance degradation with sparse overlapping users due to their reliance on a large number of fully shared users for knowledge transfer. To address these challenges, we propose a Federated Prototype-based Contrastive Learning (CL) framework for Privacy Preserving CDR, called FedPCL-CDR. This approach utilizes non-overlapping user information and differential prototypes to improve model performance within a federated learning framework. FedPCL-CDR comprises two key modules: local domain (client) learning and global server aggregation. In the local domain, FedPCL-CDR first clusters all user data and utilizes local differential privacy (LDP) to learn differential prototypes, effectively utilizing non-overlapping user information and protecting user privacy. It then conducts knowledge transfer by employing both local and global prototypes returned from the server in a CL manner. Meanwhile, the global server aggregates differential prototypes sent from local domains to learn both local and global prototypes. Extensive experiments on four CDR tasks across Amazon and Douban datasets demonstrate that FedPCL-CDR surpasses SOTA baselines. We release our code at https://github.com/Lili1013/FedPCL CDR</description>

      <title>Shallow AutoEncoding Recommender with Cold Start Handling via Side Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02288v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: User and item cold starts present significant challenges in industrial applications of recommendation systems. Supplementing user-item interaction data with metadata is a common solution-but often at the cost of introducing additional biases. In this work, we introduce an augmented EASE model that seamlessly integrates both user and item side information to address these cold start issues. Our straightforward, autoencoder-based method produces a closed-form solution that leverages rich content signals for cold items while refining user representations in data-sparse environments. Importantly, our method strikes a balance by effectively recommending cold start items and handling cold start users without incurring extra bias, and it maintains strong performance in warm settings. Experimental results demonstrate improved recommendation accuracy and robustness compared to previous collaborative filtering approaches. Moreover, our model serves as a strong baseline for future comparative studies.</description>

      <title>Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning for Multi-Objective Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective learning endeavors to concurrently optimize multiple objectives using a single model, aiming to achieve high and balanced performance across diverse objectives. However, this often entails a more complex optimization problem, particularly when navigating potential conflicts between objectives, leading to solutions with higher memory requirements and computational complexity. This paper introduces a Multi-Objective Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning (MOGCSL) framework for automatically learning to achieve multiple objectives from offline sequential data. MOGCSL extends the conventional GCSL method to multi-objective scenarios by redefining goals from one-dimensional scalars to multi-dimensional vectors. It benefits from naturally eliminating the need for complex architectures and optimization constraints. Moreover, MOGCSL effectively filters out uninformative or noisy instances that fail to achieve desirable long-term rewards across multiple objectives. We also introduces a novel goal-selection algorithm for MOGCSL to model and identify "high" achievable goals for inference.
  While MOGCSL is quite general, we focus on its application to the next action prediction problem in commercial-grade recommender systems. In this context, any viable solution needs to be reasonably scalable and also be robust to large amounts of noisy data that is characteristic of this application space. We show that MOGCSL performs admirably on both counts by extensive experiments on real-world recommendation datasets. Also, analysis and experiments are included to explain its strength in discounting the noisier portions of training data in recommender systems with multiple objectives.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Modality Bias in Multi-modal Entity Alignment from a Causal Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19458v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-Modal Entity Alignment (MMEA) aims to retrieve equivalent entities from different Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), a critical information retrieval task. Existing studies have explored various fusion paradigms and consistency constraints to improve the alignment of equivalent entities, while overlooking that the visual modality may not always contribute positively. Empirically, entities with low-similarity images usually generate unsatisfactory performance, highlighting the limitation of overly relying on visual features. We believe the model can be biased toward the visual modality, leading to a shortcut image-matching task. To address this, we propose a counterfactual debiasing framework for MMEA, termed CDMEA, which investigates visual modality bias from a causal perspective. Our approach aims to leverage both visual and graph modalities to enhance MMEA while suppressing the direct causal effect of the visual modality on model predictions. By estimating the Total Effect (TE) of both modalities and excluding the Natural Direct Effect (NDE) of the visual modality, we ensure that the model predicts based on the Total Indirect Effect (TIE), effectively utilizing both modalities and reducing visual modality bias. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmark datasets show that CDMEA outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods, especially in low-similarity, high-noise, and low-resource data scenarios.</description>
