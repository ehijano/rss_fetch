      <title>Consumption-portfolio choice with preferences for liquid assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an infinite horizon, discounted, consumption-portfolio problem in a market with one bond, one liquid risky asset, and one illiquid risky asset with proportional transaction costs. We consider an agent with liquidity preference, modeled by a Cobb-Douglas utility function that includes the liquid wealth. We analyze the properties of the value function and divide the solvency region into three regions: the buying region, the no-trading region, and the selling region, and prove that all three regions are non-empty. We mathematically characterize and numerically solve the optimal policy and prove its optimality. Our numerical analysis sheds light on the impact of various parameters on the optimal policy, and some intuition and economic insights behind it are also analyzed. We find that liquidity preference encourages agents to retain more liquid wealth and inhibits consumption, and may even result in a negative allocation to the illiquid asset. The liquid risky asset not only affects the location of the three regions but also has an impact on consumption. However, whether this impact on consumption is promoted or inhibited depends on the degree of risk aversion of agents.</description>

      <title>N-player and mean field games among fund managers considering excess logarithmic returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the competition among multiple fund managers with relative performance over the excess logarithmic return. Fund managers compete with each other and have expected utility or mean-variance criteria for excess logarithmic return.
  Each fund manager possesses a unique risky asset, and all fund managers can also invest in a public risk-free asset and a public risk asset. We construct both an $n$-player game and a mean field game (MFG) to address the competition problem under these two criteria. We explicitly define and rigorously solve the equilibrium and mean field equilibrium (MFE) for each criteria. In the four models, the excess logarithmic return as the evaluation criterion of the fund leads to the { allocation fractions} being constant. The introduction of the public risky asset yields different outcomes, with competition primarily affecting the investment in public assets, particularly evident in the MFG. We demonstrate that the MFE of the MFG represents the limit of the $n$-player game's equilibrium as the competitive scale $n$ approaches infinity. Finally, the sensitivity analyses of the equilibrium are given.</description>
