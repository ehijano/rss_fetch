      <title>Effects of self-consistent extended Hubbard interactions and spin-orbit couplings on energy bands of semiconductors and topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A first-principles computational method with self-consistent on-site and inter-site Hubbard functionals is able to treat local and non-local Coulomb interactions on an equal footing. To apply the method to understand solids with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), we have extended a psuedohybrid functional approach developed by Agapito-Curtarolo-Buongiorno Nardelli to implement self-consistent extended Hubbard energy functionals for noncollinear spin states. With this, energy bands of semiconductors with various SOC strengths such as Si, Ge, GaAs, GaSb, CdSe and PdO are obtained, agreeing with results from fully relativistic $GW$ approximation (FR-GWA) as well as experiments. We also compute energy gaps of HgTe, CuTlS$_2$, and CuTlSe$_2$ and assign them to be topological insulators correctly, unlike characteristic failures for judging topological properties from typical hybrid functionals. We demonstrate feasibility of our method to handle large systems by computing surface bands of topological insulators, Bi$_{\text{2}}$Se$_{\text{3}}$ and Bi$_2$Te$_3$ with varying thickness up to eight quintuple layers. Considering its low computational cost comparable to conventional {\it ab intio} methods and improved accuracy to FR-GWA, we expect that our method provides an opportunity to study large scale correlated systems with the strong SOC efficiently and reliably.</description>

      <title>Inside the Working Mechanism of Meta-generalized Gradient Density Functional Approximations: The Example of Quantum Spin-Hall Insulator 1T`-WTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators have attracted intensive experimental and theoretical studies due to their beneficial applications in spintronic devices. Density functional theory (DFT) meets challenges when describing the electronic structure of QSH materials. Only the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is effective in revealing the band opening in the typical QSH 1T`-WTe2, but with increased computational demands. Here, using DFT, Wannier function simulations, the screened hybrid HSE06 functional, and first-principles-based many body perturbation theory GW, we investigate the sensitive electronic structure in monolayer 1T`-WTe2, with advanced meta-generalized gradient (meta-GGA) density functional approximations. The success of the recent SCAN and r2SCAN meta-GGAs left their predecessor meta-GGA made very simple (MVS) ignored by the scientific community. Largely unnoticed were the increased band gaps of MVS compared to any semilocal approximation including SCAN. We find that the non-empirical MVS approximation yields a positive fundamental band gap, without any help from exact exchange, Hubbard U, or SOC correction. We explain the success of the meta-GGA MVS for the band gap in 1T`-WTe2 by presenting two working mechanisms in meta-GGA approximations. Besides, we point out the difficulty of using G0W0 for 1T`-WTe2. Although the single shot GW correction with an MVS reference yields a smaller band gap than GW with PBE, the G0W0@MVS is still not suitable for simulating 1T`-WTe2, due to its negative band gap. These DFT and beyond DFT results highlight the importance of meta-GGAs and novel construction schemes with enhanced kinetic energy density dependence. The MVS approximation re-appears as an appealing alternative for accurately describing 1T`-WTe2, paving an efficient way for exploring other two-dimensional QSH materials in high-throughput calculations.</description>

      <title>Unusual charge density wave introduced by Janus structure in monolayer vanadium dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a fundamental structural feature, the symmetry of materials determines the exotic quantum properties in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with charge density wave (CDW). Breaking the inversion symmetry, the Janus structure, an artificially constructed lattice, provides an opportunity to tune the CDW states and the related properties. However, limited by the difficulties in atomic-level fabrication and material stability, the experimental visualization of the CDW states in 2D TMDs with Janus structure is still rare. Here, using surface selenization of VTe2, we fabricated monolayer Janus VTeSe. With scanning tunneling microscopy, an unusual root13-root13 CDW state with threefold rotational symmetry breaking was observed and characterized. Combined with theoretical calculations, we find this CDW state can be attributed to the charge modulation in the Janus VTeSe, beyond the conventional electron-phonon coupling. Our findings provide a promising platform for studying the CDW states and artificially tuning the electronic properties toward the applications.</description>

      <title>Spin polarisation and non-isotropic effective mass in the conduction band of GdN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GdN is a ferromagnetic semiconductor which has seen increasing interest in the preceding decades particularly in the areas of spin- and superconducting- based electronics. Here we report a detailed computational study and optical spectroscopy study of the electronic structure of stoichiometric and nitrogen vacancy doped GdN. Based on our calculations we provide the effective mass tensor for undoped GdN, and some indicative values for electron doped GdN. Such a property is valuable as it can directly affect device design, and be directly measured experimentally to validate the existing computation results.</description>

      <title>Diverse Responses in Lattice Thermal Conductivity of $n$-type/$p$-type Semiconductors Driven by Asymmetric Electron-Phonon Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately assessing the impact of electron-phonon interaction (EPI) on the lattice thermal conductivity of semiconductors is crucial for the thermal management of electronic devices and a unified physical understanding of this issue is highly desired. In this work, we predict the lattice thermal conductivities of typical direct and indirect bandgap semiconductors accounting for EPI based on mode-level first-principles calculations. It is found that EPI has a larger effect on the lattice thermal conductivity of $p$-type doping compared to $n$-type doping in the same semiconductor at high charge carrier concentrations. The stronger EPI in $p$-type doping is attributed to the relatively higher electron density of states caused by the relatively larger $p$-orbital component. Furthermore, EPI has a stronger influence on the lattice thermal conductivity of $n$-type indirect bandgap semiconductors than $n$-type direct bandgap semiconductors. This is attributed to the relatively lower electron density of states in direct bandgap semiconductors stemming from the $s$-orbital component. This work reveals that there exist diverse responses in lattice thermal conductivity of $n$-type/$p$-type semiconductors, which can be attributed to asymmetric EPIs.</description>

      <title>Methods for color center preserving hydrogen-termination of diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical functionalization of diamond surfaces by hydrogen is an important method for controlling the charge state of near-surface fluorescent color centers, an essential process in fabricating devices such as diamond field-effect transistors and chemical sensors, and a required first step for realizing families of more complex terminations through subsequent chemical processing. In all these cases, termination is typically achieved using hydrogen plasma sources which can etch or damage the diamond as well as deposited materials or embedded colour centers. This work explores alternative methods for lower-damage hydrogenation of diamond surfaces, specifically the annealing of diamond samples in high-purity, non-explosive mixtures of nitrogen and hydrogen gas, and the exposure of samples to microwave hydrogen plasmas in the absence of intentional stage heating. The effectiveness of these methods are characterized by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and comparison of the results to density-functional modelling of the surface hydrogenation energetics implicates surface oxygen ligands as the primary factor limiting the termination quality of annealed samples. Finally, photoluminescence spectroscopy is used to verify that both the annealing and reduced sample temperature plasma methods are non-destructive to near-surface ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy centers, in stark contrast to plasma treatments which use heated sample stages.</description>

      <title>Electronic correlations arising from anti-Stoner spin excitations: an ab initio study of itinerant ferro- and antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anti-Stoner excitations are a spin-flips in which, effectively, an electron is promoted from a minority to a majority spin state, i.e., complementary to Stoner excitations and spin-waves. Since their spectral power is negligible in strong itinerant ferromagnets and they are identically absent in the ferromagnetic Heisenberg model, their properties and role in correlating electrons were hardly investigated so far. On the other hand, they are present in weak ferromagnets, fcc Ni being a prominent example, and both types of spin-flips (down-to-up and up-to-down) must be treated on the equal footing in systems with the degenerate spin up and down bands, in particular antiferromagnets in which case we choose CrSb as a model system. For these two materials we evaluate the strength of the effective interaction between the quasiparticles and the gas of virtual spin-flip excitations. To this end, we compute the corresponding self-energy taking advantage of our novel efficient \textit{ab initio} numerical scheme. We find that in Ni the band-structure renormalization due to the anti-Stoner processes is weaker than the one due to Stoner-type magnons in the majority spin channel but the two become comparable in the minority one. The effect can be traced back primarily to the spectral strength of the respective spin excitations and the densities of the final available quasiparticle states in the scattering process. For the antiferromagnet, the situation is more complex and we observe that the electron-magnon interaction is sensitive not only to these densities of states but critically to the spatial shapes of the coupling magnonic modes as well.</description>

      <title>The influence of dislocations on R-phase transformations in a NiTi shape memory alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to control the stress-induced phase transformation of the shape memory alloy, NiTi, is an important technological challenge that must be understood for their wide application in devices that can exploit their reversible strain properties. This study elucidates the direct relationship between dislocation density and the \textit{R}-phase transformation, including its formation temperature from interrupted annealing of rolled NiTi samples. Deformation is shown to determine the enthalpy change required for the B2$\rightarrow$\textit{R}-phase transformation, with associated transformation temperatures being modifiable via dislocation density and recovery processes. Recovery is shown to be rapid, highly heterogeneous and sensitive to crystal orientation. Grains with a $\langle100\rangle$ direction close to the macroscopic rolling direction recover more rapidly than $\langle110\rangle$ and $\langle111\rangle$ orientated grains. Considered to be governed by processing induced residual stresses and resultant crystallographic dependent annihilation/slip pathways, there are opportunities to tune B2$\rightarrow$\textit{R}-phase transformation on either a grain-averaged or an orientation dependant per-grain basis.</description>

      <title>Damage mechanisms in polyalkenes irradiated with ultra-short XUV/x-ray laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although polymers are widely used in laser-irradiation research, their microscopic response to high-intensity ultrafast XUV or X-ray irradiation is still largely unknown. Here we comparatively study homologous series of alkenes. XTANT-3 hybrid simulation toolkit is used to determine their damage kinetics and irradiation threshold doses. The code simultaneously models the nonequilibrium electron kinetics, the energy transfer between electrons and atoms via nonadiabatic electron-ion (electron-phonon) coupling, nonthermal modification of the interatomic potential due to electronic excitation, and the ensuing atomic response and damage formation. It is shown that the lowest damage threshold is associated with local defect creation such as dehydrogenation, various group detachment from the backbone, or polymer strand cross-linking. At higher doses, the disintegration of the molecules leads to a transient metallic liquid state. We identify nonthermal effects as the leading mechanism of damage, whereas the thermal (electron-ion coupling) channel influences the kinetics only slightly in the case of femtosecond-pulse irradiation. Despite notably different properties of the studied alkene polymers, the ultrafast-X-ray damage threshold doses are found to be very close to ~0.05 eV/atom in all three materials: polyethylene, polypropylene, and polybutylene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy with a CO-functionalized tip is combined with simulations to explore the impact of the CO tilt angle on topographies of a single Cu atom and CO molecule adsorbed on Cu(111). Images of the Cu atom acquired with varying tip tilt angles and sample voltages are reproduced by the calculations. The agreement between measured and simulated data allows to unveil the tip-orbital composition of the tunneling current, which highlights the role of the different $p$-orbitals of the CO-tip. Topographies of adsorbed CO and their dependence on voltage and probe-surface distance are captured for the nontilted junction geometry and in the limit of weak molecular interactions.</description>

      <title>Understanding the intrinsic framework of the Hall-Petch relationship of metals from the view of the electronic-structure level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between grain size and yield strength of metals follows the Hall-Petch relationship {\sigma} = {\sigma}0 + kd^-0.5; however, the specific physical factors that affect the coefficients {\sigma}0 and k of this relationship remain unclear. Here we propose the intrinsic descriptors to determine the Hall-Petch relation across different metals and alloys. Inspired by the tight-binding theory, we find that {\sigma}0 strongly depends on the group and period number, the valence-electron number and electronegativity, while k is determined by the cohesive energy. Our framework establishes a predictive structure-property relationship for the size-dependent yield strength of various metals, and unravels that both the coefficients of the Hall-Petch relationship physically originate from the d-band properties. This novel correlation provides a new perspective for understanding the mechanical strength of metals, which is useful for the design of high-performance materials.</description>

      <title>Electron-Beam Writing of Atomic-Scale Reconstructions at Oxide Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The epitaxial growth of complex oxides enables the production of high-quality films, yet substrate choice is restricted to certain symmetry and lattice parameters, thereby limiting the technological applications of epitaxial oxides. In comparison, the development of free-standing oxide membranes gives opportunities to create novel heterostructures by non-epitaxial stacking of membranes, opening new possibilities for materials design. Here, we introduce a method for writing, with atomic precision, ionically bonded crystalline material across the gap between an oxide membrane and a carrier substrate. The process involves a thermal pre-treatment, followed by localized exposure to the raster scan of a scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) beam. STEM imaging and electron energy-loss spectroscopy show that we achieve atomically sharp interface reconstructions between a 30 nm-thick SrTiO${_3}$ membrane and a niobium-doped SrTiO${_3}$(001)-oriented carrier substrate. These findings indicate new strategies for fabricating synthetic heterostructures with novel structural and electronic properties.</description>

      <title>PVDF transducer shape optimization for the characterization of anisotropic materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the ultrasonic determination of mechanical properties, it is common to use oblique incident waves to characterize fluid-immersed anisotropic samples. The lateral displacement of the ultrasonic field owing to leaky guided wave phenomena poses a challenge for data inversion because beam spreading is rarely well represented by plane-wave models. In this study, a finite beam model based on the angular spectrum method was developed to estimate the influence of the transducer shape and position on the transmitted signals. Additionally, anisotropic solids were considered so that the beam skewing effect was contemplated. A small-emitter large-receiver configuration was chosen, and the ideal shape and position of the receiving transducer were obtained through a meta-heuristic optimization approach with the goal of achieving a measurement system that sufficiently resembles plane-wave propagation. A polyvinylidene fluoride receiver was fabricated and tested in three cases: a single-crystal silicon wafer, a lightly anisotropic stainless-steel plate, and a highly anisotropic composite plate. Good agreement was found between the measurements and the plane-wave model.</description>

      <title>Dissociative Electron Attachment on Metal Surfaces: The Case of HCl$^-$ on Au(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transfer of charges, including electrons and holes, is a key step in heterogeneous catalysis, taking part in the reduction and oxidation of adsorbate species on catalyst surfaces. In plasmonic catalysis, electrons can transfer from photo-excited metal nanoparticles to molecular adsorbates, forming transient negative ions that can easily undergo reactions such as dissociation, desorption, or other chemical transformations. However, ab initio characterization of these anionic states has proven challenging, and little is known about the topology of their potential energy surfaces. In this work, we investigate the dissociative adsorption of HCl on Au(111) as a representative catalytic process with relatively low reaction probabilities, which could potentially be enhanced by electron transfer from photo-excited gold nanoparticles to HCl. We employ projection-based density embedding that combines the equation-of-motion electron-attachment coupled-cluster singles and doubles (EOM-EA-CCSD) method with density functional theory (DFT), and build dissociation curves of HCl$^-$ on Au(111) along the H-Cl bond distance. The HCl anion in the gas phase is unbound at equilibrium distances and only becomes bound as the bond stretches. However, our results show that, upon adsorption on Au(111), HCl$^-$ remains a stable, bound anion at all bond lengths due to charge delocalization to the metal. Forming bound anions is easier, and dissociation of HCl$^-$ on Au(111) is further facilitated, with its dissociation energy reduced by 0.61 eV compared to its neutral counterpart on Au(111), and by 1.16 eV relative to HCl. These results underscore the efficacy of embedded EOM-CCSD methods in addressing surface science challenges and highlight the potential of plasmonic catalysis proceeding via bound, rather than transient, anionic states.</description>

      <title>Machine learning guided discovery of stable, spin-resolved topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identification of a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ index in a spinful two dimensional insulator indicates the presence of an odd, quantized (pseudo)spin-resolved Chern number, $C_{s}=(C_{\uparrow}-C_{\downarrow})/2$. However, the statement is not biconditional. An odd spin-Chern number can survive when the familiar $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ index vanishes. Identification of solid-state systems hosting an odd, quantized $C_{s}$ and trivial $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ index is a pressing issue due to the potential for such insulators to admit band gaps optimal for experiments and quantum devices. Nevertheless, they have proven elusive due to the computational expense associated with their discovery. In this work, a neural network capable of identifying the spin-Chern number is developed and used to identify the first solid-state systems hosting a trivial $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ index and odd $C_{s}$. We demonstrate the potential of one such system, Ti$_{2}$CO$_{2}$, to support Majorana corner modes via the superconducting proximity effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons drive the optoelectronic properties of organic semiconductors which underpin devices including solar cells and light-emitting diodes. We demonstrate that excitons can exhibit topologically non-trivial states and identify a family of organic semiconductors exhibiting the predicted excitonic topological phases. We also show that the topological phase can be controlled through chemical functionalisation and through the dielectric environment of the material. Appealing to quantum Riemannian geometry, we predict that topologically non-trivial excitons have a lower bound on their centre-of-mass spatial spread, which can significantly exceed the size of a unit cell. The discovery of excitonic topology and excitonic Riemannian geometry in organic materials brings together two mature fields and suggests many new possibilities for a range of future optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic high-fidelity spin polarization of charged vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy ($\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has garnered significant attention among defects in two-dimensional materials. This owes, in part, to its deterministic generation, well-characterized atomic structure, and optical polarizability at room temperature. We investigate the latter through extensive measurements probing both the ground and excited state polarization dynamics. We develop a semiclassical model based on these measurements that predicts a near-unity degree of spin polarization, surpassing other solid-state spin defects under ambient conditions. Building upon our model, we include the presence of nuclear spin degrees of freedom adjacent to the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ and perform a comprehensive set of Lindbladian numerics to investigate the hyperfine-induced polarization of the nuclear spins. Our simulations predict a number of important features that emerge as a function of magnetic field which are borne out by experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unveiling of 2D van der Waals magnetism in 2017 ignited a surge of interest in low-dimensional magnetism. With dimensions reduced, research has delved into facile electric control of 2D magnetism, high-quality heterostructure design, and new device functionality. These atomically thin magnetic materials have spawned a burgeoning field known as 2D spintronics, holding immense promise for future quantum technologies. In this review, we comprehensively survey the current advancements in 2D magnet-based quantum devices, accentuating their role in manifesting exotic properties and enabling novel functionalities. Topological states, spin torques, voltage control of magnetic anisotropy, strain engineering, twistronics and designer interface will be discussed. Furthermore, we offer an outlook to guide their development in future CMOS and quantum hardware paradigms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of 80 K superconductivity in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at pressures greater than 14 GPa presents a unique opportunity to study a novel class of high-temperature superconductors. Therefore, other bilayer nickelate following the classical ($T^{4+}$) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) series of Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ would present an interesting new candidate. In this work, we study the stabilization of RP $n=2$ phase in Sr$_3$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_7$, via floating zone growth of crystals. With powder and single crystal XRD, we study the stability range of the RP-type phase. Our Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and gas extraction studies reveal a remarkably high oxidation state of Ni$^{4+}$. The obtained black crystals are insulating in transport and show a magnetic transition around 12 K.</description>

      <title>Multichannel Dyson equation: derivation and analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 216401] we presented the multichannel Dyson equation (MCDE) in which two or more many-body Green's functions are coupled. In this work we will give further details of the MCDE approach. In particular we will discuss: 1) the derivation of the MCDE and the definition of the space in which it is to be solved; 2) the rationale of the approximation to the multichannel self-energy; 3) a diagrammatic analysis of the MCDE; 4) the recasting of the MCDE on an eigenvalue problem with an effective Hamiltonian that can be solved using standard numerical techniques. This work mainly focuses on the coupling between the one-body Green's function and the three-body Green's function to describe photoemission spectra, but the MCDE method can be generalized to the coupling of other many-body Green's functions and to other spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>Ultrasmall CsPbBr3 Blue Emissive Perovskite Quantum Dots using K-alloyed Cs4PbBr6 Nanocrystals as Precursors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a colloidal synthesis of blue emissive, stable cube-shaped CsPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs) in the strong quantum confinement regime via a dissolution-recrystallization starting from pre-synthesized (KxCs1-x)4PbBr6 nanocrystals which are then reacted with PbBr2. This is markedly different from the known case of Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals that react within seconds with PbBr2 and get transformed into much larger, green emitting CsPbBr3 nanocrystals. Here, instead, the conversion of (KxCs1-x)4PbBr6 nanocrystals to CsPbBr3 QDs occurs in a time span of hours, and tuning of the QDs size is achieved by adjusting the concentration of precursors. The QDs exhibit excitonic features in optical absorption that are tunable in the 420 - 452 nm range, accompanied by blue photoluminescence with quantum yield around 60%. Detailed spectroscopic investigations in both the single and multi-exciton regime reveal the exciton fine structure and the effect of Auger recombination of these CsPbBr3 QDs, confirming theoretical predictions for this system.</description>

      <title>Kinetics of hydrogen and vacancy diffusion in iron: A Kinetic Activation Relaxation technique (k-ART) study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate hydrogen (H) and mono and divacancy-hydrogen complexes (VH$_x$ and V$_2$H$_x$) diffusion in body-centered-cubic (BCC) iron using the kinetic Activation-Relaxation Technique (k-ART), an off-lattice kinetic Monte Carlo approach with on-the-fly event catalog building, to explore diffusion barriers and associated mechanisms for these defects. K-ART uncovers complex diffusion pathways for the bound complexes, with important barrier variations that depend on the geometrical relations between the position of the inserting Fe atom and that of the bound H. Since H is small and brings little lattice deformation around itself, these bound complexes are compact, and H is fully unbound at the second neighbor site already. As more H are added, however, vacancies deform and affect the lattice over longer distances, contributing to increasing the VH$_x$ complex diffusion barrier and its impact on its local environment. We find, moreover, that the importance of this trapping decreases when going from mono to divacancy complexes, although diffusion barriers for these complexes increase with the number of trapped H.</description>

Abstract: Si and its oxides have been extensively explored in theoretical research due to their technological and industrial importance. Simultaneously describing interatomic interactions within both Si and SiO$_2$ without the use of \textit{ab initio} methods is considered challenging, given the charge transfers involved. Herein, this challenge is overcome by developing a unified machine learning interatomic potentials describing the Si/ SiO$_2$/ O system, based on the moment tensor potential (MTP) framework. This MTP is trained using a comprehensive database generated using density functional theory simulations, encompassing a wide range of crystal structures, point defects, extended defects, and disordered structure. Extensive testing of the MTP is performed, indicating it can describe static and dynamic features of very diverse Si, O, and SiO$_2$ atomic structures with a degree of fidelity approaching that of DFT</description>

      <title>Bulk Photovoltaic Effects in Helimagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bulk photovoltaic (BPV) effect that converts light into electric current is highly sensitive to the system symmetry and its electronic Bloch wavefunction. To create a sizable net electric current, it is necessary to break the centrosymmetry P in its host material. While prior studies mainly focus on P-broken nonmagnetic (time reversal T-reserved) and collinear antiferromagnetic PT systems, here we adopt magnetic group theory to scrutinize how helical spin polarization breaks P that is otherwise kept in its crystalline geometry. Such spin helix widely exists in intrinsic multiferroics and magnon excitation in collinear magnets. We demonstrate that magnetic symmetries are determined by spin spiral configurations, helical propagation wavevectors, magnetic chirality, and spin winding angles at the home site, offering effective and versatile manipulation of BPV generation in helimagnets. This is illustrated by tight-binding model calculations. Furthermore, we apply our theory to monolayer NiI2, a realistic showcase for helimagnetic material. Our first-principles calculations show that it could host observable direction-dependent BPV current, which could serve as a photoelectric probe to track the subtle magnetic configurations and potential multiferroic nature. This work reveals the fundamental mechanism of the interplay between spin spiral order and nonlinear optics process.</description>

Abstract: Cold metals have recently gained attention as a promising platform for innovative devices, such as tunnel diodes with negative differential resistance (NDR) and field-effect transistors with subthreshold swings below the thermionic limit. Recently discovered two-dimensional (2D) MA$_2$Z$_4$ (M = Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta; A = Si, Ge; Z = N, P) compounds exhibit both cold metallic and semiconducting behavior. In this work, we present a computational study of lateral heterojunction tunnel diodes based on 2D NbSi$_2$N$_4$ and HfSi$_2$N$_4$ compounds. Employing density functional theory combined with a nonequilibrium Green function method, we investigate the current-voltage ($I$-$V$) characteristics of lateral tunnel diodes with varying barrier thicknesses in both zigzag and armchair orientations. We find that tunnel diodes in the zigzag orientation exhibit significantly higher peak current densities, while those in the armchair orientation display larger peak-to-valley current ratios (PVCRs) compared to the zigzag orientation. Our findings suggest that MA$_2$Z$_4$ materials are promising candidates for realizing NDR tunnel diodes with high PVCR values, which could have potential applications in memory, logic circuits, and other electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition of single-layer vanadium diselenide on Au(111) with distinguished electronic structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Herein, we report the reversible structural transition of single-layer VSe2 grown on Au(111) through alternating thermal annealing and Se replenishment. Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we demonstrate the epitaxial growth of high-quality VSe2 on Au(111) with the octahedral (1T) structure and the Se-vacancy-induced transformation of VSe2 from the metallic moir\'e (1T) phase to the semiconducting (2H) phase. With convincing agreement between the experimental results and DFT calculations, the nanostructure near the grain boundary in the defective intermediate phase is confirmed, as well as the reaction pathway with Se gradually depleting at elevated temperatures. Importantly, it is revealed that the density of the linear Se defects plays a crucial role in the formation of the 2H domain phase due to the increment of the in-plane lattice parameter after Se desorption and the better thermal stability of the 2H phase compared to the 1T phase. The proper control of the density of Se atoms in the topmost Se layer of VSe2 could feasibly manipulate the ratio between the 1T phase and the 2H phase in the steak-shaped domain, which is regarded as a good platform for 2D homojunctions in nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Exploring Li-ion Transport Properties of Li$_3$TiCl$_6$: A Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We performed large-scale molecular dynamics simulations based on a machine-learning force field (MLFF) to investigate the Li-ion transport mechanism in cation-disordered Li$_3$TiCl$_6$ cathode at six different temperatures, ranging from 25$^\mathrm{o}$C to 100$^\mathrm{o}$C. In this work, deep neural network method and data generated by $ab-initio$ molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were deployed to build a high-fidelity MLFF. Radial distribution functions, Li-ion mean square displacements (MSD), diffusion coefficients, ionic conductivity, activation energy, and crystallographic direction-dependent migration barriers were calculated and compared with corresponding AIMD and experimental data to benchmark the accuracy of the MLFF. From MSD analysis, we captured both the self and distinct parts of Li-ion dynamics. The latter reveals that the Li-ions are involved in anti-correlation motion that was rarely reported for solid-state materials. Similarly, the self and distinct parts of Li-ion dynamics were used to determine Haven's ratio to describe the Li-ion transport mechanism in Li$_3$TiCl$_6$. Obtained trajectory from molecular dynamics infers that the Li-ion transportation is mainly through interstitial hopping which was confirmed by intra- and inter-layer Li-ion displacement with respect to simulation time. Ionic conductivity (1.06 mS/cm) and activation energy (0.29eV) calculated by our simulation are highly comparable with that of experimental values. Overall, the combination of machine-learning methods and AIMD simulations explains the intricate electrochemical properties of the Li$_3$TiCl$_6$ cathode with remarkably reduced computational time. Thus, our work strongly suggests that the deep neural network-based MLFF could be a promising method for large-scale complex materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations were applied for the paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition in the perovskite-type cadmium titanate, CdTiO3. Since the phase transition is reported to occur at the low temperature around 80 K, the quantum thermal bath (QTB) method was utilized in this study, which incorporates the nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). The structural evolutions in the QTB-FPMD simulations are in reasonable agreement with the experimental results, by contrast in the conventional FPMD simulations using the classical thermal bath (CTB-FPMD). According to our phonon calculations, volume expansion is the key in the stabilization of the ferroelectric phase at low temperatures, which was well reproduced in the QTB-FPMD with the NQEs. Thus, the NQEs are of importance in phase transitions at low temperatures, particularly below the room temperature, and the QTB is useful in that it incorporates the NQEs in MD simulations with low computational costs comparable to the conventional CTB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A numerical parameter, referred to as a topological index, is used to represent the molecular structure of a compound by analyzing its graph-theoretical characteristics. Topological indices are predictive methods for the physicochemical properties of chemical compounds in the context of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) and quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) analysis. Graph entropies have evolved into information-theoretic tools for exploring the structural information of molecular graphs. In this paper, we compute the Nirmala index, as well as the first and second inverse Nirmala index, for the diamond structure using its M-polynomial. Furthermore, entropy measures based on Nirmala indices are derived for the diamond structure. The comparison of the Nirmala indices and corresponding entropy measures is presented through numerical computation and 2D line plots. A regression model is built to investigate the relationship between the Nirmala indices and corresponding entropy measures.</description>

Abstract: The universal oscillation of the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio as a function of the insulating barrier thickness in crystalline magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is a long-standing unsolved problem in condensed matter physics. To explain this, we here introduce a superposition of wave functions with opposite spins and different Fermi momenta, based on the fact that spin-flip scattering near the interface provides a hybridization between majority- and minority-spin states. In a typical Fe/MgO/Fe MTJ, we solve the tunneling problem and show that the TMR ratio oscillates with a period of $\sim3\,$\r{A} by varying the MgO thickness, consistent with previous and present experimental observations.</description>

      <title>An efficient strategy to construct general machine learning potentials for high-entropy ceramics</title>

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are considered an efficient and low-cost means to develop remarkable properties of high-entropy ceramics with vast composition space, yet the lack of general potentials severely limits their applications. Herein, taking high-entropy carbides (HECs) as the model, we propose a strategy to efficiently construct a general neuroevolution potential (NEP) with broad compositional applicability for HECs. Specifically, the small dataset comprising unary and binary carbides with ten transition metal principal elements is first identified as the most efficient choice to train the general NEP for HECs, and then a highly accurate and transferable NEP is constructed. Further MD predictions on structural, mechanical, and thermal properties of HECs using the established NEP show good agreement with the results of first-principles calculations and experimental measurements, validating the accuracy, generalization, and reliability of our developed NEP. Our work provides an efficient solution to accelerating the MD simulations searching for high-entropy ceramics with desirable properties.</description>

      <title>Is spontaneous vortex generation in superconducting 4Hb-TaS$_2$ from vison-vortex nucleation with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the superconducting van der Waals material 4Hb-TaS$_2$ to realize the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order and interpret the recent discovery of the spontaneous vortex generation in 4Hb-TaS$_2$ as the vison-vortex nucleation. For the alternating stacking of metallic/superconducting and Mott insulating layers in 4Hb-TaS$_2$, we expect the local moments in the Mott insulating 1T-TaS$_2$ layer to form the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. The spontaneous vortex generation in 4Hb-TaS$_2$ is interpreted from the transition or nucleation between the superconducting vortex and the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vison in different phase regimes. Differing from the single vison-vortex nucleation in the original Senthil-Fisher's cuprate proposal, we consider such nucleation process between the superconducting vortex lattice and the vison crystal. We further propose experiments to distinguish this proposal with the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order from the chiral spin liquid scenarios.</description>

      <title>Imaging 3D Chemistry at 1 nm Resolution with Fused Multi-Modal Electron Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of chemistry in nanoscale matter is a longstanding challenge for metrological science. The inelastic scattering events required for 3D chemical imaging are too rare, requiring high beam exposure that destroys the specimen before an experiment completes. Even larger doses are required to achieve high resolution. Thus, chemical mapping in 3D has been unachievable except at lower resolution with the most radiation-hard materials. Here, high-resolution 3D chemical imaging is achieved near or below one nanometer resolution in a Au-Fe$_3$O$_4$ metamaterial, Co$_3$O$_4$ - Mn$_3$O$_4$ core-shell nanocrystals, and ZnS-Cu$_{0.64}$S$_{0.36}$ nanomaterial using fused multi-modal electron tomography. Multi-modal data fusion enables high-resolution chemical tomography often with 99\% less dose by linking information encoded within both elastic (HAADF) and inelastic (EDX / EELS) signals. Now sub-nanometer 3D resolution of chemistry is measurable for a broad class of geometrically and compositionally complex materials.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall effects in quantum magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the recent years, the thermal Hall transport has risen as an important diagnosis of the physical properties of the elementary excitations in various quantum materials, especially among the Mott insulating systems where the electronic transports are often featureless. Here we review the recent development of thermal Hall effects in quantum magnets where all the relevant excitations are charge-neutral. In addition to summarizing the existing experiments, we pay a special attention to the underlying mechanisms of the thermal Hall effects in various magnetic systems, and clarify the connection between the microscopic physical variables and the emergent degrees of freedom in different quantum phases. The external magnetic field is shown to modify the intrinsic Berry curvature properties of various emergent and/or exotic quasiparticle excitations in distinct fashions for different quantum systems and quantum phases, contributing to the thermal Hall transports. These include, for example, the conventional ones like the magnons in ordered magnets, the triplons in dimerized magnets, the exotic and fractionalized quasiparticles such as the spinons and the magnetic monopoles in quantum spin liquids. We review their contribution and discuss their presence in the thermal Hall conductivity in different physical contexts. We expect this review to provide a useful guidance for the physical mechanism of the thermal Hall transports in quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Envelope-function theory of inhomogeneous strain in semiconductor nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strain represents an ubiquitous feature in semiconductor heterostructures, and can be engineered by different means in order to improve the properties of various devices, including advanced MOSFETs and spin-based qubits. However, its treatment within the envelope function framework is well established only for the homogeneous case, thanks to the theory of Bir and Pikus. Here, we generalize such theory to the case of inhomogeneous strain. By fully accounting for the relativistic effects and metric aspects of the problem, we derive a complete envelope-function Hamiltonian, including the terms that depend on first and second spatial derivatives of the strain tensor.</description>

      <title>A Framework of SO(3)-equivariant Non-linear Representation Learning and its Application to Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present both a theoretical and a methodological framework that addresses a critical challenge in applying deep learning to physical systems: the reconciliation of non-linear expressiveness with SO(3)-equivariance in predictions of SO(3)-equivariant quantities. Inspired by covariant theory in physics, we address this problem by exploring the mathematical relationships between SO(3)-invariant and SO(3)-equivariant quantities and their representations. We first construct theoretical SO(3)-invariant quantities derived from the SO(3)-equivariant regression targets, and use these invariant quantities as supervisory labels to guide the learning of high-quality SO(3)-invariant features. Given that SO(3)-invariance is preserved under non-linear operations, the encoding process for invariant features can extensively utilize non-linear mappings, thereby fully capturing the non-linear patterns inherent in physical systems. Building on this foundation, we propose a gradient-based mechanism to induce SO(3)-equivariant encodings of various degrees from the learned SO(3)-invariant features. This mechanism can incorporate non-linear expressive capabilities into SO(3)-equivariant representations, while theoretically preserving their equivariant properties as we prove. We apply our theory and method to the electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction tasks, experimental results on eight benchmark databases covering multiple types of elements and challenging scenarios show dramatic breakthroughs on the state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, with improvements of up to 40% in predicting Hamiltonians and up to 76% in predicting downstream physical quantities such as occupied orbital energy. Our approach goes beyond handling physical systems and offers a promising general solution to the critical dilemma between equivariance and non-linear expressiveness for the deep learning paradigm.</description>

      <title>Bridging electronic and classical density-functional theory using universal machine-learned functional approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of density-functional theory (DFT) is determined by the quality of the approximate functionals, such as exchange-correlation in electronic DFT and the excess functional in the classical DFT formalism of fluids. The exact functional is highly nonlocal for both electrons and fluids, yet most approximate functionals are semi-local or nonlocal in a limited weighted-density form. Machine-learned (ML) nonlocal density-functional approximations are promising in both electronic and classical DFT, but have so far employed disparate approaches with limited generality. Here, we formulate a universal approximation framework and training protocol for nonlocal ML functionals, combining features of equivariant convolutional neural networks and the weighted-density approximation. We prototype this approach for several 1D and quasi-1D problems and demonstrate that a functional with exactly the same hyperparameters achieves excellent accuracy for the hard-rod fluid, the inhomogeneous Ising model, the exact exchange functional for electrons, the electron kinetic energy functional for orbital-free DFT, as well as for liquid water with 1D inhomogeneities. These results lay the foundation for a universal ML approach to exact 3D functionals spanning electronic and classical DFT.</description>
