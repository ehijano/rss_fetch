      <title>From Glue-Code to Protocols: A Critical Analysis of A2A and MCP Integration for Scalable Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving towards multi-agent systems where numerous AI agents collaborate and interact with external tools. Two key open standards, Google's Agent to Agent (A2A) protocol for inter-agent communication and Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized tool access, promise to overcome the limitations of fragmented, custom integration approaches. While their potential synergy is significant, this paper argues that effectively integrating A2A and MCP presents unique, emergent challenges at their intersection, particularly concerning semantic interoperability between agent tasks and tool capabilities, the compounded security risks arising from combined discovery and execution, and the practical governance required for the envisioned "Agent Economy". This work provides a critical analysis, moving beyond a survey to evaluate the practical implications and inherent difficulties of combining these horizontal and vertical integration standards. We examine the benefits (e.g., specialization, scalability) while critically assessing their dependencies and trade-offs in an integrated context. We identify key challenges increased by the integration, including novel security vulnerabilities, privacy complexities, debugging difficulties across protocols, and the need for robust semantic negotiation mechanisms. In summary, A2A+MCP offers a vital architectural foundation, but fully realizing its potential requires substantial advancements to manage the complexities of their combined operation.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking LLMs' Swarm intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for complex reasoning, yet their capacity for emergent coordination in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) when operating under strict constraints-such as limited local perception and communication, characteristic of natural swarms-remains largely unexplored, particularly concerning the nuances of swarm intelligence. Existing benchmarks often do not fully capture the unique challenges of decentralized coordination that arise when agents operate with incomplete spatio-temporal information. To bridge this gap, we introduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the swarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized agents. SwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks within a configurable 2D grid environment, forcing agents to rely primarily on local sensory input (k x k view) and local communication. We propose metrics for coordination effectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics. Evaluating several leading LLMs in a zero-shot setting, we find significant performance variations across tasks, highlighting the difficulties posed by local information constraints. While some coordination emerges, results indicate limitations in robust planning and strategy formation under uncertainty in these decentralized scenarios. Assessing LLMs under swarm-like conditions is crucial for realizing their potential in future decentralized systems. We release SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built upon a customizable and scalable physical system with defined mechanical properties. It provides environments, prompts, evaluation scripts, and the comprehensive experimental datasets generated, aiming to foster reproducible research into LLM-based MAS coordination and the theoretical underpinnings of Embodied MAS.

      <title>Consensus-Aware AV Behavior: Trade-offs Between Safety, Interaction, and Performance in Mixed Urban Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transportation systems have long been shaped by complexity and heterogeneity, driven by the interdependency of agent actions and traffic outcomes. The deployment of automated vehicles (AVs) in such systems introduces a new challenge: achieving consensus across safety, interaction quality, and traffic performance. In this work, we position consensus as a fundamental property of the traffic system and aim to quantify it. We use high-resolution trajectory data from the Third Generation Simulation (TGSIM) dataset to empirically analyze AV and human-driven vehicle (HDV) behavior at a signalized urban intersection and around vulnerable road users (VRUs). Key metrics, including Time-to-Collision (TTC), Post-Encroachment Time (PET), deceleration patterns, headways, and string stability, are evaluated across the three performance dimensions. Results show that full consensus across safety, interaction, and performance is rare, with only 1.63% of AV-VRU interaction frames meeting all three conditions. These findings highlight the need for AV models that explicitly balance multi-dimensional performance in mixed-traffic environments. Full reproducibility is supported via our open-source codebase on https://github.com/wissamkontar/Consensus-AV-Analysis.</description>

      <title>Implicitly Aligning Humans and Autonomous Agents through Shared Task Abstractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In collaborative tasks, autonomous agents fall short of humans in their capability to quickly adapt to new and unfamiliar teammates. We posit that a limiting factor for zero-shot coordination is the lack of shared task abstractions, a mechanism humans rely on to implicitly align with teammates. To address this gap, we introduce HA$^2$: Hierarchical Ad Hoc Agents, a framework leveraging hierarchical reinforcement learning to mimic the structured approach humans use in collaboration. We evaluate HA$^2$ in the Overcooked environment, demonstrating statistically significant improvement over existing baselines when paired with both unseen agents and humans, providing better resilience to environmental shifts, and outperforming all state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>OneDSE: A Unified Microprocessor Metric Prediction and Design Space Exploration Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the diminishing returns of Moore Law scaling and as power constraints become more impactful, processor designs rely on architectural innovation to achieve differentiating performance. Innovation complexity has increased the design space of modern high-performance processors. This work offers an efficient and novel design space exploration (DSE) solution to these challenges of modern CPU design. We identify three key challenges in past DSE approaches: (a) Metric prediction is slow and inaccurate for unseen workloads, microarchitectures, (b) Search is slow and inaccurate in CPU parameter space, and (c) A Single model is unable to learn the huge design space. We present OneDSE, a unified metric predictor and CPU parameter explorer to mitigate these challenges with three key techniques: (a) Transformer-based workload-Aware CPU DSE (TrACE) predictor that outperforms state-of-the-art ANN-based prediction methods by 2.75x and 6.12x with and without fine-tuning, respectively, on several benchmarks; (b) a novel metric space search approach that outperforms optimized metaheuristics by 1.19x while reducing search time by an order of magnitude; (c) MARL-based multi-agent framework that achieves a 10.6% reduction in prediction error compared to its non-MARL counterpart, enabling more accurate and efficient exploration of the CPU design space.</description>

      <title>Facilitating Video Story Interaction with Multi-Agent Collaborative System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video story interaction enables viewers to engage with and explore narrative content for personalized experiences. However, existing methods are limited to user selection, specially designed narratives, and lack customization. To address this, we propose an interactive system based on user intent. Our system uses a Vision Language Model (VLM) to enable machines to understand video stories, combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to create evolving characters and scene experiences. It includes three stages: 1) Video story processing, utilizing VLM and prior knowledge to simulate human understanding of stories across three modalities. 2) Multi-space chat, creating growth-oriented characters through MAS interactions based on user queries and story stages. 3) Scene customization, expanding and visualizing various story scenes mentioned in dialogue. Applied to the Harry Potter series, our study shows the system effectively portrays emergent character social behavior and growth, enhancing the interactive experience in the video story world.</description>

      <title>Satellite Autonomous Clock Fault Monitoring with Inter-Satellite Ranges Using Euclidean Distance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address the need for robust positioning, navigation, and timing services in lunar environments, this paper proposes a novel onboard clock phase jump detection framework for satellite constellations using range measurements obtained from dual one-way inter-satellite links. Our approach leverages vertex redundantly rigid graphs to detect faults without relying on prior knowledge of satellite positions or clock biases, providing flexibility for lunar satellite networks with diverse satellite types and operators. We model satellite constellations as graphs, where satellites are vertices and inter-satellite links are edges. The proposed algorithm detects and identifies satellites with clock jumps by monitoring the singular values of the geometric-centered Euclidean distance matrix (GCEDM) of 5-clique sub-graphs. The proposed method is validated through simulations of a GPS constellation and a notional constellation around the Moon, demonstrating its effectiveness in various configurations.</description>

      <title>The Power of Stories: Narrative Priming Shapes How LLM Agents Collaborate and Compete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to Yuval Noah Harari, large-scale human cooperation is driven by shared narratives that encode common beliefs and values. This study explores whether such narratives can similarly nudge LLM agents toward collaboration. We use a finitely repeated public goods game in which LLM agents choose either cooperative or egoistic spending strategies. We prime agents with stories highlighting teamwork to different degrees and test how this influences negotiation outcomes. Our experiments explore four questions:(1) How do narratives influence negotiation behavior? (2) What differs when agents share the same story versus different ones? (3) What happens when the agent numbers grow? (4) Are agents resilient against self-serving negotiators? We find that story-based priming significantly affects negotiation strategies and success rates. Common stories improve collaboration, benefiting each agent. By contrast, priming agents with different stories reverses this effect, and those agents primed toward self-interest prevail. We hypothesize that these results carry implications for multi-agent system design and AI alignment.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Infectious Disease Intervention Measures Based on Reinforcement Learning - Empirical analysis based on UK COVID-19 epidemic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globally, the outbreaks of infectious diseases have exerted an extremely profound and severe influence on health security and the economy. During the critical phases of epidemics, devising effective intervention measures poses a significant challenge to both the academic and practical arenas. There is numerous research based on reinforcement learning to optimize intervention measures of infectious diseases. Nevertheless, most of these efforts have been confined within the differential equation based on infectious disease models. Although a limited number of studies have incorporated reinforcement learning methodologies into individual-based infectious disease models, the models employed therein have entailed simplifications and limitations, rendering it incapable of modeling the complexity and dynamics inherent in infectious disease transmission. We establish a decision-making framework based on an individual agent-based transmission model, utilizing reinforcement learning to continuously explore and develop a strategy function. The framework's validity is verified through both experimental and theoretical approaches. Covasim, a detailed and widely used agent-based disease transmission model, was modified to support reinforcement learning research. We conduct an exhaustive exploration of the application efficacy of multiple algorithms across diverse action spaces. Furthermore, we conduct an innovative preliminary theoretical analysis concerning the issue of "time coverage". The results of the experiment robustly validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the methodological framework of this study. The coping strategies gleaned therefrom prove highly efficacious in suppressing the expansion of the epidemic scale and safeguarding the stability of the economic system, thereby providing crucial reference perspectives for the formulation of global public health security strategies.</description>

      <title>A Large Language Model for Feasible and Diverse Population Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating a synthetic population that is both feasible and diverse is crucial for ensuring the validity of downstream activity schedule simulation in activity-based models (ABMs). While deep generative models (DGMs), such as variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks, have been applied to this task, they often struggle to balance the inclusion of rare but plausible combinations (i.e., sampling zeros) with the exclusion of implausible ones (i.e., structural zeros). To improve feasibility while maintaining diversity, we propose a fine-tuning method for large language models (LLMs) that explicitly controls the autoregressive generation process through topological orderings derived from a Bayesian Network (BN). Experimental results show that our hybrid LLM-BN approach outperforms both traditional DGMs and proprietary LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT-4o) with few-shot learning. Specifically, our approach achieves approximately 95% feasibility, significantly higher than the ~80% observed in DGMs, while maintaining comparable diversity, making it well-suited for practical applications. Importantly, the method is based on a lightweight open-source LLM, enabling fine-tuning and inference on standard personal computing environments. This makes the approach cost-effective and scalable for large-scale applications, such as synthesizing populations in megacities, without relying on expensive infrastructure. By initiating the ABM pipeline with high-quality synthetic populations, our method improves overall simulation reliability and reduces downstream error propagation. The source code for these methods is available for research and practical application.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-based Cooperative Autonomous Driving in Smart Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsignalized intersections pose significant safety and efficiency challenges due to complex traffic flows. This paper proposes a novel roadside unit (RSU)-centric cooperative driving system leveraging global perception and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. The core of the system is an RSU-based decision-making module using a two-stage hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework. At first, policies are pre-trained offline using conservative Q-learning (CQL) combined with behavior cloning (BC) on collected dataset. Subsequently, these policies are fine-tuned in the simulation using multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO), aligned with a self-attention mechanism to effectively solve inter-agent dependencies. RSUs perform real-time inference based on the trained models to realize vehicle control via V2I communications. Extensive experiments in CARLA environment demonstrate high effectiveness of the proposed system, by: \textit{(i)} achieving failure rates below 0.03\% in coordinating three connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) through complex intersection scenarios, significantly outperforming the traditional Autoware control method, and \textit{(ii)} exhibiting strong robustness across varying numbers of controlled agents and shows promising generalization capabilities on other maps.</description>

      <title>Facilitating Trustworthy Human-Agent Collaboration in LLM-based Multi-Agent System oriented Software Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent autonomous systems (MAS) are better at addressing challenges that spans across multiple domains than singular autonomous agents. This holds true within the field of software engineering (SE) as well. The state-of-the-art research on MAS within SE focuses on integrating LLMs at the core of autonomous agents to create LLM-based multi-agent autonomous (LMA) systems. However, the introduction of LMA systems into SE brings a plethora of challenges. One of the major challenges is the strategic allocation of tasks between humans and the LMA system in a trustworthy manner. To address this challenge, a RACI-based framework is proposed in this work in progress article, along with implementation guidelines and an example implementation of the framework. The proposed framework can facilitate efficient collaboration, ensure accountability, and mitigate potential risks associated with LLM-driven automation while aligning with the Trustworthy AI guidelines. The future steps for this work delineating the planned empirical validation method are also presented.</description>

      <title>Runtime Advocates: A Persona-Driven Framework for Requirements@Runtime Decision Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex systems, such as small Uncrewed Aerial Systems (sUAS) swarms dispatched for emergency response, often require dynamic reconfiguration at runtime under the supervision of human operators. This introduces human-on-the-loop requirements, where evolving needs shape ongoing system functionality and behaviors. While traditional personas support upfront, static requirements elicitation, we propose a persona-based advocate framework for runtime requirements engineering to provide ethically informed, safety-driven, and regulatory-aware decision support. Our approach extends standard personas into event-driven personas. When triggered by events such as adverse environmental conditions, evolving mission state, or operational constraints, the framework updates the sUAS operator's view of the personas, ensuring relevance to current conditions. We create three key advocate personas, namely Safety Controller, Ethical Governor, and Regulatory Auditor, to manage trade-offs among risk, ethical considerations, and regulatory compliance. We perform a proof-of-concept validation in an emergency response scenario using sUAS, showing how our advocate personas provide context-aware guidance grounded in safety, regulatory, and ethical constraints. By evolving static, design-time personas into adaptive, event-driven advocates, the framework surfaces mission-critical runtime requirements in response to changing conditions. These requirements shape operator decisions in real time, aligning actions with the operational demands of the moment.</description>

      <title>Towards a HIPAA Compliant Agentic AI System in Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agentic AI systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) as their foundational reasoning engine, are transforming clinical workflows such as medical report generation and clinical summarization by autonomously analyzing sensitive healthcare data and executing decisions with minimal human oversight. However, their adoption demands strict compliance with regulatory frameworks such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), particularly when handling Protected Health Information (PHI). This work-in-progress paper introduces a HIPAA-compliant Agentic AI framework that enforces regulatory compliance through dynamic, context-aware policy enforcement. Our framework integrates three core mechanisms: (1) Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for granular PHI governance, (2) a hybrid PHI sanitization pipeline combining regex patterns and BERT-based model to minimize leakage, and (3) immutable audit trails for compliance verification.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been successfully applied to a wide range of robotics applications for learning complex multi-modal behaviors from data. However, prior works have mostly been confined to single-robot and small-scale environments due to the high sample complexity of learning multi-robot diffusion models. In this paper, we propose a method for generating collision-free multi-robot trajectories that conform to underlying data distributions while using only single-robot data. Our algorithm, Multi-robot Multi-model planning Diffusion (MMD), does so by combining learned diffusion models with classical search-based techniques -- generating data-driven motions under collision constraints. Scaling further, we show how to compose multiple diffusion models to plan in large environments where a single diffusion model fails to generalize well. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in planning for dozens of robots in a variety of simulated scenarios motivated by logistics environments.
