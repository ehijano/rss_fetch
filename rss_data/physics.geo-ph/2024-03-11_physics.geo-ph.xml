      <title>Evaluating Physics Informed Neural Network Performance for Seismic Discrimination Between Earthquakes and Explosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining physics with machine learning models has advanced the performance of machine learning models in many different applications. In this paper, we evaluate adding a weak physics constraint, i.e., a physics-based empirical relationship, to the loss function (the Physics Informed manner) in local distance explosion discrimination in the hope of improving the generalization capability of the machine learning model. We compare the proposed model to the two-branch model we previously developed, as well as to a pure data-driven model. Unexpectedly, the proposed model did not consistently outperform the pure data-driven model. By varying the level of inconsistency in the training data, we find this approach is modulated by the strength of the physics relationship. This result has important implications for how to best incorporate physical constraints in Machine Learning models.</description>

      <title>Lee-Wave Energy Sinks in Bottom-Intensified Flow: Reabsorption, Dissipation and Nonlinear Spectral Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Idealized numerical simulation is used to explore energy sinks for lee waves trapped in their bottom-intensified generating flow. In addition to the loss to explicit dissipation and reabsorption predicted by linear wave action conservation, indirect dissipation due to a nonlinear forward cascade by parametric subharmonic instability represents a significant sink that substantially reduces reabsorption. The partition of lee-wave energy loss between reabsorption and (explicit plus indirect) dissipation is independent of subgridscale damping parameterization. Remote dissipation of freely propagating internal waves generated by shear instability at the lee-wave critical layer proves to be small. A general parameterization for lee-wave dissipation of the balanced flow requires a more complete exploration of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Be,La,U-rich spherules as microtektites of terrestrial laterites: What goes up must come down</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently Loeb et al. (2024, "Recovery and Classification of Spherules from the Pacific Ocean Site of the CNEOS 2014 January 8 (IM1) Bolide", Res. Notes. Amer. Astron. Soc. 8, 39) reported the magnetic collection of millimeter-sized spherules from the seafloor near Papua New Guinea. About 22% had Mg/Si &lt; 1/3 and were identified as a new "differentiated" variety of cosmic spherule ("D-type"). In a subset of 26 of these "D-type" spherules, 12 "BeLaU" spherules were found to be dominated by Fe and Al, marked by low Si and even lower Mg content, depletions of volatile species like Pb and Cs, and remarkable enrichments of Be, La, U, Ba, and other elements. Loeb et al. claimed these have exotic compositions different from other Solar System materials. We show that in fact samples with these compositions are not just found on Earth, they are from Earth; specifically, we identify them as microtektites of terrestrial lateritic sandstone. Based on the location of the sample site, we associate them with the Australasian tektite strewn field, generated 788 kyr ago by an impactor that melted and ejected ~10^8 tons of sandstone, including a lateritic layer, from Indochina. A tektite origin for the spherules is corroborated by their terrestrial Fe isotopic compositions and the compound, non-spherical nature of many of them, which preclude formation as ablation spherules from a bolide. Due to the restriction of laterites to the tropics, iron-rich tektites may be uncommon, but we predict they should comprise ~3% of the Australasian microtektites.</description>

      <title>Interannual Magneto-Coriolis modes and their sensitivity on the magnetic field within the Earth's core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear modes for which the Coriolis acceleration is almost entirely in balance with the Lorentz force are called Magneto-Coriolis (MC) modes. These MC modes are thought to exist in Earth's liquid outer core and could therefore contribute to the variations observed in Earth's magnetic field. The background state on which these waves ride is assumed here to be static and defined by a prescribed magnetic field and zero flow. We introduce a new computational tool to efficiently compute solutions to the related eigenvalue problem, and study the effect of a range of both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric background magnetic fields on the MC modes. We focus on a hierarchy of conditions that sequentially partition the numerous computed modes into those which are (i) in principle observable, (ii) those which match a proxy for interannual geomagnetic signal over 1999-2023, and (iii) those which align with core-flows based on recent geomagnetic data. We found that the background field plays a crucial role in determining the structure of the modes. In particular, we found no examples of axisymmetric background fields that support modes consistent with recent geomagnetic changes, but that some non-axisymmetric background fields do support geomagnetically consistent modes.</description>
