      <title>Trading Devil Final: Backdoor attack via Stock market and Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the advent of generative artificial intelligence, every company and researcher has been rushing to develop their own generative models, whether commercial or not. Given the large number of users of these powerful new tools, there is currently no intrinsically verifiable way to explain from the ground up what happens when LLMs (large language models) learn. For example, those based on automatic speech recognition systems, which have to rely on huge and astronomical amounts of data collected from all over the web to produce fast and efficient results, In this article, we develop a backdoor attack called MarketBackFinal 2.0, based on acoustic data poisoning, MarketBackFinal 2.0 is mainly based on modern stock market models. In order to show the possible vulnerabilities of speech-based transformers that may rely on LLMs.</description>

      <title>Super-efficiency and Stock Market Valuation: Evidence from Listed Banks in China (2006 to 2023)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between bank efficiency and stock market valuation using an unbalanced panel dataset of 42 listed banks in China from 2006 to 2023. We employ a non-radial and non-oriented slack based super-efficiency Data Envelopment Analysis (Super-SBM-UND-VRS based DEA) model, which treats Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) as an undesired output. Our results show that the relationship between super-efficiency and stock market valuation is stronger than that between Return on Asset (ROA) and stock market performance, as measured by Tobin's Q. Notably, the Super-SBM-UND-VRS model yields novel results compared to other efficiency methods, such as the Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) approach and traditional DEA models. Furthermore, our results suggest that bank evaluations benefit from decreased ownership concentration, whereas interest rate liberalization has the opposite effect.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Profitability and Investor Confidence through Interpretable AI Models for Investment Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16223</link>

Abstract: Financial forecasting plays an important role in making informed decisions for financial stakeholders, specifically in the stock exchange market. In a traditional setting, investors commonly rely on the equity research department for valuable reports on market insights and investment recommendations. The equity research department, however, faces challenges in effectuating decision-making do to the demanding cognitive effort required for analyzing the inherently volatile nature of market dynamics. Furthermore, financial forecasting systems employed by analysts pose potential risks in terms of interpretability and gaining the trust of all stakeholders. This paper presents an interpretable decision-making model leveraging the SHAP-based explainability technique to forecast investment recommendations. The proposed solution not only provides valuable insights into the factors that influence forecasted recommendations but also caters the investors of varying types, including those interested in daily and short-term investment opportunities. To ascertain the efficacy of the proposed model, a case study is devised that demonstrates a notable enhancement in investor's portfolio value, employing our trading strategies. The results highlight the significance of incorporating interpretability in forecasting models to boost stakeholders' confidence and foster transparency in the stock exchange domain.</description>
