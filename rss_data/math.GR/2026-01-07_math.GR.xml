      <title>Construction of groups with triality and their corresponding code loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the global construction of code loops introduced by Nagy, which is based on the connection between Moufang loops and groups with triality. This follows from the construction of a nilpotent group $G_n$ of class 3 with triality and $2n$ generators, based on embeddings of $G_n$ into direct products of copies of $G_3$. In the finite case, where $G_n$ is a group such that $|G_n| = 2^{4n+m}$ with $n \ge 3$ and $m = 3 {n \choose 2} + 2 {n \choose 3}$, we prove that the corresponding Moufang loop is the free loop $F_n$ with $n$ generators in the variety generated by code loops. The result depends on a construction similar to that of $G_n$, namely, embedding $F_n$ into direct products of copies of $F_3$, the free code loop associated with $G_3$.</description>

      <title>The Sequence Reconstruction of Permutations under Hamming Metric with Small Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sequence reconstruction problem asks for the recovery of a sequence from multiple noisy copies, where each copy may contain up to $r$ errors. In the case of permutations on \(n\) letters under the Hamming metric, this problem is closely related to the parameter $N(n,r)$, the maximum intersection size of two Hamming balls of radius $r$. While previous work has resolved \(N(n,r)\) for small radii (\(r \leq 4\)) and established asymptotic bounds for larger \(r\), we present new exact formulas for \(r \in \{5,6,7\}\) using group action techniques. In addition, we develop a formula for \(N(n,r)\) based on the irreducible characters of the symmetric group \(S_n\), along with an algorithm that enables computation of \(N(n,r)\) for larger parameters, including cases such as \(N(43,8)\) and \(N(24,14)\).</description>

      <title>Remarks on $d$-independent topological groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-trivial topological group is called \emph{$d$-independent} if for every subgroup of cardinality less than the continuum there exists a countable dense subgroup intersecting it trivially. This notion was introduced by M\'arquez and Tkachenko and has been intensively studied in the metrizable setting. In particular, they proved that a second-countable locally compact abelian group is $d$-independent if and only if it is algebraically an $M$-group, and asked whether the same conclusion holds for all separable locally compact groups.
  In this paper we give an affirmative answer to this question. We show that every separable locally compact abelian $M$-group is $d$-independent, thereby removing the metrizability assumption from the result of M\'arquez and Tkachenko.
  In addition, we investigate several further aspects of $d$-independence. We study its behaviour under taking powers of topological groups and extend the notion of $d$-independence to the non-abelian setting. Moreover, we prove that every separable connected compact group is $d$-independent, thereby answering another question posed by M\'arquez and Tkachenko.</description>

      <title>Generalized affine buildings for semisimple algebraic groups over real closed fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use real algebraic geometry to construct an affine $\Lambda$-building $B$ associated to the $\mathbb{F}$-points of a semisimple algebraic group, where $\mathbb{F}$ is a valued real closed field. We characterize the spherical building at infinity and the local building at a base point. We compute stabilizers of various subsets of $B$ and obtain group decompositions.</description>

      <title>Incubulable hyperbolic 3-pseudomanifold groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct compact hyperbolic 3-manifolds with totally geodesic boundary, such that the closed 3-pseudomanifolds obtained by coning off the boundary components are negatively curved and contain locally convex subspaces whose fundamental groups have property (T). In particular, the fundamental groups of these 3-pseudomanifolds are word hyperbolic but not cubulable.</description>

      <title>Dualities for finite abelian groups and applications to coding theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The choice of an isomorphism, a duality, between a finite abelian group $A$ and its character group allows one to define dual codes of additive codes over $A$. Properties of dualities and dual codes are studied, continuing work of Delsarte from 1973 and more recent work of Dougherty and his collaborators.</description>

      <title>A combination theorem for hierarchically quasiconvex subgroups, and application to geometric subgroups of mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide sufficient conditions for two subgroups of a hierarchically hyperbolic group to generate an amalgamated free product over their intersection. The result applies in particular to certain geometric subgroups of mapping class groups of finite-type surfaces, that is, those subgroups coming from the embeddings of closed subsurfaces. In the second half of the paper, we study under which hypotheses our amalgamation procedure preserves several notions of convexity, such as hierarchical quasiconvexity (as introduced by Behrstock, Hagen, and Sisto) and strong quasiconvexity (every quasigeodesic with endpoints on the subset lies in a uniform neighbourhood). This answers a question of Russell, Spriano, and Tran.</description>

      <title>Bounded cohomology, quotient extensions, and hierarchical hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We call a central extension bounded if its Euler class is represented by a bounded cocycle. We prove that a bounded central extension of a hierarchically hyperbolic group (HHG) is still a HHG; conversely if a central extension is a HHG, then the extension is bounded, and under a further mild assumption the quotient is commensurable to a HHG. Motivated by questions on hierarchical hyperbolicity of quotients of mapping class groups, we therefore consider the general problem of determining when a quotient of a bounded central extension is still bounded, which we prove to be equivalent to an extendability problem for quasihomomorphisms. Finally, we show that quotients of the 4-strands braid group by suitable powers of a pseudo-Anosov are HHG, and in fact bounded central extensions of some HHG. We also speculate on how to extend the previous result to all mapping class groups.</description>

      <title>On Minimal generating sets of splitting field, Cluster towers and Multiple transitivity of Galois groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A natural generating set for a Galois extension regarded as the splitting field of an irreducible polynomial is introduced and investigated here. Minimal generating sets arising in this context throw many surprises compared to the analogous concept in linear algebra: they can be of different cardinalities. In fact we establish that for a certain family of polynomials over the rationals, we have minimal generating sets of all cardinalities in a certain range and that these are the only possible cardinalities for minimal generating set for such a polynomial. We also study how minimal generating sets behave under multiple transitivity of the Galois group and consequently prove the existence of polynomials with all minimal generating sets of uniformly same cardinality. We also connect minimal generating sets with the concept of root cluster tower of an irreducible polynomial introduced by the second author and Krithika in [8].</description>

      <title>Determining subgroups via stationary measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider random walks on the isometry groups of general metric spaces. Under some mild conditions, we show that if two non-elementary random walks on a discrete subgroup of the isometry group have non-singular stationary measures, then subgroups generated by the random walks are commensurable. This result in particular applies to separable Gromov hyperbolic spaces and Teichm\"uller spaces. As a specific application, we prove singularity between stationary measures associated to random walks on different fiber subgroups of the fundamental group of a hyperbolic 3-manifold fibering over the circle.</description>
