      <title>On a conjecture of Simpson</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a compact Riemann surface $\Sigma$ of genus $g&gt;1$, equipped with a complex vector bundle $E$ of rank $2$ and degree zero let $M_H$ be the moduli space of Higgs bundles. $M_H$ admits a $\mathbb C^{\star}$-action and to each stable $\mathbb C^{\star}$-fixed point $[(\bar\partial_0,\Phi_0)]$ is associated a holomorphic Lagrangian submanifold $W^1(\bar\partial_0,\Phi_0)$ inside the de Rham moduli space $M_{dR}$ of complex flat connections. In this note we prove a conjecture of Simpson stating that $W^1(\bar\partial_0,\Phi_0)$ is closed inside $M_{dR}$.</description>

      <title>Ricci curvature and Einstein metrics on aligned homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M=G/K$ be a compact homogeneous space and assume that $G$ and $K$ have many simple factors. We show that the topological condition of having maximal third Betti number, in the sense that $b_3(M)=s-1$ if $G$ has $s$ simple factors, so called {\it aligned}, leads to a relatively manageable algebraic structure on the isotropy representation, paving the way to the computation of Ricci curvature formulas for a large class of $G$-invariant metrics. As an application, we study the existence and classification of Einstein metrics on aligned homogeneous spaces.</description>

      <title>Ricci Flows with Nilpotent Symmetry and Zero Bundle Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Lott's functional and construct a new functional to derive rigidity results for invariant Ricci flow blowdown limits on nilpotent principal bundles with zero associated curvature. Consequently, we prove that the blowdown limit is locally an expanding Ricci soliton when the structure group is the three dimensional Heisenberg group. In addition, we classify this soliton when the base manifold is one dimensional. This, together with Lott's work in the abelian setting, yields a complete local classification of invariant Ricci flow blowdown limits on four dimensional, nilpotent principal bundles.</description>

      <title>Geometric spectral optimization on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of optimal metrics for a wide class of combinations of Laplace eigenvalues on closed orientable surfaces of any genus. The optimal metrics are explicitely related to Laplace minimal eigenmaps, defined as branched minimal immersions into ellipsoids parametrized by the eigenvalues of the critical metrics whose coordinates are eigenfunctions with respect to these eigenvalues. In particular, we prove existence of maximal metrics for the first Laplace eigenvalue on orientable surfaces of any genus. In this case, the target of eigenmaps are spheres. This completes a broad picture, first drawn by J. Hersch, 1970 (sphere), M. Berger 1973, N. Nadirashvili 1996 (tori). Our result is based on the combination of accurate constructions of Palais-Smale-like sequences for spectral functionals and on techniques by M. Karpukhin, R. Kusner, P. McGrath, D. Stern 2024, developped in the case of an equivariant optimization of the first Laplace and Steklov eigenvalues. Their result is significantly extended for two reasons: specific equivariant optimizations are not required anymore to obtain existence of maximizers of the first eigenvalue for any topology and our technique also holds for combinations of eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Focal Curves of Closed Toroidal Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric constructions are widely used in computer graphics and engineering drawing. A right generalized cylinder is a ruled surface whose base curve is a plane curve perpendicular to the rulings. The paper discusses relations between the base curve and the non-planar space curve on the right generalized cylinder. Based on these relations, a method for obtaining a new space curve from a given plane curve parameterized about an arbitrary parameter is presented. At first, we define a non-planar space curve on the right generalized cylinder whose base curve is the considered plane curve, parameterized about an arbitrary parameter. Later on, we examine the focal curve of the obtained cylindrical curve which is also a non-planar curve. The Frenet-Seret system of the cylindrical curve and its focal curve are expressed in terms of the signed curvature of the abovementioned plane curve and its derivatives. Finally, we obtained the parametric representation of orthogonal projection of the focal curve onto the Euclidean plane via before mentioned plane curve and its derivatives. That curve is called generalized focal curve of a plane curve. The proposed method is demonstrated for several closed plane curves used in engineering practice. These curves include: epicycloid, hypocycloid and a curve that is orthogonal projection of toroidal helix onto the Euclidean plane.</description>

      <title>A Local Method for Compact and Non-compact Yamabe Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ (M, g) $ be a compact manifold or a complete non-compact manifold without boundary, $ \dim M \geqslant 4 $, and not locally conformally flat. In this article, we introduce a new local method to resolve the Yamabe problem on compact manifold for dimensions at least $ 4 $, and the Yamabe problem on non-compact complete manifolds without boundary, which are pointwise conformal to subsets of some compact manifolds. In particular, the new local method applies to the hard cases--the Yamabe constants are positive. Our local method also generalizes Brezis and Nirenberg's nonlinear eigenvalue problem to subsets of manifolds.</description>

      <title>Biharmonic Hypersurfaces in Euclidean Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An isometric immersion $X: \Sigma^n \longrightarrow \mathbb{E}^{n+1}$ is biharmonic if $\Delta^2 X = 0$, i.e. if $\Delta H =0$, where $\Delta$ and $H$ are the metric Laplacian and the mean curvature vector field of $\Sigma^n$ respectively. More generally, biconservative hypersurfaces (BCH) are isometric immersions for which only the tangential part of the biharmonic equation vanishes. We study and construct BCH that are holonomic, i.e. for which the principal curvature directions define an integrable net, and we deduce that $\Sigma^n$ is a holonomic biharmonic hypersurface iff it is minimal.</description>

      <title>Nijenhuis operators on Banach homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a Banach--Lie group $G$ and an embedded Lie subgroup $K$ we consider the homogeneous Banach manifold $\mathcal M=G/K$. In this context we establish the most general conditions for a bounded operator $N$ acting on $Lie(G)$ to define a homogeneous vector bundle map $\mathcal N:T\mathcal M\to T\mathcal M$. In particular our considerations extend all previous settings on the matter and are well-suited for the case where $Lie(K)$ is not complemented in $Lie(G)$. We show that the vanishing of the Nijenhuis torsion for a homogeneous vector bundle map $\mathcal N:T\mathcal M\to T\mathcal M$ (defined by an admissible bounded operator $N$ on $Lie(G)$) is equivalent to the Nijenhuis torsion of $N$ having values in $Lie(K)$. As an application, we consider the question of integrability of an almost complex structure $\mathcal J$ on $\mathcal M$ induced by an admissible bounded operator $J$, and we give a simple characterization of integrability in terms of certain subspaces of the complexification of $Lie(G)$ (which are not eigenspaces of the complex extension of $J$).</description>

      <title>Additional first order equation for infinitesimal bendings of smooth surfaces in the isothermal coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article contributes to the theory of infinitesimal bendings of smooth surfaces in Euclidean 3-space. We derive a certain linear differential equation of the first order, which previously did not appear in the literature and which is satisfied by any Darboux rotation field of a smooth surface. We show that, for some surfaces, this additional equation is functionally independent of the three standard equations that the Darboux rotation field satisfies (and by which it is determined). As a consequence of this additional equation, we prove the maximum principle for the components of the Darboux rotation field for disk-homeomorphic surfaces with strictly positive Gaussian curvature.</description>

Abstract: We survey the recent history of the conformal Calabi-Yau problem consisting in determining the complex structures admitted by complete bounded minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Moreover, we prove that for any minimally convex domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and any compact Riemann surface $R$ there is a Cantor set $C$ in $R$ whose complement $R\setminus C$ is the complex structure of a complete proper minimal surface in $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Almost Hermitian structures on moduli spaces of non-Abelian monopoles and applications to the topology of symplectic four-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is a sequel to our previous monograph arXiv:2010.15789 (to appear in AMS Memoirs), where we initiated our program to prove that the Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau inequality holds for closed, symplectic four-manifolds and, more generally, for closed, smooth four-manifolds with a Seiberg-Witten basic class. This inequality was first proved for compact, complex surfaces of general type by Miyaoka (1977) and Yau (1978). Our approach uses a version of Morse theory for a natural Hamiltonian, the square of the $L^2$ norm of the coupled spinors, for the circle action on the moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles over a closed four-manifold. It has the aim of proving the existence of a projectively anti-self-dual connection on a rank-two Hermitian vector bundle over a blow-up of the four-manifold, where the first Pontrjagin number of the vector bundle is negative and greater than or equal to minus the Euler characteristic of the blown-up four-manifold. Our Morse theory argument relies on positivity of virtual Morse-Bott indices for critical points of Hamiltonians for circle actions on complex analytic spaces (or real analytic spaces that, locally, are sufficiently well-approximated by complex analytic model spaces), as developed by the first author in arXiv:2206.14710. In our application to the moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles, the critical points are fixed points of the circle action and thus represented by Seiberg-Witten monopoles.</description>

      <title>One-sided type-D metrics with aligned Einstein-Maxwell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider four-dimensional, Riemannian metrics for which one or other of the self-dual or anti-self-dual Weyl tensors is type-D and which satisfy the Einstein-Maxwell equations with the corresponding Maxwell field aligned with the type-D Weyl spinor, in the sense of sharing the same Principal Null Directions (or PNDs). Such metrics always have a valence-2 Killing spinor, and therefore a Hermitian structure and at least one Killing vector. We rederive the results of Araneda (\cite{ba}), that these metrics can all be given in terms of a solution of the $SU(\infty)$-Toda field equation, and show that, when there is a second Killing vector commuting with the first, the method of Ward can be applied to show that the metrics can also be given in terms of a pair of axisymmetric solutions of the flat three-dimensional Laplacian. Thus in particular the field equations linearise.
  Some examples of the constructions are given.</description>

      <title>The Logarithmic Sobolev inequality on non-compact self-shrinkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the paper we establish an optimal logarithmic Sobolev inequality for complete, non-compact, properly embedded self-shrinkers in the Euclidean space, which generalizes a recent result of Brendle \cite{Brendle22} for closed self-shrinkers. We first provide a proof for the logarithmic Sobolev inequality in the Euclidean space by using the Alexandrov-Bakelman-Pucci (ABP) method. Then we use this approach to show an optimal logarithmic Sobolev inequality for complete, non-compact, properly embedded self-shrinkers in the Euclidean space, which is a sharp version of the result of Ecker in \cite{Ecker}. The proof is a noncompact modification of Brendle's proof for closed submanifolds and has a big potential to provide new inequalities in noncompact manifolds.</description>

      <title>Positive ($S^1$-equivariant) symplectic homology of convex domains, higher capacities, and Clarke's duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the positive ($S^1$-equivariant) symplectic homology of a convex domain is naturally isomorphic to the singular ($S^1$-equivariant) homology of Clarke's dual associated with the convex domain. As a result, we prove that the Gutt-Hutchings capacities coincide with the spectral invariants introduced by Ekeland-Hofer for convex domains. From this identification, it follows that Besse convex contact spheres can be characterized by the Gutt-Hutchings capacities, which implies that symplectomorphisms of the interiors of Besse convex bodies encode information about the Reeb flow on their boundaries. Moreover, as a corollary of the aforementioned isomorphism, we deduce that the barcode entropy associated with the singular homology of Clarke's dual provides a lower bound for the topological entropy of the Reeb flow on the boundary of a convex domain in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. In particular, this barcode entropy coincides with the topological entropy for convex domains in $\mathbb{R}^4$.</description>

      <title>On geometric properties of holomorphic isometries between bounded symmetric domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study holomorphic isometries between bounded symmetric domains with respect to the Bergman metrics up to a normalizing constant. In particular, we first consider a holomorphic isometry from the complex unit ball into an irreducible bounded symmetric domain with respect to the Bergman metrics. In this direction, we show that images of (nonempty) affine-linear sections of the complex unit ball must be the intersections of the image of the holomorphic isometry with certain affine-linear subspaces. We also construct a surjective holomorphic submersion from a certain subdomain of the target bounded symmetric domain onto the complex unit ball such that the image of the holomorphic isometry lies inside the subdomain and the holomorphic isometry is a global holomorphic section of the holomorphic submersion. This construction could be generalized to any holomorphic isometry between bounded symmetric domains with respect to the \emph{canonical K\"ahler metrics}. Using some classical results for complex-analytic subvarieties of Stein manifolds, we have obtained further geometric results for images of such holomorphic isometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study the concept of quaternionic bisectional curvature introduced by B. Chow and D. Yang for quaternion-K\"ahler manifolds. We show that non-negative quaternionic bisectional curvature is only realized for the quaternionic projective space. We also show that all symmetric quaternion-K\"ahler manifolds different from the quaternionic projective space admit quaternionic lines of negative quaternionic bisectional curvature. In particular this implies that non-negative sectional curvature does not imply non-negative quaternionic bisectional curvature. Moreover we give a new and rather short proof of a classification result by A. Gray on compact K\"ahler manifolds of non-negative sectional curvature.</description>

Abstract: We investigate, under a volume constraint and among sets contained in a Euclidean half-space, the minimization problem of an energy functional given by the sum of a capillarity perimeter, a nonlocal interaction term and a gravitational potential energy. The capillarity perimeter assigns a constant weight to the portion of the boundary touching the boundary of the half-space. The nonlocal term is represented by a double integral of a positive kernel $g$, while the gravitational term is represented by the integral of a positive potential $G$.
  We first establish existence of volume-constrained minimizers in the small mass regime, together with several qualitative properties of minimizers. The existence result holds for rather general choices of kernels in the nonlocal interaction term, including attractive-repulsive ones. When the nonlocal kernel $g(x)=1/|x|^\beta$ with $\beta \in (0,2]$, we also obtain nonexistence of volume constrained minimizers in the large mass regime. Finally, we prove a generalized existence result of minimizers holding for all masses and general nonlocal interaction terms, meaning that the infimum of the problem is realized by a finite disjoint union of sets thought located at ``infinite distance'' one from the other.
  These results stem from an application of quantitative isoperimetric inequalities for the capillarity problem in a half-space.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian surplusection phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14883</link>

Abstract: Suppose you have a family of Lagrangian submanifolds \(L_t\) and an auxiliary Lagrangian \(K\). Suppose that \(K\) intersects some of the \(L_t\) more than the minimal number of times. Can you eliminate surplus intersection (surplusection) with all fibres by performing a Hamiltonian isotopy of \(K\)? Or will any Lagrangian isotopic to \(K\) surplusect some of the fibres? We argue that in several important situations, surplusection cannot be eliminated, and that a better understanding of surplusection phenomena (better bounds and a clearer understanding of how the surplusection is distributed in the family) would help to tackle some outstanding problems in different areas, including Oh's conjecture on the volume-minimising property of the Clifford torus and the concurrent normals conjecture in convex geometry. We pose many open questions.</description>
