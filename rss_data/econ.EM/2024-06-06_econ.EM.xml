      <title>Comments on B. Hansen's Reply to "A Comment on: `A Modern Gauss-Markov Theorem'", and Some Related Discussion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In P\"otscher and Preinerstorfer (2022) and in the abridged version P\"otscher and Preinerstorfer (2024, published in Econometrica) we have tried to clear up the confusion introduced in Hansen (2022a) and in the earlier versions Hansen (2021a,b). Unfortunatelly, Hansen's (2024) reply to P\"otscher and Preinerstorfer (2024) further adds to the confusion. While we are already somewhat tired of the matter, for the sake of the econometrics community we feel compelled to provide clarification. We also add a comment on Portnoy (2023), a "correction" to Portnoy (2022), as well as on Lei and Wooldridge (2022).</description>

      <title>GLOBUS: Global building renovation potential by 2070</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surpassing the two large emission sectors of transportation and industry, the building sector accounted for 34% and 37% of global energy consumption and carbon emissions in 2021, respectively. The building sector, the final piece to be addressed in the transition to net-zero carbon emissions, requires a comprehensive, multisectoral strategy for reducing emissions. Until now, the absence of data on global building floorspace has impeded the measurement of building carbon intensity (carbon emissions per floorspace) and the identification of ways to achieve carbon neutrality for buildings. For this study, we develop a global building stock model (GLOBUS) to fill that data gap. Our study's primary contribution lies in providing a dataset of global building stock turnover using scenarios that incorporate various levels of building renovation. By unifying the evaluation indicators, the dataset empowers building science researchers to perform comparative analyses based on floorspace. Specifically, the building stock dataset establishes a reference for measuring carbon emission intensity and decarbonization intensity of buildings within different countries. Further, we emphasize the sufficiency of existing buildings by incorporating building renovation into the model. Renovation can minimize the need to expand the building stock, thereby bolstering decarbonization of the building sector.</description>

      <title>Strong Approximations for Empirical Processes Indexed by Lipschitz Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents new uniform Gaussian strong approximations for empirical processes indexed by classes of functions based on $d$-variate random vectors ($d\geq1$). First, a uniform Gaussian strong approximation is established for general empirical processes indexed by Lipschitz functions, encompassing and improving on all previous results in the literature. When specialized to the setting considered by Rio (1994), and certain constraints on the function class hold, our result improves the approximation rate $n^{-1/(2d)}$ to $n^{-1/\max\{d,2\}}$, up to the same $\operatorname{polylog} n$ term, where $n$ denotes the sample size. Remarkably, we establish a valid uniform Gaussian strong approximation at the optimal rate $n^{-1/2}\log n$ for $d=2$, which was previously known to be valid only for univariate ($d=1$) empirical processes via the celebrated Hungarian construction (Koml\'os et al., 1975). Second, a uniform Gaussian strong approximation is established for a class of multiplicative separable empirical processes indexed by Lipschitz functions, which address some outstanding problems in the literature (Chernozhukov et al., 2014, Section 3). In addition, two other uniform Gaussian strong approximation results are presented for settings where the function class takes the form of a sequence of Haar basis based on generalized quasi-uniform partitions. We demonstrate the improvements and usefulness of our new strong approximation results with several statistical applications to nonparametric density and regression estimation.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity-robust granular instruments</title>

Abstract: Granular instrumental variables (GIV) has experienced sharp growth in empirical macro-finance. The methodology's rise showcases granularity's potential for identification across many economic environments, like the estimation of spillovers and demand systems. I propose a new estimator--called robust granular instrumental variables (RGIV)--that enables studying unit-level heterogeneity in spillovers. Unlike existing methods that assume heterogeneity is a function of observables, RGIV leaves heterogeneity unrestricted. In contrast to the baseline GIV estimator, RGIV allows for unknown shock variances and equal-sized units. Applied to the Euro area, I find strong evidence of country-level heterogeneity in sovereign yield spillovers.</description>

      <title>The learning effects of subsidies to bundled goods: a semiparametric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01217v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can temporary subsidies to bundles induce long-run changes in demand due to learning about the quality of one of the constituent goods? This paper provides theoretical support and empirical evidence on this mechanism. Theoretically, we introduce a model where an agent learns about the quality of an innovation through repeated consumption. We then assess the predictions of our theory in a randomised experiment in a ridesharing platform. The experiment subsidised car trips integrating with a train or metro station, which we interpret as a bundle. Given the heavy-tailed nature of our data, we propose a semiparametric specification for treatment effects that enables the construction of more efficient estimators. We then introduce an efficient estimator for our specification by relying on L-moments. Our results indicate that a ten-weekday 50\% discount on integrated trips leads to a large contemporaneous increase in the demand for integration, and, consistent with our model, persistent changes in the mean and dispersion of nonintegrated app rides. These effects last for over four months. A calibration of our theoretical model suggests that around 40\% of the contemporaneous increase in integrated rides may be attributable to increased incentives to learning. Our results have nontrivial policy implications for the design of public transit systems.</description>

      <title>Distributional Treatment Effect with Latent Rank Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Treatment effect heterogeneity is of a great concern when evaluating the treatment. However, even with a simple case of a binary random treatment, the distribution of treatment effect is difficult to identify due to the fundamental limitation that we cannot observe both treated potential outcome and untreated potential outcome for a given individual. This paper assumes a conditional independence assumption that the two potential outcomes are independent of each other given a scalar latent variable. Using two proxy variables, we identify conditional distribution of the potential outcomes given the latent variable. To pin down the location of the latent variable, we assume strict monotonicty on some functional of the conditional distribution; with specific example of strictly increasing conditional expectation, we label the latent variable as 'latent rank' and motivate the identifying assumption as 'latent rank invariance.'</description>

      <title>Augmented balancing weights as linear regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a novel characterization of augmented balancing weights, also known as automatic debiased machine learning (AutoDML). These popular doubly robust or de-biased machine learning estimators combine outcome modeling with balancing weights - weights that achieve covariate balance directly in lieu of estimating and inverting the propensity score. When the outcome and weighting models are both linear in some (possibly infinite) basis, we show that the augmented estimator is equivalent to a single linear model with coefficients that combine the coefficients from the original outcome model and coefficients from an unpenalized ordinary least squares (OLS) fit on the same data. We see that, under certain choices of regularization parameters, the augmented estimator often collapses to the OLS estimator alone; this occurs for example in a re-analysis of the Lalonde 1986 dataset. We then extend these results to specific choices of outcome and weighting models. We first show that the augmented estimator that uses (kernel) ridge regression for both outcome and weighting models is equivalent to a single, undersmoothed (kernel) ridge regression. This holds numerically in finite samples and lays the groundwork for a novel analysis of undersmoothing and asymptotic rates of convergence. When the weighting model is instead lasso-penalized regression, we give closed-form expressions for special cases and demonstrate a ``double selection'' property. Our framework opens the black box on this increasingly popular class of estimators, bridges the gap between existing results on the semiparametric efficiency of undersmoothed and doubly robust estimators, and provides new insights into the performance of augmented balancing weights.</description>
