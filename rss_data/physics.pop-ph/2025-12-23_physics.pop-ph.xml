      <title>Physicists Joke</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a reconstructed English edition of the seminal humor anthology \textbf{Physicists Joke} (\textbf{Fiziki Shutyat}), originally published in the USSR in 1966. While the Soviet edition served as a significant cultural artifact of the 1960s, a large portion of its content consisted of Russian translations of articles originally written in English. To avoid the loss of nuance inherent in back-translation, this edition does not simply translate the Russian text. Instead, the original English source materials have been identified and restored from archives of journals such as \textbf{Physics Today}, \textbf{The Journal of Irreproducible Results}, \textbf{New Scientist}, and \textbf{Proceedings of the IEEE}. The specific structural framework of the 1966 book has been preserved, along with English translations of the unique Russian scientific folklore, anecdotes, and editorial interludes compiled by the original Soviet editors. This collection offers a glimpse into the sociology of science and the shared professional culture of the "Golden Age" of mid-20th-century physics.</description>

      <title>A Search for Radio Technosignatures from Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS with the Allen Telescope Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2025 July, the third-ever interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, was discovered on its ingress into the Solar System. Similar to the NASA Voyager missions sent in 1977, science probes by extraterrestrial life (artifact ``technosignatures'') could be sent to explore other stellar systems like our own. In this campaign, we used the SETI Institute's Allen Telescope Array to observe 3I/ATLAS from 1--9~GHz. We detected nearly 74 million narrowband hits in 7.25~hr of data using the newly-developed search pipeline \texttt{bliss}. We then applied blanking in frequency and drift rate to mitigate Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) in our dataset, narrowing the dataset down to $\sim$2 million hits. These hits were further filtered by the localization code \texttt{NBeamAnalysis}, and the remaining 211 hits were visually inspected in the time-frequency domain. We did not find any signals worthy of additional follow-up. Accounting for the Doppler drift correction and given the non-detection, we are able to set an Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) upper limit of $10-110$~W on radio technosignatures from 3I/ATLAS across the frequency and drift rate ranges covered by our survey.</description>

      <title>Optical SETI at ESO in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The searches for other life and for intelligence are fundamental problems that science faces today. Most searches so far have been focused on radio, but optical laser communication is an alternative, well suited for a ground-based observatory. A project to search for artificial laser communications with the current and future extreme multiplexity spectroscopic facilities that ESO may develop by the 2040s is outlined. The monochromatic light is a clearly identifiable technosignature. The enormous corollary outreach potential of this initiative is underlined.</description>

      <title>Quantum Listenings -- Amateur Sonification of Vacuum and other Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sensory perceptions of vision and sound may be considered as complementary doorways towards interpreting and understanding physical phenomena. We provide a few selected samples where scientific data of systems usually not directly accessible to humans may be listened to. The examples are chosen close to the regime where quantum mechanics is applicable. Visual and auditory renderings are compared with some connections to music, illustrating in particular a kind of fractal complexity along the time axis.</description>

      <title>The meaning of "Big Bang"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What does ``Big Bang'' actually mean? What was the origin of these two words? It has often been said that the expression ``Big Bang'' began as an insult. Even if this were true, it would be just an irrelevant part of the whole issue. There are many more aspects hidden under this name, and which are seldom explained. They will be discussed in this work. In order to frame the analysis, help will be sought from the highly authoritative voices of two exceptional writers: William Shakespeare and Umberto Eco. Both Shakespeare and Eco have explored the tension existing between words and the realities they name. With the conclusion that names are, in general, just labels, simple stickers put to identify things. And this includes those given to great theorems or spectacular discoveries. Stigler's law of eponymy is recalled to further substantiate those statements. These points will be at the heart of the investigation carried out here, concerning the very important concept of ``Big Bang''. Everybody thinks to know what ``the Big Bang'' is, but only very few do know it, in fact. When Fred Hoyle first pronounced these two words together, on a BBC radio program, listeners were actually left with the false image that Hoyle was trying to destroy. That is, the tremendous explosion of Lema\^itre's primeval atom (or cosmic egg), which scattered all its enormous matter and energy content throughout the rest of the Universe. This image is absolutely wrong! As will be concluded, today the label ``Big Bang'' is used in several different contexts: (a) the Big Bang Singularity; (b) as the equivalent of cosmic inflation; (c) speaking of the Big Bang cosmological model; (d) to name a very popular TV program; and more.</description>
