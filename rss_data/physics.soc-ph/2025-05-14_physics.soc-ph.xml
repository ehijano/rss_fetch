      <title>Behavioral and Topological Heterogeneities in Network Versions of Schelling's Segregation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05623v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agent-based models of residential segregation have been of persistent interest to various research communities since their origin with James Sakoda and popularization by Thomas Schelling. Frequently, these models have sought to elucidate the extent to which the collective dynamics of individual preferences may cause segregation to emerge. This open question has sustained relevance in U.S. jurisprudence. Previous investigation of heterogeneity of behaviors (preferences) has shown reductions in segregation. Meanwhile, previous investigation of heterogeneity of social network topologies has shown no significant impact to observed segregation levels. In the present study, we examined the effects of the concurrent presence of both behavioral and topological heterogeneities in network segregation models. Simulations were conducted using both homogeneous and heterogeneous preference models on 2D lattices with varied levels of densification to create topological heterogeneities (i.e., clusters, hubs). Results show a richer variety of outcomes, including novel differences in resultant segregation levels and hub composition. Notably, with concurrent increased representations of heterogeneous preferences and heterogeneous topologies, reduced levels of segregation emerge. Simultaneously, we observe a novel dynamic of segregation between tolerance levels as highly tolerant nodes take residence in dense areas and push intolerant nodes to sparse areas mimicking the urban-rural divide.</description>

      <title>Metric Similarity and Manifold Learning of Circular Dichroism Spectra of Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a machine learning analysis of circular dichroism spectra of globular proteins from the SP175 database, using the optimal transport-based $1$-Wasserstein distance $\mathcal{W}_1$ (with order $p=1$) and the manifold learning algorithm $t$-SNE. Our results demonstrate that $\mathcal{W}_1$ is consistent with both Euclidean and Manhattan metrics while exhibiting robustness to noise. On the other hand, $t$-SNE uncovers meaningful structure in the high-dimensional data. The clustering in the $t$-SNE embedding is primarily determined by proteins with distinct secondary structure compositions: one cluster predominantly contains $\beta$-rich proteins, while the other consists mainly of proteins with mixed $\alpha/\beta$ and $\alpha$-helical content.</description>
