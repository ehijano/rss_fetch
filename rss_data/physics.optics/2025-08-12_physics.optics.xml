      <title>GaN/InN HEMT based UV photodetector on SiC with hexagonal boron nitride passivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel Gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) based ultraviolet photodetector architecture integrating advanced material and structural design strategies to enhance detection performance and stability under room-temperature operation. The device is constructed on a high-thermal-conductivity silicon carbide (SiC) substrate and incorporates an n-GaN buffer, an indium nitride (InN) channel layer for improved electron mobility and two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) confinement, and a dual-passivation scheme combining silicon nitride (SiN) and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). A p-GaN layer is embedded between the passivation interfaces to deplete the 2DEG in dark conditions. Lateral nickel (Ni) source and drain electrodes and a recessed gate positioned within the substrate ensure enhanced electric field control and noise suppression. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the integration of a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) interlayer within the dual passivation stack effectively suppresses the gate leakage current from typical literature values of the order of $10^{-7}$~A to approximately $10^{-10}$~A, highlighting its critical role in enhancing interfacial insulation. In addition, consistent with previous reports, the use of a silicon carbide (SiC) substrate offers significantly improved thermal management over sapphire, enabling more stable operation under UV illumination. The device demonstrates strong photoresponse under 360~nm ultraviolet (UV) illumination, high photo-to-dark current ratios (PDCR) of approximately $10^{6}$, and tunable performance via structural optimization of p-GaN width between 0.40~$\mu$m and 1.60~$\mu$m, doping concentration from $5 \times 10^{16}$~cm$^{-3}$ to $5 \times 10^{18}$~cm$^{-3}$, and embedding depth between 0.060~$\mu$m and 0.068~$\mu$m.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Photonic Neuromorphic Chips for Spiking Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic computing chips have made significant progress in accelerating linear computations, but nonlinear computations are usually implemented in the digital domain, which introduces additional system latency and power consumption, and hinders the implementation of fully-functional photonic neural network chips. Here, we propose and fabricate a 16-channel programmable incoherent photonic neuromorphic computing chip by co-designing a simplified MZI mesh and distributed feedback lasers with saturable absorber array using different materials, enabling implementation of both linear and nonlinear spike computations in the optical domain. Furthermore, previous studies mainly focused on supervised learning and simple image classification tasks. Here, we propose a photonic spiking reinforcement learning (RL) architecture for the first time, and develop a software-hardware collaborative training-inference framework to address the challenge of training spiking RL models. We achieve large-scale, energy-efficient (photonic linear computation: 1.39 TOPS/W, photonic nonlinear computation: 987.65 GOPS/W) and low-latency (320 ps) end-to-end deployment of an entire layer of photonic spiking RL. Two RL benchmarks include the discrete CartPole task and the continuous Pendulum tasks are demonstrated experimentally based on spiking proximal policy optimization algorithm. The hardware-software collaborative computing reward value converges to 200 (-250) for the CartPole tasks, respectively, comparable to that of a traditional PPO algorithm. This experimental demonstration addresses the challenge of the absence of large-scale photonic nonlinear spike computation and spiking RL training difficulty, and presents a high-speed and low-latency photonic spiking RL solution with promising application prospects in fields such as real-time decision-making and control for robots and autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>High-power monolithic narrow-linewidth 1.6 mJ/8 ns fiber laser system based on all-glass spun tapered double-clad fiber amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy, narrow-linewidth nanosecond pulses are highly demanding for many applications that require high temporal and spatial coherence. However, the amplification of narrow-linewidth pulses is primarily limited by stimulated Brillouin scattering, which causes pulse instabilities, back-reflected pulses, and catastrophic damage effects on optical components. In this work, we present a 1.6 mJ narrow-linewidth nanosecond pulsed fiber laser system based on all-glass spun tapered double-clad fibers without employing any mitigating technique for the stimulated Brillouin scattering effect. The system delivers pulses with an 8 ns duration at a 100 kHz repetition rate, over 97.5% degree of polarization, a beam quality factor of M2 = 1.3, a spectral linewidth of 53.8 MHz, a 160 W average power, and 188 kW peak power with a slope efficiency of 97.6%. The degree of spatial coherence of the amplified signal was measured to be 0.94. Our results are highly valued in applications requiring high-energy, high-coherence pulses with spectral, spatial, and polarization characteristics in a compact system.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-Locked Kerr Microcombs for Flexible On-Chip Optical Clock Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical atomic clocks deliver unrivaled precision, yet their size and complexity still confine them to specialized laboratories. Frequency combs provide the crucial optical-to-microwave division needed for clock readout, but conventional fiber- or bulk-laser combs are far too large for portable use. The advent of chip-integrated microcombs, frequency combs generated in micron-scale resonators, has revolutionized this landscape, enabling fully miniaturized, low-power clocks that bridge optical and radio-frequency domains on a single chip. Nevertheless, stabilizing a microcomb solely through pump laser control entangles otherwise independent feedback parameters, injects extra technical noise, and prevents flexible partial division of the optical frequency. Here, we propose and demonstrate a universal on-chip optical-clock architecture that supports both partial and full optical division. A hybrid passive-active scheme enables locking any two microcomb teeth independently, eliminating cross-coupling of control loops. Using the pump laser as a nonlinear actuator to stabilize an arbitrary tooth, we achieve a residual relative frequency instability of 1e-16. This advance brings integrated optical clocks closer to real-world deployment and opens new avenues for precision timing and navigation.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency silicon LED with ultra-wideband emission from visible to infrared at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary challenge in silicon photonics is achieving efficient luminescence in the communication band, crucial for its large-scale application. Despite significant efforts, silicon light sources still suffer from low efficiency and limited emission wavelengths. We addressed this by achieving broadband luminescence from 600-1650 nm through femtosecond laser annealing of 220nm standard SOI, resulting in an external quantum efficiency exceeding 0.26% and an output optical power density greater than 20 W/cm2, several orders of magnitude higher than other silicon-based LEDs in performance. The broadband LED has potential applications in optical inspection, gas sensing, optical coherence tomography, optical communication, and more.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numeric simulations based on the Huygens-Fresnel method allow one to develop intuition about the behavior of coherent light in diffraction and interference experiments. They give an opportunity to numerically observe and appreciate a number important phenomena, while avoiding the need to deal with the intricacies of their analytic descriptions. In an introductory teaching lab, they help to build a matrix of ideas, into which many optical demonstration experiments fall nicely and to the benefit of a student.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous optical selection rule for independent control of valley currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal an instantaneous optical valley selection rule that illuminates the coupling between the instantaneous optical chirality of the driving laser field and the chirality of valley systems. Building on this principle, we propose and demonstrate that a single chirality-separated optical field, in which oppositely signed instantaneous optical chiralities are separated within an optical cycle, enables independent manipulation of currents from $\rm K$ and $\rm K^{\prime}$ valleys.Based on this scheme, we highlight two key example applications: (1) complete separation of currents from different valleys, yielding 100\%-purity valley-polarized currents, and (2) generation of pure valley current with zero net charge flow. Our work offers a robust and highly controllable all-optical strategy for ultrafast engineering valley currents in the optical cycle timescale, paving a new avenue for valleytronics and quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>Topological quantum electrodynamics in synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum electrodynamics (QED), a cornerstone framework that describes light-matter interactions rooted in Abelian symmetries, renders the harnessing of synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields as a fundamental yet uncharted frontier. Here, we develop a general theory of light-matter interaction of quantum emitters embedded in non-Abelian photonic lattices. Based on analytical solutions to the non-Abelian Landau dressed states beyond the continuum limit, we reveal chiral photon emission and vortices with emergent nonreciprocity enabled by selective coupling between emitters and spin-momentum-locked bands. When coexisting with Abelian and non-Abelian magnetic fields, emitters hybridize with Landau dressed orbits to form spin-polarized, squeezed Landau polaritons that carry quantized angular momenta, with Rabi frequencies tunable via Landau levels and pseudospin interactions. Multi-emitter dynamics further exhibit collective phenomena governed by real-space staggered phases induced by nonsymmorphic crystalline symmetry. These results bridge non-Abelian physics with quantum optics, and establish non-Abelian gauge fields as a versatile tool for synthesizing topological quantum optical states, angular momentum transfer, and controlling photon-mediated correlations in QED systems, relevant for applications in quantum simulations and chiral quantum optical networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the realization of optical microcavities consisting in the plane-plane arrangement of two suspended Fano mirrors possessing spectrally overlapping high-quality factor internal resonances. We first investigate their generic transmission spectra as the cavity length is varied on the basis of a simple linear Fabry-Perot model, compare them with those of broadband mirror cavities or Fano cavities possessing a single Fano mirror, and then present an experimental realization using a pair of highly pretensioned, ultrathin silicon nitride films patterned with one-dimensional photonic crystal structures.</description>

      <title>Semiconductor Bloch equations in Wannier gauge with well-behaved dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semiconductor Bloch equations (SBEs) with a dephasing operator for the microscopic polarizations are a well established approach to simulate high-harmonic spectra in solids. We discuss the impact of the dephasing operator on the stability of the numerical integration of the SBEs in the Wannier gauge. It is shown that the standard approach to apply dephasing is ill-defined in the presence of band crossings and leads to artifacts in the carrier distribution. They are caused by rapid changes of the dephasing operator matrix elements in the Wannier gauge, which render the convergence of the simulation in the stationary basis infeasible. In the comoving basis, also called Houston basis, these rapid changes can be resolved, but only at the cost of a largely increased computation time. As a remedy, we propose a modification of the dephasing operator with reduced magnitude in energetically close subspaces. This approach removes the artifacts in the carrier distribution and significantly speeds up the calculations, while affecting the high-harmonic spectrum only marginally. To foster further development, we provide our parallelized source code.</description>

      <title>High-background X-ray single particle imaging enabled by holographic enhancement with 2D crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray single particle imaging (SPI) has offered the potential to visualize structures of biomolecules at near-atomic resolution. However, state-of-the-art structures at X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) are limited to moderate resolution, primarily due to background scattering. We computationally explore a modified SPI technique based on holographic enhancement from a strongly scattering 2D crystal lattice placed near the object. The Bragg peaks from the crystal enable structure retrieval even for background levels up to 10$^{5}$ times higher than the object signal. This method could enable SPI at more widely accessible synchrotron sources, where even detection of objects before radiation damage is nearly impossible currently, supports practical fixed-target sample delivery, and enables high-resolution imaging under near-native conditions. Numerical simulations with a custom reconstruction algorithm to recover the latent parameters show the potential to improve the achievable resolution while also expanding the accessibility to the technique.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Integration of CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots with Plasmonic Ring Microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite quantum dots hold great promise for quantum information processing as wavelength-tunable single photon sources operable over a broad temperature range. However, their deterministic integration into nanophotonic structures remains a major challenge, limited by their random spatial distribution and non-directional emission. In this work, we employ a two-step electron beam lithography process to deterministically place CsPbBr3 quantum dots within the mode volume of plasmonic ring microcavities. Simulations predict strong field enhancement within the cavity, boosting photon emission rates via the Purcell effect and improving the quantum efficiency of the emitters. Experimentally, coupling ensembles of CsPbBr3 quantum dots to the cavities results in a four-fold enhancement in photoluminescence intensity and a three-fold reduction in fluorescence lifetime at room temperature. Single-emitter coupling is further investigated at cryogenic temperatures, leading to a two-fold reduction in radiative lifetime. These results demonstrate a scalable approach for the integration of perovskite quantum dots into nanophotonic cavities and quantum photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared integrated resonators on a III-V platform with Q-factors beyond half a million</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate mid-IR integrated race-track resonators on a III-V semiconductor platform,InGaAs core epitaxially grown on InP. We have performed a complete characterization of the optical propagation losses at wavelength = 4.6 um and wavelength = 8.5 um, two representative wavelengths for the 1st and 2nd atmospheric transparency windows. We measured losses of 1 dB/cm (TE polarization) and 1.3 dB/cm (TM polarization) at 8.5 um. Substantially lower losses, 0.28 dB/cm, were measured at wavelength = 4.6 um (TM polarization). We then implemented racetrack resonators with straight evanescent couplers. We obtained loaded quality factors larger than 600.000 at wavelength = 4.6 um. These results are promising towards the development of non-linear mid-IR integrated devices with Q factors beyond a million, where the onset of stimulated parametric processes could be reachable.</description>

      <title>Tunable edge and depth sensing via phase-change nonlocal metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performing simultaneous depth-of-field (DoF) extension and edge enhancement within a single optical element remains a fundamental challenge in advanced imaging. Here, we propose a wavelength-tunable nonlocal Huygens' metasurface capable of simultaneously extracting depth and edge features of images in a single-shot exposure. Using the selective polarization response of the Huygens' metasurfaces, the circularly polarized converted component undergoes geometric phase modulation for wavefront shaping to extend the DoF, while the non-converted component acts as a spatial frequency filter to enhance edge contrast. The integration of a phase-change material, Sb$_{2}$S$_{3}$, enables continuous tuning of the resonance wavelength across a range of 100 nm by modulating its refractive index, granting the system excellent broadband spectral adaptability. This work offers a novel and compact solution for real-time depth sensing and feature extraction in applications such as autonomous navigation and biomedical imaging.</description>

      <title>Citation Issues in Wave Mechanics Theory of Microwave Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wave mechanics theory of microwave absorption challenges the long-standing impedance-matching and quarter-wavelength paradigms by demonstrating that conventional models mistakenly conflate bulk material parameters with thin-film phenomena. Drawing on a corpus of 35 peer-reviewed papers and preprints, the study performs a citation-pattern analysis and a logical audit of established theory. Results reveal a striking asymmetry in scholarly engagement, only a handful of supportive or neutral citations appear amid widespread silence, alongside critical logical flaws in impedance matching, notably its inconsistent treatment of penetration, reflection, and absorption from film. By re-framing absorption as a wave-mechanics process governed by interference at parallel interfaces, the wave mechanics framework restores energy-conservation consistency and provides experimentally verified design rules for film thickness, phase response, and broadband performance. The paper further situates the citation neglect within broader issues of peer-review bias and paradigm inertia, illustrating how cargo-cult scientific practices can impede theoretical progress. Recommendations are offered for researchers, editors, and institutions to foster open discourse, rigorously test competing models, and update curricula and design tools accordingly.</description>

      <title>Experimental plasmonic sensing of malaria using an aluminum metasurface</title>

Abstract: A wide range of methods currently exist for testing the presence of malaria, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. New technologies are urgently needed to develop more effective diagnosis tools to fight and eradicate malaria. Optical biosensors that employ surface plasmon resonance (SPR) techniques are a promising category of devices for detecting malaria biomarkers. One such biomarker is plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), a protein produced during the life cycle of the malaria parasite, which is a metabolic enzyme found in all plasmodium species, including the most widespread falciparum. This work reports on the design, probing, and experimental performance of an optical biosensor for detecting pLDH based on SPR and extraordinary optical transmission. The biosensor is composed of an aluminum metasurface made from an array of nanoholes. The sensor operates in the visible spectral region and achieves label-free sensing of plasmodium falciparum LDH (pfLDH) spiked in phosphate-buffered saline. The sensor has a spectral sensitivity of 360 nm/RIU and an LOD of 1.3 nM, equivalent to 45.6 ng/mL of pfLDH. This type of optical biosensor may offer a cost-effective and high sensitivity method for active infection diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Radiative Heat Transfer and 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative heat transfer is of great interest from a fundamental point of view and for energy harvesting applications. This is a material dependent phenomenon where confined plasmonic excitations, hyperbolicity and other properties can be effective channels for enhancement, especially at the near field regime. Materials with reduced dimensions may offer further benefits of enhancement compared to the bulk systems. Here we study the radiative thermal power in the family of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers in their H- and T-symmetries. For this purpose, the computed from first principles electronic and optical properties are then used in effective models to understand the emerging scaling laws for metals and semiconductors as well as specific materials signatures as control knobs for radiative heat transfer. Our combined approach of analytical modeling with properties from ab initio simulations can be used for other materials families to build a materials database for radiative heat transfer.</description>

      <title>Counter-propagating Entangled Photon Pairs from a Monolayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-phase-matched spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in atomically thin materials provides new degrees of freedom and enhanced quantum information capacity compared to conventional phase-matched sources. These systems emerged as promising platforms for quantum computing, communication, and imaging, with the potential to support higher-order nonlinear processes. However, direct observation of photon-pair emission from a monolayer has remained experimentally challenging. In this work, we theoretically modeled SPDC emission across the full angular space from a monolayer GaSe film and experimentally validated the model through measurements of both co- and counter-propagating photon pairs. We demonstrated two-photon quantum correlations in the telecom C-band from the thinnest SPDC source reported to date. The spatially symmetric, broadband emission predicted by theory was confirmed experimentally. Furthermore, we observed high-fidelity Bell states in the counter-propagating configuration, marking the first realization of polarization-entangled photon pairs from a monolayer. Our results revealed the emission characteristics of SPDC in the deeply subwavelength, non-phase-matched regime, and introduced atomically thin, counterpropagating SPDC as a scalable and integrable platform for programmable quantum state generation, extendable via moir\'e superlattice engineering.</description>

      <title>Quantized Thouless Pumping of Dark Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinearity enables the emergence of localized waves such as solitons that maintain their shapes during propagation. Solitons are broadly classified into bright and dark solitons. While a bright soliton exhibits a density peak, a dark soliton presents as a defect on a continuous wave background. A distinctive feature of dark solitons is the abrupt phase change in their wave function, which can host Majorana zero modes in topological fermionic superfluids. Recent studies have shown that bright solitons can undergo quantized transport through Thouless pumping, where the bright soliton functions as a Wannier function. However, it remains unclear whether Thouless pumping can also occur for dark solitons, which fundamentally differ from bright solitons. Here, we theoretically demonstrate the occurrence of both integer and fractional Thouless pumping for dark solitons within both a continuous model under optical lattices and a tight-binding model. Specifically, we find that a dark soliton is transported by one or half a unit cell, following the center-of-mass position of a Wannier function, as a system parameter is slowly varied over one cycle. Our work opens new avenues for exploring Thouless pumping for defects with phase changes, such as dark solitons, vortex solitons, ring dark solitons, and vortices.</description>

      <title>Light-Wave Engineering for Selective Polarization of a Single $\mathbf{Q}$ Valley in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The selective control of specific momentum valleys lies at the core of valleytronics, a field that has thus far focused primarily on the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K'}$ valleys in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, direct optical access to other low-lying yet conventionally inaccessible valleys such as the sixfold degenerate $\mathbf{Q}$ valleys has remained an outstanding challenge, fundamentally limiting the exploitation of the full valley degree of freedom for information processing. Here, we theoretically introduce an emergent light-wave valley selection rule that enables deterministic and high fidelity excitation of any single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley in monolayer TMDs. By coherently combining a circularly polarized pump pulse with a linearly polarized driver pulse, we engineer distinct quantum pathways that unambiguously excited electrons into a targeted $\mathbf{Q}$ valley, completely decoupled from the conventional $\mathbf{K}/\mathbf{K'}$ valleys. This all-optical scheme achieves near-unity ($\sim$100\%) valley polarization across an exceptionally broad ultrafast window, from the terahertz ($10^{12}$~Hz) to petahertz ($10^{15}$~Hz) regimes, enabling single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley polarization on femtosecond timescales. Our findings establish a new paradigm of light-wave quantum metrology in valleytronics, unlocking the $\mathbf{Q}$-valley subspace for scalable multi-state valley information processing.</description>

      <title>Ionization rate vs. laser intensity determined from ion count vs. peak intensity due to neutral gas exposure to an 800 nm ultrashort pulsed laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical cycle-averaged ionization rate of Ar, O$_{2}$, and N$_{2}$ vs. local instantaneous laser intensity $I$ for linear polarized $800$ nm light is determined up to approx. $300$ TW/cm$^{2}$ by numerically inverting published time-of-flight ion spectrometer data. The published Ar$^{+}$ collection efficiency of the microchannel plate (MCP) at the end of the spectrometer and its $I_{0}$ scale are recalibrated by fitting it to its high $I_{0}$ solution. The relative collection efficiencies of the other species are determined by published MCP cathode data. Results for O$_2$ are consistent with a reevaluation of published data used to determine its cross section $\sigma_8$ in the multiphoton (low $I$) regime.</description>

      <title>Observation of Metal-Insulator and Spectral Phase Transitions in Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian extensions of the Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model reveal a rich variety of phase transitions arising from the interplay of quasiperiodicity and non-Hermiticity. Despite their theoretical significance, experimental explorations remain challenging due to complexities in realizing controlled non-Hermiticity. Here, we present the first experimental realization of the unitary almost-Mathieu operator (UAMO) which simulates the AAH model by employing single-photon quantum walks. Through precise control of quasiperiodicity, we systematically explore the phase diagram displaying a phase transition between localized and delocalized regimes in the Hermitian limit. Subsequently, by introducing non-reciprocal hopping, we experimentally probe the parity-time (PT) symmetry-breaking transition that is characterized by the emergence of complex quasienergies. Moreover, we identify a novel spectral transition exclusive to discrete-time settings, where all quasienergies become purely imaginary. Both transitions are connected to changes in the spectral winding number, demonstrating their topological origins. These results clarify the interplay between localization, symmetry breaking, and topology in non-Hermitian quasicrystals, paving the way for future exploration of synthetic quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Ghost projection via focal-field diffraction catastrophes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ghost projection is the reversed process of computational classical ghost imaging that allows any desired image to be synthesized using a linear combination of illuminating patterns. Typically, physical attenuating masks are used to produce these illuminating patterns. A mask-free alternative form of ghost projection is explored here, where the illuminations are a set of caustic-laden diffraction patterns known as diffraction catastrophes. These are generated by focusing a coherent beam with spatially modulated phase having random Zernike-polynomial aberrations. We demonstrate, via simulation, that a suitable linear combination of such random focal-field intensity patterns can be used as a basis to synthesize arbitrary images. In our proof-of-concept ghost-projection synthesis, the positive weighting coefficients in the decomposition are proportional to exposure times for each focal-field diffraction catastrophe. Potential applications include dynamic on-demand beam shaping of focused fields, aberration correction and lithography.</description>

      <title>Time-reversed Young's experiment: Deterministic, diffractionless second-order interference effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classic Young's double-slit experiment exhibits first-order interference, producing alternating bright and dark fringes modulated by the diffraction effect of the slits. In contrast, here we demonstrate that its time-reversed configuration produces an ideal, deterministic second-order 'ghost' interference pattern devoid of diffraction and first-order effect, with the size dependent on the dimensions of the `effectively extended light source.' Furthermore, the new system enables a range of effects and phenomena not available in traditional double-slit interference studies, including the formation of programmed and digitized interference fringes and the coincidence of the pattern plane and the source plane. Despite the absence of first-order interference, our proposed experiment does not rely on nonclassical correlations or quantum entanglement. The elimination of diffraction through time-reversal symmetry holds promise for advancing superresolution optical imaging and sensing techniques beyond existing capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We designed an automatic differentiation-based strategy to generate optical trap arrays that change smoothly in time. Instead of repeatedly regenerating the holograms for each time step, we derive the differential form of the phase dynamics that enables the continuous evolution of the trap coordinates. This differential form is derived from the implicit differentiation of the fixed point of the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm, which is computationally efficient. We carried out numerical and laboratory experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the phase continuity and reducing the computational burden compared to the traditional pure interpolation techniques. By combining the method with the spatial light modulator, the method is promising for the dynamic manipulation of particles in real experiments.</description>

      <title>Windowing in terahertz time-domain spectroscopy: resolving resonances in thin-film samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) has become a powerful tool for investigating the optical properties of thin films, offering direct access to the complex permittivity in the terahertz range. However, in transmission-based measurements of thin films on thick substrates, multiple reflections and limited time windows can introduce artifacts that obscure resonant features such as phonon modes. Time-domain windowing remains one of the most widely adopted strategies to mitigate these effects, yet systematic guidelines on its application remain scarce. In this work, we organize a practical routine for extracting the complex permittivity from THz-TDS data, focusing on when and how to apply time-domain windowing. The routine incorporates decision points for truncation versus smooth apodization, and emphasizes tailoring the window length and shape to specific signal conditions. We demonstrate the approach using representative measurements on PbTe thin films, highlighting cases in which truncation suffices, where apodization is essential, and how different window functions and lengths influence the resulting spectra. We also propose simple metrics to assess signal continuity and guide window selection. Although other analysis techniques exist, including parametric spectral estimation, this study focuses on formalizing windowing-based processing into an accessible experimental workflow. Our results show that the choice of window parameters can significantly affect the accuracy of extracted material parameters, particularly for sharply resonant systems. This work provides an accessible framework for improving spectral fidelity in THz-TDS of thin-film samples.</description>

      <title>Overprinting with Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13842v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing (TVAM) is a light-based 3D printing technique capable of producing centimeter-scale objects within seconds. A key challenge lies in the calculation of projection patterns under non-standard conditions, such as the presence of occlusions and materials with diverse optical properties, including varying refractive indices or scattering surfaces. This work focuses on demonstrating a wide variety of overprinting scenarios. First, utilizing a telecentric laser-based TVAM (LaserTVAM), we demonstrate the printing of a microfluidic perfusion system with biocompatible resins on existing nozzles for potential biomedical applications. In a subsequent demonstration, embedded spheres within the bio-resins are localized inside this perfusion system, optimized into specific patterns, and successfully connected to the nozzles via printed channels in less than three minutes. As a final LaserTVAM example, we print gears on a glossy metal rod, taking into account the scattered rays from the rod's surface. Using a non-telecentric LED-based TVAM (LEDTVAM), we then overprint engravings onto an existing LED placed in the resin. With an additional printed lens on this LED, we can project those engravings onto a screen. In a similar application with the same setup, we print microlenses on a glass tube filled with water, allowing us to image samples embedded within the glass tubes. Based on a differentiable physically-based ray optical approach, we are able to optimize all these scenarios within our existing open-source framework called Dr.TVAM. This framework enables the optimization of high-quality projections for both LaserTVAM and LEDTVAM setups within minutes, as well as lower-quality projections within seconds, outperforming existing solutions in terms of speed, flexibility, and quality.</description>

      <title>Algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect and generalized Fermi surface formula in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, characterized by a proliferation of exponentially localized edge modes in open-boundary systems, has led to the discovery of numerous novel physical phenomena that challenge the limits of conventional band theory. In sharp contrast to this familiar exponential localization, we report a distinct phenomenon--the algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect--which arises generically in non-Hermitian systems with two or more spatial dimensions. In such cases, the amplitude of skin modes typically decays from the boundary following a power law, rather than an exponential form--a behavior not captured by existing theoretical frameworks. To bridge this gap and describe the transition in localization from one to higher dimensions, we develop a generalized Fermi surface framework applicable to open-boundary systems in arbitrary dimensions. This framework not only reproduces known results for the exponential skin effect in 1D, but also predicts a new class of skin effects with algebraic decay in 2D and above. We demonstrate this framework in both tight-binding and continuum models in two and three dimensions. This investigation not only unveils a novel category of the non-Hermitian skin effect but also offers a comprehensive theoretical structure that describes skin effects in any non-Hermitian system, irrespective of its spatial dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Trapping of Single Atoms in Metasurface Optical Tweezer Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have emerged as a key experimental platform for quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology, enabling unprecedented levels of control over single atoms and molecules. However, existing tweezer platforms have fundamental limitations in array geometry, size, and scalability. Here we demonstrate the trapping of single strontium atoms in optical tweezer arrays generated via holographic metasurfaces. We realize two dimensional arrays with more than 1000 trapped atoms, arranged in arbitrary geometries with trap spacings as small as 1.5 um. The arrays have a high uniformity in terms of trap depth, trap frequency, and positional accuracy, rivaling or surpassing existing approaches. This is enabled by highly efficient holographic metasurfaces fabricated from high-refractive index materials, silicon-rich silicon nitride and titanium dioxide. Leveraging sub-micrometer pixel sizes and high pixel densities, our platform allows scaling far beyond current capabilities. As a demonstration, we realize an optical tweezer array with 360,000 traps. These advances will facilitate tweezer-array based quantum applications that require large system sizes.</description>

      <title>Microwave-to-Optical Quantum Transduction with Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. Regarding the transduction mediated by magnons, previous studies have so far utilized ferromagnetic magnons in ferromagnets. Here, we formulate a theory for the microwave-to-optical quantum transduction mediated by antiferromagnetic magnons in antiferromagnets. We derive analytical expressions for the transduction efficiency in the cases with and without an optical cavity, where a microwave cavity is used in both cases. In contrast to the case of the quantum transduction using ferromagnets, we find that the quantum transduction can occur even in the absence of an external static magnetic field. We also find that, in the case with an optical cavity the transduction efficiency takes a peak structure with respect to the sample thickness, indicating that there exists an optimal thickness, whereas in the case without an optical cavity the transduction efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of the sample thickness. Our study opens up a way for possible applications of antiferromagnetic materials in future quantum interconnects.</description>

      <title>Optical signatures of Euler superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study optical manifestations of multigap band topology in multiband superconductors with a nontrivial topological Euler class. We introduce a set of lattice models for non-Abelian superconductors with the Euler invariant signified by a nontrivial quantum geometry. We then demonstrate that the topological Bogoliubov excitations realized in these models provide for a characteristic first-order optical response distinct from those of the other known topological superconductors. We find that the spectral distribution of the optical conductivity universally admits a topological jump originating from the Euler class in the presence of $d$-wave superconducting pairings, and naturally differs from the features induced by the quantum geometry in the noninteracting bands without pairing terms. Further to uncovering observable signatures in first-order optical conductivities, we showcase that the higher-order optical responses of the non-Abelian Euler superconductor can result in enhanced nonlinear currents that fingerprint the exotic topological invariant. Finally, by employing a diagrammatic approach, we generalize our findings beyond the specific models of Euler superconductors.</description>

      <title>Free surface topography of capillary flows using spatiotemporal phase shifting profilometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel experimental technique to characterize the free surface of capillary flows adapted from the Spatio-Temporal Phase Shifting Profilometry (ST-PSP) method introduced by Ri et al. (Journal of Optics, 2019) for solid bodies. The present study is focused on various regimes of capillary flows over inclined surfaces, including drops, rivulets, meanders, and braided films. A calibration process is carried out using a solid wedge to determine the optical distances required for the phase-to-height relationship. The optimal dye concentration necessary for accurately reconstructing the free surface of a dyed water flow is explored. The ST-PSP method is then applied to profile different liquid flows and objects, achieving large signal-to-noise ratios across all experiments. Notably, the analysis of a sessile droplet shows a promising correlation between the ST-PSP results and side-view visualizations, as evidenced by the accurate recovery of its apparent contact angle. Furthermore, free surface reconstructions of rivulet flows exhibit good agreement with the theoretical predictions of Duffy and Moffatt (The Chemical Engineering Journal and the Biochemical Engineering Journal, 1995). These results suggest that the ST-PSP method is highly effective for obtaining accurate height maps of capillary flows and objects, making it a valuable tool for validating theoretical models in the future.</description>

      <title>Optomechanically induced transparency in Four-wave mixing atomic ensemble assisted Laguerre-Gaussian vortex cavity system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the steady-state optical response of a Laguerre-Gaussian vortex cavity system integrated with cold atoms featuring a double-$\Lambda$ energy level structure. Within this hybrid system, the atoms are driven by cavity mode and three coherent vortex beams, each carrying independent orbital angular momentum (OAM). We first check the steady-state output spectrum of the hybrid system in the passive/active case (without/with external cavity driving). Our findings reveal that the optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) spectrum is modulated by the OAM difference $(\Delta \ell\hbar)$ from the atomic component throughout the four-wave mixing (FWM) process. The resulting loop phase ($\Delta \ell\theta$) can achieve a switching effect on the absorption and gain behavior of the hybrid system for the probe beam. Additionally, the group delay, indicative of fast/slow light phenomena, is also tuned by $\Delta \ell$. We further display how the atomic OAM modulates the periodicity of the output spot pattern in the hybrid system. This research provides valuable insights into the modulation of optical responses in Laguerre-Gaussian vortex cavity systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17413v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We confirm the existence of a new bulk medium quasiparticle with transverse orbital angular momentum (tOAM) and elucidate its physical origin. The tOAM structure is driven by torques induced by the ponderomotive force of the light in the medium, originating from the magnetic Lorentz force, even for weak light fields. There are two contributions to the material tOAM: one part depends on the pulse spatial shape change as it passes through an interface, and the other part depends on dispersion. The results, from first principles particle-in-cell simulations of a simple plasma, are in excellent agreement with our theory for general dielectric media [S. W. Hancock et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021)]. For plasma, there is agreement up to near-critical densities and near-relativistic field strengths.</description>

      <title>Cavity-based optical switching via phase modulation in warm rubidium vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical switching remains a key outstanding challenge for scalable fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing due to the trade-off between speed, bandwidth, and loss. Scalable quantum photonics demands all three, to enable high computational clock rates and resource efficient scaling to large systems. We present a cavity-based optical switch that overcomes this limitation, demonstrating 22 ns rise time, insertion loss of 2.4 dB, and 17.5 dB extinction ratio. All-optical control is achieved via phase modulation of a signal field detuned from the near-degenerate two-photon absorption ladder in warm rubidium vapor. The ultimate performance of our switch, combining both speed and efficiency, will find applications in active multiplexing, loop-based quantum memory, and feedforward for quantum error-correction protocols.</description>
