      <title>Entropic force and bouncing behaviour in $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalise the entropic force description of gravity into $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time and derive the $\kappa$-deformed corrections to the Newton's gravitational force. Using this we show the appearance of logarithmic correction as the first order $\kappa$-deformed correction term to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Further we also derive the $\kappa$-deformed Friedmann equations and study the evolution of scale factor in $\kappa$-deformed space-time. Finally we show that the $\kappa$-deformation parameter avoids the initial singularity in early universe by providing a bounce behaviour for the case of spatially flat and closed universe.</description>

      <title>Revisiting black holes surrounded by cloud and fluid of strings in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits black hole solutions surrounded by clouds and fluids of strings within the framework of general relativity. We introduce a generalized equation of state for a fluid of strings with a variable parameter and derive a general solution to Einstein field equations for this system. We allow the parameter $\alpha$ in the equation of state for a fluid of strings ($\rho/p = \alpha$) to vary as a function of the radial coordinate. A particular solution with $M=0$ is explored, focusing on positive ranges of the equation of state parameter in analogy with the reduced Kiselev solution. Furthermore, we present a novel regular black hole solution that reduces to the Schwarzschild solution with a cloud of strings when the radial coordinate is much larger than a control parameter $r_0$. As an additional contribution of this work, we show that the energy-momentum tensor for the fluid of strings can be decomposed into contributions from three components: an isotropic perfect fluid, an electromagnetic field, and a scalar field minimally coupled. The paper examines the connection between the fluid of strings and Kiselev anisotropic fluid, revealing structural similarities through their energy-momentum tensors. The study also highlights how the obtained solutions influence the horizons and thermodynamic properties of black holes. The new solutions allow for the emergence of geometries with multiple horizons and non-trivial temperature behaviors. As an additional test of the general solution, it is shown that particular choices for the function $\alpha(r)$ reproduce well-known results in the literature. Finally, we study geodesic motion of particles, geodesic completeness and shadows in the geometry of the novel regular black hole.</description>

      <title>The robustness of extracting quasinormal mode information from black hole merger simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In linear perturbation theory, the ringdown of a gravitational wave (GW) signal is described by a linear combination of quasinormal modes (QNMs). Detecting QNMs from GW signals is a promising way to test GR, central to the developing field of black-hole spectroscopy. More robust black-hole spectroscopy tests could also consider the ringdown amplitude-phase consistency. That requires an accurate understanding of the excitation and stability of the QNM expansion coefficients. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of the extracted $m=2$ QNM coefficients obtained from a high-accuracy numerical relativity waveform. We explore a framework to assess the robustness of QNM coefficients. Within this framework, we not only consider the traditional criterion related to the constancy of a QNM's expansion coefficients over a window in time, but also emphasize the importance of consistency among fitting models. In addition, we implement an iterative greedy approach within which we fix certain QNM coefficients. We apply this approach to linear fitting, and to nonlinear fitting where the properties of the remnant black hole are treated as unknown variables. We find that the robustness of overtone coefficients is enhanced by our greedy approach, particularly for the $(2,2,2,+)$ overtone. Based on our robustness criteria applied to the $m=2$ signal modes, we find the $(2\!\sim\!4,2,0,+)$ and $(2,2,1\!\sim\!2,+)$ modes are robust, while the $(3,2,1,+)$ subdominant mode is only marginally robust. After we subtract the contributions of the $(2\!\sim\!4,2,0,+)$ and $(2\!\sim\!3,2,1,+)$ QNMs from signal mode $(4,2)$, we also find evidence for the quadratic QNM $(2,1,0,+)\times(2,1,0,+)$.</description>

      <title>Kaluza-Klein Bubble With Massive Scalar Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known soliton (bubble) solution of five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein General Relativity is modified by imposing mass on the scalar field. By forcing the scalar field to be short-range, the failure of the original bubble solution to satisfy the equivalence principle is remedied, and the bubble acquires gravitational mass.Most importantly, the mass is quantized, even in this classical setting, and has a value $m_P / (4 \sqrt{\alpha})$, where $m_P$ is the Planck mass,and $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant. This result applies for any choice of scalar-field mass, as it is an attractor for the field equations.</description>

      <title>Hamilton-Jacobi method in reheating predictions for non-minimal coupling inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi method offers a natural and concise framework for describing inflation, with implications that extend to the reheating phase. Additionally, reheating plays a crucial role in constraining the observationally viable parameter space of inflationary models. In this study, we employ the Hamilton-Jacobi approach to investigate reheating predictions within non-minimally coupled inflation models, comparing the metric and Palatini formulations. Our results show that the coupling effect suppresses the tensor-to-scalar ratio, aligning predictions with the Planck CMB and BICEP/Keck data in both formulations. Additionally, reheating predictions in the Palatini formulation are more sensitive to coupling strength variations, leading to a stronger suppression of the tensor-to-scalar ratio. This highlights a key difference in reheating dynamics between the metric and Palatini formulations.</description>

      <title>Study of light deflection and shadow from a hairy black hole under the influence of the non-magnetic plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article computes the bending angle of a hairy black hole at weak field limits. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem is applied to the Gaussian optical curvature; this gives a way to calculate the hairy black hole light bending angle using the Gibbons and Werner approach. We determine the light's deflection angle under the influence of gravitational decoupling parameters, non-magnetic plasma, and dark matter. Further, using the ray tracing phenomenon, we determine the shadow at which light is deflected when a non-magnetic plasma medium is present. There must exist unstable circular light orbits that can act as limit curves for light rays in a spiral motion. In this manner, the shadow can be calculated for an observer at any distance from the center, and the energy emission rate for the hairy black hole can be studied.</description>

      <title>Accretion with Back-Reaction onto Cylindrically Symmetric Black Hole with Energy Conditions Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to study back-reaction effects from matter accretion onto a cylindrically symmetric black hole using a perturbative scheme, focusing on cases where accretion reaches a quasi-steady state. We examine three distinct models by deriving corrections to the metric coefficients and obtaining expressions for the mass function. We analyze energy conditions, the self-consistency of the corrected solution and present formulas for the corrected apparent horizon and discussed thermodynamic properties. Our results align with the Vaidya form near the apparent horizon, regardless of the energy-momentum tensor's form. Furthermore, we show that for a charged cylindrically symmetric black hole, the corrected mass term resembles that of the static case, indicating that charge does not alter the corrected metric form in this perturbative approach.</description>

      <title>Optical appearance of a boson star with soliton potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct an in-depth investigation into the optical images of boson stars with the solitonic potential. In the context of a celestial source and a thin accretion disk, the optical characteristics of the soliton boson star have been derived. Considering the influence of the initial scalar field $\psi_0$ and a larger coupling parameter $\alpha$ (the weak coupling case), the optical images of boson stars primarily exhibit direct and lensed images. The results demonstrate that variations in $\psi_0$ and $\alpha$ influence the image size, whereas the observer's inclination angle $\theta$ has a substantial impact on the image shape. In contrast, when the coupling parameter $\alpha$ is small (the strong coupling case), a sub-annular structure emerges within the Einstein ring for a spherically symmetric light source. In the presence of a thin accretion disk, higher-order gravitational lensing images emerge, indicating that photons are capable of orbiting the equatorial plane of the boson star multiple times. We also analyze how the effective potential and redshift factor depend on the parameters $\psi_0$, $\alpha$, and $\theta$. The results indicate that at smaller values of $\theta$, gravitational redshift is the dominant effect, resulting in an optical image featuring a bright ring surrounding a comparatively dim central region. At larger values of $\theta$, the Doppler effect becomes more pronounced, resulting in a substantial brightness disparity between the left and right sides of the optical image. These findings offer robust theoretical underpinnings for differentiating solitonic boson stars from black holes via high-resolution astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Primordial gravitational waves: Model effects on time evolution and spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the detection of gravitational waves (GW) in recent years, many papers that use simulated GW datasets to constrain dark energy models have been published. However, these works generally consider GW generated by massive astrophysical objects, such as mergers of black holes or neutron stars. In this paper, we analyse the evolution and spectrum of GW generated in the inflationary epoch, assuming a standard slow-roll single-field inflationary scenario. Three models for the background are considered: a field theory model of interacting dark energy - the Interacting Holographic Tachyonic Model, the Holographic Dark Energy Model, and the {\Lambda}CDM. The results show significant dependence on the cosmological model, especially for the spectrum, and in particular show that an interaction between dark energy and dark matter can leave a significant imprint. Therefore, future primordial gravitational waves (PGW) datasets could be very useful for constraining dark energy models, including to probe an interaction in the dark sector of the universe.</description>

      <title>Singularity resolution and regular black hole formation in gravitational collapse in asymptotically safe gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adopt an effective action inspired by asymptotically safe gravity, in which the effective gravitational constant is parameterized as $G(\epsilon) = G_{N} [1 + \tilde{\omega} (G_{N}^{2} \epsilon)^{\alpha}]^{-1}$, where $G_{N}$ and $\epsilon$ denote Newton's gravitational constant and the energy density of the matter field, respectively, with two dimensionless model parameters, $\tilde{\omega}$ and $\alpha$. Within this framework, we investigate the complete gravitational collapse of a homogeneous ball of perfect fluid and find that the singularity is completely resolved for $\alpha &gt; 1$ but not for $1/2 \le \alpha \le 1$. The case $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1/2$ is inconsistent with asymptotic safety. Moreover, we note that although the singularity cannot be fully resolved for $\alpha = 1$, it is significantly weakened by quantum gravity effects. Furthermore, we successfully construct a static exterior metric which, together with the interior solution, describes the dynamical formation of regular black holes in an asymptotically flat spacetime for the perfectly resolved case $\alpha &gt; 1$. The resulting regular black hole, obtained as the final static state, contains a de Sitter core and admits a static metric fully expressible in terms of the Lerch transcendent for general cases and in elementary functions for certain values of $\alpha$, including \alpha = 2$. We also discuss the formation of gravastars and the late-time evaporation process of the regular black holes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of Einstein-Cartan gravity we consider an action, containing up to quadratic terms of the Ricci scalar and the Holst invariant, coupled non-minimal to a scalar field, including couplings of its derivatives to curvature. We derive the equivalent metric theory, featuring an extra dynamical pseudoscalar degree of freedom associated with the presence of the Holst term in the action. We study the evolution of the resulting two-field system in a FRW background and show that it evolves rapidly into an effective single-field inflationary model. We find that the model is consistent with the latest observational data for a wide range of its parameters, determining the necessary upper limits on derivative coupling parameters.</description>

      <title>A Multipole-Based Framework for Kerr Black Hole Mimickers: From General Construction to a Specific Case of Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for constructing solutions to the Einstein equations with an arbitrary multipolar structure, providing a systematic method to identify physically reasonable energy-momentum tensors that source black hole mimickers. As an example, we investigate an anisotropic fluid with a gaussian-like energy-density profile that, at linearized level, satisfies all energy and causality conditions while producing a gravitational field with the exact same multipolar structure as Kerr black holes. In the spinless case, we obtain a fully non-perturbative solution that, depending on the parameter choices, describes either a horizonless Schwarzschild mimicker or a static regular black hole model with a resolved curvature singularity.</description>

      <title>Gray-body factors: Method matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculation of gray-body factors is essential for understanding Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics. While the formalism developed by Chandrasekhar is effective for static black holes, it faces significant challenges in Kerr spacetimes, particularly in the superradiant regime, where a specific choice of coordinates introduces numerical inaccuracies. To address these limitations, an alternative method based on re-scaling radial coordinates and employing Frobenius-like expansions has been investigated. We compare the gray-body factors obtained for a near-maximally rotating black hole using both methods and find that the Chandrasekhar formalism systematically overestimates the values in the superradiant regime compared to well-established analytical results. Specifically, for a spin parameter of $a_* = 0.999$, the Chandrasekhar method yields values approximately twice as large as the correct result. Since this approach has been implemented in \texttt{BlackHawk}, we assess the impact of these discrepancies on constraints derived from gamma-ray observations of highly spinning primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Global monopole in a Ricci-coupled Kalb-Ramond bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate black hole solutions in Einstein-Kalb-Ramond (EKR) bumblebee gravity sourced by a global monopole characterized by the charge $\eta$. This modified theory of gravity possesses the notable feature of incorporating local Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) via a spontaneous symmetry-breaking mechanism. We solve the field equations for a static and spherically symmetric metric with the Kalb-Ramond (KR) field fixed at its VEV, thereby obtaining new black hole solutions. These solutions simultaneously exhibit the LSB effects, codified by the $\gamma$ parameter, and the global monopole effects, codified by the charge $\eta$. Next, we study the impact of the global monopole and LSB corrections on two classical tests, namely, the advance of Mercury's perihelion and the light deflection. Furthermore, we compute the Hawking temperature, black hole shadows, and greybody factors. Ultimately, we estimate an upper bound for $\eta$ by comparing the theoretical results provided by the EKR model with observational data from the advance of Mercury's perihelion and light deflection.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of physical properties of Kiselev like AdS spacetime in the context of $f(R,~T)$ gravity under the impact of quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The developments of the $f(R,~T)$ gravity theory, which is a logical expansion of general relativity according to Einstein, inspire us to examine this theory in greater detail and take up our study to obtain a modification of the Kiselev-like AdS black holes scenario. In this study, we employ the semi-classical Hamilton-Jacobi procedure to investigate the Hawking temperature $(T_{H})$ for 4-dimensional Kiselev-like AdS BHs in the context of $f(R,~T)$ gravity. We derive the temperature using a standard formula for Kiselev-like AdS BHs in the context of $f(R,~T)$ gravity. The relativistic field equation in the context of the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP), the semi-classical Hamilton-Jacobi procedure, and the WKB strategy are used to tunnel boson particles into the horizon under the effect of quantum gravity as well as Hawking temperature and also use this temperature to compute entropy corrections. Further, we study the $f(R,~T)$ gravity ($\zeta$), quantum gravity ($\alpha$), and particle kinetic energy ($\Xi$) effect on both temperature and entropy.</description>

      <title>Accounting for the Known Unkown: A Parametric Framework to Incorporate Systematic Waveform Errors in Gravitational-Wave Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Parameter Estimation (PE) for Gravitational Waves (GW) merger events relies on a waveform model calibrated using numerical simulations. Within the Bayesian framework, this waveform model represents the GW signal produced during the merger and is crucial for estimating the likelihood function. However, these waveform models may possess systematic errors that can differ across the parameter space. Addressing these errors in the current data analysis pipeline is an active area of research. This work presents a framework for accounting for uncertainties in waveform modeling. We introduce two parametrizations, relative and absolute errors in the phase of the waveform, to modify the base waveform model, which can account for uncertainties. When the waveform errors are known, those error budgets can be used as a prior distribution in the Bayesian framework. We also show that conservative priors can be used to quantify uncertainties in waveform modeling without any knowledge of waveform error budgets. By conducting zero-noise injections and recoveries, we demonstrate through PE results that even 1-2% of errors in relative phase to the actual waveform model can introduce biases in the recovered parameters. These biases can be corrected when we account for waveform uncertainties within the PE framework. By injecting a series of precessing waveform models and using the nonspinning model for recovery, we show that our method can account for the missing physics by making the posterior samples broad enough to account for bias. We also present a Python package that is easily integrated with the publicly available GW analysis tool PyCBC and can be used to do PE with the parametrization presented in this paper.</description>

      <title>Measuring anisotropies in the PTA band with cross-correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The astrophysical gravitational wave background in the nanohertz (nHz) band is expected to be primarily composed of the superposition of signals from binaries of supermassive black holes. The spatial discreteness of these sources introduces shot noise, which, in certain regimes, would overwhelm efforts to measure the anisotropy of the gravitational wave background. In this work, we explicitly demonstrate, starting from first principles, that cross-correlating a gravitational wave background map with a sufficiently dense galaxy survey can mitigate this issue. This approach could potentially reveal underlying properties of the gravitational wave background that would otherwise remain obscured. We quantify the shot noise level and show that cross-correlating the gravitational wave background with a galaxy catalog improves by more than two orders of magnitude the prospects for a first detection of the background anisotropy by a gravitational wave observatory operating in the nHz frequency range, provided it has sufficient sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Mapping Parameter Correlations in Spinning Binary Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spins of black holes in binaries measured with gravitational waves provide insights about the formation, evolution, and dynamics of these systems. The imprint of spin in the inspiral, where the black holes are well-separated, is understood through analytic equations for the binary dynamics. During the merger phase, the binary dynamics can only be studied with numerical relativity simulations. Though such simulations provide an exact solution (to within numerical error), the imprint of the full six spin degrees of freedom on the signal is not transparent. In the absence of analytic expressions for the merger, here we propose a waveform-based approach. Leveraging a neural network to efficiently calculate mismatches between waveforms, we identify regions in the parameter space of spins and mass ratio that result in low mismatches and thus similar waveforms. We map these regions with a Gaussian fit, thus identifying correlations between the mass ratio and spins and quantifying their strength. For low-mass, inspiral-dominated systems, we recover the known physical imprint: larger aligned spins are correlated with more equal masses as they have opposite effects on the inspiral length. For high-mass, merger-dominated signals, a qualitatively similar correlation is present, though its shape is altered and strength decreases with increasing total mass. Correlations between in-plane spins and mass ratio follow a similar trend, with their shape and strength altered as the mass increases. Waveform-based correlation mapping can motivate effective spin parameters and reveal the imprint of spins on signals for which no simple analytic descriptions exist.</description>

      <title>Mind the gap: addressing data gaps and assessing noise mismodeling in LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the sheer complexity of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) space mission, data gaps arising from instrumental irregularities and/or scheduled maintenance are unavoidable. Focusing on merger-dominated massive black hole binary signals, we test the appropriateness of the Whittle-likelihood on gapped data in a variety of cases. From first principles, we derive the likelihood valid for gapped data in both the time and frequency domains. Cheap-to-evaluate proxies to p-p plots are derived based on a Fisher-based formalism, and verified through Bayesian techniques. Our tools allow to predict the altered variance in the parameter estimates that arises from noise mismodeling, as well as the information loss represented by the broadening of the posteriors. The result of noise mismodeling with gaps is sensitive to the characteristics of the noise model, with strong low-frequency (red) noise and strong high-frequency (blue) noise giving statistically significant fluctuations in recovered parameters. We demonstrate that the introduction of a tapering window reduces statistical inconsistency errors, at the cost of less precise parameter estimates. We also show that the assumption of independence between inter-gap segments appears to be a fair approximation even if the data set is inherently coherent. However, if one instead assumes fictitious correlations in the data stream, when the data segments are actually independent, then the resultant parameter recoveries could be inconsistent with the true parameters. The theoretical and numerical practices that are presented in this work could readily be incorporated into global-fit pipelines operating on gapped data.</description>

Abstract: The normalization of the quantum corrected action is resolving the equation divergent dependence of the cutoff towards the system apparent result in quantum gravity. Here we consider the normalization to Einstein R twice scalar action with the cutoff runs from apparent infrared momentu to the ultraviolet momentum. These gravitational actions, Einstein R twice and Einstein R twice with the scalar theory, are come to the ensured apparent system recommendations in classical quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Physics motivated models of pulsar X-ray hotspots: off-center dipole configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was proposed that an off-center dipole magnetic configuration, together with a non-trivial temperature profile, may be the best model to explain the X-ray light curve of PSR J0030+0451 observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (\emph{NICER}). Using a theoretical model for the electric current density in a force-free pulsar magnetosphere, we compute from first principles the distribution of electric current over the polar cap associated with an off-center magnetic dipole. We then use a simple prescription to compute the resulting temperature distribution, which allows us to derive the observed X-ray light curve. We investigate the role of the volumetric return current region in the polar cap and find that although it does not make a big difference in an aligned dipole case, the difference can be bigger in the case of an off-center dipole. Finally, we apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting to the X-ray light curves of pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0437--4715 with and without the volumetric return current, and find that our model can reasonably recover the observed X-ray light curves.</description>

      <title>Modeling the shadow of Sgr A* through an eclipsing black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sgr A* resolved the photon ring at the galactic centre, revealing a diameter of $51.8~\mu \text{as}$. The ring-like structure is consistent with that of a Kerr black hole. However, the source of the high bright regions in the image and the time variability remain an open question. Besides the plasma properties and emission models, the spacetime geometry also holds an important role. We present an image depicting the bright hot spots consistent with Sgr A* observations at a wavelength $ \lambda $ = 1.3mm. The image is the result of an eclipsing Schwarzschild black hole situated along the line of sight between the galactic centre and Earth. The separation from both, primary (Sgr A*) and secondary (eclipsing) black holes is $10233\, {\rm AU}$. The central supermassive black hole located at the centre of the galaxy has an observational mass of $4.14\times10^6\,M_{\odot}$ and the secondary eclipsing black hole has an inferred mass of $1035\,M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on Dark Energy Models with $\Lambda$ as an Equilibrium Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a dynamical reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state parameter by assuming that it satisfies a law of motion described by an autonomous second-order differential equation, with the limit of the cosmological constant as an equilibrium point. We determine the asymptotic solutions of this equation and use them to construct two families of parametric dark energy models, employing both linear and logarithmic parametrizations with respect to the scale factor. We perform observational constraints by using the Supernova, the Cosmic Chronometers and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations. The constraint parameters are directly related with the initial value problem for the law of motion and its algebraic properties. The analysis shows that most of the models fit the observational data well with a preference to the models of the logarithmic parametrization. Furthermore, we introduce a new class of models as generalizations of the CPL model, for which the equilibrium point is a constant value rather than the cosmological constant. These models fit the data in a similar or better way to the CPL and the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Influence of dark matter on the structure of strange quark stars in one-fluid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16317v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies the influence of scalar dark matter on the structural properties of strange quark stars (SQS) within a one-fluid framework, considering Yukawa interactions between dark matter and quark matter. Contributions from perturbative QCD, Yukawa interaction between scalar dark matter and quarks, and Bose-Einstein condensation of dark matter are included in the model. We first determine the allowable range of Yukawa interaction coupling by imposing the stability condition for strange quark matter (SQM). Using this range, we derive the equation of state (EOS) for different fractions of dark matter within the total pressure of SQS. These fractions are constrained by the tidal deformability limit from GW170817. The presence of dark matter alters the EOS, leading to changes in the mass-radius relationship, tidal deformability, and stability of SQS. We demonstrate that increasing the mass of dark matter softens the EOS, whereas higher fractions of dark matter lead to stiffer EOSs. We also explore the reasons behind this behavior. Our EOSs not only describe massive objects, such as PSR J0952-0607 and PSR J2215+5135, but also satisfy the tidal deformability constraint from GW170817. These results reveal that incorporating dark matter modifies the EOS, enabling the support of higher stellar masses while maintaining consistency with observational data.</description>

      <title>Existence theorem on the UV limit of Wilsonian RG flows of Feynman measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In nonperturbative formulation of Euclidean signature quantum field theory (QFT), the vacuum state is characterized by the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) flow of Feynman measures. Such an RG flow is a family of Feynman measures on the space of ultraviolet (UV) regularized fields, linked by the Wilsonian renormalization group equation. In this paper we show that under mild conditions, a Wilsonian RG flow of Feynman measures extending to arbitrary regularization strenghts has a factorization property: there exists an ultimate Feynman measure (UV limit) on the distribution sense fields, such that the regularized instances in the flow are obtained from this UV limit via taking the marginal measure against the regulator. Existence theorems about the flow and UV limit of the corresponding action functional are also proved.</description>

      <title>Causal Structure of Higher Curvature Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the causal structure of Generalized Quadratic Gravity (GQG) and Einsteinian Cubic Gravity (ECG). It is well known that gravitons in higher-curvature theories can exhibit superluminal propagation, rendering the conventional definition of causal structures based on null curves inadequate. Instead, the causal structure must be defined using the fastest propagating modes, which travel along characteristic surfaces. The superluminal propagation in higher-curvature theories has significant implications for black holes. Specifically, if the Killing horizon of a black hole is not a characteristic surface corresponding to the fastest propagating mode, the horizon can no longer function as a causal barrier. Our analysis demonstrates that GQG with a genuine fourth-order equation of motion possesses only null characteristics, implying that the horizon is a characteristic surface. Furthermore, we perform a detailed characteristic analysis of ECG. We show that while all null surfaces are characteristic surfaces in ECG, the converse is not true - there exist non-null characteristic surfaces. In particular, we identify a non-null characteristic surface in a Type N spacetime in the algebraic classification of spacetimes. Despite the existence of multiple characteristic surfaces in ECG, we establish that the black hole horizon remains a characteristic surface.</description>

Abstract: We point out a difficulty with a naive application of Virasoro TQFT methods to compute path integrals for two types of off-shell 3-dimensional geometries. Maxfield-Turiaci proposed solving the negativity problem of pure 3d gravity by summing over off-shell geometries known as Seifert manifolds. We attempt to compute Seifert manifolds using Virasoro TQFT. Our results don't match completely with Maxfield-Turiaci. We trace the discrepancies to not including the mapping class group properly. We also compute a 3-boundary torus-wormhole by extrapolating from an on-shell geometry. We encounter challenges similar to those observed in the comparison between the genuine off-shell computation of a torus-wormhole by Cotler-Jensen and the extrapolation from an on-shell configuration.</description>

Abstract: We summarize our recent achievements in the description of neutrino oscillations in various gravitational fields. After the short review of the previous studies of neutrinos in gravitational fields, we consider the neutrinos propagation and oscillations in two gravitational backgrounds. First, we discuss neutrino spin oscillations in their gravitational scattering off a supermassive black hole surrounded by a thick magnetized accretion disk. Second, we study neutrino flavor oscillations in stochastic gravitational waves. We also consider applications of the obtained results for oscillations of astrophysical neutrinos.</description>

Abstract: We study the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surfaces associated with timelike subregions in static spacetimes with a horizon. These RT surfaces can extend into the horizon, allowing us to probe the interior of the black hole. The horizon typically divides the RT surface into two distinct parts. We demonstrate that the area of the RT surface inside the horizon can be reconstructed from the contributions of the RT surfaces outside the horizon, along with additional RT surfaces for spacelike subregions that are causally related to the timelike subregions. This result provides a concrete realization of black hole complementarity, where the information from the black hole interior can be reconstructed from the degrees of freedom outside the horizon.</description>

      <title>Gauge Invariant Effective Potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the long-standing problem of gauge dependence of the effective potential arises due to the factorisation of the determinant of operators, which is invalid when we take the zeta-regularised trace of the operators. We show by correcting for this assumption by computing the multiplicative anomaly, the gauge-dependent terms of the effective potential cancel. We also show that in two- and odd-dimensional non-compact spacetime manifolds where the multiplicative anomaly term is zero, the standard calculation of one-loop effective potential gives a gauge-independent result. These results are in support of our claim that the multiplicative anomaly may play a crucial role in removing the gauge dependence in the effective potential in the four-dimensional non-compact manifold. Noting the non-trivial aspects of this anomaly computation for a generic scenario, we propose the Heat-Kernel method to compute the effective potential where this anomaly emerges as a total derivative, thus redundant. We explicitly show how one can calculate the gauge independent, effective action and the Coleman-Weinberg effective potential by employing the Heat-Kernel method. Based on this result, we advocate the Heat-Kernel expansion as the most straightforward method, as it naturally deals with the matrix elliptic operator for the calculation of manifestly gauge independent, effective actions compared to other conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Late-Time Saturation of Black Hole Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The holographic complexity of a static spherically symmetric black hole, defined as the volume of an extremal surface, grows linearly with time at late times in general relativity. The growth comes from a region at a constant transverse area inside the black hole and continues forever in the classical theory. In this region the volume complexity of any spherically symmetric black hole in $d+1$ spacetime dimensions reduces to a geodesic length in an effective two-dimensional JT-gravity theory. The length in JT-gravity has been argued to saturate at very late times via non-perturbative corrections obtained from a random matrix description of the gravity theory. The same argument, applied to our effective JT-gravity description of the volume complexity, leads to complexity saturation at times of exponential order in the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a $d+1$-dimensional black hole. Along the way, we explore a simple toy model for complexity growth, based on a discretisation of Nielsen complexity geometry, that can be analytically shown to exhibit the expected late-time complexity saturation.</description>

      <title>Back-Reaction of Super-Hubble Fluctuations, Late Time Tracking and Recent Observational Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies suggested that the back-reaction of super-Hubble cosmological fluctuations could lead to a dynamical relaxation of the cosmological constant. Moreover, this mechanism appears to be self-regulatory, potentially leading to an oscillatory behavior in the effective dark energy. Such an effect would occur in any cosmological model with super-Hubble matter fluctuations, including the standard $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ model, without the need for additional mechanisms. The recent DESI data, which supports the possibility of dynamical dark energy, has renewed interest in exploring scenarios leading to such oscillatory behavior. In this work we propose a parametrization to account for the impact of super-Hubble fluctuations on the background energy density of the Universe. We model the total effective cosmological constant as the sum of a constant piece and an oscillating contribution. We perform a preliminary comparison of the background dynamics of this model with the recent radial BAO data from DESI. We also discuss the status of the $H_0$ tension problem in this model. While this analysis serves as a first step in testing the scenario, we emphasize the importance of considering this effect, as it is naturally expected to be present and could offer valuable insights in light of the recent observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04076v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to explore the interplay between neutrinos and quantum gravity, illustrating some proposals about the use of these particles as probes for the supposed quantized structure of spacetime. The residual signatures of a more fundamental theory of quantum gravity can manifest themselves modifying the free particle dispersion relations and the connected velocity. In neutrino sector these supposed effects can modify the time of flight for astrophysical particles with different energies and can affect the usual neutrino oscillation pattern introducing species depending perturbations. We will highlight how perturbations caused by non-standard interactions in the solar neutrino sector can mimic the presumed quantum gravity effects. In fact, the mathematical formulation of non-standard interactions is equivalent to that of CPT-odd perturbations. We will, therefore, emphasize the need to identify the nature of different contributions in order to disentangle them in the search for quantum gravity effects. As a final point we will discuss the possibility to detect in the neutrino sector decoherence effects caused by the quantum gravity supposed perturbations. By reviewing current experimental constraints and observations, we seek to shed light on the intricate relationship between neutrinos and quantum gravity, and discuss the challenges and future directions in this fascinating field of research.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of anti-symmetric tensor effects, which trigger the Lorentz symmetry breaking, on charged spherically symmetric black holes. Initially, we address an overview of the model, laying the groundwork for deriving solutions to black holes. With this, we analyze the horizons, critical orbits, and geodesics. We compute quasinormal modes and the time-domain solution with a particular emphasis on vectorial perturbations. In addition, we derive the Hawking temperature to perform the calculation of the remnant mass. Additionally, we estimate the lifetime of the black holes until they reach their final stage after the evaporation process. Finally, we explore the emission rate, the deflection angle and, we investigate the correlation between quasinormal modes and shadows.</description>

      <title>Accretion of the degenerate Fermi gas onto a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the Rioseco and Sarbach model into Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole accretes degenerate relativistic Fermi gas. The accretion theory is based on the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates and the Fermi gas follows Fermi-Dirac statistics at infinity. The expressions for the particle current density, the stress energy-momentum tensor, and three accretion rates are derived. We first investigated the impact of Risoseco and Sarbach model on the evolution of a black hole's charge. The results show that both the mass accretion rate and charge accretion rate are proportional to the particle accretion rate. We have also provided analytical results at infinity and numerical results within a finite range for these quantities. Our results indicate that the accretion rate decreases as the charge of the black hole increases, suggesting that our accretion model does not violate the cosmic censorship hypothesis. In this paper, we first point out that the accretion of Vlasov gas behaves as an anisotropic fluid containing two perfect-fluid components. One component represents the isotropic fluid of Fermi gas, while the other represents a null fluid. When using the Boyer-Lindquist coordinate system, we observed that the contribution from the null fluid persists even at infinity, which led to the radial pressure always smaller than the tangential pressure. Therefore, it's not appropriate to treat the accretion model as a perfect fluid at infinity.</description>

      <title>Potential impact of noise correlation in next-generation gravitational wave detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon the statistical formulation for parameter estimation (PE) in the presence of correlated noise proposed by Cireddu et al., we present the initial study to incorporate the effects of correlated noise into the analyses of various detector designs' performance. We consider a two-L-shaped-detector configuration in Europe and compare the expectation of PE of gravitational wave (GW) transients between noncollocated and hypothetical collocated configurations. In our study, we posit the existence of low-frequency correlated noise within the 5-10 Hz range for the collocated detector configuration, with a varying correlation. In this specific detector setup, our observations indicate an enhancement in the precision of intrinsic parameter measurements as the correlation increases. This trend suggests that noise correlation may beneficially influence the accuracy of PE. In particular, when the noise is highly correlated, the uncertainty on chirp mass decreases by up to $30\%$. The absence of an inter-European baseline does hinder the estimation of the extrinsic parameters. However, given a realistic global network with the additional detector in the US, the uncertainty of extrinsic parameters is significantly reduced. This reduction is further amplified as the noise correlation increases. When the noise correlation exceeds a certain level, the collocated configuration outperforms the noncollocated configuration. For instance, when the correlation is high, the collocated configuration decreases the $90\%$ credible area of sky location by up to $10\%$ compared to the noncollocated configuration. We conclude that the impact of noise correlation is not trivial and can potentially alter both the quantitative and qualitative outcomes in detector performance. We therefore recommend the inclusion of noise correlation for a comprehensive assessment of the design of third-generation GW detectors.</description>

      <title>The Existence and Distribution of Photon Spheres Near Spherically Symmetric Black Holes -- A Geometric Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14035v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon sphere has attracted significant attention since the capture of black hole shadow images by Event Horizon Telescope. Recently, a number of studies have highlighted that the number of photon spheres and their distributions near black holes are strongly constrained by black hole properties. Specifically, for black holes with event horizons and proper asymptotic behaviors, the number of stable and unstable photon spheres satisfies the relation $n_{\text{stable}} - n_{\text{unstable}} = -1$. In this study, we provide a new proof on this relation using a geometric analysis, which is carried out using intrinsic curvatures in the optical geometry of black hole spacetimes. Firstly, we demonstrate the existence of photon spheres near black holes assuming most general asymptotic behaviors (asymptotically flat black holes, asymptotically de-Sitter and anti-de-Sitter black holes). Subsequently, we prove that the stable and unstable photon spheres near black holes must be one-to-one alternatively separated from each other, such that each unstable photon sphere is sandwiched between two stable photon spheres (and each stable photon sphere is sandwiched between two unstable photon spheres). Our analysis is applicable to any spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: In this comment, we point out a series of errors made by Senjaya in your paper (2024) \cite{Senjaya}. In particular, these errors involved the Dirac equation in the 3+1 dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime, tetrad field, curved gamma matrices, and the time-independent Dirac equation written in terms of the inner/scalar product between the gamma matrices and the orbital angular momentum (i.e., $\vec{\gamma}\cdot\vec{L}$). Besides, the strange/peculiar thing about all this is that even Senjaya \cite{Senjaya} citing Collas and Klein \cite{Collas}, where the (mathematical) formalism is correct, everything indicates that he ``ignored'' or ``forgot'' to use such formalism in your paper. Therefore, using Ref. \cite{Collas}, we show here the correct form of the errors made by Senjaya \cite{Senjaya}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We disclose the thermodynamical properties of the apparent horizon in a nonsingular universe. We take into account the zero-point length correction to the gravitational potential and derive the modified entropy expression that includes zero-point length correction terms. We apply the first law of thermodynamics on the apparent horizon as well as the emergent gravity scenario to derive the modified Friedmann equations. Further, we examine the time evolution of the total entropy, including the entropy of the apparent horizon and the matter field entropy inside the horizon and find out that the generalized second law of thermodynamics is satisfied. We also investigate the cosmological implications of the modified cosmology through zero-point length. We observe that the zero-point length correction does not change the general profile of the universe evolution, however, it shifts the time of the phase transition in a universe filled with matter and cosmological constant. We explore the age of the universe for our model and observe that the predicted age of the universe becomes larger compared to the standard cosmology. By calculating the explicit form of Ricci and Kretchmann invariants, we confirm that in our model, the initial singularity of the universe is removed. This is an expected result, because the main motivation for considering zero-point length correction in the gravitational potential is to remove singularity at the origin.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic topology of Black Holes in $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity's Rainbow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topology of black hole thermodynamics is a fascinating area of study that explores the connections between thermodynamic properties and topological features of black holes. We successfully derive the field equations for $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg theory, providing a framework for studying the interplay between modified gravity and non-linear electromagnetic effects. We obtain an analytical solution for a static, spherically symmetric, energy-dependent black hole with constant scalar curvature. Also, our analysis of black holes in F(R)-Euler-Heisenberg gravity's Rainbow reveals significant insights into their topological properties. We identified the total topological charges by examining the normalized field lines along various free parameters. Our findings indicate that the parameters $( R_0 )$ and $( f_{\epsilon} = g_{\epsilon} )$ influence the topological charges. These results are comprehensively summarized in Table I. In examining the photon sphere within this model, the sign of the parameter \( R_0 \) plays a crucial role in determining whether the model adopts a dS or AdS configuration. An interesting characteristic of this model is that, in its AdS form, it avoids the formation of naked singularity regions, which sets it apart from many other models. Typically, varying parameter values in other models can result in the division of space into regions of black holes and naked singularities. However, this model consistently retains its black hole behavior by featuring an unstable photon sphere, regardless of parameter values within the acceptable range. In its dS form, the behavior of the model's photon sphere remains consistent with other dS models and does not exhibit unique differences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be capable of detecting gravitational waves (GWs) in the milli-Hertz band. Among various sources, LISA will detect the coalescence of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). Accurate and rapid inference of parameters for such sources will be important for potential electromagnetic follow-up efforts. Rapid Bayesian inference with LISA includes additional complexities as compared to current generation terrestrial detectors in terms of time and frequency dependent antenna response functions. In this work, we extend a recently developed, computationally efficient technique that uses meshfree interpolation methods to accelerate Bayesian reconstruction of compact binaries. Originally developed for second-generation terrestrial detectors, this technique is now adapted for LISA parameter estimation. Using the full inspiral, merger, and ringdown waveform (PhenomD) and assuming rigid adiabatic antenna response function, we show faithful inference of SMBHB parameters from GW signals embedded in stationary, Gaussian instrumental noise. We discuss the computational cost and performance of the meshfree approximation method in estimating the GW source parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series data from observations of black hole ringdown gravitational waves are often analyzed in the time domain by using damped sinusoid models with acyclic boundary conditions. Data conditioning operations, including downsampling, filtering, and the choice of data segment duration, reduce the computational cost of such analyses and can improve numerical stability. Here we analyze simulated damped sinsuoid signals to illustrate how data conditioning operations, if not carefully applied, can undesirably alter the analysis' posterior distributions. We discuss how currently implemented downsampling and filtering methods, if applied too aggressively, can introduce systematic errors and skew tests of general relativity. These issues arise because current downsampling and filtering methods do not operate identically on the data and model. Alternative downsampling and filtering methods which identically operate on the data and model may be achievable, but we argue that the current operations can still be implemented safely. We also show that our preferred anti-alias filtering technique, which has an instantaneous frequency-domain response at its roll-off frequency, preserves the structure of posterior distributions better than other commonly used filters with transient frequency-domain responses. Lastly, we highlight that exceptionally long data segments may need to be analyzed in cases where thin lines in the noise power spectral density overlap with central signal frequencies. Our findings may be broadly applicable to any analysis of truncated time domain data with acyclic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Space-based optical lattice clocks as gravitational wave detectors in search for new physics</title>

Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity and performance of space-based Optical Lattice Clocks (OLCs) in detecting gravitational waves, in particular the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) at low frequencies $(10^{-4}, 1) \rm Hz$, which are inaccessible to ground-based detectors. We first analyze the response characteristics of a single OLC detector for SGWB detection and compare its sensitivity with that of Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Due to longer arm lengths, space-based OLC detectors can exhibit unique frequency responses and enhance the capability to detect SGWB in the low-frequency range, but the sensitivity of a single OLC detector remains insufficient overall compared to LISA. Then, as a preliminary plan, we adopt a method of cross-correlation on two OLC detectors to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This method leverages the uncorrelated origins but statistically similar properties of noise in two detectors while the SGWB signal is correlated between them, thus achieving effective noise suppression and sensitivity enhancement. Future advancements in OLC stability are expected to further enhance their detection performance. This work highlights the potential of OLC detectors as a promising platform for SGWB detection, offering complementary capabilities to LISA, and opening an observational window into more astrophysical sources and the early universe.</description>

      <title>An upper limit to the lifetime of stellar remnants from gravitational pair production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black holes are assumed to decay via Hawking radiation. Recently we found evidence that spacetime curvature alone without the need for an event horizon leads to black hole evaporation. Here we investigate the evaporation rate and decay time of a non-rotating star of constant density due to spacetime curvature-induced pair production and apply this to compact stellar remnants such as neutron stars and white dwarfs. We calculate the creation of virtual pairs of massless scalar particles in spherically symmetric asymptotically flat curved spacetimes. This calculation is based on covariant perturbation theory with the quantum field representing, e.g.,\ gravitons or photons. We find that in this picture the evaporation timescale, $\tau$, of massive objects scales with the average mass density, $\rho$, as $\tau\propto\rho^{-3/2}$. The maximum age of neutron stars, $\tau\sim 10^{68}\,\text{yr}$, is comparable to that of low-mass stellar black holes. White dwarfs, supermassive black holes, and dark matter supercluster halos evaporate on longer, but also finite timescales. Neutron stars and white dwarfs decay similarly to black holes, ending in an explosive event when they become unstable. This sets a general upper limit for the lifetime of matter in the universe, which in general is much longer than the Hubble--Lema\^itre time, although primordial objects with densities above $\rho_\text{max} \approx 3\times 10^{53}\,\text{g/}\text{cm}^3$ should have dissolved by now. As a consequence, fossil stellar remnants from a previous universe could be present in our current universe only if the recurrence time of star forming universes is smaller than about $\sim 10^{68}\,\text{years}$.</description>

      <title>Probing Loop Quantum Gravity via Kerr Black Hole and EHT Results</title>

Abstract: Recently, a study on shadow of quantum Schwarzschild black hole appeared in [Ye et al., Phys.Lett. B 851, 138566, (2024)] for a fixed value of Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\gamma$. Following this approach, we considered its rotating counterpart being a deformed Kerr metric in Loop Quantum Gravity and studied its deviation from Kerr black hole for a fixed value of $\gamma$. We proved a theorem describing the location of unstable circular null orbits for all metrics of this kind. The deviation between the shadows of the quantum Kerr and Kerr black holes has also been studied, and parameters are constrained by comparison with the EHT results for M87* and Sgr A* to precisely probe the quantity of deviation due to quantum correction. Lastly, we immersed the deformed Kerr black hole in an inhomogeneous plasma and studied its impact on the shadow size. We found that the unstable null orbits for the quantum black hole are always smaller than the unstable null orbits for Kerr black hole. The quantum correction allows the deformed Kerr black hole to mimic Sgr A* with a higher probability than the Kerr black hole. However, the quantum-corrected Kerr black hole barely mimics M87*. The plasma reduces the size of black hole shadow and the plasma parameter in the case II is more sensitive than that in case I.</description>

      <title>Higgs Inflation Model with Small Non-Minimal Coupling Constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the "Higgs field+gravity" model, the selfconsistency of equations obtained from the original action has the form of an algebraic constraint defining the scalar $\zeta$ as a function of the Higgs field $\varphi$ and its first derivatives. The scalar $\zeta$ is present in all equations of motion and has a significant effect on the dynamics. Transition to the Einstein frame is carried out in equations of motions. Due to the constraint, the original model parameters are converted into $\varphi$-dependent classical effective parameters. In particular, the effective potential has the form $U_{eff}=\frac{\lambda}{4\xi^2}M_P^4 F(\varphi) \tanh^4(\frac{\sqrt{\xi}\varphi}{M_P})$, where $F(\varphi)$ is a smooth function. The constant $\xi$ of non-minimal coupling to scalar curvature can be chosen as small as desired. If $\xi =1/6$, then to ensure agreement with CMB observational data, the Higgs field selfcoupling parameter $\lambda$ in the original action must be of the order of $\sim 10^{-11}$. During cosmological evolution after the end of inflation, the decrease of $\varphi$ leads to a change in the sign of the effective Higgs mass term. This effect provides an answer to the mystery of the Higgs potential structure and leads to SSB. As $\varphi$ approaches VEV, the scalar function $\zeta(\varphi)$ changes in such a way that the classical effective selfcoupling parameter $\lambda_{eff}(\zeta(\varphi))$ increases by 10 orders of magnitude compared to $\lambda$, which is necessary for the implementation of the GWS theory. Applying the model to the very beginning of the classical evolution of the Universe shows that under certain initial conditions, cosmological dynamics can begin with a phantom regime preceding inflation.However, if evolution begins with normal dynamics, then it proceeds only as inflation, and the problem of initial conditions for the onset of inflation does not arise.</description>

      <title>Resonant Locking Between Binary Systems Induced by Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction of gravitational waves (GWs) with matter is thought to be typically negligible in the Universe. We identify a possible exception in the case of resonant interactions, where GWs emitted by a background binary system such as an inspiraling supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary causes a resonant response in a stellar-mass foreground binary and the frequencies of the two systems become, and remain, synchronized. We point out that such locking is not only possible, but can significantly reduce the binaries' merger time for $\mathcal{O}(1-10^4)$ binaries in the host galaxy of the merging SMBHs of $10^{9-11}M_{\odot}$ for standard general relativity and even more either in ``wet'' SMBH mergers or in certain modified theories of gravity where the inspiral rate is reduced. This could leave an imprint on the period distribution of stellar mass binaries in post-merger galaxies which could be detectable by future GW detectors, such as LISA.</description>

      <title>Into the vortex: quasinormal and quasibound spectra of rotating acoustic geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong-field gravity simulators are laboratory experiments that can investigate a wide range of both classical and quantum phenomena occurring in nature. In this work, we introduce an effective geometry that captures most of the characteristics of the strong-field regime of astrophysical, rotating black holes. This geometry can represent a vortex made from a variety of fluid and superfluid profiles with zero viscosity, making it a promising finite-temperature quantum-field-theory simulator for rotating curved spacetimes. Our geometry includes not only the typical radial flow which gives rise to an acoustic horizon, but also azimuthal circulation of the fluid. We compute the quasinormal modes, semi-analytically, and the exact quasibound states of acoustic excitations interacting with this effective geometry. The resulting spectra can be identified for both co-rotating and counter-rotating surface acoustic waves. In particular, the behavior of our acoustic geometry with circulation aligns with the phenomenology observed in recent experiments that include superfluids.</description>

      <title>Identification of Stochastic Gravitational Wave Backgrounds from Cosmic String Using Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Cosmic strings play a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of the fundamental structure and evolution of the universe, unifying our knowledge of cosmology, and potentially unveiling new physical laws and phenomena. The advent and operation of space-based detectors provide an important opportunity for detecting stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB) generated by cosmic strings. However, the intricate nature of SGWB poses a formidable challenge in distinguishing its signal from the complex noise by some traditional methods. Therefore, we attempt to identify SGWB based on machine learning. Our findings show that the joint detection of LISA and Taiji significantly outperforms individual detectors, and even in the presence of numerous low signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) signals, the identification accuracy remains exceptionally high with 95%. Although our discussion is based solely on simulated data, the relevant methods can provide data-driven analytical capabilities for future observations of SGWB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deepen the analysis of the cosmological acceleration produced by quantum gravity dynamics in the formalism of group field theory condensate cosmology, treated at the coarse-grained level via a phenomenological model, in the language of hydrodynamics on minisuperspace. Specifically, we conduct a detailed analysis of the late-time evolution, which shows a phantom-like phase followed by an asymptotic De Sitter expansion. We argue that the model indicates a recent occurrence of the phantom crossing and we extract a more precise expression for the effective cosmological constant, linking its value to other parameters in the model and to the scale of the quantum bounce in the early universe evolution. Additionally, we show how the phantom phase produced by our quantum gravity dynamics increases the inferred value of the current Hubble parameter based on observed data, indicating a possible quantum gravity mechanism for alleviating the Hubble tension. Our results represent a concrete example of how quantum gravity can provide an explanation for large-scale cosmological puzzles, in an emergent spacetime scenario.</description>

      <title>Can wormholes mirror the quasi-normal mode spectrum of Schwarzschild black holes?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wormholes are exotic compact objects characterized by the absence of essential singularities and horizons, acting as slender bridges linking two distinct regions of spacetime. Despite their theoretical significance, they remain however undetected, possibly due to their ability to closely mimic the observational properties of black holes. This study explores whether a static and spherically symmetric wormhole within General Relativity can reproduce the quasi-normal mode spectrum of a Schwarzschild black hole under scalar, electromagnetic, and axial gravitational perturbations, both individually and in combination. To address this, we reformulate the wormhole metric components using a near-throat parametrization. Our analysis concentrates on the fundamental mode and first overtone, estimated via the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method. By employing a customized minimization strategy, we demonstrate that within a specific region of the parameter space, a wormhole can successfully replicate a subset of the black hole quasi-normal mode spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a Bardeen model coupling Einstein gravity with nonlinear electromagnetic fields and non-topological soliton complex scalar fields, governed by the magnetic charge $\tilde{q}$, the complex scalar field frequency $\tilde{\omega}$, and the self-interaction parameter $\tilde{\eta}$. Our results reveal that the magnetic charge $\tilde{q}$ exhibits $\tilde{\eta}$-dependent critical values $\tilde{q}_c$, beyond which ($\tilde{q} &gt; \tilde{q}_c$) Bardeen boson stars (BBSs) may transition into frozen states ($\tilde{\omega} \to 0$). These frozen states are characterized by a critical horizon whose radius $\tilde r^\mathrm{H}_{c}$ satisfies $\tilde r_{\text{inner}}^{\text{H,RN}} &lt; \tilde r_{c} &lt; \tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{H,RN}}$, where $\tilde r_{\text{inner}}^{\text{H,RN}}$ and $\tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{RN}}$ denote the inner and outer horizons of magnetic Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) black holes with equivalent mass and magnetic charge. Notably, the ADM mass of frozen BBSs is independent of $\tilde{\eta}$. Furthermore, light ring (LR) solutions exist universally across all tested combinations of $\tilde{q}$ and $\tilde{\eta}$, with all frozen BBSs exhibiting LRs whose outer radius $\tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{LR}}$ is independent of $\tilde{\eta}$. Compared to magnetic RN black holes, frozen BBSs possess a smaller outer LR radius ($\tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{LR}} &lt; \tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{LR, RN}}$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the correspondence between modified gravity theories and general entropic cosmology theory. Such a theory is proposed by an analogy with Jacobson's work, where the Einstein equation was derived from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We compare FLRW equations obtained in entropic gravity with those in modified gravity theories. It is found the correspondence of $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ gravities and general entropic gravity. We regard the $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ gravity theories as effective local theories corresponding to the entropic gravity theories and we investigate the gravitational waves. The obtained equation of the gravitational wave is identical to that in Einstein's gravity except that the gravitational coupling is modified by the functional form of the functions $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$. It is interesting that in the case of the Tsallis entropic cosmology, the gravitational coupling becomes small or large, which may suppress or enhance the emission of the gravitational wave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-point correlation function of a massive field $\langle\chi(\tau)\chi(0)\rangle$, measured along an observer's worldline in de Sitter (dS), decays exponentially as $\tau \to \infty$. Meanwhile, every dS observer is surrounded by a horizon and the holographic interpretation of the horizon entropy $S_{\rm dS}$ suggests that the correlation function should stop decaying, and start behaving erratically at late times. We find evidence for this expectation in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity by finding a topologically nontrivial saddle, which is suppressed by $e^{-S_{\rm dS}}$, and which gives a constant contribution to $|\langle \chi(\tau)\chi(0)\rangle|^2$. This constant might have the interpretation of the late-time average of $|\langle \chi(\tau)\chi(0)\rangle|^2$ over all microscopic theories that have the same low-energy effective description.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Raman Scattering in Effective Field Theory: a Scalar Tidal Matching at $\mathcal{O}(G^3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework to compute amplitudes for the gravitational analog of the Raman process, a quasi-elastic scattering of waves off compact objects, in worldline effective field theory (EFT). As an example, we calculate third post-Minkowskian (PM) order ($\mathcal{O}(G^3)$), or two-loop, phase shifts for the scattering of a massless scalar field including all tidal effects and dissipation. Our calculation unveils two sources of the classical renormalization-group flow of dynamical Love numbers: a universal running independent of the nature of the compact object, and a running self-induced by tides. Restricting to the black hole case, we find that our EFT phase shifts agree exactly with those from general relativity, provided that the relevant static Love numbers are set to zero. In addition, we carry out a complete matching of the leading scalar dynamical Love number required to renormalize a universal short scale divergence in the S-wave. Our results pave the way for systematic calculations of gravitational Raman scattering at higher PM orders.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the confident binary black hole (BBH) detections from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) with an alternative mass population model in order to capture features in the mass distribution beyond the Powerlaw + Peak model. We find that the peak of a second power law characterizes the $\sim 30-35~ M_\odot$ bump, such that the data marginally prefers a mixture of two power laws for the mass distribution of binary components over a Powerlaw + Peak model with a Bayes Factor $\log_{10}\mathcal{B}$ of 0.24. This result may imply that the $\sim 30-35~ M_\odot$ feature represents the onset of a second population of BBH mergers (e.g. from a dynamical formation channel) rather than a specific mass feature over a broader distribution. When an additional Gaussian bump is allowed within our power law mixture model, we find a new feature in the BH mass spectrum at $\sim65-70~M_\odot$ ($\log_{10}\mathcal{B}$ = 0.29 compared to Powerlaw + Peak). This new feature may be consistent with hierarchical mergers, and constitute $\sim3\%$ of the BBH population. This model also recovers a maximum mass of $58^{+32}_{-14}~M_\odot$ for the second power law, consistent with the onset of a pair-instability supernova mass gap.</description>

      <title>Holographic CFT phase transitions for 4-D Dyonic AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11058v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work aims to explore the holographic dual of the thermodynamics of 4-D dyonic AdS black holes within the AdS/CFT correspondence framework. With the alterations in $\Lambda$ as cosmological constant and $G_N$ as Newton's constant, the AdS black hole thermodynamics can be extended. This relates to incorporating the $C$ as CFT central charge and $\mu$ as its chemical potential to the standard pairs of $(T, S)$ that is temperature vs. entropy, and $(p,\mathcal{V})$ as field theory pressure vs. volume as a pair in the dual CFT for conjugate thermodynamic variables. We explore the dyonic system which is rich in phase transitions so the traditional pairs for potential and charges become $(\tilde{\Phi}_e,\tilde{Q}_e)$ as electric potential and charge and $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_m)$ as magnetic potential and charge. Exploration of all the 16 ensembles, showed that some show interesting phase behaviour and criticality in some ensembles like $(\tilde{Q}_m,\tilde{\Phi}_e,\mathcal{V},C)$, $(\tilde{Q}_e,\tilde{\Phi}_m,\mathcal{V},C)$, $(\tilde{Q}_m,\tilde{Q}_e,\mathcal{V},C)$ where we get a number of phase transitions and criticality namely Van der Waals, Superfluid $\lambda$ and Davies type where Davies type is missing in the last ensemble. In ensembles $(\tilde{Q}_m,\tilde{\Phi}_e,\mathcal{V},\mu)$, $(\tilde{Q}_e,\tilde{\Phi}_m,\mathcal{V},\mu)$, $(\tilde{Q}_m,\tilde{Q}_e,\mathcal{V},\mu)$, we see only a Davies type phase transitions. In ensemble $(\tilde{Q}_m,\tilde{\Phi}_e,p,C)$, $(\tilde{Q}_m,\tilde{\Phi}_e,p,\mu)$, $(\tilde{Q}_e,\tilde{\Phi}_m,p,C)$, $(\tilde{Q}_e,\tilde{\Phi}_m,p,\mu)$, $(\tilde{\Phi}_m,\tilde{\Phi}_e,p,\mu)$, $(\tilde{Q}_m,\tilde{Q}_e,p,C)$, $(\tilde{Q}_m,\tilde{Q}_e,p,\mu)$ we see no criticality but we do see Davies type phase transition. In ensembles $(\tilde{\Phi}_m,\tilde{\Phi}_e,\mathcal{V},C)$, we see a confined/deconfined and Davies-type phase transition.</description>

      <title>Infrared Sensitivity of Cosmological Probes In The Presence of Axion Field Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of long wavelength entropy fluctuations on cosmological probes such as galaxy clustering, luminosity distance, and CMB temperature anisotropies. Specifically, we consider fluctuations of a massless spectator scalar field set up in the early universe, which later acquires mass during the radiation-dominated era. We find that there are non-vanishing effects on observables, and the amplitude of these effects peaks for observables set up at the time of equal matter and radiation, and decreases as $\eta^{-2}$ where $\eta$ is the conformal time. Hence, the back-reaction effects are important for CMB anisotropies, but their impact on late-time observables is suppressed. In particular, the back-reaction effects are unable to explain the Hubble tension while they might alleviate the cosmic dipole tension. In contrast to a lot of the previous work on back-reaction, we work in position rather than momentum space.</description>

      <title>The Gauge Theory of Weyl Group and its Interpretation as Weyl Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give an extensive description of Weyl quadratic gravity as the gauge theory of the Weyl group. The previously discovered (vectorial) torsion/non-metricity equivalence is shown to be built-in as it corresponds to a redefinition of the generators of the Weyl group. We present a generalisation of the torsion/non-metricity duality which includes, aside from the vector, also a traceless 3-tensor with two antisymmetric indices and vanishing skew symmetric part. A discussion of this relation in the case of minimally coupled matter fields is given. We further point out that a Rarita-Schwinger field can couple minimally to all the components of torsion and some components of non-metricity. Alongside we present the same gauge construction for the Poincar\'e and conformal groups. We show that even though the Weyl group is a subgroup of the conformal group, the gauge theory of the latter is actually only a special case of Weyl quadratic gravity.</description>

      <title>Off-diagonal coupling of supersymmetric SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the off-diagonal coupling between two supersymmetric SYK models, which preserves both supersymmetry and solvability. We found that the interaction terms of the $N=2$ supersymmetric SYK have a holographic interpretation as a possible supersymmetric traversable wormhole. First we introduce the coupling in the trivial Homologic $N=1$ SYK model as a simplified example. Similar couplings can be implied in $N=2$ chiral SYK model with BPS states. We propose a special form of $N=4$ SYK by introducing supermultiplets, and which also naturally include the coupling terms. The holographic picture of $N=4$ SYK does not have an eternal solution in the low energy limit. And the effective actions are studied in both thermal limit and low energy limit. We also investigate the SYK-like thermal field double states of the supersymmetric SYK and the transmission amplitude between single-side $N=2$ models in Lorentz time. Additionally, the multi-side $N=2,4$ OTOCs are also studied.</description>

      <title>De Sitter quantum gravity and the emergence of local algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00111v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum theories of gravity are generally expected to have some degree of non-locality, with familiar local physics emerging only in a particular limit. Perturbative quantum gravity around backgrounds with isometries and compact Cauchy slices provides an interesting laboratory in which this emergence can be explored. In this context, the remaining isometries are gauge symmetries and, as a result, gauge-invariant observables cannot be localized. Instead, local physics can arise only through certain relational constructions.
  We explore such issues below for perturbative quantum gravity around de Sitter space. In particular, we describe a class of gauge-invariant observables which, under appropriate conditions, provide good approximations to certain algebras of local fields. Our results suggest that, near any minimal $S^d$ in dS$_{d+1}$, this approximation can be accurate only over regions in which the corresponding global time coordinate $t$ spans an interval $\Delta t \lesssim O(\ln G^{-1})$. In contrast, however, we find that the approximation can be accurate over arbitrarily large regions of global dS$_{d+1}$ so long as those regions are located far to the future or past of such a minimal $S^d$. This in particular includes arbitrarily large parts of any static patch.</description>

      <title>Wormhole-induced effective coupling in SYK chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inhomogeneous quantum chains have recently been considered in the context of developing novel discrete realizations of holographic dualities. To advance this programme, we explore the ground states of infinite chains with large number $N$ of Majorana fermions on each site, which interact via on-site $q$-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) couplings, as well as via additional inhomogeneous hopping terms between nearest-neighbour sites. The hopping parameters are either aperiodically or randomly distributed. Our approach unifies techniques to solve SYK-like models in the large $N$ limit with a real-space renormalization group method known as strong-disorder renormalization group (SDRG). We show that the SDRG decimation of SYK dots linked by a strong hopping induces an effective hopping interaction between their neighbouring sites. If two decimated sites are nearest neighbours, in the large $q$ limit their local ground states admit a holographic dual description in terms of eternal traversable wormholes. At the end of the SDRG procedure, we obtain a factorised ground state of the infinite inhomogeneous SYK chains that we consider, which has a spacetime description involving a sequence of wormholes. This amounts to a local near-boundary description of the bulk geometry in the context of discrete holography.</description>

      <title>Local Operator Algebras of Charged States in Gauge Theory and Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Powerful techniques have been developed in quantum field theory that employ algebras of local operators, yet local operators cannot create physical charged states in gauge theory or physical nonzero-energy states in perturbative quantum gravity. A common method to obtain physical operators out of local ones is to dress the latter using appropriate Wilson lines. This procedure destroys locality, it must be done case by case for each charged operator in the algebra, and it rapidly becomes cumbersome, particularly in perturbative quantum gravity.
  In this paper we present an alternative approach to the definition of physical charged operators: we define an automorphism that maps an algebra of local charged operators into a (non-local) algebra of physical charged operators. The automorphism is described by a formally unitary intertwiner mapping the exact BRS operator associated to the gauge symmetry into its quadratic part.
  The existence of an automorphism between local operators and the physical ones, describing charged states, allows to retain many of the results derived in local operator algebras and extend them to the physical-but-nonlocal algebra of charged operators as we discuss in some simple applications of our construction. We also discuss a formal construction of physical states and possible obstructions to it.</description>

Abstract: Formulating a quantum theory of gravity lies at the heart of fundamental theoretical physics. This collection of lecture notes encompasses a selection of topics that were covered in six mini-courses at the Nordita PhD school "Towards Quantum Gravity". The scope was to provide a coherent picture, from its foundation to forefront research, emphasizing connections between different areas. The lectures begin with perturbative quantum gravity and effective field theory. Subsequently, two ultraviolet-complete approaches are presented: asymptotically safe gravity and string theory. Finally, elements of quantum effects in black hole spacetimes are discussed.</description>

Abstract: To deepen our understanding of Quantum Gravity and its connections with black holes and cosmology, building a common language and exchanging ideas across different approaches is crucial. The Nordita Program "Quantum Gravity: from gravitational effective field theories to ultraviolet complete approaches" created a platform for extensive discussions, aimed at pinpointing both common grounds and sources of disagreements, with the hope of generating ideas and driving progress in the field. This contribution summarizes the twelve topical discussions held during the program and collects individual thoughts of speakers and panelists on the future of the field in light of these discussions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron Stars (NSs), among the densest objects in the Universe, are exceptional laboratories for investigating Dark Matter (DM) properties. Recent theoretical and observational developments have heightened interest in exploring the impact of DM on NS structure, giving rise to the concept of Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars (DANSs). This review examines how NSs can accumulate DM over time, potentially altering their fundamental properties. We explore leading models describing DM behavior within NSs, focusing on the effects of both bosonic and fermionic candidates on key features such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Additionally, we review how DM can modify the cooling and heating processes, trigger the formation of a black hole, and impact Gravitational Waves (GWs) emissions from binary systems. By synthesizing recent research, this work highlights how DANSs might produce observable signatures, offering new opportunities to probe DM properties through astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Minimal extension of the Standard Model with a mirror symmetry between fundamental fermions and a possible origin of dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a specific, nontrivial extension of the Standard Model of weak interactions based on the ${SU(2)}_L\times{U(1)}_Y\times{U(1)}_C$ group. Our motivation follows from the identification of the globally conserved charge $\Omega=\mathrm{B}-\mathrm{L}-\mathrm{Q}$ as a neutrino charge. An intriguing feature of the model is the emergence of a mirror symmetry between neutrinos and electrically charged leptons, as well as between up and down quarks. Following the spontaneous breaking of the weak gauge symmetry with the use of the Goldstone-Higgs iso-doublet, all elementary fermions acquire Dirac masses from Yukawa interaction. The $W^\pm$ and $Z$ bosons also acquire masses, although with a modified relationship between their respective masses, as compared to the Standard Model. Our model accounts for both chiral components of the neutrino and offers an explanation for the non-observability of the right-chiral neutrino. Additionally, it forbids neutrinoless double-beta decay. Spontaneous breaking of the local $U(1)$ symmetry leads to the new gauge boson $ \mathit{\Omega}_\mu$ mass $M_\mathit{\Omega}$, which we assume to be greater than the mass $m_\chi$ of a new scalar, Higgs-like field $\chi$. The cosmological stability of $\chi$, predicted under this condition, allows for its interpretation as dark matter, interacting exclusively with $\mathit{\Omega}_\mu$ and gravity. From this perspective, we solve and analyze a system of Boltzmann equations that describe the thermal evolution of the number density of $\chi$ dark matter and the $\mathit{\Omega}_\mu$ mediator field within the context of the $\mathrm{\Lambda CDM}$ cosmological model. Specifically, we estimate the coupling constant $q$ to be in the range of $\sim 10^{-8.5}\ g$ to $\sim 10^{-6}\ g$ which ensures cosmological stability of the $\chi$ particles.</description>

      <title>Holographic observers for time-band algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the algebra of observables in a time band on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space in a theory of quantum gravity. Strictly speaking this algebra does not have a commutant because products of operators within the time band give rise to operators outside the time band. However, we show that in a state where the bulk contains a macroscopic observer, it is possible to define a coarse-grained version of this algebra with a non-trivial commutant, and a resolution limited by the observer's characteristics. This algebra acts on a little Hilbert space that describes excitations about the observer's state and time-translated versions of this state. Our construction requires a choice of dressing that determines how elements of the algebra transform under the Hamiltonian. At leading order in gravitational perturbation theory, and with a specific choice of dressing, our construction reduces to the modular crossed-product described previously in the literature. We also prove a theorem showing that this is the only crossed product of a type III$_1$ algebra resulting in an algebra with a trace. This trace can be used to define entropy differences between states in the little Hilbert space that are insensitive to the properties of the observer. We discuss some technical challenges in extending this construction to higher orders in perturbation theory. Lastly, we review the construction of interior operators in the eternal black hole and show that they can be written as elements of a crossed product algebra.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of chaos across the phase transition in a 2-coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, with a focus on the unstable "hot wormhole" phase. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we employ two non-equilibrium protocols that allow access to this phase, which is inaccessible through equilibrium simulations: one involves cooling the system via a coupling to a thermal bath, while in the other we periodically drive the coupling parameter between the two sides. We numerically compute the Lyapunov exponents of the hot wormhole for the two cases. Our results uncover a rich structure within this phase, including both thermal and non-thermal solutions. These behaviors are analyzed in detail, with partial insights provided by the Schwarzian approximation, which captures certain but not all aspects of the observed dynamics.</description>

      <title>Sign Switching in Dark Sector Coupling Interactions as a Candidate for Resolving Cosmological Tensions</title>

Abstract: The $\Lambda$CDM model has successfully explained a wide range of cosmological observations, but is increasingly challenged by the emergence of cosmological tensions, particularly the Hubble Tension $H_0$ and the $S_8$ tension. The Hubble Tension, with a significance above 5$\sigma$, and the $S_8$ tension, showing a discrepancy of approximately 2-4$\sigma$, highlight inconsistencies between measurements of the local and early universe. This paper expands a well-established Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) phenomenological scenario, where dark matter (DM) can transfer energy to dark energy (DE) or vice versa, depending on the sign of the coupling parameter $\xi$. The novel feature consists in a transition mechanism which reverses the direction of the energy-momentum transfer after the redshift where the densities of the dark species are the same. We evaluate this model using a comprehensive set of recent observational data, including Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the DESI survey, Type Ia Supernovae from the PantheonPlus, DESY5 and Union3 samples, and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck. Our analysis shows that this scenario can potentially relax both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions simultaneously. We find the new model to be weakly preferred over $\Lambda$CDM by BAO-DESI data. However, we show that the IDE model features positive Bayesian evidence compared to $\Lambda$CDM only when Cepheid distance calibration in the SH0ES sample is used to calibrate SNIa data from PantheonPlus.</description>

      <title>Three-Field String Inflation with Perturbative Corrections: Dynamics and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we construct an explicit string motivated example of three-field inflation in a related, yet distinct from, the recently discovered perturbative large volume scenario (pLVS). Contrary to the usual constructions, in this set up, large volume is ensured by the interplay between the effects of $\alpha^{\prime 3}$, logarithmic loop and higher derivative $F^4$ corrections. After addressing a full moduli stabilization scenario, we move on to a detailed analysis of three-field model of inflation in a canonical basis. We conduct multiple consistency checks to establish a solid foundation for our model within the framework of the underlying 4D effective field theory (EFT). Our model differs from previous setups in three key aspects: first, the interaction between subleading corrections that drive full moduli stabilization follows a different pattern, second, the volume form of the underlying Calabi-Yau is different, and third, in our three-field inflation scenario, the second slow-roll parameter consistently dominates over the first by several orders of magnitude. The latter signals the possible presence of primordial features which can be verified by forthcoming ground and space based experiments. We can roughly distinguish two stages of inflation: the first stage mostly occurs in the steepest direction during horizon crossing giving us almost $55$ efolds of inflation -- once one of the inflatons falls off the ridge and then to its true minimum, the other two fields become active, giving us a truly multi-field behavior in the second stage -- adding few more efolds of inflation. We also confirm our claim by introducing the non-planar torsion in the inflationary trajectory -- this quantity becomes non-trivial in the second stage of inflation. Finally, we calculate the cosmological observables, which align with Planck data, and discuss potential directions for future research.</description>
