      <title>The $q$-generalised multinomial/KL-divergence correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymptotic correspondence between the probability mass function of the $q$-deformed multinomial distribution and the $q$-generalised Kullback-Leibler divergence, also known as Tsallis relative entropy, is established. The probability mass function is generalised using the $q$-deformed algebra developed within the framework of nonextensive statistics, leading to the emergence of a family of divergence measures in the asymptotic limit as the system size increases. The coefficients in the asymptotic expansion yield Tsallis relative entropy as the leading-order term when $q$ is interpreted as an entropic parameter. Furthermore, higher-order expansion coefficients naturally introduce new divergence measures, extending Tsallis relative entropy through a one-parameter generalisation. Some fundamental properties of these extended divergences are also explored.</description>

Abstract: We point out an inconsistency in the theoretical treatment of Bosetti and collaborators (Crystal Growth &amp; Design, 2021, 22.1: 87-97), and then proceed to prove that for monomers interacting by two-body potentials, the presence of an infinite, flat, attractive crystal surface may not induce an increased propensity for cluster formation (that is, secondary nucleation) of the type envisioned by these authors.</description>

      <title>Role of Coupling Asymmetry in the Fully Disordered Kuramoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of phase oscillators in the fully disordered Kuramoto model with couplings of defined asymmetry. The mean-field dynamics is reduced to a self-consistent stochastic single-oscillator problem which we analyze perturbatively and by numerical simulations. We elucidate the influence of the asymmetry on the correlation and response function of the system as well as on the distribution of the order parameter. The so-called volcano transition is shown to be robust with respect to a small degree of coupling asymmetry but to disappear when the antisymmetry in the couplings outweighs the symmetry.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic inference of correlations in nonequilibrium collective dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of stochastic thermodynamics has revealed many useful fluctuation relations, with the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) being a theorem of major interest. When many nonequilibrium currents interact with each other, a naive application of the TUR to an individual current can result in an apparent violation of the TUR bound. Here, we explore how such an apparent violation can be used to put a lower bound on the strength of correlations as well as the number of interacting currents in collective dynamics. Our proposed protocol allows for the inference of hidden correlations in experiment, for example when a team of molecular motors pulls on the same cargo but only one or a subset of them is fluorescently tagged. By solving analytically and numerically several models of many-body nonequilibrium dynamics, we ascertain under which conditions this strategy can be applied and the inferred bound on correlations becomes tight.</description>

      <title>Efficient post-selection in light-cone correlations of monitored quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider how to target evolution conditioned on atypical measurement outcomes in monitored quantum circuits, i.e., the post-selection problem. We show that for a simple class of measurement schemes, post-selected light-cone dynamical correlation functions can be obtained efficiently from the averaged correlations of a different unitary circuit. This connects rare measurement outcomes in one circuit to typical outcomes in another one. We derive conditions for the existence of this rare-to-typical mapping in brickwork quantum circuits made of XYZ gates. We illustrate these general results with a model system that exhibits a dynamical crossover (a smoothed dynamical transition) in event statistics, and discuss extensions to more general dynamical correlations.</description>

      <title>Out-Of-Time-Ordered-Correlators for the Pure Inverted Quartic Oscillator: Classical Chaos meets Quantum Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-time-ordered-correlators (OTOCs) have been suggested as a means to diagnose chaotic behavior in quantum mechanical systems. Recently, it was found that OTOCs display exponential growth for the inverted quantum harmonic oscillator, mirroring the fact that this system is classically and quantum mechanically unstable. In this work, I study OTOCs for the inverted anharmonic (pure quartic) oscillator in quantum mechanics, finding only oscillatory behavior despite the classically unstable nature of the system. For higher temperature, OTOCs seem to exhibit saturation consistent with a value of $-2 \langle x^2 \rangle_T \langle p^2 \rangle_T$ at late times. I provide analytic evidence from the spectral zeta-function and the WKB method as well as direct numerical solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation that the inverted quartic oscillator possesses a real and positive energy eigenspectrum, and normalizable wave-functions.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo Tree Search approach to QAOA: finding a needle in the haystack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for quantum algorithms to tackle classical combinatorial optimization problems has long been one of the most attractive yet challenging research topics in quantum computing. In this context, variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are a promising family of hybrid quantum-classical methods tailored to cope with the limited capability of near-term quantum hardware. However, their effectiveness is hampered by the complexity of the classical parameter optimization which is prone to getting stuck either in local minima or in flat regions of the cost-function landscape. The clever design of efficient optimization methods is therefore of fundamental importance for fully leveraging the potential of VQAs. In this work, we approach parameter optimization as a sequential decision-making problem and tackle it with an adaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a common artificial intelligence technique designed for efficiently exploring complex decision graphs. We show that leveraging regular parameter patterns deeply affects the decision-tree structure and allows for a flexible and noise-resilient optimization strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices. Our results shed further light on the interplay between artificial intelligence and quantum information and provide a valuable addition to the toolkit of variational quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>The Fock-space landscape of many-body localisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article reviews recent progress in understanding the physics of many-body localisation (MBL) in disordered and interacting quantum many-body systems, from the perspective of ergodicity breaking on the associated Fock space. This approach to MBL is underpinned by mapping the dynamics of the many-body system onto that of a fictitious single particle on the high-dimensional, correlated and disordered Fock-space graph; yet, as we elaborate, the problem is fundamentally different from that of conventional Anderson localisation on high-dimensional or hierarchical graphs. We discuss in detail the nature of eigenstate correlations on the Fock space, both static and dynamic, and in the ergodic and many-body localised phases as well as in the vicinity of the MBL transition. The latter in turn sheds light on the nature of the transition, and motivates a scaling theory for it in terms of Fock-space based quantities. We also illustrate how these quantities can be concretely connected to real-space observables. An overview is given of several analytical and numerical techniques which have proven important in developing a comprehensive picture. Finally, we comment on some open questions in the field of MBL where the Fock-space approach is likely to prove insightful.</description>

      <title>Effective field theories of dissipative fluids with one-form symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A system with a one-form global symmetry at finite temperature can be viewed as a dissipative fluid of string-like objects. In this work, we classify and construct the most general effective field theories for hydrodynamics of such string fluids, in a probe limit where the one-form charge density is decoupled from the energy-momentum tensor. We show that at leading order in the derivative expansion, there are two distinct types of diffusive transport in a string fluid depending on the discrete spacetime symmetries present in it. One particular application of interest is magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), where the effective field theories describe the diffusion of magnetic field lines. Due to the distinction between the effective field theories for different discrete symmetries, we show that the MHD of a fluid with charge conjugation symmetry is qualitatively different from that of a neutron star, which we previously discussed in arXiv:2207.01636. The explicit effective actions that we write down can be used to obtain the dispersion relations $\omega(k)$ up to cubic order in momenta for each of the different discrete symmetry choices. As another application of this formalism, we show that when the one-form symmetry is spontaneously broken, the effective action reduces to the Maxwell theory. This confirms the interpretation of the photon as a Goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of a one-form symmetry.</description>

      <title>Ground state of the S = 1/2 Heisenberg spin chain with random ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Heisenberg $S=1/2$ chain with random ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings, using quantum Monte Carlo simulations at ultra-low temperatures, converging to the ground state. Finite-size scaling of correlation functions and excitation gaps demonstrate an exotic critical state in qualitative agreement with previous strong-disorder renormalization group calculations, but with scaling exponents depending on the coupling distribution. We find dual scaling regimes of the transverse correlations versus the distance, with an $L$ independent form $C(r)=r^{-\mu}$ for $r \ll L$ and $C(r,L)=L^{-\eta}f(r/L)$ for $r/L &gt; 0$, where $\mu &gt; \eta$ and the scaling function is delivered by our analysis. These results are at variance with previous spin-wave and density-matrix renormalization group calculations, thus highlighting the power of unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>The scaling limit of boundary spin correlations in non-integrable Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of non-integrable 2D Ising models obtained by perturbing the nearest-neighbor model via a weak, finite range potential which preserves translation and spin-flip symmetry, and we study its critical theory in the half-plane. We prove that the leading order long-distance behavior of the correlation functions for spins on the boundary is the same as for the nearest-neighbor model, up to an analytic multiplicative renormalization constant. In particular, the scaling limit is the Pfaffian of an explicit matrix. The proof is based on an exact representation of the generating function of correlations in terms of a Grassmann integral and on a multiscale analysis thereof, generalizing previous results to include observables located on the boundary.</description>

      <title>Fluid-network relations: decay laws meet with spatial self-similarity, scale-invariance, and control scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diverse implicit structures of fluids are discovered lately, providing opportunities to study the physics of fluids applying network analysis. Although considerable works devote to identifying informative network structures of fluids, we have limited understanding about the information these networks convey about fluids. To analyze how fluid mechanics is embodied in network topology or vice versa, we reveal a set of fluid-network relations that quantify the interactions between fundamental fluid properties (e.g., kinetic energy and enstrophy decay laws) and defining network characteristics (e.g., spatial self-similarity, scale-invariance, and control scaling). By analyzing spatial self-similarity in classic and generalized contexts, we first assess the self-similarity of vortical interactions in fluid flows. Deviations from self-similarity in networks exhibit power-law scaling behaviors with respect to fluid properties, suggesting the diversity among vortex as essential to self-similar fluid flows. Then, the same paradigm is adopted to investigate scale-invariance using renormalization groups, which reveals that the breaking extents of scale-invariance in networks, similar to those of spatial self-similarity, also scale with fluid properties in power-law manners. Furthermore, we define a control problem on networks to study the propagation of perturbations through vortical interactions over different ranges. The minimum cost of controlling vortical networks exponentially scales with range diameters (i.e., control distances), whose growth rates experiences temporal decays. We show that this temporal decay speed is fully determined by fluid properties in power-law scaling behaviours. In summary, these fluid-network relations enable a deeper understanding of implicit fluid structures and their interactions with fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Genotype-Phenotype Maps Reveal Mutational Robustness of RNA Folding, Spin Glasses, and Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies of genotype-phenotype (GP) maps have reported universally enhanced phenotypic robustness to genotype mutations, a feature essential to evolution. Virtually all of these studies make a simplifying assumption that each genotype -- represented as a sequence -- maps deterministically to a single phenotype, such as a discrete structure. Here, we introduce probabilistic genotype-phenotype (PrGP) maps, where each genotype maps to a vector of phenotype probabilities, as a more realistic and universal language for investigating robustness in a variety of physical, biological, and computational systems. We study three model systems to show that PrGP maps offer a generalized framework which can handle uncertainty emerging from various physical sources: (1) thermal fluctuation in RNA folding, (2) external field disorder in spin glass ground state finding, and (3) superposition and entanglement in quantum circuits, which are realized experimentally on IBM quantum computers. In all three cases, we observe a novel biphasic robustness scaling which is enhanced relative to random expectation for more frequent phenotypes and approaches random expectation for less frequent phenotypes. We derive an analytical theory for the behavior of PrGP robustness, and we demonstrate that the theory is highly predictive of empirical robustness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While it is known that Hamiltonian systems may undergo a phenomenon of condensation akin to Bose-Einstein condensation, not all the manifestations of this phenomenon have been uncovered yet. In this work we present a novel form of condensation in conservative Hamiltonian systems that stands out due to its evolution through highly coherent states. The result is based on a deterministic approach to obtain exact explicit solutions representing the dynamical formation of condensates in finite time. We reveal a dual-cascade behavior during the process, featuring inverse and direct transfer of conserved quantities across the spectrum. The direct cascade yields the excitation of arbitrarily high modes in finite time, being associated with the formation of a small-scale coherent structure. We provide a fully analytic description of the processes involved.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of phase space distributions to microcanonical equilibrium: dynamical isometry and generalized coarse-graining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05123v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the manner in which classical phase space distribution functions converge to the microcanonical distribution. We first prove a theorem about the lack of convergence, then define a generalization of the coarse-graining procedure that leads to convergence. We prove that the time evolution of phase space distributions is an isometry for a broad class of statistical distance metrics, implying that ensembles do not get any closer to (or farther from) equilibrium, according to these metrics. This extends the known result that strong convergence of phase space distributions to the microcanonical distribution does not occur. However, it has long been known that weak convergence can occur, such that coarse-grained distributions--defined by partitioning phase space into a finite number of cells--converge pointwise to the microcanonical distribution. We define a generalization of coarse-graining that removes the need for partitioning phase space into cells. We prove that our generalized coarse-grained distribution converges pointwise to the microcanonical distribution if the dynamics are strong mixing. As an example, we study an ensemble of triangular billiard systems.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Multidimensional Long-Range Random Field Ising Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14150v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend a recent argument by Ding and Zhuang from nearest-neighbor to long-range interactions and prove the phase transition in a class of ferromagnetic random field Ising models. Our proof combines a generalization of Fr\"ohlich-Spencer contours to the multidimensional setting, proposed by two of us, with the coarse-graining procedure introduced by Fisher, Fr\"ohlich, and Spencer. Our result shows that the Ding-Zhuang strategy is also useful for interactions $J_{xy}=|x-y|^{- \alpha}$ when $\alpha &gt; d$ in dimension $d\geq 3$ if we have a suitable system of contours, yielding an alternative approach that does not use the Renormalization Group Method (RGM), since Bricmont and Kupiainen suggested that the RGM should also work on this generality. We can consider i.i.d. random fields with Gaussian or Bernoulli distributions.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg spin chain with random-sign couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the 1D quantum Heisenberg chain with randomly ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic couplings (a model previously studied by approximate strong-disorder RG). We find that, at least for sufficiently large spin $S$, the ground state has ``spin glass'' order. The spin waves on top of this state have the dynamical exponent ${z=3/2}$, intermediate between the values $z=1$ of the antiferromagnet and ${z=2}$ of the ferromagnet. DMRG simulations are in good agreement with the analytical results for spins ${S=1}$ and ${S=3/2}$. The case ${S=1/2}$ shows large finite size effects: we suggest that this case is also ordered, but with a small ordered moment.</description>

      <title>Quantum memory at nonzero temperature in a thermodynamically trivial system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Passive error correction protects logical information forever (in the thermodynamic limit) by updating the system based only on local information and few-body interactions. A paradigmatic example is the classical two-dimensional Ising model: a Metropolis-style Gibbs sampler retains the sign of the initial magnetization (a logical bit) for thermodynamically long times in the low-temperature phase. Known models of passive quantum error correction similarly exhibit thermodynamic phase transitions to a low-temperature phase wherein logical qubits are protected by thermally stable topological order. Here, in contrast, we show that certain families of constant-rate classical and quantum low-density parity check codes have no thermodynamic phase transitions at nonzero temperature, but nonetheless exhibit ergodicity-breaking dynamical transitions: below a critical nonzero temperature, the mixing time of local Gibbs sampling diverges in the thermodynamic limit. Slow Gibbs sampling of such codes enables fault-tolerant passive quantum error correction using finite-depth circuits. This strategy is well suited to measurement-free quantum error correction and may present a desirable experimental alternative to conventional quantum error correction based on syndrome measurements and active feedback.</description>

      <title>Chiral Edge States Emerging on Anyon-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a symmetry-based approach to constructing lattice models for chiral topological phases, focusing on non-Abelian anyons. Using a 2+1D version of anyon chains and modular tensor categories(MTCs), we ensure exact MTC symmetry at the microscopic level. Numerical simulations using tensor networks demonstrate chiral edge modes for topological phases with Ising and Fibonacci anyons. Our method contrasts with conventional solvability approaches, providing a new theoretical avenue to explore strongly coupled 2+1D systems, revealing chiral edge states in non-Abelian anyonic systems.</description>
