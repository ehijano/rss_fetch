      <title>The $\alpha$-induction of Superconformal Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The successful application of $\alpha$-induction to the conformal field theory has given rise to many amazing results. For example, the classification of conformal nets in the discrete series. In this paper, however, we study $\alpha$-induction of graded local conformal nets. The main difference lies between locality in the conformal net cases and graded locality in the graded local conformal net cases. We show that the inclusions of graded local conformal nets give braided subfactors. We check that the $\alpha$-induction is still valid in terms of graded local conformal nets. Moreover, the simple current extension originally defined in terms of conformal nets still works for graded local conformal nets. Consequently, we give a shorter proof of classification of $N=2$ superconformal nets in the discrete series according to Gannon's list.</description>

      <title>Groupoid homology and K-theory for algebraic actions from number theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the groupoid homology for the ample groupoids associated with algebraic actions from rings of algebraic integers and integral dynamics. We derive results for the homology of the topological full groups associated with rings of algebraic integers, and we use our groupoid homology calculation to compute the K-theory for ring C*-algebras of rings of algebraic integers, recovering the results of Cuntz and Li and of Li and L\"uck without using Cuntz--Li duality. Moreover, we compute the K-theory for C*-algebras attached to integral dynamics, resolving the conjecture by Barlak, Omland, and Stammeier in full generality.</description>

Abstract: We study Beurling-Fourier algebras of $ q $-deformations of compact semisimple Lie groups. In particular, we show that the space of irreducible representations of the function algebras of their Drinfeld doubles is exhausted by the irreducible representations of weighted Fourier algebras associated to a certain family of central weights.</description>

      <title>The graph groupoid of a quantum sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spheres are among the most studied examples of compact quantum spaces, described by C*-algebras which are Cuntz-Krieger algebras of a directed graph, as proved by Hong and Szyma\'nski in 2002. About five years earlier, in 1997, Sheu proved that the C*-algebra of a quantum sphere is a groupoid C*-algebra. Here we show that the path groupoid of the directed graph of Hong and Szyma\'nski is isomorphic to the groupoid discovered by Sheu.</description>

      <title>Positive definiteness and Fell bundles over discrete groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a natural concept of positive definiteness for bundle maps between Fell bundles over (possibly different) discrete groups and describe several examples. Such maps induce completely positive maps between the associated full cross-sectional $C^*$-algebras in a functorial way. Under the assumption that the kernel of the homomorphism connecting the groups under consideration is amenable, they also induce completely positive maps between the associated reduced cross-sectional $C^*$-algebras. As an application, we define an approximation property for a Fell bundle over a discrete group which generalizes Exel's approximation property and still implies the weak containment property. Both approximation properties coincide when the unit fibre is nuclear.</description>

      <title>Semifinite von Neumann algebras in gauge theory and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: von Neumann algebras have been playing an increasingly important role in the context of gauge theories and gravity. The crossed product presents a natural method for implementing constraints through the commutation theorem, rendering it a useful tool for constructing gauge invariant algebras. The crossed product of a Type III algebra with its modular automorphism group is semifinite, which means that the crossed product regulates divergences in local quantum field theories. In this letter, we find a sufficient condition for the semifiniteness of the crossed product of a type III algebra with any locally compact group containing the modular automorphism group. Our condition surprisingly implies the centrality of the modular flow in the symmetry group, and we provide evidence for the necessity of this condition. Under these conditions, we construct an associated trace which computes physical expectation values. We comment on the importance of this result and and its implications for subregion physics in gauge theory and gravity.</description>

      <title>Strong primeness for equivalence relations arising from Zariski dense subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that orbit equivalence relations arising from essentially free ergodic probability measure preserving actions of Zariski dense discrete subgroups of simple algebraic groups are strongly prime. As a consequence, we prove the existence and the uniqueness of a prime factorization for orbit equivalence relations arising from direct products of higher rank lattices. This extends and strengthens Zimmer's primeness result for equivalence relations arising from actions of lattices in simple Lie groups. The proof of our main result relies on a combination of ergodic theory of algebraic group actions and Popa's intertwining theory for equivalence relations.</description>

      <title>General limit theorems for mixtures of free, monotone, and boolean independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study mixtures of free, monotone, and boolean independence described by directed graphs (digraphs). For a sequence of digraphs $G_n = (V_n,E_n)$, we give sufficient conditions for the limit $\widehat{\mu} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \boxplus_{G_n}(\mu_n)$ to exist whenever the boolean convolution powers $\mu_n^{\uplus |V_n|}$ converge to some $\mu$. This in particular includes central limit and Poisson limit theorems, as well as limit theorems for each classical domain of attraction. The hypothesis on the sequence of $G_n$ is that the normalized counts of digraph homomorphisms from rooted trees into $G_n$ converge as $n \to \infty$, and we verify this for several families of examples where the $G_n$'s converge in some sense to a continuum limit. In particular, we obtain a new limit theorems for multiregular digraphs, as well as recovering several limit theorems in prior work.</description>

      <title>Group measure space construction, ergodicity and $W^\ast$-rigidity for stable random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.14821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work discovers a novel link between probability theory (of stable random fields) and von Neumann algebras. It is established that the group measure space construction corresponding to a minimal representation is an invariant of a stationary symmetric $\alpha$-stable (S$\alpha$S) random field indexed by any countable group $G$. When $G=\mathbb{Z}^d$, we characterize ergodicity (and also absolute non-ergodicity) of stationary S$\alpha$S fields in terms of the central decomposition of this crossed product von Neumann algebra coming from any (not necessarily minimal) Rosinski representation. This shows that ergodicity (or the complete absence of it) is a $W^\ast$-rigid property (in a suitable sense) for this class of fields. All our results have analogues for stationary max-stable random fields as well.</description>

      <title>On numerical diameters and linear maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the diameter of the numerical range of bounded operators on Hilbert space and the induced seminorm, called the numerical diameter, on bounded linear maps between operator systems which is sensible in the case of unital maps and their scalar multiples. It is shown that the completely bounded numerical diameter is a norm that is comparable but not equal to the completely bounded norm. This norm is particularly interesting in the case of unital completely positive maps and their sections.</description>

      <title>Zero-error communication under discrete-time Markovian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider an open quantum system with (discrete-time) Markovian dynamics. Our task is to store information in the system in such a way that it can be retrieved perfectly, even after the system is left to evolve for an arbitrarily long time. We show that this is impossible for classical (resp. quantum) information precisely when the dynamics is mixing (resp. asymptotically entanglement breaking). Furthermore, we provide tight universal upper bounds on the minimum time after which any such dynamics `scrambles' the encoded information beyond the point of perfect retrieval. On the other hand, for dynamics that are not of this kind, we show that information must be encoded inside the peripheral space associated with the dynamics in order for it to be perfectly recoverable at any time in the future. This allows us to derive explicit formulas for the maximum amount of information that can be protected from noise in terms of the structure of the peripheral space of the dynamics.</description>
