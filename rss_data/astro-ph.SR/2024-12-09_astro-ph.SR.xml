      <title>Unveiling the Origins and Dynamics of the Hierarchical Triple Star System CN Lyn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we present a detailed analysis of CN Lyn, an overlooked triple star system, by combining spectroscopic data from the literature, photometric \textit{TESS} data, and kinematic techniques. We updated the fundamental parameters of the known eclipsing components in the system with high precision. The chemical composition of both eclipsing components (Aab) and the third component (B) in the system were calculated with great accuracy. According to our analysis the mass, radius, and metallicity of the eclipsing components are $1.166_{-0.012}^{+0.013}\,M_\odot$, $1.786_{-0.014}^{+0.013}\,R_\odot$, and $-0.78_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$ dex for Aa and $1.143_{-0.012}^{+0.013}\,M_\odot$, $1.651_{-0.013}^{+0.014}\,R_\odot$, and $-0.55_{-0.02}^{+0.03}$ dex for Ab. The pair's age is $3.89_{-0.10}^{+0.10}$ Gyr. The mass, radius, metallicity, and age for B are $0.85_{-0.23}^{+0.23}\,M_\odot$, $1.436_{-0.023}^{+0.026}\,R_\odot$, $-1.83_{-0.11}^{+0.09}$ dex, and $12.5_{-2.5}^{+2.5}$ Gyr, respectively. It is also found that the triple system (AabB) satisfies the stability criteria for the hierarchical triple system. Kinematic and Galactic orbital parameters of CN Lyn were obtained from the astrometric and spectroscopic data of the system. Dynamical orbital analyses, taking into account the ages of the component stars in the central binary system (A) show that the CN Lyn originated at the metal-poor edge of the Galactic disk. The third component of the system was found to be a member of the halo population in terms of age, $\alpha$ elements and metal abundance. Given the different chemical abundances and age of B compared to A, this suggests that the third component was captured by the central system in a region with weak gravitational interactions far beyond the Galactic disc.</description>

      <title>Going from 3D common-envelope simulations to fast 1D simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) methods for simulating the common-envelope (CE) phase offer advantages over three-dimensional (3D) simulations regarding their computational speed and feasibility. We present the 1D CE method from Bronner et al. (2024), including the results of the CE simulations of an asymptotic giant branch star donor. We further test this method in the massive star regime by computing the CE event of a red supergiant with a neutron-star mass and a black-hole mass companion. The 1D model can reproduce the orbital evolution and the envelope ejection from 3D simulations when choosing suitable values for the free parameters in the model. The best-fitting values differ from the expectations based on the low mass simulations, indicating that the free parameters depend on the structure of the giant star. The released recombination energy from hydrogen and helium helps to expand the envelope, similar to the low-mass CE simulations.</description>

      <title>New Ultracool Companions to Nearby White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a search for new ultracool companions to nearby white dwarfs using multiple methods, including the analysis of colors and examination of images in both the optical and the infrared. Through this process, we identified fifty-one previously unrecognized systems with candidate ultracool companions. Thirty-one of these systems are resolved in at least one catalog, and all but six are confirmed as co-moving companions via common proper motion and consistent parallax measurements (when available). We have followed up four co-moving companions with near-infrared spectroscopy and confirm their ultracool nature. The remaining twenty candidates are unresolved, but show clear signs of infrared excess which is most likely due to the presence of a cold, low-mass companion or a dusty circumstellar disk. Three of these unresolved systems have existing optical spectra that clearly show the presence of a cool stellar companion to the white dwarf primary via spectral decomposition. These new discoveries, along with our age estimates for the primary white dwarfs, will serve as valuable benchmark systems for future characterization of ultracool dwarfs.</description>

      <title>SDSS J100711.74+193056.2: A Candidate Common Motion Substellar Companion to the Nearest B-Type Star Regulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The L9 dwarf SDSS J100711.74+193056.2 is situated 7$^{\circ}$.5 north of the nearest B-type star Regulus (d = 24.3+-0.2 pc), part of a stellar quadruplet. The object is at similar distance (d = 21.9+-1.0 pc) as Regulus, with a 3D separation of 3.9+0.6-0.5 pc ($\sim$1.6 tidal radii from Regulus), and shares tangential motion within 2 km/s, hinting at a physical connection. Near-infrared spectroscopy with Keck/NIRES finds that SDSS J100711.74+193056.2 also has a comparable radial velocity as Regulus A and B, a metallicity similar to Regulus B, and a spectral morphology consistent with the estimated 1--2 Gyr total age of Regulus's close pre-white dwarf companion. Taken together, these observations indicate that SDSS J100711.74+193056.2 is a very widely-separated and potentially physically-bound companion to Regulus, with a binding energy and mass ratio comparable to other wide star-brown dwarf systems. It joins a growing list of brown dwarfs at the L dwarf/T dwarf transition with independent constraints on physical properties such as age and metallicity.</description>

      <title>The 100 pc White Dwarf Sample in the SDSS Footprint II. A New Look at the Spectral Evolution of White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We increase the spectroscopic completeness of the 100 pc white dwarf sample in the SDSS footprint with 840 additional spectra. Our spectroscopy is 86% complete for white dwarfs hotter than $T_{\rm eff}= 5000$ K, where H$\alpha$ remains visible and provides reliable constraints on the atmospheric composition. We identify 2108 DA white dwarfs with pure hydrogen atmospheres, and show that ultramassive DA white dwarfs with $M\geq1.1~M_{\odot}$ are an order of magnitude less common below 10,000 K. This is consistent with a fraction of them getting stuck on the crystallization sequence due to $^{22}$Ne distillation. In addition, there are no ultramassive DA white dwarfs with $M\geq1.1~M_{\odot}$ and $T_{\rm eff}\leq6000$ K in our sample, likely because Debye cooling makes them rapidly fade away. We detect a significant trend in the fraction of He-atmosphere white dwarfs as a function of temperature; the fraction increases from 9% at 20,000 K to 32% at 6000 K. This provides direct evidence of convective mixing in cool DA white dwarfs. Finally, we detect a relatively tight sequence of low-mass DQ white dwarfs in color-magnitude diagrams for the first time. We discuss the implications of this tight DQ sequence, and conclude with a discussion of the future prospects from the upcoming ULTRASAT mission and the large-scale multi-fiber spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>The lithium-rich giant stars puzzle: New observational trends for a general-mass-loss scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of one percent of lithium-rich giant stars among normal, lithium-poor giant stars continues to be poorly explained. By merging two catalogues, one containing 10,535 lithium-rich giant stars with lithium abundances ranging from 1.5 to 4.9 dex, and the other detecting infrared sources, we have found 421 clump giant stars and 196 first-ascending giant stars with infrared excesses indicating stellar mass losses. The clump stars are the most lithium-rich. Approximately 5.8 percent of these stars episodically lose mass in periods of approximately 10^4 years or less, while the remaining stars ceased their mass loss and maintained their lithium for nearly 10^7 years. We propose a scenario in which all giant stars with masses below two solar masses undergo prompt lithium enrichment with mass-ejection episodes. We suggest that mass loss results from internal angular-momentum transport. It is possible that a transitory instability, perhaps of magnetic origin, rapidly transports the nuclear material responsible for the lithium enrichment to the stellar surface and triggers shell ejections. Additionally, the strong mass loss in some lithium-rich stars during their evolution activates their chromospheres, as observed in ultraviolet spectra. Furthermore, intense episodical mass losses in these stages led to the observable formation of complex organic and inorganic particles, as detected in near-infrared spectra. In contrast to first-ascending giant stars, helium flashes during the clump can contribute to additional lithium enrichment alongside the aforementioned process. The combination of these two lithium sources may explain the much higher observed lithium abundances in clump stars, as well as their observed infrared excesses. If our scenario based on a universal and rapid lithium enrichment episode process is correct, it could explain the rarity of lithium-rich giant stars.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning application for stellar parameters determination: III- Denoising Procedure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this third paper in a series, we investigate the need of spectra denoising for the derivation of stellar parameters. We have used two distinct datasets for this work. The first one contains spectra in the range of 4450-5400 {\AA} at a resolution of 42000 and the second in the range of 8400-8800 {\AA} at a resolution of 11500. We constructed two denoising techniques, an autoencoder, and a Principal Component Analysis. Using random Gaussian noise added to synthetic spectra, we have trained a Neural Network to derive the stellar parameters Teff, log g, ve sin i, {\xi}t, and [M/H] of the denoised spectra. We find that, independently of the denoising technique, the stellar parameters accuracy values do not improve once we denoise the synthetic spectra. This is true with and without applying data augmentation to the stellar parameters Neural Network.</description>

      <title>HD 60435: The star that stopped pulsating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HD 60435 is a well-known rapidly oscillating (roAp) Ap star with a series of alternating even and odd degree modes, making it a prime asteroseismic target. It is also an oblique pulsator with rotational inclination, $i$, and magnetic/pulsation obliquity, $\beta$, such that both magnetic/pulsation poles are viewed over the rotation period, $P_{\rm rot} = 7.679696$ d, determined from rotational light variations. While some roAp stars have stable pulsation mode amplitudes over decades, HD 60435 is known to have amplitude variations on time scales as short as 1 d. We show from 5 yr of {\it TESS} observations that there is strong amplitude modulation on this short time scale with possible mode interactions. Most remarkably, HD 60435 stopped pulsating during the time span of the {\it TESS} observations. This is the first time that any pulsating star has been observed to cease pulsating entirely. That has implications for mode interaction, excitation and damping, and is relevant to the problem of why only some stars in many pulsation instability strips pulsate, while others do not. During a 24.45-d time span of the {\it TESS} data when there was mode stability for a dipole mode and a quadrupole mode, the oblique pulsator model constrained $i$ and $\beta$, which we used to model those modes with a magnetic pulsation model from which we determined a polar field strength of 4 kG, in good agreement with a known magnetic measurement. We modelled the frequency separations showing that they can constrain the global metallicity, something that is not possible from spectroscopy of the highly peculiar Ap atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Impact of Two-Population $\alpha$-particle Distributions on Plasma Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of weakly collisional plasmas is well represented by linear theory, and the generated waves play an essential role in the thermodynamics of these systems. The velocity distribution functions (VDF) characterizing kinetic particle behavior are commonly represented as a sum of anisotropic bi-Maxwellians. For the majority of in situ observations of solar wind plasmas enabled by heliospheric missions, a three bi-Maxwellian model is commonly applied for the ions, assuming that the VDF consists of a proton core, proton beam, and a single He ($\alpha$) particle population, each with their own density, bulk velocity, and anisotropic temperature. Resolving an $\alpha$-beam component was generally not possible due to instrumental limitations. The Solar Orbiter Solar Wind Analyser Proton and Alpha Sensor (SWA PAS) resolves velocity space with sufficient coverage and accuracy to routinely characterize secondary $\alpha$ populations consistently. This design makes the SWA PAS dataset ideal for examining effects of the $\alpha$-particle beam on the plasma's kinetic stability. We test the wave signatures observed in the magnetic field power spectrum at ion scales and compare them to the predictions from linear plasma theory, Doppler-shifted into the spacecraft reference frame. We find that taking into account the $\alpha$-particle beam component is necessary to predict the coherent wave signatures in the observed power spectra, emphasizing the importance of separating the $\alpha$-particle populations as is traditionally done for protons. Moreover, we demonstrate that the drifts of beam components are responsible for the majority of the modes that propagate in oblique direction to the magnetic field, while their temperature anisotropies are the primary source of parallel Fast Magnetosonic Modes in the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Uniform characterisation of an ensemble of main-sequence benchmark stars: effect of Gaia-based data on grid search models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inference of stellar parameters (such as radius and mass) through asteroseismic forward modelling depends on the number, accuracy, and precision of seismic and atmospheric constraints. ESA's Gaia space mission is providing precise parallaxes which yield an additional constraint to be included in the model grid search. Using a handful of main-sequence benchmark stars, we perform a uniform characterisation of these stars. We assess the accuracy and precision of stellar parameters inferred from grid-based searches when a Gaia-based luminosity is combined with different stellar constraints. We also examine the precision needed for an interferometric radius (model-independent radius) to have a significant contribution towards the determination of stellar mass in the optimisation process. Our findings show that more precise stellar masses are inferred for some stars when seismic and spectroscopic constraints are complemented with a Gaia-based luminosity, with a scatter varying from 1.9 per cent to 0.8 per cent. However, the inferred stellar radii are underestimated when compared to the interferometric radii and yield a scatter of $\sim$1.9 per cent. In addition, we demonstrate that a precisely measured interferometric radius ($\lesssim$ 1 per cent) when applied in the optimisation process yields a mass with a precision $\lesssim$ 1.5 per cent. Finally, we find that when only $l=0$ mode oscillation frequencies are available, robust masses and radii are still attainable. However, this requires precise and numerous $l=0$ mode oscillations frequencies ($&gt;$ 8) to be coupled with atmospheric constraints.</description>

      <title>Open Cluster Study Using $Gaia$ I:Membership and Cluster Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star clusters are interesting laboratories to study star formation, single and binary stellar evolution, and stellar dynamics. We have used the exquisite data from $Gaia$'s data release 3 (DR3) to study 21 relatively rich and nearby open clusters with member numbers ($N_{\rm{cl}}$)$&gt;500$. We have developed a non-parametric method to identify cluster members. Our method works well for clusters located in both sparse and crowded environments, hence, can be applied to a wide variety of star clusters. Since the member classification scheme does not make any assumptions on the expected distributions of potential cluster members, our method can identify members associated with clusters that are oddly shaped or have complex internal spatial or kinematic structures. In addition, since the membership determination does not depend on the proximity to any well-defined sequences on the color-magnitude diagram, this method easily identifies straggler members. Furthermore, for each of these clusters, we estimate essential cluster properties including age, metallicity, distance, and reddening using detailed Markov-Chain Monte Carlo parameter estimation. We report the full posteriors for these important cluster properties for all clusters in our study.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismic Structure Inversions of Main-Sequence Solar-like Oscillators with Convective Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroseismic inferences of main-sequence solar-like oscillators often rely on best-fit models. However, these models cannot fully reproduce the observed mode frequencies, suggesting that the internal structure of the model does not fully match that of the star. Asteroseismic structure inversions provide a way to test the interior of our stellar models. Recently, structure inversion techniques were used to study 12 stars with radiative cores. In this work, we extend that analysis to 43 main-sequence stars with convective cores observed by Kepler to look for differences in the sound speed profiles in the inner 30% of the star by radius. For around half of our stars, the structure inversions show that our models reproduce the internal structure of the star, where the inversions are sensitive, within the observational uncertainties. For the stars where our inversions reveal significant differences, we find cases where our model sound speed is too high and cases where our model sound speed is too low. We use the star with the most significant differences to explore several changes to the physics of our model in an attempt to resolve the inferred differences. These changes include using a different overshoot prescription and including the effects of diffusion, gravitational settling, and radiative levitation. We find that the resulting changes to the model structure are too small to resolve the differences shown in our inversions.</description>

      <title>X-ray/Radio Quasi-periodic Pulsations Associated with Plasmoids in Solar Flare Current Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmoids (or magnetic islands) are believed to play an important role in the onset of fast magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration during solar flares and eruptions. Direct imaging of flare current sheets and formation/ejection of multiple plasmoids in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images, along with simultaneous X-ray and radio observations, offers significant insights into the mechanisms driving particle acceleration in solar flares. Here we present direct imaging of the formation and ejection of multiple plasmoids in flare plasma/current sheets and associated quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) observed in X-ray and radio wavelengths, using observations from SDO/AIA, RHESSI, and Fermi GBM. These plasmoids propagate bidirectionally upward and downward along the flare current sheet beneath the erupting flux rope during two successive flares associated with confined/failed eruptions. The flux rope exhibits evidence of helical kink instability with formation and ejection of multiple plasmoids in the flare current sheet, as predicted in an MHD simulation of a kink-unstable flux rope. RHESSI X-ray images show double coronal sources (``loop-top" and higher coronal sources) located at both ends of the flare current/plasma sheet. Moreover, we detected an additional transient faint X-ray source (6-12 keV) located between the double coronal sources, which was co-spatial with multiple plasmoids in the flare current sheet. X-ray (soft and hard) and radio (decimetric) observations unveil QPPs (periods$\approx$10-s and 100-s) associated with the ejection and coalescence of plasmoids. These observations suggest that energetic electrons are accelerated during the ejection and coalescence of multiple plasmoids in the flare current sheet.</description>

      <title>proEQUIB: IDL Library for Plasma Diagnostics and Abundance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:1812.01605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emission lines emitted from gaseous nebulae carry valuable information about the physical conditions and chemical abundances of ionized gases in these objects, as well as the interstellar extinction. "proEQUIB" is a library containing several application programming interface (API) functions developed in the Interactive Data Language (IDL), which can be used for plasma diagnostics and abundance analysis of nebular spectra. This IDL library can also be used by the GNU Data Language (GDL), which is a free and open-source IDL compiler. This package includes several API functions to determine physical conditions and chemical abundances from collisionally excited lines (CEL) and recombination lines (RL), derive interstellar extinctions from Balmer lines, and deredden the observed fluxes. This IDL library heavily relies on the IDL Astronomy User's library and the IDL "AtomNeb" library. The API functions of this IDL library can easily be utilized for spatially-resolved studies of ionized gaseous nebulae observed using integral field spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Chemical Abundances in the Nuclear Star Cluster of the Milky Way: alpha-Element Trends and Their Similarities with the Inner Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A chemical characterization of the Galactic Center is essential for understanding its formation and structural evolution. Trends of alpha-elements, such as Mg, Si, and Ca, serve as powerful diagnostic tools, offering insights into star-formation rates and gas-infall history. However, high extinction has previously hindered such studies. In this study, we present a detailed chemical abundance analysis of M giants in the Milky Way's Nuclear Star Cluster (NSC), focusing on alpha-element trends with metallicity. High-resolution, near-infrared spectra were obtained using the IGRINS spectrograph on the Gemini South telescope for nine M giants. Careful selection of spectral lines, based on a solar-neighborhood control sample of 50 M giants, was implemented to minimize systematic uncertainties. Our findings show enhanced alpha-element abundances in the predominantly metal-rich NSC stars, consistent with trends in the inner bulge. The NSC stars follow the high-[alpha/Fe] envelope seen in the solar vicinity's metal-rich population, indicating a high star-formation rate. The alpha-element trends decrease with increasing metallicity, also at the highest metallicities. Our results suggest the NSC population likely shares a similar evolutionary history with the inner bulge, challenging the idea of a recent dominant star formation burst. This connection between the NSC and the inner-disk sequence suggests that the chemical properties of extragalactic NSCs of Milky Way type galaxies could serve as a proxy for understanding the host galaxies' evolutionary processes.</description>

      <title>Eta-Earth Revisited II: Deriving a Maximum Number of Earth-like Habitats in the Galactic Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Lammer et al. 2024, we defined Earth-like Habitats (EH) as rocky planets in the habitable zone of complex life (HZCL) on which Earth-like N$_2$-O$_2$-dominated atmospheres with minor amounts of CO$_2$ can exist and derived a formula for estimating their maximum number in the Galaxy. Here, we apply this formula by considering only requirements that are already scientifically quantifiable. By implementing models for star formation rate, initial mass function, and galactic mass distribution, we calculate the spatial distribution of disk stars as functions of stellar mass and birth age. We apply models for the GHZ and evaluate the thermal stability of Earth-like atmospheres with various CO$_2$ mixing ratios by implementing the newest stellar evolution and upper atmosphere models. In addition, we include the rocky exoplanet frequency, the availability of oceans and subaerial land, and the potential large moon requirement by evaluating their importance and implementing these criteria from minima to maxima values. We also discuss factors that are not yet scientifically quantifiable but may be requirements for EHs to evolve. We find that EHs are rare by obtaining maximum numbers of $2.5^{+71.6}_{-2.4}\times10^{5}$ and $0.6^{+27.1}_{-0.59}\times10^{5}$ planets that can potentially host N$_2$-Earth-like atmospheres with maximum CO$_2$ mixing ratios of 10\% and 1\%, respectively, implying that a minimum of $\sim 10^3 - 10^6$ rocky HZCL planets are needed for 1 EH to evolve. Their actual number, however, may be substantially lower as several requirements are not included in our model; this also implies ETIs are significantly rarer still. Our results illustrate that neither every star can host EHs, nor that each rocky HZCL planet evolves such that it may be able to host complex animal-like life. The Copernican Principle therefore cannot be applied to infer that such life is common in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Eta-Earth Revisited I: A Formula for Estimating the Maximum Number of Earth-like Habitats</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this hypothesis article, we discuss the basic requirements of planetary environments where aerobe organisms can grow and survive, including atmospheric limitations of millimeter-to-meter-sized biological animal life based on physical limits, and O$_2$, N$_2$, and CO$_2$ toxicity levels. By assuming that animal-like extraterrestrial organisms adhere to similar limits, we define Earth-like Habitats ($\eta_{\rm EH}$) as rocky exoplanets in the Habitable Zone of Complex Life that host N$_2$-O$_2$-dominated atmospheres with minor amounts of CO$_2$, at which advanced animal-like life can in principle evolve and exist. We then derive a new formula that can be used to estimate the maximum occurrence rate of such Earth-like Habitats in the Galaxy. This contains realistic probabilistic arguments that can be fine-tuned and constrained by atmospheric characterization with future space and ground-based telescopes. As an example, we briefly discuss two specific requirements feeding into our new formula that, although not quantifiable at present, will become scientifically quantifiable in the upcoming decades due to future observations of exoplanets and their atmospheres.</description>

      <title>The Survey of Surveys: machine learning for stellar parametrization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a machine learning method to assign stellar parameters (temperature, surface gravity, metallicity) to the photometric data of large photometric surveys such as SDSS and SKYMAPPER. The method makes use of our previous effort in homogenizing and recalibrating spectroscopic data from surveys like APOGEE, GALAH, or LAMOST into a single catalog, which is used to inform a neural network. We obtain spectroscopic-quality parameters for millions of stars that have only been observed photometrically. The typical uncertainties are of the order of 100K in temperature, 0.1 dex in surface gravity, and 0.1 dex in metallicity and the method performs well down to low metallicity, were obtaining reliable results is known to be difficult.</description>

      <title>C/O ratios in self-gravitating protoplanetary discs with dust evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elemental abundances, particularly the C/O ratio, are seen as a way to connect the composition of planetary atmospheres with planet formation scenario and the disc chemical environment. We model the chemical composition of gas and ices in a self-gravitating disc on timescales of 0.5\,Myr since its formation to study the evolution of C/O ratio due to dust dynamics and growth, and phase transitions of the volatile species. We use the thin-disc hydrodynamic code FEOSAD, which includes disc self-gravity, thermal balance, dust evolution and turbulent diffusion, and treats dust as a dynamically different and evolving component interacting with the gas. It also describes freeze-out, sublimation and advection of four volatile species: H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$ and CO. We demonstrate the effect of gas and dust substructures on the distribution of volatiles and C/O ratios, including the formation of multiple snowlines of one species, and point out the anticorrelation between dust-to-gas ratio and total C/O ratio emerging due to the contribution of oxygen-rich ice mantles. We identify time and spatial locations where two distinct trigger mechanisms for planet formation are operating and differentiate them by C/O ratio range: wide range of the C/O ratios of $0-1.4$ for streaming instability, and a much narrower range $0.3-0.6$ for gravitational instability (with the initial value of 0.34). This conclusion is corroborated by observations, showing that transiting exoplanets, which possibly experienced migration through a variety of disc conditions, have significantly larger spread of C/O in comparison with directly imaged exoplanets likely formed in gravitationally unstable outer disk regions. We show that the ice-phase C/O$\approx0.2-0.3$ between the CO, CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ snowlines corresponds to the composition of the Solar system comets, that represent primordial planetesimals.</description>

      <title>Novel Physics of Escaping Secondary Atmospheres May Shape the Cosmic Shoreline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations of cool, rocky exoplanets reveal a probable lack of thick atmospheres, suggesting prevalent escape of the secondary atmospheres formed after losing primordial hydrogen. Yet, simulations indicate that hydrodynamic escape of secondary atmospheres, composed of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, requires intense fluxes of ionizing radiation (XUV) to overcome the effects of high molecular weight and efficient line cooling. This transonic outflow of hot, ionized metals (not hydrogen) presents a novel astrophysical regime ripe for exploration. We introduce an analytic framework to determine which planets retain or lose their atmospheres, positioning them on either side of the cosmic shoreline. We model the radial structure of escaping atmospheres as polytropic expansions - power-law relationships between density and temperature driven by local XUV heating. Our approach diagnoses line cooling with a three-level atom model and incorporates how ion-electron interactions reduce mean molecular weight. Crucially, hydrodynamic escape onsets for a threshold XUV flux dependent upon the atmosphere's gravitational binding. Ensuing escape rates either scale linearly with XUV flux when weakly ionized (energy-limited) or are controlled by a collisional-radiative thermostat when strongly ionized. Thus, airlessness is determined by whether the XUV flux surpasses the critical threshold during the star's active periods, accounting for expendable primordial hydrogen and revival by volcanism. We explore atmospheric escape from Young-Sun Mars and Earth, LHS-1140 b and c, and TRAPPIST-1 b. Our modeling characterizes the bottleneck of atmospheric loss on the occurrence of observable Earth-like habitats and offers analytic tools for future studies.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Binaries Embedded Within Common Envelopes</title>

Abstract: Triple stellar systems allow us to study stellar processes that cannot be attained in binary stars. The evolutionary phases in which the stellar members undergo mass exchanges can alter the hierarchical layout of these systems. Yet, the lack of a self-consistent treatment of common-envelope (CE) in triple star-systems hinders the comprehensive understanding of their long-term fate. This letter examines the conditions predicted around binaries embedded within CEs using local 3D hydrodynamical simulations. We explore varying the initial binary separation, the flow Mach number, and the background stellar density gradients as informed by a wide array of CE conditions, including those invoked to explain the formation of the triple system hosting PSR J0337+1715. We find that the stellar density gradient governs the gaseous drag force, which determines the final configuration of the embedded binary. We observe a comparable net drag force on the center of mass but an overall reduction in the accretion rate of the binary compared to the single object case. We find that for most CE conditions, and in contrast to the uniform background density case, the binary orbital separation increases with time, softening the binary and preventing it from subsequently merging. We conclude that binaries spiraling within CEs become more vulnerable to be disrupted by tidal interactions. This can have profound implications on the final outcomes of triple star-systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.01193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic helicity, and more broadly magnetic field line topology, impose constraints on the plasma dynamics. Helically interlocked magnetic rings are in a non-trivial topological state. It is harder to bring them into a topologically trivial state than two rings that are not linked. This particular restriction has the consequence that helical plasmas exhibit increased stability in laboratory devices, in the Sun and in the intergalactic medium. Here we discuss how a magnetic field is stabilizing the plasma and preventing it from disruption by the presence of magnetic helicity. We present observational results, numerical experiments and analytical results that illustrate how helical magnetic fields strongly contribute to the long-term stability of some plasmas. We discuss several cases, such as that of solar corona, toroidal fusion devices, the galactic and extragalactic medium, with a special emphasis on extragalactic bubbles.</description>

      <title>Young O-rich Stars Migrated from the Outer Disc: Imprints of Sagittarius Accretion Event</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Milky Way underwent significant transformations in its early history, characterised by violent mergers and satellite galaxy accretion. However, recent observations reveal notable star formation events over the past 4 Gyr, likely triggered by perturbations from the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. Here, we present chemical signatures of this accretion event, using the [Fe/H] and [O/Fe] ratios of thin disc stars. In the normalised age-metallicity plane, we identify a discontinuous V-shape structure at z$_{\rm max}$ $&lt;$ 0.4 kpc in the local disc, interrupted by a star formation burst between 4 and 2 Gyr ago. This event is characterized by a significant increase in oxygen abundance, resulting in a distinct [O/Fe] gradient and the formation of young O-rich stars. These stars have larger birth radii, indicating formation in the outer disc followed by radial migration to the Solar neighbourhood. Simulations of late satellite infall suggest that the passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy may have contributed to the observed increase in oxygen abundance in the local disc.</description>

      <title>Difficulties of two exploding white dwarfs to account for type Ia supernovae with bimodal nebular emission profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a simple dynamical scheme to simulate the ejecta of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) scenarios with two exploding white dwarfs (WDs) and find that the velocity distribution of the ejecta has difficulties accounting for bimodal emission line profiles with a large separation between the two emission peaks. The essence of the dynamical code is in including the fact that the ejecta does not leave the system instantaneously. We find that the final separation velocity between the centers of masses of the two WDs' ejecta is ~80% of the pre-explosion WDs' orbital velocity, i.e., we find separation velocities of 4200-5400 km/s for two WDs of masses M1=M2=0.94 Mo. The lower separation velocities we find challenge scenarios with two exploding WDs to explain bimodal emission line profiles with observed velocity separations of up to ~7000 km/s. Only the mass in the ejecta of one WD with an explosion velocity lower than the separation velocity contributes to one peak of the bimodal profile; this is the inner ejecta. We find the inner ejecta to be only &lt;15% of the ejecta mass in energetic explosions. Less energetic explosions yield higher inner mass but lower separation velocities. We encourage searching for alternative explanations of bimodal line profiles.</description>

Abstract: We present a pattern emerging from stellar obliquity measurements in single-star systems: planets with high planet-to-star mass ratios ($M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$$&gt;$ $2\times10^{-3}$) -- such as super-Jupiters, brown dwarf companions, and M-dwarfs hosting Jupiter-like planets -- tend to be aligned, even around hot stars. This alignment represents a 3.7$\sigma$ deviation from the obliquity distribution observed in systems with lower mass ratios ($M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$$&lt;$ $2\times10^{-3}$), which predominantly include Jupiters and sub-Saturns. The only known outlier system, XO-3, exhibits misalignment confirmed via our newly collected Rossiter-McLaughlin effect measurement ($\lambda=41.8^{+2.1}_{-2.0}$ degrees). However, the relatively large $\textit{Gaia}$ Renormalized Unit Weight Error (RUWE) of XO-3 suggests that it may harbor an undetected binary companion, potentially contributing to its misalignment. Given that tidal realignment mechanisms are weak for hot stars, the observed alignment in high $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ systems is likely $\textit{primordial}$ rather than resulting from tidal interactions. One possible explanation is that only dynamically isolated planets can continue accreting gas and evolve into super-Jupiters while maintaining their primordial alignment. Conversely, planets formed in compact configurations may be unable to grow beyond the gap-opening mass, for which our work suggests an empirical boundary $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$$=$ $2\times10^{-3}$, identified between aligned high $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ systems and misaligned low $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ systems, with dynamical instabilities contributing to the diverse spin-orbit misalignments observed in the latter.</description>
