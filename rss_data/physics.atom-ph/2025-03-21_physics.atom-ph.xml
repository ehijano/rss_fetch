      <title>Thermal resonance-enhanced transparency in room temperature Rydberg gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the enhanced optical transmission in the coherent, off-resonant excitation of Rydberg atom gases at room temperature via a two-photon process. Here thermal resonance-enhanced transparency (TRET) is induced when the detuning of the two lasers is adjusted to compensate the atomic thermal-motion-induced energy shifts, i.e. single and two-photon Doppler shifts. We show that the atomic velocity is mapped into the transmission of the probe fields, which can be altered by independently and selectively exciting different velocity groups through sweeping the detuning. The maximal transmission in TRET is about 8 times higher than that under the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Utilizing the TRET effect, we enhance the sensitivity of a Rydberg microwave receiver to be 28.7~nVcm$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1/2}$, ultimately reaching a factor of 2.1 of the EIT case. When atoms of separate velocity groups are excited simultaneously by multiple sets of detuned lasers, the receiver sensitivity further increases, which is linearly proportional to the number of the velocity groups. Our study paves a way to exploit light-matter interaction via the TRET, and contributes to current efforts in developing quantum sensing, primary gas thermometry, and wireless communication with room-temperature atomic gases.</description>

      <title>Redirection and Reshaping of Intense Extreme-Ultraviolet Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal to control short-wavelength radiation for the investigation and manipulation of ultrafast dynamics in quantum systems coevolves with the growing availability of extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) and x-ray sources from high-harmonic generation and free-electron lasers. Here, we present an XUV spatio-spectral phase modulator based on an intense XUV laser beam propagating through an optically thick resonant target, introducing dispersion profile variations around the resonance both perpendicular to and along the laser propagation direction. The resulting dipole radiation gets spectrally reshaped and becomes more divergent as compared to the original beam in the far field. As an experimental demonstration, the intense-XUV-induced double-peak off-axis structure in the far-field spectrum obtained at the Free-Electron Laser in Hamburg (FLASH) shows indications of the underlying XUV-driven Rabi dynamics and resonant pulse propagation effects. The presented work highlights a ubiquitous phenomenon occurring when an intense laser beam passes through a resonant medium.</description>

      <title>Electron-Impact Excitation of Zirconium I-III in support of Neutron Star Merger Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observation and analysis of kilonovae (KNe) spectra as a result of neutron star mergers require accurate and complete atomic structure and collisional data for interpretation. Ideally, the atomic datasets for elements predicted to be abundant in the ejecta should be experimentally calibrated. For near-neutral ion stages of Zirconium in particular, the A-values and the associated excitation/de-excitation rates are required from collision calculations built upon accurate structure models. The atomic orbitals required to perform the structure calculations may be calculated using a Multi-Configuration-Dirac-Fock (MCDF) approximation implemented within the General Relativistic Atomic Structure Package (GRASP0). Optimized sets of relativistic atomic orbitals are then imported into electron-impact excitation collision calculations. A relativistic R-matrix formulation within the Dirac Atomic R-matrix Code (DARC) is employed to compute collision strengths, which are subsequently Maxwellian convolved to produce excitation/de-excitation rates for a wide range of electron temperatures. These atomic datasets subsequently provide the foundations for non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) collisional-radiative models. In this work all these computations have been carried out for the first three ion stages of Zirconium (Zr I-III) with the data further interfaced with collisional-radiative and radiative transfer codes to produce synthetic spectra which can be compared with observation.</description>

      <title>Nonpertubative Many-Body Theory for the Two-Dimensional Hubbard Model at Low Temperature: From Weak to Strong Coupling Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the theoretical study of two-dimensional systems, difficulties emerge as that quantum phase transitions at zero temperature cause low- and high-temperature scenarios to belong to different branches, while the Mermin-Wagner theorem prohibits continuous symmetry breaking at finite temperatures, excluding a Landau phase transition marked by a critical temperature $T_c$. In many-body theory, fundamental symmetries like Ward-Takahashi identity (WTI), Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem (FDT), and Pauli-repulsive principle must be satisfied, yet widely-used approximate theories struggle to meet them simultaneously. We introduce a symmetrization theory that, by using spurious broken phases from approximate theories, can naturally generate different low- and high-temperature branches. Employing the GW method beyond mean-field and the covariance scheme, which strictly satisfy WTI and FDT, we numerically show that the violation of Pauli-repulsive principle is significantly less than that in mean-field, and further restore Pauli-repulsive principle without breaking WTI and FDT. By calculating symmetrized one-body Green's function and two-body correlation function and comparing them with accurate results from Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), we demonstrate its numerical accuracy at low temperatures and strong coupling. This symmetrization theory can be easily applied to other two-dimensional systems at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Computing Classical Escape Rates from Periodic Orbits in Chaotic Hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When placed in parallel magnetic and electric fields, the electron trajectories of a classical hydrogen atom are chaotic. The classical escape rate of such a system can be computed with classical trajectory Monte Carlo techniques, but these computations require enormous numbers of trajectories, provide little understanding of the dynamical mechanisms involved, and must be completely rerun for any change of system parameter, no matter how small. We demonstrate an alternative technique to classical trajectory Monte Carlo computations, based on classical periodic orbit theory. In this technique, escape rates are computed from a relatively modest number (a few thousand) of periodic orbits of the system. One only needs the orbits' periods and stability eigenvalues. A major advantage of this approach is that one does not need to repeat the entire analysis from scratch as system parameters are varied; one can numerically continue the periodic orbits instead. We demonstrate the periodic orbit technique for the ionization of a hydrogen atom in applied parallel electric and magnetic fields. Using fundamental theories of phase space geometry, we also show how to generate nontrivial symbolic dynamics for acquiring periodic orbits in physical systems. A detailed analysis of heteroclinic tangles and how they relate to bifurcations in periodic orbits is also presented.</description>

      <title>Rovibrational Overtone and Combination Bands of the HCNH+ Ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectra of vibrational overtone and combination bands from vibrational ground state of HCNH+ were measured using an action spectroscopy technique with active background suppression in a cryogenic 22 pole radio frequency ion trap apparatus. Spectroscopic constants for the upper vibrational levels of the transitions were determined with vibrational band origins being 6846.77981(90) $\text{cm}^{-1}$ ($2\nu_1$ , NH stretch), 6640.47624(43) $\text{cm}^{-1}$ ($\nu_1 + \nu_2$), 6282.03578(63) $\text{cm}^{-1}$ ($2\nu_2$, CH stretch), and 6588.4894(20) $\text{cm}^{-1}$ ($\nu_2 + \nu_3 + 2\nu_5^0$). State of the art ab initio VCI calculations up to 10000 $\text{cm}^{-1}$ complement the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Probing classical and quantum violations of the equivalence of active and passive gravitational mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equivalence of active and passive (EAP) gravitational mass is one of the most fundamental principles of gravity. But in contrast to the usual equivalence of inertial and (passive) gravitational mass, the EAP has not received much attention. Here we revisit this principle and show how it can be used to probe quantum gravity in laboratory-based experiments. We first examine how the dynamics under EAP violations affects classical systems and show that new laboratory tests can be performed, to improve over the current experimental bounds and to test new manifestations of EAP violations. We then extend the analysis to the quantum domain, where quantized energy contributes to mass and the EAP principle can thus shed light on how quantum source masses would gravitate. We show that experiments with cold polar molecules, and future experiments with nuclear atomic clocks, can test the quantum EAP in a regime where quantum gravity phenomenology could become relevant. Our results open new opportunities for fundamental tests of gravity in high-precision laboratory experiments that can shed light on foundational principles of gravity and its interface with quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Many exact area-law scar eigenstates in the nonintegrable PXP and related models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present new, highly non-trivial area-law exact zero-energy eigenstates of the one-dimensional (1D) PXP and related models. We formulate sufficient conditions for a matrix product state to represent an exact zero-energy eigenstate of a given 1D kinetically constrained model and use them to prove our new states. We also demonstrate that all previously known exact eigenstates of PXP-type models satisfy these conditions, and, in fact, can be directly deduced from them. We discuss and demonstrate a remarkably effective general numerical technique for discovering finite-bond-dimension eigenstates residing in degenerate subspaces of a broad class of Hamiltonians. Our results highlight a previously unrecognized structure characteristic of the exponentially large nullspaces in kinetically constrained models, suggesting the possibly of extensively many increasingly complex area-law zero-energy eigenstates in the thermodynamic limit. The important implications of these emergent exact eigenstates for the general thermalization phenomenology are exemplified by one of the states introduced in this work, which we propose is a member of the primary $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum many-body scar tower responsible for long-lived revivals in the Rydberg atom chain experiment.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Intraspecies Scattering Length on the Observability of Resonances in Efimov-Unfavored Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efimov resonances in the three-body loss rate have been observed in ultracold heteronuclear gases near interspecies Feshbach resonances. However, the intraspecies scattering length $a_\text{BB}$ has been assumed to have a negligible effect on the overall Efimov scenario, namely, on the locations of the Efimov resonances $a_{-}^{(n)}$ and, consequently, on the three-body parameter (3BP). The present Letter analyzes the influence of $a_\text{BB}$ on the Efimov resonance positions $a_{-}^{(n)}$, particularly the 3BP, in Efimov-unfavored systems. Using van der Waals interactions described by separable $s$-wave potentials, the unitarity energy spectrum ($|a_\text{BX}|\rightarrow\infty$) and the Efimov resonance positions $a_{-}^{(n)}$ for $^{23}\text{Na}_2^{40}\text{K}$ are mapped out in $a_\text{BB}$. It is found that both the magnitude and sign of $a_\text{BB}$ can significantly impact the resonances $a_{-}^{(n)}$ in Efimov-unfavored systems, with the 3BP taking an observable value when $a_\text{BB}&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>Beyond the semiclassical approximation in atom interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a quantum perturbative approach to evaluating the phase shift of an atom interferometer in a weakly anharmonic trap. This provides a simple way to evaluate quantum corrections to the standard semi-classical approximation. The calculation benefits from the use of generalized coherent states for a basis. We find that the form of the semi-classical approximation remains valid to first order in the anharmonic perturbation, but that phase differences arise because the trajectory of a quantum wave packet will generally deviate from that of a classical particle. The quantum correction to the phase is a factor $\ell^2/A^2$ smaller than the semi-classical perturbation itself, where $\ell$ is the quantum harmonic oscillator length scale and $A$ is the classical amplitude of the motion. We provide analytical results for one-dimensional perturbations of power three through six in the position coordinate.</description>
