      <title>Electric Vehicles Limit Equitable Access to Essential Services During Blackouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) link mobility and electric power availability, posing a risk of making transportation unavailable during blackouts. We develop a computational framework to quantify the impact of EVs on mobility and access to services and find that existing access issues are exacerbated by EVs. Our results demonstrate that larger batteries reduce mobility constraints but their effectiveness is dependent on the geographic distribution of services and households. We explore the trade-offs between mobility and quality-of-life improvements presented by Vehicle-to-Grid technologies and the feasibility and trade-offs of public charging infrastructure as a solution to access inequalities. Equitable access to essential services (e.g. supermarkets, schools, parks, etc.) is the most important aspect of community resilience and our results show vehicle electrification can hinder access to essential services unless properly incorporated into policy and city-scale decision-making.</description>

      <title>Vulnerability and Efficiency Assessment of Complex Power Grids Using Current-Flow Line Centralities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The centrality measure (CM) is one of the most fundamental metrics for evaluating the efficiency and vulnerability analysis of complex power grids (CPGs). Despite an abundance of different CMs for individual nodes, there are only a few metrics available in the literature to measure the centrality of individual lines. We propose here the current-flow (CF) line CMs to identify the ranking of lines, where each set of lines is associated with a different level of importance. We then find the CMs using effective resistance and apply it to identify the important lines in a commonly used IEEE 118-bus network. Finally, the efficiency and vulnerability of CPG are analyzed to validate the proposed concepts.</description>

      <title>Harmony in the Australian Domain Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we use for the first time a systematic approach in the study of harmonic centrality at a Web domain level, and gather a number of significant new findings about the Australian web. In particular, we explore the relationship between economic diversity at the firm level and the structure of the Web within the Australian domain space, using harmonic centrality as the main structural feature. The distribution of harmonic centrality values is analyzed over time, and we find that the distributions exhibit a consistent pattern across the different years. The observed distribution is well captured by a partition of the domain space into six clusters; the temporal movement of domain names across these six positions yields insights into the Australian Domain Space and exhibits correlations with other non-structural characteristics. From a more global perspective, we find a significant correlation between the median harmonic centrality of all domains in each OECD country and one measure of global trust, the WJP Rule of Law Index. Further investigation demonstrates that 35 countries in OECD share similar harmonic centrality distributions. The observed homogeneity in distribution presents a compelling avenue for exploration, potentially unveiling critical corporate, regional, or national insights.</description>

      <title>Understanding Human-COVID-19 Dynamics using Geospatial Big Data: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed human life. To mitigate the pandemic's impacts, different regions implemented various policies to contain COVID-19 and residents showed diverse responses. These human responses in turn shaped the uneven spatial-temporal spread of COVID-19. Consequently, the human-pandemic interaction is complex, dynamic, and interconnected. Delineating the reciprocal effects between human society and the pandemic is imperative for mitigating risks from future epidemics. Geospatial big data acquired through mobile applications and sensor networks have facilitated near-real-time tracking and assessment of human responses to the pandemic, enabling a surge in researching human-pandemic interactions. However, these investigations involve inconsistent data sources, human activity indicators, relationship detection models, and analysis methods, leading to a fragmented understanding of human-pandemic dynamics. To assess the current state of human-pandemic interactions research, we conducted a synthesis study based on 67 selected publications between March 2020 and January 2023. We extracted key information from each article across six categories, e.g., research area and time, data, methodological framework, and results and conclusions. Results reveal that regression models were predominant in relationship detection, featured in 67.16% of papers. Only two papers employed spatial-temporal models, notably underrepresented in the existing literature. Studies examining the effects of policies and human mobility on the pandemic's health impacts were the most prevalent, each comprising 12 articles (17.91%). Only 3 papers (4.48%) delved into bidirectional interactions between human responses and the COVID-19 spread. These findings shed light on the need for future research to spatially and temporally model the long-term, bidirectional causal relationships within human-pandemic systems.</description>

      <title>A Methodology of Cooperative Driving based on Microscopic Traffic Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a methodology of cooperative driving in vehicular traffic, in which for short-time traffic prediction rather than one of the statistical approaches of artificial intelligence (AI), we follow a qualitative different microscopic traffic prediction approach developed recently [Phys. Rev. E 106 (2022) 044307]. In the microscopic traffic prediction approach used for the planning of the subject vehicle trajectory, no learning algorithms of AI are applied; instead, microscopic traffic modeling based on the physics of vehicle motion is used. The presented methodology of cooperative driving is devoted to application cases in which microscopic traffic prediction without cooperative driving cannot lead to a successful vehicle control and trajectory planning. For the understanding of the physical features of the methodology of cooperative driving, a traffic city scenario has been numerically studied, in which a subject vehicle, which requires cooperative driving, is an automated vehicle. Based on microscopic traffic prediction, in the methodology first a cooperating vehicle(s) is found; then, motion requirements for the cooperating vehicle(s) and characteristics of automated vehicle control are predicted and used for vehicle motion; to update predicted characteristics of vehicle motion, calculations of the predictions of motion requirements for the cooperating vehicle and automated vehicle control are repeated for each next time instant at which new measured data for current microscopic traffic situation are available. With the use of microscopic traffic simulations, the evaluation of the applicability of this methodology is illustrated for a simple case of unsignalized city intersection, when the automated vehicle wants to turn right from a secondary road onto the priority road.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics of Human Perception, Behaviour and Decision-Making: A Do-It-Yourself Model Kit for Modelling Optical Illusions and Opinion Formation in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the surface, behavioural science and physics seem to be two disparate fields of research. However, a closer examination of problems solved by them reveals that they are uniquely related to one another. Exemplified by the theories of quantum mind, cognition and decision-making, this unique relationship serves as the topic of this chapter. Surveying the current academic journal papers and scholarly monographs, we present an alternative vision of the role of quantum mechanics in the modern studies of human perception, behaviour and decision-making. To that end, we mostly aim to answer the 'how' question, deliberately avoiding complex mathematical concepts but developing a technically simple computational code that the readers can modify to design their own quantum-inspired models. We also present several practical examples of the application of the computation code and outline several plausible scenarios, where quantum models based on the proposed do-it-yourself model kit can help understand the differences between the behaviour of individuals and social groups.</description>

      <title>Flow-Acoustics: Theory and Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The urgent need for transitioning to green energy solutions, particularly in the context of house heating and urban redensification, has brought the issue of fan noise aeroacoustics investigations to the forefront. As societies worldwide strive to mitigate climate change and reduce carbon emissions, adopting sustainable heating technologies such as air heat pumps has gained significant traction. In Germany, renowned for its commitment to environmental sustainability, the "TA L\"arm" regulations, derived from the "Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz," impose stringent limits on noise levels both inside and outside buildings across various applications. These regulations delineate permissible noise levels during daytime (6 AM to 10 PM) and nighttime (10 PM to 6 AM), with particular emphasis on protecting residential areas with low noise limits. Moreover, the noise limits prescribed for indoor environments are even more stringent. Given the necessity of maintaining acoustic comfort and quality of life, compliance with these regulations necessitates meticulous attention to noise generation sources, especially those associated with heating and ventilation systems. Consequently, understanding and mitigating fan noise through aeroacoustic investigations is essential to ensure the successful adoption and integration of green energy solutions in residential and urban settings. In the following, an experimental benchmark for a low-pressure rise axial fan (FAN-01) is presented, and several prediction methods of the sound pressure and sound power are evaluated.</description>

      <title>A Strategy Transfer and Decision Support Approach for Epidemic Control in Experience Shortage Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epidemic outbreaks can cause critical health concerns and severe global economic crises. For countries or regions with new infectious disease outbreaks, it is essential to generate preventive strategies by learning lessons from others with similar risk profiles. A Strategy Transfer and Decision Support Approach (STDSA) is proposed based on the profile similarity evaluation. There are four steps in this method: (1) The similarity evaluation indicators are determined from three dimensions, i.e., the Basis of National Epidemic Prevention &amp; Control, Social Resilience, and Infection Situation. (2) The data related to the indicators are collected and preprocessed. (3) The first round of screening on the preprocessed dataset is conducted through an improved collaborative filtering algorithm to calculate the preliminary similarity result from the perspective of the infection situation. (4) Finally, the K-Means model is used for the second round of screening to obtain the final similarity values. The approach will be applied to decision-making support in the context of COVID-19. Our results demonstrate that the recommendations generated by the STDSA model are more accurate and aligned better with the actual situation than those produced by pure K-means models. This study will provide new insights into preventing and controlling epidemics in regions that lack experience.</description>

      <title>Effects of group size and noise on cooperation in population evolution of dynamic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a large population, the agents temporally form group of the Public Goods Game (PGG) one after another, and size of one group is randomly distributed at $g\in [g_l,g_h]$. Players in it have two strategies to be chosen to cooperate, or to defect for playing the PGG. Based on this structure we investigate the evolution of cooperation in PGG as a function of the noise level underlying strategy adoptions with the group size distribution. In the process of the evolution, the payoffs of cooperators(defectors) have related to the strategy selection implemented by the death-birth process. With a smaller group size $g$, different noise value $K$ induces different dynamic behavior with the increase of multiplication factor $r$. These cooperative behavior can be analytically solved. For a greater group size $g$, the system finally evolve to the bistable state(AllC and hybrid state with cooperators and defectors)starting from different initial concentrations of cooperation. The numerical computation also fit well with the simulation results. We focus on the bistable phenomenon in the equilibrium for a given value of $K$ and a greater group size when the intrusion of one C(D)-player into D(C)-population is investigated from upwards(downwards) branch after experiencing a unstable cooperative evolution. Here, the hysteresis phenomenon can be observed. Further, when one D-player invades into the C-population, the critical value $r_c$ can be obtained in the simulation and the mathematical relationship between the critical value $r_c$ and noise $K$ is analysed.</description>

      <title>Delayed interactions in the noisy voter model through the periodic polling mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of delayed interactions on the stationary distribution of the noisy voter model. We assume that the delayed interactions occur through the periodic polling mechanism and replace the original instantaneous two-agent interactions. In our analysis, we require that the polling period aligns with the delay in announcing poll outcomes. As expected, when the polling period is relatively short, the model with delayed interactions is almost equivalent to the original model. As the polling period increases, oscillatory behavior emerges, but the model with delayed interactions still converges to stationary distribution. The stationary distribution resembles a Beta-binomial distribution, with its shape parameters scaling with the polling period. The observed scaling behavior is non-monotonic. Namely, the shape parameters peak at some intermediate polling period.</description>
