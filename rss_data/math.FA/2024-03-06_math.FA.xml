      <title>Complex structure that admits complete Nevanlinna-Pick spaces of Hardy type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will characterize those sets, over which every irreducible complete Nevanlinna-Pick space enjoys that its multiplier and supremum norms coincide. Moreover, we will prove that, if there exists an irreducible complete Nevanlinna-Pick space of holomorphic functions on a reduced complex space $X$ whose multiplier algebra is isometrically equal to the algebra of bounded holomorphic functions (we will say that such a space is of Hardy type in this paper), then $X$ must be a Riemann surface.</description>

      <title>Dilation estimates for Wiener amalgam spaces of Orlicz type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend dilation properties of Wiener amalgam spaces when the local and global componenets are Lebesgue spaces to a more general setting of Orlicz spaces. We recover the result of Cordero and Nicola when restricted to Lebesgue spaces. In addition, we prove continuity of the Zak transform on Wiener amalgam spaces with Orlicz spaces as their local components.</description>

      <title>Characterization of ($\alpha$,$\alpha$)-derivation on $B(X)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a Banach algebra and $B(X)$ be the set of all bounded linear operators on $X$. Suppose that $\alpha: B(X) \rightarrow B(X)$ is an automorphism. We say that a mapping $\delta$ from $B(X)$ into itself is derivable at $G \in B(X)$ if $\delta(G) = \alpha(A)\delta(B) + \delta(A)\alpha(B)$ for all $A, B \in B(X)$ with $AB = G$. We say that an element $G \in B(X)$ is an $(\alpha,\alpha)$-all derivable point of $B(X)$ if every $(\alpha,\alpha)$-derivable mapping $\delta$ at G is an $(\alpha,\alpha)$-derivation. In this paper, we show that every $(\alpha,\alpha)$-derivable mapping at a nonzero element in $B(X)$ is an $(\alpha,\alpha)$-derivation.</description>

      <title>Koopman operators with intrinsic observables in rigged reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for estimating the Koopman operator defined on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and its spectra. We propose an estimation method, what we call Jet Dynamic Mode Decomposition (JetDMD), leveraging the intrinsic structure of RKHS and the geometric notion known as jets to enhance the estimation of the Koopman operator. This method refines the traditional Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) in accuracy, especially in the numerical estimation of eigenvalues. This paper proves JetDMD's superiority through explicit error bounds and convergence rate for special positive definite kernels, offering a solid theoretical foundation for its performance. We also delve into the spectral analysis of the Koopman operator, proposing the notion of extended Koopman operator within a framework of rigged Hilbert space. This notion leads to a deeper understanding of estimated Koopman eigenfunctions and capturing them outside the original function space. Through the theory of rigged Hilbert space, our study provides a principled methodology to analyze the estimated spectrum and eigenfunctions of Koopman operators, and enables eigendecomposition within a rigged RKHS. We also propose a new effective method for reconstructing the dynamical system from temporally-sampled trajectory data of the dynamical system with solid theoretical guarantee. We conduct several numerical simulations using the van der Pol oscillator, the Duffing oscillator, the H\'enon map, and the Lorenz attractor, and illustrate the performance of JetDMD with clear numerical computations of eigenvalues and accurate predictions of the dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hyperbolicity, Stability and Expansivity for Operators on Locally Convex Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the notions of (generalized) hyperbolicity, topological stability and (uniform) topological expansivity for operators on locally convex spaces. We prove that every generalized hyperbolic operator on a locally convex space has the finite shadowing property. Contrary to what happens in the Banach space setting, hyperbolic operators on Fr\'echet spaces may fail to have the shadowing property, but we find additional conditions that ensure the validity of the shadowing property. Assuming that the space is sequentially complete, we prove that generalized hyperbolicity implies the strict periodic shadowing property, but we also show that the hypothesis of sequential completeness is essential. We show that operators with the periodic shadowing property on topological vector spaces have other interesting dynamical behaviors, including the fact that the restriction of such an operator to its chain recurrent set is topologically mixing and Devaney chaotic. We prove that topologically stable operators on locally convex spaces have the finite shadowing property and the strict periodic shadowing property. As a consequence, topologically stable operators on Banach spaces have the shadowing property. Moreover, we prove that generalized hyperbolicity implies topological stability for operators on Banach spaces. We prove that uniformly topologically expansive operators on locally convex spaces are neither Li-Yorke chaotic nor topologically transitive. Finally, we characterize the notion of topological expansivity for weighted shifts on Fr\'echet sequence spaces. Several examples are provided.</description>

      <title>SIC-POVMs from Stark Units: Dimensions n^2+3=4p, p prime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence problem for maximal sets of equiangular lines (or SICs) in complex Hilbert space of dimension $d$ remains largely open. In a previous publication (arXiv:2112.05552) we gave a conjectural algorithm for how to construct a SIC if $d = n^2+3 = p$, a prime number. Perhaps the most surprising number-theoretical aspect of that algorithm is the appearance of Stark units in a key role: a single Stark unit from a ray class field extension of a real quadratic field serves as a seed from which the SIC is constructed. The algorithm can be modified to apply to all dimensions $d = n^2+3$. Here we focus on the case when $d= n^2+3 = 4p$, $p$ prime, for two reasons. First, special measures have to be taken on the Hilbert space side of the problem when the dimension is even. Second, the degrees of the relevant ray class fields are `smooth' in a sense that facilitates exact calculations. As a result the algorithm becomes easier to explain. We give solutions for seventeen different dimensions of this form, reaching $d = 39604$. Several improvements relative to our previous publication are reported, but we cannot offer a proof that the algorithm works for any dimensions where it has not been tested.</description>

      <title>Weighted floating functions and weighted functional affine surface areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to introduce the new concept of weighted floating functions associated with log concave or $s$-concave functions. This leads to new notions of weighted functional affine surface areas. Their relation to more traditional versions of functional affine surface areas as well as to the classical affine surface areas for convex bodies is discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>A leaf as a convex domain containing eigenvalues of an endomorphism on a real inner product space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a leaf which is a domain in the closure $\overline{\mathfrak{H}}=\mathfrak{H}\cup\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\}$ of the complex upper half plane $\mathfrak{H} = \{z\in\mathbb{C}\mid{\mathrm{Im}\,} z&gt;0\}$ for any endomorphism of a real inner product space. If the dimension of the base space is at least 3, the leaf is convex on the Poincar\'e metric, and contains all eigenvalues with nonnegative imaginary part. If the endomorphism is normal, the leaf is the minimum convex domain in $\overline{\mathfrak{H}}$ containing all eigenvalues with nonnegative imaginary part. We apply the geometric properties of a leaf to the operator norm and to some algebraic properties on endomorphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalization of continuous biframe in a Hilbert space is introduced and a few examples are discussed. Some characterizations and algebraic properties of this biframe are given. Here we also construct various types of continuous K-biframes with the help of a bounded linear operator. Relationship between continuous K-biframe and quotient operator is established. Finally, we define continuous K-biframe for the tensor products of Hilbert spaces and give an example.</description>

      <title>On Left and Right Semi-B-Fredholm Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To complete the study of Fredholm type operators of [10] and [11], we define in this paper the classes of left and right semi-B-Fredholm operators (Definition 3.1). Then, we prove that an operator $T \in L(X), X$ being a Banach space, is a left( resp. right) semi-B-Fredholm operator if and only if $T$ is the direct sum of left(resp. right) semi-Fredholm operator and a nilpotent one. This result extend the earlier characterization of B-Fredholm operators as the direct sum of a Fredholm operator and a nilpotent one obtained in [4,Theorem 2.7].</description>
