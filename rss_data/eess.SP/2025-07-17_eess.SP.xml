      <title>Differential Communication in Channels with Mobility and Delay Spread using Zak-OTFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zak-transform based orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS) is a delay-Doppler (DD) domain modulation scheme in which the signal processing is carried out in the DD domain. The channel when viewed in the DD domain is predictable. However, even with Zak-OTFS, pilots need to be sent periodically, albeit at a lower rate. In this paper, we propose a differential communication scheme for Zak-OTFS systems that alleviates the need for periodic pilot transmission. Towards this, we analytically show that the detected data can be used as a pilot and that the channel estimate obtained from the detected data can enable further detection enabling the "differential" aspect of the communication. Specifically, we leverage the prediction capability of the DD channel in Zak-OTFS to use the channel estimate (obtained from detected data symbols treated as pilots) in the previous instant to detect data in the next instant and propagate this forward. The advantages are two fold. First, it allows the data symbols to enjoy higher energy since the energy that would otherwise be required for pilot symbols can also be allocated to data symbols. Second, it allows for full spectral efficiency compared to point or embedded pilots. Comparison with the full spectral efficiency achieving spread pilot scheme shows that the proposed method achieves better bit-error rate at lower complexity.</description>

      <title>Achieving Robust Channel Estimation Neural Networks by Designed Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel estimation is crucial in cognitive communications, as it enables intelligent spectrum sensing and adaptive transmission by providing accurate information about the current channel state. However, in many papers neural networks are frequently tested by training and testing on one example channel or similar channels. This is because data-driven methods often degrade on new data which they are not trained on, as they cannot extrapolate their training knowledge. This is despite the fact physical channels are often assumed to be time-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and limited computing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and computing resources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters. This motivates us to design offline-trained neural networks that can perform robustly over wireless channels, but without any actual channel information being known at design time. In this paper, we propose design criteria to generate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that after training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error (MSE) on new and previously unseen channels. Therefore, neural network solutions require no prior channel information or parameters update for real-world implementations. Based on the proposed design criteria, we further propose a benchmark design which ensures intelligent operation for different channel profiles. To demonstrate general applicability, we use neural networks with different levels of complexity to show that the generalization achieved appears to be independent of neural network architecture. From simulations, neural networks achieve robust generalization to wireless channels with both fixed channel profiles and variable delay spreads.</description>

      <title>A Novel Data Augmentation Strategy for Robust Deep Learning Classification of Biomedical Time-Series Data: Application to ECG and EEG Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing need for accurate and unified analysis of diverse biological signals, such as ECG and EEG, is paramount for comprehensive patient assessment, especially in synchronous monitoring. Despite advances in multi-sensor fusion, a critical gap remains in developing unified architectures that effectively process and extract features from fundamentally different physiological signals. Another challenge is the inherent class imbalance in many biomedical datasets, often causing biased performance in traditional methods. This study addresses these issues by proposing a novel and unified deep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across different signal types. Our method integrates a ResNet-based CNN with an attention mechanism, enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy: time-domain concatenation of multiple augmented variants of each signal to generate richer representations. Unlike prior work, we scientifically increase signal complexity to achieve future-reaching capabilities, which resulted in the best predictions compared to the state of the art. Preprocessing steps included wavelet denoising, baseline removal, and standardization. Class imbalance was effectively managed through the combined use of this advanced data augmentation and the Focal Loss function. Regularization techniques were applied during training to ensure generalization. We rigorously evaluated the proposed architecture on three benchmark datasets: UCI Seizure EEG, MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, and PTB Diagnostic ECG. It achieved accuracies of 99.96%, 99.78%, and 100%, respectively, demonstrating robustness across diverse signal types and clinical contexts. Finally, the architecture requires ~130 MB of memory and processes each sample in ~10 ms, suggesting suitability for deployment on low-end or wearable devices.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Urban GNSS Positioning Reliability via Conservative Satellite Selection Using Unanimous Voting Across Multiple Machine Learning Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In urban environments, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning is often compromised by signal blockages and multipath effects caused by buildings, leading to significant positioning errors. To address this issue, this study proposes a robust enhancement of zonotope shadow matching (ZSM)-based positioning by employing a conservative satellite selection strategy using unanimous voting across multiple machine learning classifiers. Three distinct models - random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and support vector machine (SVM) - were trained to perform line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) classification based on global positioning system (GPS) signal features. A satellite is selected for positioning only when all classifiers unanimously agree on its classification and their associated confidence scores exceed a threshold. Experiments with real-world GPS data collected in dense urban areas demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the positioning success rate and the receiver containment rate, even with imperfect LOS/NLOS classification. Although a slight increase in the position bound was observed due to the reduced number of satellites used, overall positioning reliability was substantially enhanced, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in urban GNSS environments.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Tradeoff for Sensing and Communication in Cell-Free MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies optimal joint beamforming (BF) for joint sensing and communication (JSAC) in small-scale cell-free MIMO (CF-MIMO) systems. While prior works have explored JSAC optimization using methods such as successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR), many of these approaches either lack global optimality or require additional rank-reduction steps. In contrast, we propose an SDR-based optimization framework that guarantees globally optimal solutions without post-processing. To benchmark its performance, we introduce a standalone BF strategy that dedicates each access point (AP) exclusively to either communication or sensing. The proposed formulation builds upon a general multi-user system model, enabling future extensions beyond the single-user setting. Overall, our framework offers a globally optimal and computationally efficient BF design, providing valuable insights for the development of next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Multiple-Mode Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing with Index Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), a promising multicarrier technique utilizing chirp signals, has been envisioned as an effective solution for high-mobility communication scenarios. In this paper, we develop a multiple-mode index modulation scheme tailored for AFDM, termed as MM-AFDM-IM, which aims to further improve the spectral and energy efficiencies of AFDM. Specifically, multiple constellation alphabets are selected for different chirp-based subcarriers (chirps). Aside from classical amplitude/phase modulation, additional information bits can be conveyed by the dynamic patterns of both constellation mode selection and chirp activation, without extra energy consumption. Furthermore, we discuss the mode selection strategy and derive an asymptotically tight upper bound on the bit error rate (BER) of the proposed scheme under maximum-likelihood detection. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the superior performance of MM-AFDM-IM compared to conventional benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Unmodulated Visible Light Positioning: A Deep Dive into Techniques, Studies, and Future Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visible Light Positioning (VLP) has emerged as a promising technology for next-generation indoor positioning systems (IPS), particularly within the scope of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Its attractiveness stems from leveraging existing lighting infrastructures equipped with light-emitting diodes (LEDs), enabling cost-efficient deployments and achieving high-precision positioning accuracy in the centimeter-todecimeter range. However, widespread adoption of traditional VLP solutions faces significant barriers due to the increased costs and operational complexity associated with modulating LEDs, which consequently reduces illumination efficiency by lowering their radiant flux. To address these limitations, recent research has introduced the concept of unmodulated Visible Light Positioning (uVLP), which exploits Light Signals of Opportunity (LSOOP) emitted by unmodulated illumination sources such as conventional LEDs. This paradigm offers a cost-effective, lowinfrastructure alternative for indoor positioning by eliminating the need for modulation hardware and maintaining lighting efficiency. This paper delineates the fundamental principles of uVLP, provides a comparative analysis of uVLP versus conventional VLP methods, and classifies existing uVLP techniques according to receiver technologies into intensity-based methods (e.g., photodiodes, solar cells, etc.) and imaging-based methods. Additionally, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy categorizing techniques into demultiplexed and undemultiplexed approaches. Within this structured framework, we critically review current advancements in uVLP, discuss prevailing challenges, and outline promising research directions essential for developing robust, scalable, and widely deployable uVLP solutions.</description>

      <title>Angle Estimation of a Single Source with Massive Uniform Circular Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the directions of arrival (DOAs) of incoming plane waves is an essential topic in array signal processing. Widely adopted uniform linear arrays can only provide estimates of source azimuth. Thus, uniform circular arrays (UCAs) are attractive in that they can provide $360^{\circ}$ azimuthal coverage and additional elevation angle information. Considering that with a massive UCA, its polar angles of array sensors can approximately represent azimuth angles over $360^{\circ}$ using angle quantization, a simple two-dimensional DOA estimation method for a single source is proposed. In this method, the quantized azimuth angle estimate is obtained by only calculating and comparing a number of covariances, based on which the elevation angle estimate is then obtained by an explicit formula. Thus, the proposed method is computationally simple and suitable for real-time signal processing. Numerical results verify that the proposed method can obtain azimuth as well as elevation angle estimates and the estimates can be used as starting points of multidimensional searches for methods with higher accuracy. Additionally, the proposed method can still work in the presence of nonuniform noise.</description>

      <title>Multifrequency system model for multiport time-modulated scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing scatterers in communication engineering, such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and backscatter systems, requires physically consistent models for accurate performance prediction. A multiport model, which also accounts for structural scattering, has been developed for non-periodic scatterers. However, many emerging systems operate at multiple frequencies or generate intermodulation harmonics, particularly when incorporating space-time modulation (STM) or dynamic load control. These functionalities demand advanced modeling approaches capable of capturing scattering behavior across several frequencies and directions simultaneously. This article extends a multiport S-parameters-based model for predicting the scattering properties of multifrequency operating structures. The model extends the applicability of convenient S-matrix models to time-modulated multiport structures. Unlike known approaches, this model incorporates structural scattering, mutual coupling, the possibility of non-digital modulation, and non-periodic configurations, enabling precise analysis and optimization for a broad range of communication and sensing systems. Validation against experimental results for a space-time modulated scattering structure demonstrates the accuracy and practical applicability of the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Disentangling coincident cell events using deep transfer learning and compressive sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate single-cell analysis is critical for diagnostics, immunomonitoring, and cell therapy, but coincident events - where multiple cells overlap in a sensing zone - can severely compromise signal fidelity. We present a hybrid framework combining a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) with compressive sensing (CS) to disentangle such overlapping events in one-dimensional sensor data. The FCN, trained on bead-derived datasets, accurately estimates coincident event counts and generalizes to immunomagnetically labeled CD4+ and CD14+ cells in whole blood without retraining. Using this count, the CS module reconstructs individual signal components with high fidelity, enabling precise recovery of single-cell features, including velocity, amplitude, and hydrodynamic diameter. Benchmarking against conventional state-machine algorithms shows superior performance - recovering up to 21% more events and improving classification accuracy beyond 97%. Explinability via class activation maps and parameterized Gaussian template fitting ensures transparency and clinical interpretability. Demonstrated with magnetic flow cytometry (MFC), the framework is compatible with other waveform-generating modalities, including impedance cytometry, nanopore, and resistive pulse sensing. This work lays the foundation for next-generation non-optical single-cell sensing platforms that are automated, generalizable, and capable of resolving overlapping events, broadening the utility of cytometry in translational medicine and precision diagnostics, e.g. cell-interaction studies.</description>

      <title>Robust Resource Allocation for Pinching-Antenna Systems under Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna technology has lately showcased its promising capability for reconfiguring wireless propagation environments, especially in high-frequency communication systems like millimeter-wave and terahertz bands. By dynamically placing the antenna over a dielectric waveguide, line-of-sight (LoS) connections can be made to significantly improve system performance. Although recent research have illustrated the advantages of pinching-antenna-assisted designs, they mainly presuppose complete knowledge of user locations -- an impractical assumption in real-world systems. To address this issue, the robust resource allocation in a multi-user pinching antenna downlink system with uncertain user positions is investigated, aiming to minimize total transmit power while satisfying individual outage probability constraints. First, we address the single-user case, deriving the optimal pinching antenna position and obtaining the corresponding power allocation using a bisection method combined with geometric analysis. We then extend this solution to the multi-user case. In this case, we optimize the pinching antenna position using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to handle the resulting non-convex and non-differentiable optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional fixed-antenna systems and validate the effectiveness of the PSO-based antenna placement strategy under location uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Mapping Emotions in the Brain: A Bi-Hemispheric Neural Model with Explainable Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances have shown promise in emotion recognition from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals by employing bi-hemispheric neural architectures that incorporate neuroscientific priors into deep learning models. However, interpretability remains a significant limitation for their application in sensitive fields such as affective computing and cognitive modeling. In this work, we introduce a post-hoc interpretability framework tailored to dual-stream EEG classifiers, extending the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) approach to accommodate structured, bi-hemispheric inputs. Our method adapts LIME to handle structured two-branch inputs corresponding to left and right-hemisphere EEG channel groups. It decomposes prediction relevance into per-channel contributions across hemispheres and emotional classes. We apply this framework to a previously validated dual-branch recurrent neural network trained on EmoNeuroDB, a dataset of EEG recordings captured during a VR-based emotion elicitation task. The resulting explanations reveal emotion-specific hemispheric activation patterns consistent with known neurophysiological phenomena, such as frontal lateralization in joy and posterior asymmetry in sadness. Furthermore, we aggregate local explanations across samples to derive global channel importance profiles, enabling a neurophysiologically grounded interpretation of the model's decisions. Correlation analysis between symmetric electrodes further highlights the model's emotion-dependent lateralization behavior, supporting the functional asymmetries reported in affective neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Robust Beamforming Design for Secure Near-Field ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter investigates the robust beamforming design for a near-field secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system with multiple communication users (CUs) and targets, as well as multiple eavesdroppers. Taking into account the channel uncertainty constraints, we maximize the minimum sensing beampattern gain for targets, subject to the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for each CU and the maximum SINR constraint for each eavesdropper, as well as the ISAC transmit power constraint. The formulated design problem is non-convex. As a low-complexity suboptimal solution, we first apply the S-Procedure to convert semi-infinite channel uncertainty constraints into linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and then use the state-of-the-art sequential rank-one constraint relaxation (SROCR) method to address the rank-one constraints. The numerical results show that the proposed ISAC beamforming design scheme outperforms the existing semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and other baseline schemes, and it significantly enhances security and robustness for near-field ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>From Neck to Head: Bio-Impedance Sensing for Head Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present NeckSense, a novel wearable system for head pose tracking that leverages multi-channel bio-impedance sensing with soft, dry electrodes embedded in a lightweight, necklace-style form factor. NeckSense captures dynamic changes in tissue impedance around the neck, which are modulated by head rotations and subtle muscle activations. To robustly estimate head pose, we propose a deep learning framework that integrates anatomical priors, including joint constraints and natural head rotation ranges, into the loss function design. We validate NeckSense on 7 participants using the current SOTA pose estimation model as ground truth. Our system achieves a mean per-vertex error of 25.9 mm across various head movements with a leave-one-person-out cross-validation method, demonstrating that a compact, line-of-sight-free bio-impedance wearable can deliver head-tracking performance comparable to SOTA vision-based methods.</description>

      <title>Wireless Multi-Port Sensing: Virtual-VNA-Enabled De-Embedding of an Over-the-Air Fixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a multi-port-backscatter-modulation technique to determine, over the air (OTA), the scattering parameters of a linear, passive, time-invariant multi-port device under test (DUT). A set of "not-directly-accessible" (NDA) antennas can be switched between being terminated by the DUT or by a specific, known, tunable load network. Waves can be radiated and captured via a distinct set of "accessible" antennas that couple OTA to the NDA antennas. First, we characterize the OTA fixture between the accessible antennas' ports and the DUT's ports. We achieve this based on our recently introduced "Virtual VNA" technique; specifically, we connect the NDA antennas to the tunable load network and measure the scattering at the accessible antennas' ports for various configurations of the tunable load network. Second, we connect the NDA antennas to the DUT and measure the scattering at the accessible antennas' ports. Third, we de-embed the OTA fixture to retrieve the DUT's scattering parameters. We experimentally validate our technique at 2.45 GHz for 1-port DUTs and 5-port DUTs, considering a rich-scattering OTA fixture inside a reverberation chamber. We systematically study the influence of the number of accessible antennas and various conceivable simplifications in terms of the system model as well as the properties of the tunable load network. Our wireless multi-port sensing technique can find applications in areas like RFID and wireless bioelectronics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Scattering Matrix Framework for Modeling Implantable Antennas in Multilayered Spherical Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified and efficient framework for analyzing antennas embedded in spherically stratified media -- a model broadly applicable to implantable antennas in biomedical systems and radome-enclosed antennas in engineering applications. The proposed method decouples the modeling of the antenna and its surrounding medium by combining the antenna's free-space generalized scattering matrix (GSM) with a set of extended spherical scattering operators (SSOs) that rigorously capture the electromagnetic interactions with multilayered spherical environments. This decoupling enables rapid reevaluation under arbitrary material variations without re-simulating the antenna, offering substantial computational advantages over traditional dyadic Green's function (DGF)-based MoM approaches. The framework supports a wide range of spherical media, including radially inhomogeneous and uniaxially anisotropic layers. Extensive case studies demonstrate excellent agreement with full-wave and DGF-based solutions, confirming the method's accuracy, generality, and scalability. Code implementations are provided to facilitate adoption and future development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, a pinching antenna (PA)-aided scheme for establishing a secure integrated sensing and communication system (ISAC) is investigated. The underlying system comprises a dual-functional radar communication (DFRC) base station (BS) linked to multiple waveguides to serve several downlink users while sensing a set of malicious targets in a given area. The PA-aided BS aims at preserving communication confidentiality with the legitimate users while being able to detect malicious targets. One objective of the proposed scheme is to optimize the PA locations, based on which an optimal design of the legitimate signal beamforming and artificial noise covariance matrices is provided to maximize the network's sensing performance, subject to secrecy and total power constraints. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme through numerical examples and compare that against a traditional DFRC ISAC system with a uniform linear array of half-wavelength-spaced antennas. We show that the proposed scheme outperforms the baseline PA-aided scheme with equidistant PAs by $3$ dB in terms of illumination power, while it can provide gains of up to $30$ dB of the same metric against a traditional ISAC system with half-wavelength-space uniform linear arrays.</description>

      <title>Fast Variational Block-Sparse Bayesian Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00442v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a variational Bayesian (VB) implementation of block-sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL) to compute proxy probability density functions (PDFs) that approximate the posterior PDFs of the weights and associated hyperparameters in a block-sparse linear model, resulting in an iterative algorithm coined variational BSBL (VA-BSBL). The priors of the hyperparameters are selected to belong to the family of generalized inverse Gaussian distributions. This family contains as special cases commonly used hyperpriors. Inspired by previous work on classical sparse Bayesian learning (SBL), we investigate the update stage in which the proxy PDFs of a single block of weights and of its associated hyperparameter are successively updated, while keeping the proxy PDFs of the other parameters fixed. This stage defines a nonlinear first-order recurrence relation for the mean of the proxy PDF of the hyperparameter. By iterating this relation "ad infinitum" we obtain a criterion that determines whether the so-generated sequence of hyperparameter means converges or diverges. Incorporating this criterion into the VA-BSBL algorithm yields a fast implementation, coined fast-BSBL (F-BSBL), which achieves a two-order-of-magnitude runtime improvement. We further identify the range of the parameters of the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution which result in an inherent pruning procedure that switches off "weak" components in the model, which is necessary to obtain sparse results. Lastly, we show that expectation-maximization (EM)-based and VB-based implementations of BSBL are identical methods. Thus, we extend a well-known result from classical SBL to BSBL. Consequently, F-BSBL and BSBL using coordinate ascent to maximize the marginal likelihood coincide. These results provide a unified framework for interpreting existing BSBL methods.</description>

      <title>Globally Optimal Movable Antenna-Enhanced multiuser Communication: Discrete Antenna Positioning, Motion Power Consumption, and Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) represent a promising paradigm to enhance the spatial degrees of freedom of conventional multi-antenna systems by dynamically adapting the positions of antenna elements within a designated transmit area. In particular, by employing electro-mechanical MA drivers, the positions of the MA elements can be adjusted to shape a favorable spatial correlation for improving system performance. Although preliminary research has explored beamforming designs for MA systems, the intricacies of the power consumption and the precise positioning of MA elements are not well understood. Moreover, the assumption of perfect CSI adopted in the literature is impractical due to the significant pilot overhead and the extensive time to acquire perfect CSI. To address these challenges, we model the motion of MA elements through discrete steps and quantify the associated power consumption as a function of these movements. Furthermore, by leveraging the properties of the MA channel model, we introduce a novel CSI error model tailored for MA systems that facilitates robust resource allocation design. In particular, we optimize the beamforming and the MA positions at the BS to minimize the total BS power consumption, encompassing both radiated and MA motion power while guaranteeing a minimum required SINR for each user. To this end, novel algorithms exploiting the branch and bound (BnB) method are developed to obtain the optimal solution for perfect and imperfect CSI. Moreover, to support practical implementation, we propose low-complexity algorithms with guaranteed convergence by leveraging successive convex approximation (SCA). Our numerical results validate the optimality of the proposed BnB-based algorithms. Furthermore, we unveil that both proposed SCA-based algorithms approach the optimal performance within a few iterations, thus highlighting their practical advantages.</description>

      <title>Rate Splitting Multiple Access for RIS-aided URLLC MIMO Broadcast Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of modern wireless communication systems is typically limited by interference. The impact of interference can be even more severe in ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) use cases. A powerful tool for managing interference is rate splitting multiple access (RSMA), which encompasses many multiple-access technologies like non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), spatial division multiple access (SDMA), and broadcasting. Another effective technology to enhance the performance of URLLC systems and mitigate interference is constituted by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). This paper develops RSMA schemes for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) RIS-aided broadcast channels (BCs) based on finite block length (FBL) coding. We show that RSMA and RISs can substantially improve the spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) of MIMO RIS-aided URLLC systems. Additionally, the gain of employing RSMA and RISs noticeably increases when the reliability and latency constraints are more stringent. Furthermore, RISs impact RSMA differently, depending on the user load. If the system is underloaded, RISs are able to manage the interference sufficiently well, making the gains of RSMA small. However, when the user load is high, RISs and RSMA become synergetic.</description>

Abstract: Quantitative acoustic microscopy (QAM) is a cutting-edge imaging modality that leverages very high-frequency ultrasound to characterize the acoustic and mechanical properties of biological tissues at microscopic resolutions. Radio-frequency echo signals are digitized and processed to yield two-dimensional maps. This paper introduces a weighted Hankel-based spectral method with a reweighting strategy to enhance robustness with regard to noise and reduce unreliable acoustic parameter estimates. Additionally, we derive, for the first time in QAM, Cram\'er-Rao bounds to establish theoretical performance benchmarks for acoustic parameter estimation. Simulations and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperform standard autoregressive approach, particularly under challenging conditions. These advancements promise to improve the accuracy and reliability of tissue characterization, enhancing the potential of QAM for biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Polarization Domain of the IOS for Enhanced Full-Dimensional Transmission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent omni-surface (IOS), capable of providing service coverage to mobile users (MUs) in a reflective and refractive manner, has recently attracted widespread attention. However, the performance of power-domain IOS-assisted systems is limited by the intimate coupling between the refraction and reflection behavior of IOS elements. In this paper, we introduce the concept of dual-polarized IOS-assisted communication to overcome this challenge. By employing the polarization domain in the design of IOS, full independent refraction and reflection modes can be delivered. We consider a downlink dual-polarized IOS-aided system while also accounting for the leakage between different polarizations. To maximize the sum rate, we formulated a joint base station (BS) digital and IOS analog beamforming problem and proposed an iterative algorithm to solve the nonconvex program. Simulation results validate that dual-polarized IOS significantly enhances the performance than that of the power-domain one.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Multi-IRS Aided Multiple Operator Systems at mmWave Frequencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are envisioned to enhance the performance of mmWave wireless systems. In practice, multiple mobile operators (MO) coexist in an area and provide simultaneous and independent services to user-equipments (UEs) on different frequency bands. Then, if each MO deploys an IRS to enhance its performance, the IRSs also alter the channels of UEs of other MOs. In this context, this paper addresses the following questions: can an MO still continue to control its IRS independently of other MOs and IRSs? Is joint optimization of IRSs deployed by different MOs and inter-MO cooperation needed? To that end, by considering the mmWave bands, we first derive the ergodic sum spectral efficiency (SE) in a $2$-MO system for the following schemes: 1) joint optimization of an overall phase angle of the IRSs with MO cooperation, 2) MO cooperation via time-sharing, and 3) no cooperation between the MOs. We find that even with no cooperation between the MOs, the performance of a given MO is not degraded by the presence of an out-of-band (OOB) MO deploying and independently controlling its own IRS. On the other hand, the SE gain obtained at a given MO using joint optimization and cooperation over the no-cooperation scheme decreases inversely with the number of elements in the IRS deployed by the other MO. We generalize our results to a multiple MO setup and show that the gain in the sum-SE over the no-cooperation case increases at least linearly with the number of OOB MOs. Finally, we numerically verify our findings and conclude that every MO can independently operate and tune its IRS; cooperation via optimizing an overall phase only brings marginal benefits in practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) offer remarkable spatial flexibility but face significant challenges in acquiring high-resolution channel state information (CSI), leading to considerable overhead. To address this issue, we propose CANet, a robust deep learning model for channel extrapolation in FAS. CANet combines context-adaptive modeling with a cross-scale attention mechanism and is built on a ConvNeXt v2 backbone to improve extrapolation accuracy for unobserved antenna ports. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a novel spatial amplitude perturbation strategy, inspired by frequency-domain augmentation techniques in image processing. This motivates the incorporation of a Fourier-domain loss function, capturing frequency-domain consistency, alongside a spectral structure consistency loss that reinforces learning stability under perturbations. Our simulation results demonstrate that CANet outperforms benchmark models across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels.</description>

      <title>DSSD: Efficient Edge-Device LLM Deployment and Collaborative Inference via Distributed Split Speculative Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing but face critical deployment challenges in device-edge systems due to resource limitations and communication overhead. To address these issues, collaborative frameworks have emerged that combine small language models (SLMs) on devices with LLMs at the edge, using speculative decoding (SD) to improve efficiency. However, existing solutions often trade inference accuracy for latency or suffer from high uplink transmission costs when verifying candidate tokens. In this paper, we propose Distributed Split Speculative Decoding (DSSD), a novel architecture that not only preserves the SLM-LLM split but also partitions the verification phase between the device and edge. In this way, DSSD replaces the uplink transmission of multiple vocabulary distributions with a single downlink transmission, significantly reducing communication latency while maintaining inference quality. Experiments show that our solution outperforms current methods, and codes are at: https://github.com/JasonNing96/DSSD-Efficient-Edge-Computing</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12096v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce token communications (TokCom), a large model-driven framework to leverage cross-modal context information in generative semantic communications (GenSC). TokCom is a new paradigm, motivated by the recent success of generative foundation models and multimodal large language models (GFM/MLLMs), where the communication units are tokens, enabling efficient transformer-based token processing at the transmitter and receiver. In this paper, we introduce the potential opportunities and challenges of leveraging context in GenSC, explore how to integrate GFM/MLLMs-based token processing into semantic communication systems to leverage cross-modal context effectively at affordable complexity, present the key principles for efficient TokCom at various layers in future wireless networks. In a typical image semantic communication setup, we demonstrate a significant improvement of the bandwidth efficiency, achieved by TokCom by leveraging the context information among tokens. Finally, the potential research directions are identified to facilitate adoption of TokCom in future wireless networks.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a supervised training algorithm for learning stochastic resource allocation policies with generative diffusion models (GDMs). We formulate the allocation problem as the maximization of an ergodic utility function subject to ergodic Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. Given samples from a stochastic expert policy that yields a near-optimal solution to the constrained optimization problem, we train a GDM policy to imitate the expert and generate new samples from the optimal distribution. We achieve near-optimal performance through the sequential execution of the generated samples. To enable generalization to a family of network configurations, we parameterize the backward diffusion process with a graph neural network (GNN) architecture. We present numerical results in a case study of power control.</description>

Abstract: Token communications (TokCom) is an emerging generative semantic communication concept that reduces transmission rates by using context and multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based token processing, with tokens serving as universal semantic units across modalities. In this paper, we propose a semantic multiple access scheme in the token domain, referred to as token domain multiple access (ToDMA), where a large number of devices share a token codebook and a modulation codebook for source and channel coding, respectively. Specifically, each transmitter first tokenizes its source signal and modulate each token to a codeword. At the receiver, compressed sensing is employed first to detect active tokens and the corresponding channel state information (CSI) from the superposed signals. Then, the source token sequences are reconstructed by clustering the token-associated CSI across multiple time slots. In case of token collisions, some active tokens cannot be assigned and some positions in the reconstructed token sequences are empty. We propose to use pre-trained MLLMs to leverage the context, predict masked tokens, and thus mitigate token collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ToDMA framework for both text and image transmission tasks, achieving significantly lower latency compared to context-unaware orthogonal communication schemes, while also delivering superior distortion and perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art context-unaware non-orthogonal communication methods.</description>
