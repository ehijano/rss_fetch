      <title>Bifurcations of unstable eigenvalues for Stokes waves derived from conserved energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address Euler's equations for irrotational gravity waves in an infinitely deep fluid rewritten in conformal variables. Stokes waves are traveling waves with the smooth periodic profile. In agreement with the previous numerical results, we give a rigorous proof that the zero eigenvalue bifurcation in the linearized equations of motion for co-periodic perturbations occurs at each extremal point of the energy function versus the steepness parameter, provided that the wave speed is not extremal at the same steepness. We derive the normal form for the unstable eigenvalues and, assisted with numerical approximation of its coefficients, we show that the new unstable eigenvalues emerge only in the direction of increasing steepness.</description>

      <title>Kinks of fractional $\phi^4$ models: existence, uniqueness, monotonicity, stability, and sharp asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work we construct kink solutions for different (parabolic and wave) variants of the fractional $\phi^4$ model, in both the sub-Laplacian and super-Laplacian setting. We establish existence and monotonicity results (for the sub - Laplacian case), along with sharp asymptotics which are corroborated through numerical computations. Importantly, in the sub-Laplacian regime, we provide the explicit and numerically verifiable spectral condition, which guarantees uniqueness for odd kinks. We check numerically the relevant condition to confirm the uniqueness of such solutions. In addition, we show asymptotic stability for the stationary kinks in the parabolic setting and also, the spectral stability for the traveling kinks in the corresponding wave equation.</description>

      <title>Event Soliton Formation in Mixed Energy-Momentum Gaps of Nonlinear Spacetime Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the formation of a novel soliton, termed event soliton, in nonlinear photonic spacetime crystals (STCs). In these media, simultaneous spatiotemporal periodic modulation of the dielectric constant generates mixed frequency (${\omega}$) and wavevector (k) gaps. Under Kerr nonlinearity, the event solitons emerge as fully localized entities in both spacetime and energy-momentum domains, providing a tangible demonstration of the concept of event in relativity. The ${\omega}$k-gap mixture arises from the coexistence and competition between time reflected and Bragg reflected waves due to the spatiotemporal modulation. We propose a new partial differential equation to capture various spatiotemporal patterns and present numerical simulations to validate our theoretical predictions, reflecting a three-way balance among k-gap opening, ${\omega}$-gap opening, and nonlinearity. Our work opens avenues for fundamental studies and fosters experimental prospects for implementing spacetime crystals in both time-varying photonics and periodically driven condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>New exact spatially localized solutions of the (3 + 1) -dimensional nonlinear non-dissipative quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity equation for an exponential atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New exact spatially localized stationary solutions against the background of a zonal flow are found for the (3+1)-dimensional nonlinear non-dissipative quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity equation, which describes Rossby waves and vortices in an exponential atmosphere. In total, three solutions are presented. The nonlinear boundary conditions with a flat bottom and a rigid lid generate an infinite discrete set of baroclinic modes for each solution. The solutions show the possibility of existence of baroclinic dipoles in the exponential atmosphere, similar to baroclinic dipoles in the ocean. It is shown that: a) a pair of vortices in the baroclinic dipole appears and disappears when the velocity of stationary motion changes; b) the baroclinic dipoles show the ability to transfer warm or cold air depending on the polarity of the vortices in the dipole.</description>

      <title>Coherent pulse interactions in mode-locked semiconductor lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of multipulse solutions in mode-locked lasers in presence of time-delayed feedback stemming, e.g., from reflections upon optical elements, and carrier dynamics. We demonstrate that the dynamics of such a high dimensional problem can be successfully described by some effective equations of motion for the pulses' phases and positions. Analyzing the reduced vector field permits disclosing a highly complex dynamics where coherent and incoherent interactions compete. The latter lead to regimes in which pulses can be equidistant or non-equidistant and also have different phase relations. Multi-stability between regimes is also observed as well as emerging limit cycles and global heteroclinic bifurcations in phase space.</description>

      <title>Synthetic half-integer magnetic monopole and single-vortex dynamics in spherical Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles are crucial in explaining the quantization of electric charges and quantum Hall effects, while artificially creating a minimal magnetic monopole in experiments remains a challenge. Here, we come up with a flexible way to simulate a half-integer-type monopole in Bose gases and investigate the induced vortex dynamics on a sphere. We list the possible experiment parameter settings for different isotopes and discuss their experimental feasibility. With the assumption of a rigid monopole-vortex structure, we analytically predict the vortex trajectory in an external magnetic field. We then confirm the result by numerically solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which employs two gauges simultaneously (the Wu-Yang approach) to prevent singularity in the one-gauge method when a monopole is present. The study offers significant insight into the characteristics of monopoles and vortices, facilitating avenues for experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Traveling spatially localized convective structures in an inclined porous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple stationary, localized structures were recently found for inclined porous medium convection with constant-temperature boundaries. We analyze traveling asymmetric, localized convective structures, consisting of 1 to 5 pulses, in a 2D inclined porous layer with fixed temperature at the bottom and an imperfectly conducting boundary at the top, such that midplane reflection symmetry is broken. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) are performed with different Biot numbers at the top boundary. The drift velocity $c$ of pulses is measured for different values of the symmetry parameter $\kappa\geq0$ based on the Biot number, with perfect midplane reflection symmetry and $c=0$ at $\kappa=0$. In small domains, the drift velocity $c&gt;0$ (upslope), increases monotonically with $\kappa$, while in large domains $c$ changes sign depending on parameters. We show that pulse tails, controlling interactions, depend on the dominant spatial eigenvalues, whose real part is closest to zero, with a transition at $\kappa_c&gt;0$: below $\kappa_c$, both dominant eigenvalues are complex, and the tails are oscillatory. Above $\kappa_c$, the dominant spatial eigenvalue with a positive real part becomes real, and the downslope tail transitions from oscillatory to monotonic. Below $\kappa_c$, bound states with different numbers of pulses exist whose collisions are studied. Well above $\kappa_c$, adjacent pulses repel each other, spreading out and becoming equispaced in the domain. A reduced model is proposed based on the interaction via tails of adjacent pulses, reproducing the repulsion and collisions from DNS. The model shows that the transition from bound states to equidistant spreading occurs when the monotonic/oscillatory tails have the same slope. This study elucidates the motion of localized patterns in moderate-Rayleigh number convection in an inclined porous layer with an imperfectly conducting boundary.</description>
