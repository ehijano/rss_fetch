      <title>Two-field theory for phase coexistence of active Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Brownian particles (ABPs) serve as a minimal model of active matter systems. When ABPs are sufficiently persistent, they undergo a liquid-gas phase separation and, in the presence of obstacles, accumulate around them, forming a wetting layer. Here, we perform simulations of ABPs in a quasi-one-dimensional domain in the presence of a wall, studying the dynamics of the polarization field. On the course of time, we observe a transition from a homogeneous (where all particles are aligned) to a heterogeneous (where particles align only at the interface) polarization regime. We propose coarse-grained equations for the density and polarization fields based on microscopic and phenomenological arguments that correctly account for the observed phenomena.</description>

      <title>Sliding of liquid droplets on thin viscoelastic soft layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft substrates are deformed by liquid-vapor surface tension upon contact with liquid droplets, forming the well-known wetting ridge. This ridge dynamically propagates with the moving contact line and critically influences liquid spreading. Here, we experimentally investigate gravity-driven sliding dynamics of water droplets on vertically tilted silicone layers whose viscoleasticity is characterized by the Chasset-Thirion model with the exponent m. At low Bond numbers, the sliding velocity scales with droplet size as V S $\sim$ D 2 m . While in the thin-film limit, velocity exhibits a pronounced power-law dependence on nominal substrate thickness, V S $\sim$ $\Pi$(h) -1 m . We rationalize these observations by quantifying viscoelastic dissipation within the soft layer and balancing it against the gravitational driving force using an energy-conservation framework. Our findings offer novel avenues for designing advanced soft coatings, anti-fouling and self-cleaning surfaces, and biomedical devices.</description>

      <title>Emergence of rotating clusters in active Brownian particles with visual perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the group formation and subsequent dynamics of active particles which are equipped with a visual perception using Langevin dynamics simulations. These particles possess an orientational response to the position of the nearest neighbours which are within a vision cone of these particles. We observe the emergence of rotating clusters when the visual perception of the particles are in the intermediate range. We have found that the persistent motion of these active particles are intimately correlated with the emerging structures by analysing the persistence probability as well as the orientational correlation function. For rotating clusters, the persistent probability is found to be very quickly decaying and orientational correlation function shows oscillatory behaviour.</description>

      <title>The configurational entropy of random trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a graph theoretical approach to the configurational statistics of random tree-like objects, such as randomly branching polymers. In particular, we show that Pr\"ufer labelling provides: (i) direct access to the exact configurational entropy as a function of the tree composition, (ii) computable exact expressions for partition functions and important experimental observables for tree ensembles with controlled branching activity and (iii) an efficient sampling scheme for corresponding tree configurations and arbitrary static properties.</description>

      <title>Theory for the Anomalous Phase Behavior of Inertial Active Brownian Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contrast to equilibrium systems, inertia can profoundly impact the phase behavior of active systems. This has been made particularly evident in recent years, with motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) exhibiting several intriguing dependencies on translational inertia. Here we report extensive simulations characterizing the phase behavior of inertial active matter and develop a mechanical theory for the complete phase diagram without appealing to equilibrium notions. Our theory qualitatively captures all aspects of liquid-gas coexistence, including the critical value of inertia above which MIPS ceases. Notably, our findings highlight that particle softness, and not inertia, is responsible for the MIPS reentrance effect at the center of a proposed active refrigeration cycle.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of the hard-sphere potential model in three and four dimensions using a pseudo-hard-sphere potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hard-sphere potential has become a cornerstone in the study of both molecular and complex fluids. Despite its mathematical simplicity, its implementation in fixed time-step molecular simulations remains a formidable challenge due to the discontinuity at contact. To circumvent the issues associated with the ill-defined force at contact, a continuous potential--referred to here as the pseudo-hard-sphere (pHS) potential--has recently been proposed [J. Chem, Phys. 149, 164907 (2018)]. This potential is constructed to match the second virial coefficient of the hard-sphere potential and is expected to mimic its thermodynamic properties. However, this hypothesis has only been partially validated within the fluid region of the phase diagram for hard-sphere dispersions in two and three dimensions. In this contribution, we examine the ability of the continuous pHS potential to reproduce the equation of state of a hard-sphere fluid, not only in the fluid phase but also across the fluid-solid coexistence region. Our focus is primarily on hard-sphere systems in three and four dimensions. We compare the results obtained from Brownian dynamics simulations of the pHS potential with those derived from refined event-driven simulations of the corresponding hard-sphere potential. Furthermore, we provide a comparative analysis with theoretical equations of state based on both mean-field and integral equation approximations.</description>
