      <title>Applications and Novel Regularization of the Thin-Film Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical no-slip boundary condition of the Navier-Stokes equations fails to describe the spreading motion of a droplet on a substrate due to the missing small-scale physics near the contact line. In this thesis, we introduce a novel regularization of the thin-film equation to model droplet spreading. The solution of the regularized thin-film equation -- the Geometric Thin-Film Equation is studied and characterized. Two robust numerical solvers are discussed, notably, a fast and mesh-free numerical scheme for simulating thin-film flows in two and three spatial dimensions. Moreover, we prove the regularity and convergence of the numerical solutions. The existence and uniqueness of the solution of the Geometric Thin-Film Equation with respect to a wide range of measure-valued initial conditions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Boundary layer stability and transition analysis using the nonlinear One-Way Navier-Stokes approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the One-Way Navier Stokes (OWNS) approach to support nonlinear interactions between waves of different frequencies, which will enable nonlinear analysis of instability and transition. In OWNS, the linearized Navier-Stokes equations are parabolized and solved in the frequency domain as a spatial initial-value (marching) problem. OWNS yields a reduced computational cost compared to direct numerical simulation (DNS), while also conferring numerous advantages over the parabolized stability equations (PSE), despite its higher computational cost relative to PSE, that we seek to extend to nonlinear analysis. We validate the nonlinear OWNS (NOWNS) method by examining nonlinear evolution of two- and three-dimensional disturbances in a low-speed Blasius boundary layer compared to nonlinear PSE (NPSE) and DNS results from the literature. We demonstrate that NOWNS supports non-modal instabilities, is more robust to numerical noise, and converges for stronger nonlinearities, as compared to NPSE.</description>

      <title>Linear stability analysis of wall-bounded high-pressure transcritical fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixing and heat transfer rates are typically enhanced when operating at high-pressure transcritical turbulent flow regimes. The rapid variation of thermophysical properties in the vicinity of the pseudo-boiling region can be leveraged to significantly increase the Reynolds numbers and destabilize the flow. The underlying physical mechanism responsible for this destabilization is the presence of a baroclinic torque mainly driven by large localized density gradients across the pseudo-boiling line. As a result, the enstrophy levels are enhanced compared to equivalent low-pressure cases, and the flow physics behavior deviates from standard wall turbulence characteristics. In this work, the nature of this instability is carefully analyzed and characterized by means of linear stability theory. It is found that, at isothermal wall-bounded transcritical conditions, the non-linear thermodynamics exhibited near the pseudo-boiling region propitiates the laminar-to-turbulent transition with respect to sub- and super-critical thermodynamic states. This transition is further exacerbated for non-isothermal flows even at low Brinkman numbers. Particularly, neutral curve sensitivity to Brinkman numbers and perturbation profiles of dynamic and thermodynamic unstable modes based on modal and non-modal analysis, which trigger the early flow destabilization, confirm this phenomenon. Nonetheless, a non-isothermal setup is a necessary condition for transition when operating at low-Mach/Reynolds-number regimes. In detail, on equal Brinkman number, turbulence transition is accelerated and algebraic growth enhanced in comparison to isothermal cases. Consequently, high-pressure transcritical setups result in larger kinetic energy budgets due to larger production rates and lower viscous dissipation.</description>

      <title>Capillary waves in miscible fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the existence of capillary waves propagating along the boundary between miscible co-flowing fluids. We unveil that the interplay between transient interfacial stresses and confinement drives the progressive transition from the well-known inertial regime, characterized by a wavenumber independent of frequency, $k\sim\omega^{0}$, to an unexpected capillary-wave scaling, $k\sim\omega^{2/3}$. This allows us to measure the effective interfacial tension between miscible fluids and its rapid decay on time scales never probed so far, which we rationalize with a model going beyond square gradient theories.</description>

      <title>Improving the Vector Basis Neural Network for RANS Equations Using Separate Trainings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new data-driven turbulence model for Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations called $\nu_t$-Vector Basis Neural Network. This new model, grounded on the already existing Vector Basis Neural Network, predicts separately the turbulent viscosity $\nu_t$ and the contribution of the Reynolds force vector that is not already accounted in $\nu_t$. Numerical experiments on the flow in a Square Duct show the better accuracy of the new model compared to the reference one.</description>

      <title>An Experimental Configuration to Study High-Enthalpy Radiating Flows Under Nonequilibrium De-excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an experimental configuration to study high-enthalpy radiating flows under nonequilibrium de-excitation. A general design method is introduced, combiningtheoretical analysis and numerical simulations to tailor the flow conditions for various research objectives. The implementation involves considerations of the shock tube condition, the arrangement configuration, and the effective measurement zone. The interplay between shock tube condition and aerofoil geometry generates diverse de-excitation patterns. The shock tube test time, transition onset location, and radiance intensity determine the effective measurement zone. An example utilizing N2 as the test gas demonstrates the method, achieving one-dimensional flow with thermal nonequilibrium and chemical freezing along the centerline, validating the method's effectiveness. An effective measurement zone of 200 mm is obtained under this condition, and the primary constraint under high-enthalpy conditions is the limited shock tube test time due to the high shock velocity and low fill pressure.</description>

      <title>The global flow state in a precessing cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the fluid flow forced by precession of a rotating cylindrical container using numerical simulations and experimental flow measurements with ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry (UDV). The analysis is based on the decomposition of the flow field into contributions with distinct azimuthal symmetry or analytically known inertial modes and the corresponding calculation of their amplitudes. We show that the predominant fraction of the kinetic energy of the precession-driven fluid flow is contained only within a few large-scale modes.
  The most striking observation shown by simulations and experiments is the transition from a flow dominated by large-scale structures to a more turbulent behaviour with the small-scale fluctuations becoming increasingly important. At a fixed rotation frequency (parametrized by the Reynolds number, ${\rm{Re}}$) this transition occurs when a critical precession ratio is exceeded and consists of a two-stage collapse of the directly driven flow going along with a massive modification of the azimuthal circulation (the zonal flow) and the appearance of an axisymmetric double-roll mode limited to a narrow range of precession ratios. A similar behaviour is found in experiments which make it possible to follow the transition up to Reynolds numbers of ${\rm{Re}}\approx 2\times 10^6$. We find that the critical precession ratio decreases with rotation, initially showing a particular scaling $\propto {\rm{Re}}^{-\frac{1}{5}}$ but developing an asymptotic behaviour for ${\rm{Re}}\gtrsim 10^5$ which might be explained by the onset of turbulence in boundary layers.</description>

      <title>Physics-aligned Schr\"{o}dinger bridge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconstruction of physical fields from sparse measurements is pivotal in both scientific research and engineering applications. Traditional methods are increasingly supplemented by deep learning models due to their efficacy in extracting features from data. However, except for the low accuracy on complex physical systems, these models often fail to comply with essential physical constraints, such as governing equations and boundary conditions. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel data-driven field reconstruction framework, termed the Physics-aligned Schr\"{o}dinger Bridge (PalSB). This framework leverages a diffusion Schr\"{o}dinger bridge mechanism that is specifically tailored to align with physical constraints. The PalSB approach incorporates a dual-stage training process designed to address both local reconstruction mapping and global physical principles. Additionally, a boundary-aware sampling technique is implemented to ensure adherence to physical boundary conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PalSB through its application to three complex nonlinear systems: cylinder flow from Particle Image Velocimetry experiments, two-dimensional turbulence, and a reaction-diffusion system. The results reveal that PalSB not only achieves higher accuracy but also exhibits enhanced compliance with physical constraints compared to existing methods. This highlights PalSB's capability to generate high-quality representations of intricate physical interactions, showcasing its potential for advancing field reconstruction techniques.</description>

      <title>Small Leidenfrost droplet dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An isolated Leidenfrost droplet levitating over its own vapor above a superheated flat substrate is considered theoretically, the superheating for water being up to several hundred degrees above the boiling temperature. The focus is on the limit of small, practically spherical droplets of several tens of micrometers or less. This may occur when the liquid is sprayed over a hot substrate, or just be a late life stage of an initially large Leidenfrost droplet. A rigorous numerically-assisted analysis is carried out within verifiable assumptions such as quasi-stationarities and small Reynolds/P\'{e}clet numbers. It is considered that the droplet is surrounded by its pure vapor. Simple fitting formulas of our numerical data for the forces and evaporation rates are preliminarily obtained, all respecting the asymptotic behaviors (also investigated) in the limits of small and large levitation heights. They are subsequently used within a system of ODEs to study the droplet dynamics and take-off (drastic height increase as the droplet vaporizes). A previously known quasi-stationary inverse-square root law for the droplet height as a function of its radius (at the root of the take-off) is recovered, although we point out different prefactors in the two limits. Deviations of a dynamic nature therefrom are uncovered as the droplet radius further decreases due to evaporation, improving the agreement with experiment. Furthermore, we reveal that, if initially large enough, the droplets vanish at a universal finite height (just dependent on the superheat and fluid properties). Scalings in various distinguished cases are obtained in the way.</description>

      <title>Initial release styles have limited effects on the hydrodynamic dynamics of a self-propelled fin in the unsteady wakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living fish may suddenly encounter upstream obstacles, join the queue of the fish schooling, or detect upstream flow in advance, resulting in interactions with environmental vortices that can be abrupt or develop gradually from an initial state. The impact of initial conditions on fish swimming behavior in unsteady upstream vortices remains an open question. This study employs a self-propelled flexible fin model, the immersed boundary method, and direct simulation to analyze the hydrodynamics and locomotion of fish swimming behind a bluff cylinder and within the schooling, under different initial gaps and release styles. Additionally, the above tests were conducted with both quiescent flow fields and fully developed unsteady flows as initial conditions. The results indicate that schooling self-propelled fins are more resilient to initial perturbations compared to fins swimming behind a bluff body. More importantly, when simulations begin with a fully developed wake pattern, which better reflects natural environments, the characteristics of the self-propelled fins remain consistent regardless of the initial release styles. Therefore, from a hydrodynamic perspective, we conclude that initial release styles have limited effects on living fish in unsteady wakes.</description>

      <title>FlowBench: A Large Scale Benchmark for Flow Simulation over Complex Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating fluid flow around arbitrary shapes is key to solving various engineering problems. However, simulating flow physics across complex geometries remains numerically challenging and computationally resource-intensive, particularly when using conventional PDE solvers. Machine learning methods offer attractive opportunities to create fast and adaptable PDE solvers. However, benchmark datasets to measure the performance of such methods are scarce, especially for flow physics across complex geometries. We introduce FlowBench, a dataset for neural simulators with over 10K samples, which is currently larger than any publicly available flow physics dataset. FlowBench contains flow simulation data across complex geometries (\textit{parametric vs. non-parametric}), spanning a range of flow conditions (\textit{Reynolds number and Grashoff number}), capturing a diverse array of flow phenomena (\textit{steady vs. transient; forced vs. free convection}), and for both 2D and 3D. FlowBench contains over 10K data samples, with each sample the outcome of a fully resolved, direct numerical simulation using a well-validated simulator framework designed for modeling transport phenomena in complex geometries. For each sample, we include velocity, pressure, and temperature field data at 3 different resolutions and several summary statistics features of engineering relevance (such as coefficients of lift and drag, and Nusselt numbers). %Additionally, we include masks and signed distance fields for each shape. We envision that FlowBench will enable evaluating the interplay between complex geometry, coupled flow phenomena, and data sufficiency on the performance of current, and future, neural PDE solvers. We enumerate several evaluation metrics to help rank order the performance of neural PDE solvers. We benchmark the performance of several baseline methods including FNO, CNO, WNO, and DeepONet.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic growth of sea ice: assessing the role of salinity using a quasi-static modelling framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sea ice is a mushy layer, a porous material whose properties depend on the relative proportions of solid and liquid. The growth of sea ice is governed by heat transfer through the ice together with appropriate boundary conditions at the interfaces with the atmosphere and ocean. The salinity of sea ice has a large effect on its thermal properties so might naively be expected to have a large effect on its growth rate. However, previous studies observed a low sensitivity throughout the winter growth season. The goal of this study is to identify the controlling physical mechanisms that explain this observation. We develop a simplified quasi-static framework by applying a similarity transformation to the underlying heat equation and neglecting the explicit time dependence. We find three key processes controlling the sensitivity of growth rate to salinity. First, the trade-off between thermal conductivity and (latent) heat capacity leads to low sensitivity to salinity even at moderately high salinity and brine volume fraction. Second, the feedback on the temperature profile reduces the sensitivity relative to models that assume a linear profile, such as zero-layer Semtner models. Third, thicker ice has the opposite sensitivity of growth rate to salinity compared to thinner ice, sensitivities that counteract each other as the ice grows. Beyond its use in diagnosing these sensitivities, we show that the quasi-static approach offers a valuable sea-ice model of intermediate complexity between zero-layer Semtner models and full partial-differential-equation-based models such as Maykut-Untersteiner/Bitz-Lipscomb and mushy-layer models.</description>

      <title>A new transient higher order compact scheme for computation of flow and heat transfer in nonuniform polar grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, a higher order compact (HOC) discretization is developed on the nonuniform polar grid. The discretization conceptualized using the unsteady convection-diffusion equation (CDE) is further extended to flow problems governed by the Navies-Stokes (N-S) equations as well as the Boussinesq equations. The scheme developed here combines the advantages of body-fitted mesh with grid clustering, thereby making it efficient to capture flow gradients on polar grids. The scheme carries a spatial convergence of order three with temporal order of convergence being almost two. Diverse flow problems are being investigated using the scheme. Apart from two verification studies we validate the scheme by time marching simulation for the benchmark problem of driven polar cavity and the problem of natural convection in the horizontal concentric annulus. In the process, a one-sided approximation for the Neumann boundary condition for vorticity is also presented. Finally, the benchmark problem of forced convection around a circular cylinder is tackled. The results obtained in this study are analyzed and compared with the well-established numerical and experimental data wherever available in the literature. The newly developed scheme is found to generate accurate solutions in each case.</description>

Abstract: The present study applies a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm to Active Flow Control (AFC) of a two-dimensional flow around a confined square cylinder. Specifically, the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm is employed to modulate the flow of a pair of synthetic jets placed on the upper and lower surfaces of the confined squared cylinder in flow configurations characterized by $Re$ of 100, 200, 300, and 400. The investigation starts with an analysis of the baseline flow in the absence of active control. It is observed that at $Re$ = 100 and $Re$ = 200, the vortex shedding exhibits mono-frequency characteristics. Conversely, at $Re$ = 300 and $Re$ = 400, the vortex shedding is dominated by multiple frequencies, which is indicative of more complex flow features. With the application of the SAC algorithm, we demonstrate the capability of DRL-based control in effectively suppressing vortex shedding, while significantly diminishing drag and fluctuations in lift. Quantitatively, the data-driven active control strategy results in a drag reduction of approximately 14.4%, 26.4%, 38.9%, and 47.0% for $Re$ = 100, 200, 300, and 400, respectively. To understand the underlying control mechanism, we also present detailed flow field comparisons, which showcase the adaptability of DRL in devising distinct control strategies tailored to the dynamic conditions at varying $Re$. These findings substantiate the proficiency of DRL in controlling chaotic, multi-frequency dominated vortex shedding phenomena, underscoring the robustness of DRL in complex AFC problems.</description>

Abstract: We study the adaptability of deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based active flow control (AFC) technology for bluff body flows with complex geometries. It is extended from a cylinder with an aspect ratio $Ar = 1$ to a flat elliptical cylinder with $Ar=2$, slender elliptical cylinders with $Ar$ less than 1, and a flat plate with $Ar=0$. We utilize the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to precisely control the mass flow rates of synthetic jets located on the upper and lower surfaces of a cylinder to achieve reduction in drag, minimization of lift, and suppression of vortex shedding. Our research findings indicate that, for elliptical cylinders with $Ar$ between 1.75 and 0.75, the reduction in drag coefficient ranges from 0.9% to 15.7%, and the reduction in lift coefficient ranges from 95.2% to 99.7%. The DRL-based control strategy not only significantly reduces lift and drag, but also completely suppresses vortex shedding while using less than 1% of external excitation energy, demonstrating its efficiency and energy-saving capabilities. Additionally, for $Ar$ from 0.5 to 0, the reduction in drag coefficient ranges from 26.9% to 43.6%, and the reduction in lift coefficient from 50.2% to 68.0%. This reflects the control strategy's significant reduction in both drag and lift coefficients, while also alleviating vortex shedding. The interaction and nonlinear development of vortices in the wake of elliptical cylinders lead to complex flow instability, and DRL-based AFC technology shows adaptability and potential in addressing flow control problems for this type of bluff body flow.</description>

      <title>Effect of Synthetic Jets Actuator Parameters on Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Flow Control Performance in a Square Cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12834</link>

Abstract: We conduct an active flow control (AFC) study on the mass flow rate of synthetic jets on the upper and lower surfaces of a square cylinder using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, with a focus on investigating the influence of the position and width of the synthetic jets on the flow control performance. At Reynolds numbers ($Re$) of 100 and 500, it is found that our proposed method significantly reduced the lift and drag coefficients of the square cylinder, and completely suppressed vortex shedding in the wake. In particular, at $Re=100$, placing the synthetic jets near the tail corner was beneficial for reducing drag, with a maximum drag reduction rate of 14.4%. When $Re=500$, positioning the synthetic jets near the leading edge corner resulted in a maximum optimal drag reduction effect of 65.5%. This indicates that locating the synthetic jet at the main flow separation point can achieve optimal control. Furthermore, we notice that when the synthetic jets are positioned near the tail corner, vortex shedding can be completely suppressed. Additionally, a narrower width of the synthetic jets can enhance flow instability and increase the cost of flow control.</description>

      <title>Linear dynamics of over-expanded annular supersonic jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article delves into the dynamics of inviscid annular supersonic jets, akin to those exiting converging-diverging nozzles in over-expanded regimes. It focuses on the first azimuthal Fourier mode of flow fluctuations and examines their behavior with varying mixing layer parameters and expansion regimes. The study reveals that two unstable Kelvin-Helmholtz waves exist in all cases, with the outer layer wave being more unstable due to velocity gradient differences. The inner layer wave is more sensitive to base flow changes and extends beyond the jet, potentially contributing to nozzle resonances. The article also investigates guided-jet modes, which are found to be robust and not highly sensitive to base flow parameters, making them essential for understanding jet dynamics. A simplified model is used to obtain ideal base flows with realistic shape to study varying nozzle pressure ratios (NPR) effects on the dynamics of the waves supported by the jet.</description>

      <title>Optimal Parallelization Strategies for Active Flow Control in Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11515v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for handling highly dynamic and nonlinear Active Flow Control (AFC) problems. However, the computational cost associated with training DRL models presents a significant performance bottleneck. To address this challenge and enable efficient scaling on high-performance computing architectures, this study focuses on optimizing DRL-based algorithms in parallel settings. We validate an existing state-of-the-art DRL framework used for AFC problems and discuss its efficiency bottlenecks. Subsequently, by deconstructing the overall framework and conducting extensive scalability benchmarks for individual components, we investigate various hybrid parallelization configurations and propose efficient parallelization strategies. Moreover, we refine input/output (I/O) operations in multi-environment DRL training to tackle critical overhead associated with data movement. Finally, we demonstrate the optimized framework for a typical AFC problem where near-linear scaling can be obtained for the overall framework. We achieve a significant boost in parallel efficiency from around 49% to approximately 78%, and the training process is accelerated by approximately 47 times using 60 central processing unit (CPU) cores. These findings are expected to provide valuable insights for further advancements in DRL-based AFC studies. Consequently, it continues to be a prominent and actively studied problem of significant interest.</description>
