      <title>A uniform rate of convergence for the entropic potentials in the quadratic Euclidean setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We bound the rate of uniform convergence in compact sets for both entropic potentials and their gradients towards the Brenier potential and its gradient, respectively. Both results hold in the quadratic Euclidean setting for absolutely continuous measures satisfying some convexity assumptions.</description>

      <title>A unified approach to hypergeometric class functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergeometric class equations are given by second
  order differential operators in one variable whose coefficient at the second derivative
  is a polynomial of degree $\leq2$, at the first derivative of degree
  $\leq1$ and the free term is a number. Their solutions, called hypergeometric class functions, include the Gauss hypergeometric function and its various limiting cases. The paper presents a unified approach to these functions. The main structure behind this approach is a family of complex 4-dimensional Lie algebras, originally due to Willard Miller. Hypergeometric class functions can be interpreted as eigenfunctions of the quadratic Casimir operator in a representation of Miller's Lie algebra given by differential operators in three complex variables. One obtains a unified treatment of various properties of hypergeometric class functions such as recurrence relations, discrete symmetries, power series expansions, integral representations, generating functions and orthogonality of polynomial solutions.</description>

      <title>Even Hypergeometric Polynomials and Finite Free Commutators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study in detail the class of even polynomials and their behavior with respect to finite free convolutions. To this end, we use some specific hypergeometric polynomials and a variation of the rectangular finite free convolution to understand even real-rooted polynomials in terms of positive-rooted polynomials. Then, we study some classes of even polynomials that are of interest in finite free probability, such as even hypergeometric polynomials, symmetrizations, and finite free commutators. Specifically, we provide many new examples of these objects, involving classical families of special polynomials (such as Laguerre, Hermite, and Jacobi). Finally, we relate the limiting root distributions of sequences of even polynomials with the corresponding symmetric measures that arise in free probability.</description>

      <title>Representation of solutions of the one-dimensional Dirac equation in terms of Neumann series of Bessel functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A representation of solutions of the one-dimensional Dirac equation is obtained. The solutions are represented as Neumann series of Bessel functions. The representations are shown to be uniformly convergent with respect to the spectral parameter. Explicit formulas for the coefficients are obtained via a system of recursive integrals. The result is based on the Fourier-Legendre series expansion of the transmutation kernel. An efficient numerical method for solving initial-value and spectral problems based on this approach is presented with a numerical example. The method can compute large sets of eigendata with non-deteriorating accuracy.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for multiple $q$-orthogonal polynomials from the RHP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deduce the asymptotic behaviour of a broad class of multiple $q$-orthogonal polynomials as their degree tends to infinity. We achieve this by rephrasing multiple $q$-orthogonal polynomials as part of a solution to a Riemann Hilbert Problem (RHP). In particular, we study multiple $q$-orthogonal polynomials of the first kind (see [12]), which are Type II orthogonal polynomials with weights given by
  \begin{equation}
  w_1(x) = x^\alpha \omega(x)d_qx,\qquad w_2(x) = x^\beta \omega(x)d_qx, \nonumber \end{equation} which satisfy the constraint \begin{equation}\nonumber
  |\omega(q^{2n})-1| = \mathcal{O}(q^{2n}), \end{equation} as $n\to \infty$. Using $q$-calculus we obtain detailed asymptotics for these polynomials from the RHP. This class of polynomials studied was chosen in part to their connection to the work of [11,12], concerning the irrationality of $\zeta_q(1)$ and $\zeta_q(2)$. To conduct our asymptotic analysis we will require the following added restrictions on $w_1(x)$ and $w_2(x)$: $\alpha \notin \mathbb{Z}$, $\beta \notin \mathbb{Z}$ and $\alpha \neq \beta \mod \mathbb{Z}$. These restrictions are necessary for the asymptotic analysis but not the statement of multiple $q$-orthogonal polynomials as solutions to a RHP.
  The author wishes to extend special thanks to Prof. Walter Van Assche, who motivated this studied and provided valuable discussion.</description>

      <title>Expressing the difference of two Hurwitz zeta functions by a linear combination of the Gauss hypergeometric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, the author expresses the difference $2^m\bigl[\zeta\bigl(-m,\frac{1+x}{2}\bigr)-\zeta\bigl(-m,\frac{2+x}{2}\bigr)\bigr]$ in terms of a linear combination of the function $\Gamma(m+1){\,}_2F_1(-m,-x;1;2)$ for $m\in\mathbb{N}_0$ and $x\in(-1,\infty)$ in the form of matrix equations, where $\Gamma(z)$, $\zeta(z,\alpha)$, and ${}_2F_1(a,b;c;z)$ stand for the classical Euler gamma function, the Hurwitz zeta function, and the Gauss hypergeometric function, respectively. This problem originates from the Landau level quantization in solid state materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\mathcal X, d,\mu)$ be an RD-space, and let $\rho$ be an admissible function on $\mathcal X$. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the boundedness of a new class of generalized Calder\'on-Zygmund operators of log-Dini type on the Hardy space $H^1_\rho(\mathcal X)$, introduced by Yang and Zhou. Our results extend and unify some recent results, providing further insights into the study of singular integral operators in this setting.</description>

      <title>Intermediate dimensions of measures: Interpolating between Hausdorff and Minkowski dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define a family of dimensions for Borel measures that lie between the Hausdorff and Minkowski dimensions for measures, analogous to the intermediate dimensions of sets. Previously, Hare et. al. in [10] defined intermediate dimensions that interpolate between the Minkowski and Assouad dimensions for measures. Additionally, Fraser, in [7] introduced intermediate dimensions that interpolate between the Fourier and Hausdorff dimensions of measures. Our results address a "gap" in the study of dimension interpolation for measures, almost completing the spectrum of intermediate dimensions for measures: from Fourier to Assouad dimensions.
  Furthermore, Theorem 3.11 can be interpreted as a "reverse Frostman" lemma for intermediate dimensions. We also obtain a capacity-theoretic definition that enables us to estimate the intermediate dimensions of pushforward measures by projections.</description>

      <title>Middle Laplace transform and middle convolution for linear Pfaffian systems with irregular singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formulating the Laplace transform from the viewpoint of Katz theory, we introduce a transformation called the middle Laplace transform for linear Pfaffian systems with irregular singularities. While the definition of the middle Laplace transform is purely algebraic, its categorical interpretation is also provided. We then show the fundamental properties (invertibility, irreducibility) of the middle Laplace transform. As an application of the middle Laplace transform, we define the middle convolution for linear Pfaffian systems with irregular singularities. This gives a generalization of Haraoka's middle convolution, which was defined for linear Pfaffian systems with logarithmic singularities. The fundamental properties (additivity, irreducibility) of the middle convolution follow from the properties of the middle Laplace transform.</description>

      <title>Bounds for quasimodes with polynomially narrow bandwidth on surfaces of revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a compact surface of revolution with Laplace-beltrami operator $\Delta$, we consider the spectral projector $P_{\lambda,\delta}$ on a polynomially narrow frequency interval $[\lambda-\delta,\lambda + \delta]$, which is associated to the self-adjoint operator $\sqrt{-\Delta}$. For a large class of surfaces of revolution, and after excluding small disks around the poles, we prove that the $L^2 \to L^{\infty}$ norm of $P_{\lambda,\delta}$ is of order $\lambda^{\frac{1}{2}} \delta^{\frac{1}{2}}$ up to $\delta \geq \lambda^{-\frac{1}{32}}$. We adapt the microlocal approach introduced by Sogge for the case $\delta = 1$, by using the Quantum Completely Integrable structure of surfaces of revolution introduced by Colin de Verdi\`ere. This reduces the analysis to a number of estimates of explicit oscillatory integrals, for which we introduce new quantitative tools.</description>

      <title>On the extremal eigenvalues of Jacobi ensembles at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the $\beta$-Hermite, Laguerre, and Jacobi ensembles of dimension $N$ there exist central limit theorems for the freezing case $\beta\to\infty$ such that the associated means and covariances can be expressed in terms of the associated Hermite, Laguerre, and Jacobi polynomials of order $N$ respectively as well as via the associated dual polynomials in the sense of de Boor and Saff. In this paper we derive limits for $N\to\infty$ for the covariances of the $r\in\mathbb N$ largest (and smallest) eigenvalues for these frozen Jacobi ensembles in terms of Bessel functions. These results correspond to the hard edge analysis in the frozen Laguerre cases by Andraus and Lerner-Brecher and to known results for finite $\beta$.</description>

      <title>The Principle of Indivisible Integrity: A Structural Perspective on Higher-Order Differential Equations and Recurrence Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.03115v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Principle of Indivisible Integrity, challenging the classical assumptions of power series convergence in higher-order recurrence relations. It proves that for all recurrence relations of order three or higher, internal component rearrangements necessarily reduce the radius of convergence, contradicting Fuchs' theorem and the Poincare-Perron theorem. This necessitates a fundamental revision of recurrence relation theory, as absolute convergence must be explicitly ensured rather than assumed.
  The study applies this principle to Heun-type differential equations, revealing overlooked structural constraints that significantly alter the expected radius of convergence. These findings suggest that classical methods must be re-evaluated to maintain analytical consistency. The implications extend to asymptotic analysis, spectral theory, and numerical stability of special functions.
  The core results remain unchanged from previous versions, but the theoretical framework and exposition have been refined for greater clarity and rigor.</description>

      <title>State-dependent Delay Differential Equations on $H^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04730v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classically, solution theories for state-dependent delay equations are developed in spaces of continuous or continuously differentiable functions. The former can be technically challenging to apply in as much as suitably Lipschitz continuous extensions of mappings onto the space of continuous functions are required; whereas the latter approach leads to restrictions on the class of initial pre-histories. Here, we establish a solution theory for state-dependent delay equations for arbitrary Lipschitz continuous pre-histories and suitably Lipschitz continuous right-hand sides on the Sobolev space $H^1$. The provided solution theory is independent of previous ones and is based on the contraction mapping principle on exponentially weighted spaces. In particular, initial pre-histories are not required to belong to solution manifolds and the generality of the approach permits the consideration of a large class of functional differential equations even for which the continuity of the right-hand side has constraints on the derivative.</description>

Abstract: For the class of sine polynomials $b_1\sin t+b_2\sin2t+...+b_N\sin Nt,\; (b_N\not= 0),$ which are nonnegative on $(0,\pi)$, W. Rogosinski and G. Szeg\"o derived, among other things, exact bounds for $|b_2|$ via the Luk\'acs presentation of nonnegative algebraic polynomials and a variational type argument for exact bounds, but they did not find the extremizers. Within this algebraic framework, we construct explicit polynomials which attain these bounds and prove their uniqueness. The proof uses the Fej\'er -Riesz representation of nonnegative trigonometric polynomials, a 7-band Toeplitz matrix of arbitrary finite dimension, and Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind and their derivatives.</description>

      <title>Note on homoclinic solutions to nonautonomous Hamiltonian systems with sign-changing nonlinear part</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper, we utilize the recent variational, abstract theorem to show the existence of homoclinic solutions to the Hamiltonian system $$ \dot{z} = J D_z H(z, t), \quad t \in \mathbb{R}, $$ where the Hamiltonian $H : \mathbb{R}^{2N} \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is of the form $$ H(z, t) = \frac12 Az \cdot z + \Gamma(t) \left( F(z) - \lambda G(z) \right) $$ for some symmetric matrix $A$.</description>

      <title>Product formulas for basic hypergeometric series by evaluations of Askey--Wilson polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ismail and Wilson derived a generating function for Askey--Wilson polynomials which is given by a product of $q$-Gauss (Heine) nonterminating basic hypergeometric functions. We provide a generalization of that generating function which contains an extra parameter. A special case gives a closed form summation formula for a quadruple basic hypergeometric sum. We further present two new terminating balanced ${}_4\phi_3$ summations that give rise to quadratic special values for Askey--Wilson polynomials. We also present three new terminating 2-balanced ${}_4\phi_3$ summations and two new terminating 3-balanced ${}_4\phi_3$ summations. Using the Ismail--Wilson generating function combined with explicit summations for terminating balanced basic hypergeometric $_4\phi_3$ series, we compute new basic hypergeometric product transformations for nonterminating basic hypergeometric series and provide corresponding integral representations.</description>

      <title>Self-embedding similitudes of Bedford-McMullen carpets with dependent ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any non-degenerate Bedford-McMullen carpet does not allow oblique self-embedding similitudes; that is, if $f$ is a similitude sending the carpet into itself, then the image of the $x$-axis under $f$ must be parallel to one of the principal axes. We also establish a logarithmic commensurability result on the contraction ratios of such embeddings. This completes a previous study of Algom and Hochman [Ergod. Th. &amp; Dynam. Sys. 39 (2019), 577--603] on Bedford-McMullen carpets generated by multiplicatively independent exponents, together with a new proof on their non-obliqueness statement.
  For the self-similar case, however, we construct a generalized Sierpinski carpet that is symmetric with respect to an appropriate oblique line and hence allows a reflectional oblique self-embedding. As a complement, we prove that if a generalized Sierpinski carpet satisfies the strong separation condition and permits an oblique rotational self-embedding similitude, then the tangent of the rotation angle takes values $\pm 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the wave packet decomposition to study the Schrodinger evolution with rough potential. As an application, we obtain the improved bound on the wave propagation for the generic value of a parameter.</description>
