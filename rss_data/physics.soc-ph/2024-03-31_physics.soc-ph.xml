      <title>Novel approaches to urban science problems: human mobility description by physical analogy of electric circuit network based on GPS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human mobility in an urban area is complicated; the origins, destinations, and transport methods of each person differ. The quantitative description of urban human mobility has recently attracted the attention of researchers, and it highly related to urban science problems. Herein, combined with physics inspiration, we introduce a revised electric circuit model (RECM) in which moving people are regarded as charged particles and analogical concepts of electromagnetism such as human conductivity and human potential enable us to capture the characteristics of urban human mobility. We introduce the unit system, ensure the uniqueness of the calculation result, and reduce the computation cost of the algorithm to 1/10000 compared with the original ECM, making the model more universal and easier to use. We compared features including human conductivity and potential between different cities in Japan to show our improvement of the universality and the application range of the model. Furthermore, based on inspiration of physics, we propose a route generation model (RGM) to simulate a human flow pattern that automatically determines suitable routes between a given origin and destination as a source and sink, respectively. These discoveries are expected to lead to new approaches to the solution of urban science problems.</description>

      <title>Scaling of variability measures in hierarchical demographic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demographic heterogeneity is often studied through the geographical lens. Therefore it is considered at a predetermined spatial resolution, which is a suitable choice to understand scalefull phenomena. Spatial autocorrelation indices are well established for this purpose. Yet complex systems are often scale-free, and thus studying the scaling behavior of demographic heterogeneity may provide valuable insights. Furthermore, migration processes are not necessarily influenced by the physical landscape, which is accounted for by the spatial autocorrelation indices. The migration process may be more influenced by the socio-economic landscape, which is better reflected by the hierarchical demographic data. Here we explore the scaling behavior of variability measures in the United Kingdom 2011 census data set. As expected, all of the considered variability measures decrease as the hierarchical scale becomes coarser. Though the non-monotonicity is observed, it can be explained by accounting for the imperfect hierarchical relationships. We show that the scaling behavior of variability measures can be qualitatively understood in terms of Schelling's segregation model and Kawasaki-Ising</description>

      <title>A Review of Graph Neural Networks in Epidemic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing interest in studying epidemiological models. Traditional mechanistic models mathematically describe the transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases. However, they often fall short when confronted with the growing challenges of today. Consequently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a progressively popular tool in epidemic research. In this paper, we endeavor to furnish a comprehensive review of GNNs in epidemic tasks and highlight potential future directions. To accomplish this objective, we introduce hierarchical taxonomies for both epidemic tasks and methodologies, offering a trajectory of development within this domain. For epidemic tasks, we establish a taxonomy akin to those typically employed within the epidemic domain. For methodology, we categorize existing work into \textit{Neural Models} and \textit{Hybrid Models}. Following this, we perform an exhaustive and systematic examination of the methodologies, encompassing both the tasks and their technical details. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing methods from diverse perspectives and systematically propose future research directions. This survey aims to bridge literature gaps and promote the progression of this promising field. We hope that it will facilitate synergies between the communities of GNNs and epidemiology, and contribute to their collective progress.</description>

Abstract: I investigate the peculiar situation in which I find myself healthy and strong, with a darling family, stimulating job, top-notch dental plan, and living far from active war and wildfire zones -- yet perpetually ill at ease and prone to sudden-onset exasperation when absolutely nothing has happened. My triggers include dinner parties, chairs, therapists, and shopping at Costco. In analysing this phenomenon, I consider epigenetics, the neuroscience of neuroticism, and possible environmental factors such as NSF grant budgets. Yet no obvious solution emerges. Fortunately, my affliction isn't really all that serious. In fact, it's good writing material. So while I'm open to better ideas, I figure I'll just continue being like this.</description>

      <title>Pursuing equitable access to vaccines for the next epidemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To mitigate the pandemic stemming from COVID-19, numerous nations have initiated extensive vaccination campaigns for their citizens since late 2020. While affluent countries have predominantly received vaccine allocations, fewer doses have been dispatched to nations with lower average incomes. This unequal distribution not only widens the disparity between wealthy and impoverished regions but also prolongs the pandemic, evident in the emergence of new viral variants. Our research delves into the correlation between the duration of the pandemic and the timing of vaccine distribution between two countries with migratory ties. By using a pair of coupled Susceptible- Infected-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) models incorporating vaccination data, we demonstrate that timely sharing of vaccines benefits both nations, regardless of the presence of viral variants. This underscores that in the realm of vaccine distribution, self-interest and altruism are not mutually exclusive.</description>

      <title>Optimal prevention strategies for chronic diseases in a compartmental disease trajectory model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In countries with growing elderly populations, multimorbidity poses a significant healthcare challenge. The trajectories along which diseases accumulate as patients age and how they can be targeted by prevention efforts are still not fully understood. We propose a compartmental model, traditionally used in infectious diseases, describing chronic disease trajectories across 132 distinct multimorbidity patterns (compartments). Leveraging a comprehensive dataset from approximately 45 million hospital stays spanning 17 years in Austria, our compartmental disease trajectory model (CDTM) forecasts changes in the incidence of 131 diagnostic groups and their combinations until 2030, highlighting patterns involving hypertensive diseases with cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders. We pinpoint specific diagnoses with the greatest potential for preventive interventions to promote healthy aging. According to our model, a reduction of new onsets by 5% of hypertensive diseases (I10-I15) leads to a reduction in all-cause mortality over a period of 15 years by 0.57 (0.06)% and for malignant neoplasms (C00-C97) mortality is reduced by 0.57 (0.07)%. Furthermore, we use the model to assess the long-term consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on hospitalizations, revealing earlier and more frequent hospitalizations across multiple diagnoses. Our fully data-driven approach identifies leverage points for proactive preparation by physicians and policymakers to reduce the overall disease burden in the population, emphasizing a shift towards patient-centered care.</description>

      <title>Measuring Online Emotional Reactions to Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rich and dynamic information environment of social media provides researchers, policy makers, and entrepreneurs with opportunities to learn about social phenomena in a timely manner. However, using this data to understand social behavior is difficult due heterogeneity of topics and events discussed in the highly dynamic online information environment. To address these challenges, we present a method for systematically detecting and measuring emotional reactions to offline events using change point detection on the time series of collective affect, and further explaining these reactions using a transformer-based topic model. We demonstrate the utility of the method on a corpus of tweets from a large US metropolitan area between January and August, 2020, covering a period of great social change. We demonstrate that our method is able to disaggregate topics to measure population's emotional and moral reactions. This capability allows for better monitoring of population's reactions during crises using online data.</description>
