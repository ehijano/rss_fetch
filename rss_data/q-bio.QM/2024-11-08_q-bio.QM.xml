      <title>BAPULM: Binding Affinity Prediction using Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying drug-target interactions is essential for developing effective therapeutics. Binding affinity quantifies these interactions, and traditional approaches rely on computationally intensive 3D structural data. In contrast, language models can efficiently process sequential data, offering an alternative approach to molecular representation. In the current study, we introduce BAPULM, an innovative sequence-based framework that leverages the chemical latent representations of proteins via ProtT5-XL-U50 and ligands through MolFormer, eliminating reliance on complex 3D configurations. Our approach was validated extensively on benchmark datasets, achieving scoring power (R) values of 0.925 $\pm$ 0.043, 0.914 $\pm$ 0.004, and 0.8132 $\pm$ 0.001 on benchmark1k2101, Test2016_290, and CSAR-HiQ_36, respectively. These findings indicate the robustness and accuracy of BAPULM across diverse datasets and underscore the potential of sequence-based models in-silico drug discovery, offering a scalable alternative to 3D-centric methods for screening potential ligands.</description>

      <title>Invitro Pharmacological Evaluations Of Ethanolic Extract Of Jatropha Maheshwari</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: To assess the antioxidant, wound healing, anti-ulcer, and anti-inflammatory properties of Jatropha maheshwari. Methods: Jatropha maheshwari was collected from Kanyakumari district and authenticated. Ethanol was used for continuous hot percolation extraction of the plant. Antioxidant activity was evaluated using DPPH and ABTS assays. The wound healing potential was assessed through a wound scratch assay using 3T3-L1 murine fibroblast cell lines. Anti-ulcer activity was measured using the acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) and H+/K+-ATPase inhibitory activity methods. Anti-inflammatory effects were determined through dose-dependent studies of the ethanol extract. Results: Antioxidant Activity: The crude extract exhibited strong antioxidant capacity with percentage inhibition values of 88% (DPPH) and 75.7% (ABTS). Wound Healing Activity: The wound closure rate in treated 3T3-L1 cell lines reached 97.88%, indicating potent wound healing properties. Anti-Ulcer Activity: The extract demonstrated an 80.1% inhibition compared to the control when tested alongside omeprazole. ANC per gram of antacid was recorded at 20 and 26 for oral doses of 10 and 500 {\mu}g/ml, respectively. Anti-Inflammatory Activity: Dose-dependent inhibition percentages of 30.1% (10 {\mu}g/ml) and 96.5% (500 {\mu}g/ml) were observed (p&lt;0.001) relative to inflammation control. Additional percentages of 26.3% (10 {\mu}g/ml) and 42.6% (500 {\mu}g/ml) further confirmed the anti-inflammatory activity.
  Conclusion: Jatropha maheshwari demonstrates significant antioxidant, wound healing, anti-ulcer, and anti-inflammatory properties. Further research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these pharmacological effects.</description>

      <title>AutoProteinEngine: A Large Language Model Driven Agent Framework for Multimodal AutoML in Protein Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein engineering is important for biomedical applications, but conventional approaches are often inefficient and resource-intensive. While deep learning (DL) models have shown promise, their training or implementation into protein engineering remains challenging for biologists without specialized computational expertise. To address this gap, we propose AutoProteinEngine (AutoPE), an agent framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for multimodal automated machine learning (AutoML) for protein engineering. AutoPE innovatively allows biologists without DL backgrounds to interact with DL models using natural language, lowering the entry barrier for protein engineering tasks. Our AutoPE uniquely integrates LLMs with AutoML to handle model selection for both protein sequence and graph modalities, automatic hyperparameter optimization, and automated data retrieval from protein databases. We evaluated AutoPE through two real-world protein engineering tasks, demonstrating substantial performance improvements compared to traditional zero-shot and manual fine-tuning approaches. By bridging the gap between DL and biologists' domain expertise, AutoPE empowers researchers to leverage DL without extensive programming knowledge. Our code is available at https://github.com/tsynbio/AutoPE.</description>

      <title>An Approach for Molecular and Biological Characterizations of Virulent Influenza A Viruses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an approach based on a combination of physical, chemical, and mathematical methods to identify and characterize virulent influenza A viruses (IAVs) through the analysis of the hemagglutinin protein. These methods include the isoelectric point, extreme value theory, and tree-like classification. The characterization process involves molecular and biological aspects. This procedure was applied to an IAV sample that included strains related to known influenza pandemics. The results provided clear position and amino acid pairs that identify these virulent viruses. These results show that our approach is promising to contribute new methodologies to identify and characterize virulent IAVs.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Graph Attention Networks with Structural Motifs for Predicting Cell Line-Specific Synergistic Drug Combinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer is the second leading cause of death, with chemotherapy as one of the primary forms of treatment. As a result, researchers are turning to drug combination therapy to decrease drug resistance and increase efficacy. Current methods of drug combination screening, such as in vivo and in vitro, are inefficient due to stark time and monetary costs. In silico methods have become increasingly important for screening drugs, but current methods are inaccurate and generalize poorly to unseen anticancer drugs. In this paper, I employ a geometric deep-learning model utilizing a graph attention network that is equivariant to 3D rotations, translations, and reflections with structural motifs. Additionally, the gene expression of cancer cell lines is utilized to classify synergistic drug combinations specific to each cell line. I compared the proposed geometric deep learning framework to current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, and the proposed model architecture achieved greater performance on all 12 benchmark tasks performed on the DrugComb dataset. Specifically, the proposed framework outperformed other SOTA methods by an accuracy difference greater than 28%. Based on these results, I believe that the equivariant graph attention network's capability of learning geometric data accounts for the large performance improvements. The model's ability to generalize to foreign drugs is thought to be due to the structural motifs providing a better representation of the molecule. Overall, I believe that the proposed equivariant geometric deep learning framework serves as an effective tool for virtually screening anticancer drug combinations for further validation in a wet lab environment.

      <title>Strong anomalous diffusion for free-ranging birds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural and anomalous diffusion are widely observed and used to explore causes and consequences of movement across organisms, resulting in extensive use of the mean and mean-squared displacement (MSD). Using high-resolution data from over 70 million localizations of young and adult free-ranging Barn Owls (\textit{Tyto alba}), we demonstrate the necessity of a broad spectrum of displacement moments to characterize bird movement across scales. The mean and MSD -- interchangeable with moments $q=1$ and 2 -- are insufficient special cases. We reveal empirical strong anomalous diffusion as a nonlinear growth of displacement moments according to $\left&lt;|x(t)|^q\right&gt; \sim t^{\lambda(q)}$. The moment spectrum function $\lambda(q)$ displays piecewise linearity with a critical moment marking the crossover point between two scaling regimes, linked to a combination of age-specific behavioral modes. A critical timescale of five minutes marks an unexpected transition from a convex $\lambda_s(q)$ to a concave $\lambda_\ell(q)$, related to environmental and behavioral constraints. Using two stochastic models of varying ecological complexity, we demonstrate that strong anomalous diffusion may be widespread in animal movement, underscoring the importance of expanding analysis beyond the average and MSD.</description>

      <title>NeuroFly: A framework for whole-brain single neuron reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurons, with their elongated, tree-like dendritic and axonal structures, enable efficient signal integration and long-range communication across brain regions. By reconstructing individual neurons' morphology, we can gain valuable insights into brain connectivity, revealing the structure basis of cognition, movement, and perception. Despite the accumulation of extensive 3D microscopic imaging data, progress has been considerably hindered by the absence of automated tools to streamline this process. Here we introduce NeuroFly, a validated framework for large-scale automatic single neuron reconstruction. This framework breaks down the process into three distinct stages: segmentation, connection, and proofreading. In the segmentation stage, we perform automatic segmentation followed by skeletonization to generate over-segmented neuronal fragments without branches. During the connection stage, we use a 3D image-based path following approach to extend each fragment and connect it with other fragments of the same neuron. Finally, human annotators are required only to proofread the few unresolved positions. The first two stages of our process are clearly defined computer vision problems, and we have trained robust baseline models to solve them. We validated NeuroFly's efficiency using in-house datasets that include a variety of challenging scenarios, such as dense arborizations, weak axons, images with contamination. We will release the datasets along with a suite of visualization and annotation tools for better reproducibility. Our goal is to foster collaboration among researchers to address the neuron reconstruction challenge, ultimately accelerating advancements in neuroscience research. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/beanli161514/neurofly</description>

      <title>Selection of single cell clustering methodologies through rank aggregation of multiple performance measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As single-cell gene expression data analysis continues to grow, the need for reliable clustering methods has become increasingly important. The prevalence of heuristic means for method choice could lead to inaccurate reports if comprehensive evaluation of the methods is omitted. Typical comparisons of methods fail to address the complexity presented by the data, transformations, or internal parameters. Previous work in the field of microarray data provided measures to evaluate the stability characteristic of clustering algorithms. Additional work on aggregation in the same era presented a way to compare multiple methodologies using several performance measures. In this paper, we provide adaptations to these measures and employ two aggregation schemes to create ranked lists of method and parameter choices for six unique datasets. Our findings demonstrate that an ensemble of validation measures, combined with ranking based on measures' dataset specific preferences, provides an objective way to select clustering methodologies, taking into account characteristic evaluation from each measure.</description>

      <title>A review of statistical models used to characterize species-habitat associations with animal movement data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding species-habitat associations is fundamental to ecological sciences and for species conservation. Consequently, various statistical approaches have been designed to infer species-habitat associations. Due to their conceptual and mathematical differences, these methods can yield contrasting results. In this paper, we describe and compare commonly used statistical models that relate animal movement data to environmental data. Specifically, we examined selection functions which include resource selection function (RSF) and step-selection function (SSF), as well as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and related methods such as state-space models. We demonstrate differences in assumptions of each method while highlighting advantages and limitations. Additionally, we provide guidance on selecting the most appropriate statistical method based on research objectives and intended inference. To demonstrate the varying ecological insights derived from each statistical model, we apply them to the movement track of a single ringed seal in a case study. For example, the RSF indicated selection of areas with high prey diversity, whereas the SSFs indicated no discernable relationship with prey diversity. Furthermore, the HMM reveals variable associations with prey diversity across different behaviors. Notably, the three models identified different important areas. This case study highlights the critical significance of selecting the appropriate model to identify species-habitat relationships and specific areas of importance. Our comprehensive review provides the foundational information required for making informed decisions when choosing the most suitable statistical methods to address specific questions, such as identifying expansive corridors or protected zones, understanding movement patterns, or studying behaviours.</description>
