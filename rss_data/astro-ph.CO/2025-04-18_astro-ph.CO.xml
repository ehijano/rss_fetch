      <title>N-body simulations of dark matter-baryon interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) particles can interact with particles of the Standard Model. Although there exist constraints from direct and indirect detection experiments, the dynamical evolution of astrophysical objects could provide a promising probe for these interactions. Obtaining astrophysical predictions is challenging and limited by our ability to simulate scatterings between DM and baryonic particles within N-body and hydrodynamics simulations. We develop a novel scheme that allows simulating these interacting dark matter (IDM) models and accurately accounts for their angular and velocity dependence, as well as the mass ratio between the DM and baryonic scattering partners. To describe DM-baryon interactions, we use an N-body code together with its implementation of smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and meshless finite mass. The interaction itself is realised in a pairwise fashion by creating a virtual scattering partner from the baryonic particle and letting it interact with a DM particle using a scattering routine initially developed for self-interacting dark matter. After the interaction, the virtual particle is rejoined with the baryonic particle, fulfilling energy and momentum conservation. Through several test problems, we demonstrate that we can reproduce their analytic solutions with our IDM scheme. We comment on various numerical aspects and challenges as well as describe the limitations of our numerical scheme. Furthermore, we study the impact of IDM on halo formation with a collapsing overdensity. Overall, it is possible to accurately model IDM within N-body and hydrodynamics simulations, commonly used in astrophysics. In consequence, our scheme allows for making novel predictions and obtaining new constraints of DM-baryon scattering.</description>

      <title>Robust non-minimal attractors in many-field inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-field inflation can be inherently non-predictive, with the exception of models with strong attractors. In this work, we focus on models with multiple scalar fields that are non-minimally coupled to the space-time Ricci curvature scalar, motivated by the expectation of a rich particle spectrum at high energies. We show that in this family of models, the single- and multi-field predictions for CMB observables are identical, as long as there exists at least one non-minimal coupling with $\xi \gg 1$. We provide simple expressions for the Hubble scale, the number of $e$-folds, and the turn rate for systems with an arbitrary number of fields and explore the statistical properties for different priors.</description>

      <title>The effect of intrinsic alignments on weak lensing statistics in hydrodynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of weak gravitational lensing surveys has the potential to place stringent constraints on cosmological parameters. However, their analysis is limited by systematics such as the intrinsic alignments of galaxies, which alter weak lensing convergence and can lead to biases in cosmological parameter estimations. In this work, we investigate the impact of intrinsic alignments on non-Gaussian statistics of the weak lensing field using galaxy shapes derived from the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation. We create two catalogs of ray-traced convergence maps: one that includes the measured intrinsic shape of each galaxy and another where all galaxies are randomly rotated to eliminate intrinsic alignments. We compare an exhaustive list of weak lensing statistics between the two catalogs, including the shear-shear correlation function, the map-level angular power spectrum, one-point, peak count, minimum distribution functions, and Minkowski functionals. For each statistic, we assess the level of statistical distinguishability between catalogs for a set of future survey angular areas. Our results reveal strong small-scale correlation in the alignment of galaxies and statistically significant boosts in weak lensing convergence in both positive and negative directions for high-significance peaks and minimums, respectively. Weak lensing analyses utilizing non-Gaussian statistics must account for intrinsic alignments to avoid significantly compromised cosmological inferences.</description>

      <title>The Intergalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intergalactic medium (IGM) comprises all the matter that lies between galaxies. Hosting the vast majority ($\gtrsim 90\%$) of the baryons in the Universe, the IGM is a critical reservoir and probe for cosmology and astrophysics, providing insights into large-scale structure formation and galaxy evolution. In this Chapter, we present an overview of the general properties of the IGM, focusing on their dependence on cosmic environment and cosmic time. Emphasis is given to the basic physical principles that allow us to model the density, temperature, and ionization state of the IGM, supported by results from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We also cover the foundational principles of quasar spectroscopy used to probe the IGM in absorption, with a particular focus on HI absorption lines. Finally, we briefly discuss future prospects and complementary observational techniques to enhance our understanding of the IGM.</description>

      <title>Spherical collapse in DHOST theories and EFT of dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear evolution of matter overdensities using the spherical collapse model in degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories beyond Horndeski, employing the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy approach. We investigate the impact of the EFT parameters characterising DHOST theories on the formation of large-scale structure. We identify the parameter space in which the collapse of the spherical overdensity is prevented by the scalar field turning imaginary at some moment, which allows us to place constraints on the model parameters. We show how the collapse time and the critical density contrast depend on the EFT parameters. To assess the observational implications, we compute the halo mass function using the Press-Schechter formalism. We find that the number density of halos is suppressed compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model due to ``beyond Horndeski'' effects, upon imposing the stability of linear perturbations.</description>

      <title>Skewness as a Probe of Gravity: Real and Redshift Space Counts-In-Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the counts-in-cells reduced skewness $s_3$ for dark matter, halo, and galaxy distributions in both real and redshift space, using the ELEPHANT ($\textit{Extended LEnsing PHysics with ANalytical ray Tracing}$) suite of $N$-body simulations. We compare General Relativity (GR) with two extended (EG) gravity models: $f(R)$ gravity with chameleon screening and the normal-branch Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) model with Vainshtein screening. We quantify the suppression of $s_3$ by redshift-space distortions (RSD), finding that while small-scale skewness is strongly reduced, the $F5$ model retains a $\sim 4\%$ deviation from GR in galaxy samples, corresponding to a $2\sigma$ significance. We show that the ratio $s_3^{\mathrm{RSD}}/s_3^{\mathrm{real}}$ is approximately independent of the gravity model across tracers and redshifts. Our results demonstrate that real-space predictions can help reliably infer redshift-space skewness in both GR and extended gravity, providing a new tool for testing gravity with current and forthcoming galaxy redshift surveys.</description>

      <title>A quadratic estimator view of the transfer function correction in intensity mapping surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In single dish neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping, signal separation methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are used to clean the astrophysical foregrounds. PCA induces a signal loss in the estimated power spectrum, which can be corrected by a transfer function (TF). By injecting mock signals of HI into the data and performing the PCA cleaning, we can use the cleaned mock HI signal to cross-correlate with the original mock, and estimate the signal loss as a TF, $T(\vec{k})$. As expected, a correction of ${T}(\vec{k})^{-1}$ restores the cross-power between the HI and optical galaxies. However, contrary to intuition, the HI auto-power also requires a ${T}(\vec{k})^{-1}$ correction, not ${T}(\vec{k})^{-2}$. The ${T}(\vec{k})^{-1}$ correction is only known empirically through simulations. In this Letter, we show that the ${T}(\vec{k})^{-1}$ correction in auto-power is universal, and can be analytically proven using the quadratic estimator formalism through window function normalisation. The normalisation can also be used to determine the TF correction for any type of linear process. Using the window function, we demonstrate that PCA induces mode-mixing in the power spectrum estimation, which may lead to biases in the model inference.</description>

      <title>Polarization Properties of the Electromagnetic Response to High-frequency Gravitational Wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves (EMWs) can be generated by gravitational waves (GWs) within magnetic field via the Gertsenshtein effect. The conversion probability between GWs and EMWs can be enhanced by inhomogeneities in the electron density and magnetic field within the magnetized plasma of both the Milky Way (MW) and the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the expanding universe. Polarized GWs can induce polarized EMWs, and the polarization properties of these EMWs can be altered by Faraday rotation as they propagate through magnetized plasma. Additionally, the polarization intensity of the EMWs may be weakened due to depolarization effects. In this study, we calculate the enhanced GW-EMW conversion in inhomogeneous magnetized plasma during the propagation of GWs through the universe and our galaxy. We analyze the polarization states of the EMWs generated by polarized GWs and discuss the depolarization effects induced by the medium's irregularities, as well as the differential Faraday rotation occurring in multi-layer polarized radiation. Our work provides alternative methods for detecting GWs and exploring their polarization states, and potentially constrain the parameters of the possible GW sources, especially the primordial black hole (PBH), contributing to the advancement of very-high-frequency GW detection and research.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Parameters Estimate from Persistent Radio Sources of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method to constrain the Hubble constant ($H_0$) by combining fast radio bursts (FRBs) and their persistent radio sources (PRSs) through the observationally validated Yang relation, $ L_{\nu} \propto | \mathrm{RM} | $, which links PRS luminosity to the rotation measure (RM) of the associated FRB. Using a mock sample of PRSs, we demonstrate that the Yang relation can help to unravel the degeneracies among $H_0$, baryon density parameter $\Omega_b$, and baryon fraction in the intergalactic medium $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$ in the traditional approach of using dispersion measure only to perform cosmological analyses. Our method employs a two-stage Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis to constrain $H_0$. Using the available data of six observed PRS systems, we obtain a preliminary constraint of $H_0 = 75 \pm 30~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. We briefly discuss possible refinements of the method by reducing residual degeneracies and systematic uncertainties using future data and physical modeling. Our results indicate that the Yang relation can potentially become a new probe for performing FRB cosmology.</description>

      <title>Purely gravitational dark matter production in warm inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an appealing scenario for the production of purely gravitational dark matter in the background of warm inflation, a mechanism that maintains stable thermal bath during inflation. Through systematic investigation of various gravitational production channels, we reveal distinctive features compared to the standard inflation scenario. Notably, the inflaton annihilation channel in warm inflation exhibits markedly different thermodynamics from the standard inflation paradigm, leading to a suppression on the production of sub-inflaton-mass dark matter. For the production channel of inflationary vacuum fluctuations, we find a correlation of $\rho_\chi\propto m_\chi^{5/2}$ for the conformally coupled dark matter, which expands the feasible range of dark matter mass. Our results also indicates that a minimum temperature threshold of $10^{-6}M_P$ is necessary for warm inflation, which allows adequate dark matter production. With observational constraints, our results provide stringent limits on the mass range of purely gravitational dark matter with sufficient density: $10^{-8}-10^{-2}M_P$ for minimal coupling and $10^{-14}-10^{-2}M_P$ for conformal coupling.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Anisotropic Cosmic Birefringence from CMB B-mode Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic birefringence$-$the rotation of the polarization plane of light as it traverses the universe$-$offers a direct observational window into parity-violating physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we revisit the anisotropic component of cosmic birefringence, which leads to the generation of $B$-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Using an exact theoretical treatment beyond the thin last-scattering surface approximation, we constrain the amplitude of anisotropic birefringence with combined polarization data from SPTpol, ACT, POLARBEAR, and BICEP. The joint analysis yields a best-fit amplitude of $A_{\rm CB} = 0.42^{+0.40}_{-0.34} \times 10^{-4}$, consistent with zero within $2\sigma$, and we place a 95\% confidence-level upper bound of $A_{\rm CB} &lt; 1 \times 10^{-4}$. The constraint is not dominated by any single experiment and remains robust under the inclusion of a possible isotropic rotation angle. These results provide leading constraints on anisotropic cosmic birefringence from CMB $B$-mode polarization and illustrate the potential of upcoming experiments to improve sensitivity to parity-violating effects in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave anisotropies from axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important prediction of inflation is the production of a primordial stochastic gravitational wave background. Observing this background is challenging due to the weakness of the signal and the simultaneous presence of an astrophysical background generated by many unresolved late-time sources. One possible way to distinguish between the two is to examine their anisotropies. In this paper we calculate the primordial correlation function of gravitational wave anisotropies in the cosmological background generated by axion inflation, where the inflaton is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson coupled to gauge fields. In this scenario, tensor modes arise not only from the standard amplification of vacuum fluctuations present in any inflationary model, but also from the inverse decay process of the produced gauge fields. The correlator of gravitational wave anisotropies consists therefore of two main components: the contribution from vacuum tensor modes and the contribution from tensor modes sourced by the gauge fields. Our analysis shows that, while the former, previously studied in the literature, is negligible, the one arising from the sourced tensor modes, normalized by the fractional energy density at interferometer frequencies, can reach values as large as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. This result shows that axion inflation can generate large anisotropies with the potential to be observed by gravitational wave detectors within a reasonable time frame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a mechanism that allows thermal relic dark matter to annihilate efficiently in the Galactic Halo and in galaxy clusters, but not in the lower-velocity environments of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. We realize this within a complete model in which the dark matter consists of two distinct states separated by a small mass splitting. An indirect detection signal is generated only through the coannihilations of these two states, requiring both to be present. In the halo of the Milky Way, the dark matter particles in the lighter state can be excited into the long-lived heavier state through scattering. Once excited, these heavier particles can coannihilate with those in the lighter state, yielding a gamma-ray signal with little or no suppression. By contrast, the dark matter particles in dwarf galaxies do not possess enough kinetic energy to be excited, thereby suppressing the coannihilation rate and corresponding indirect detection signals from those systems. This framework breaks the predictive relationship that ordinarily exists between these respective gamma-ray signals and complicates our ability to interpret the results of indirect detection searches.</description>

      <title>Why $w \ne -1$? Anthropic Selection in a $\Lambda$ + Axion Dark Energy Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a dark energy model composed of a bare negative cosmological constant and a single ultra-light axion, motivated by the string axiverse. Assuming that intelligent observers can exist and observe an accelerating universe, we derive nontrivial constraints on both the axion mass and the bare cosmological constant. The axion mass is bounded from above to avoid fine-tuning of the initial misalignment angle near the hilltop, and from below because extremely light axions would require the bare cosmological constant to be unnaturally close to zero to achieve accelerated expansion. As a result, the anthropically allowed axion mass range typically lies around $m = \mathcal{O}(10)\, H_0$ for a decay constant close to the Planck scale, where $H_0$ is the observed value of the Hubble constant. In this framework, the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0$ generically deviates from $-1$ by $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$, providing a natural explanation for why $w \ne -1$ may be expected. This outcome is intriguingly consistent with recent DESI hints of time-varying dark energy, and offers a compelling anthropic explanation within the $\Lambda$ + axion framework.</description>

      <title>Palatini Linear Attractors Are Back in ACTion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) indicate a scalar spectral index $n_s \simeq 0.9743$, in excellent agreement with the prediction of linear inflation. However, the corresponding tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \simeq 0.0667$ is in tension with current observational bounds. In this work, we investigate how this tension can be alleviated in the Palatini formulation of gravity. We consider two classes of models based on simple monomial potentials: (i) models with a non-minimal coupling between the inflaton and gravity, and (ii) models including an $\alpha R^2$ term. In the first case, we find that a quadratic potential with a linear non-minimal coupling leads to the linear inflation attractor, with $r$ suppressed as $\xi$ increases. In the second case, we show that a linear potential can yield values of $r$ consistent with observations for sufficiently large $\alpha$. Our results demonstrate that simple monomial models can remain compatible with current observational constraints when embedded in the Palatini framework.</description>

      <title>Detecting light dark matter with prompt-delayed events in neutrino experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the prompt-delayed signals induced by knockout neutrons from the quasi-elastic scattering in neutrino experiments provides a new avenue for detecting light dark matter. As an illustration, we consider the detection of atmospheric dark matter in the liquid scintillator detectors. The results show that the constraint on the DM-nucleon interaction from KamLAND is approximately one order of magnitude more stringent than those obtained from the elastic nuclear recoil signals in dark matter direct detection experiments. Furthermore, a larger volume neutrino experiment, such as JUNO, is expected to significantly enhance the light dark matter detection sensitivity through the quasi-elastic scattering.</description>

      <title>Forecasts on Anisotropic Cosmic Birefringence Constraints for CMB Experiment in the Northern Hemisphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of cosmic birefringence through Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments is a key research area in cosmology and particle physics, providing a critical test for Lorentz and CPT symmetries. This paper focuses on an upcoming CMB experiment in the mid-latitude of the Northern Hemisphere, and investigates the potential to detect anisotropies in cosmic birefringence. Applying a quadratic estimator on simulated polarization data, we reconstruct the power spectrum of anisotropic cosmic birefringence successfully and estimate constraints on the amplitude of the spectrum, $A_{\mathrm{CB}}$, assuming scale invariance. The forecast is based on a wide-scan observation strategy during winter, yielding an effective sky coverage of approximately 23.6%. We consider two noise scenarios corresponding to the short-term and long-term phases of the experiment. Our results show that with a small aperture telescope operating at 95/150GHz, the $2\sigma$ upper bound for $A_{\mathrm{CB}}$ can reach 0.017 under the low noise scenario when adopting the method of merging multi-frequency data in map domain, and merging multi-frequency data in spectrum domain tightens the limit by about 10%.A large-aperture telescope with the same bands is found to be more effective, tightening the $2\sigma$ upper limit to 0.0062.</description>

      <title>High-Significance Detection of Correlation Between the Unresolved Gamma-Ray Background and the Large Scale Cosmic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our understanding of the $\gamma$-ray sky has improved dramatically in the past decade, however, the unresolved $\gamma$-ray background (UGRB) still has a potential wealth of information about the faintest $\gamma$-ray sources pervading the Universe. Statistical cross-correlations with tracers of cosmic structure can indirectly identify the populations that most characterize the $\gamma$-ray background. In this study, we analyze the angular correlation between the $\gamma$-ray background and the matter distribution in the Universe as traced by gravitational lensing, leveraging more than a decade of observations from the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) and 3 years of data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We detect a correlation at signal-to-noise ratio of 8.9. Most of the statistical significance comes from large scales, demonstrating, for the first time, that a substantial portion of the UGRB aligns with the mass clustering of the Universe as traced by weak lensing. Blazars provide a plausible explanation for this signal, especially if those contributing to the correlation reside in halos of large mass ($\sim 10^{14} M_{\odot}$) and account for approximately 30-40 % of the UGRB above 10 GeV. Additionally, we observe a preference for a curved $\gamma$-ray energy spectrum, with a log-parabolic shape being favored over a power-law. We also discuss the possibility of modifications to the blazar model and the inclusion of additional $gamma$-ray sources, such as star-forming galaxies or particle dark matter.</description>

      <title>The connection between high-redshift galaxies and Lyman ${\alpha}$ transmission in the Sherwood-Relics simulations of patchy reionisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has suggested that, during reionisation, spatial variations in the ionising radiation field should produce enhanced Ly ${\alpha}$ forest transmission at distances of tens of comoving Mpc from high-redshift galaxies. We demonstrate that the Sherwood-Relics suite of hybrid radiation-hydrodynamical simulations are qualitatively consistent with this interpretation. The shape of the galaxy--Ly ${\alpha}$ transmission cross-correlation is sensitive to both the mass of the haloes hosting the galaxies and the volume averaged fraction of neutral hydrogen in the IGM, $\bar{x}_{\rm HI}$. The reported excess Ly ${\alpha}$ forest transmission on scales r ~ 10 cMpc at $\langle z \rangle \approx 5.2$ -- as measured using C IV absorbers as proxies for high-redshift galaxies -- is quantitatively reproduced by Sherwood-Relics at z = 6 if we assume the galaxies that produce ionising photons are hosted in haloes with mass $M_{\rm h}\geq 10^{10}~h^{-1}\,{\rm M}_\odot$. However, this redshift mismatch is equivalent to requiring $\bar{x}_{\rm HI}\sim 0.1$ at $z\simeq 5.2$, which is inconsistent with the observed Ly ${\alpha}$ forest effective optical depth distribution. We suggest this tension may be partly resolved if the minimum C IV absorber host halo mass at z &gt; 5 is larger than $M_{\rm h}=10^{10}~h^{-1}\,{\rm M}_\odot$. After reionisation completes, relic IGM temperature fluctuations will continue to influence the shape of the cross-correlation on scales of a few comoving Mpc at $4 \leq z \leq 5$. Constraining the redshift evolution of the cross-correlation over this period may therefore provide further insight into the timing of reionisation.</description>

      <title>Flattened bispectrum of the scalar-induced gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent pulsar timing array collaborations have reported evidence of the stochastic gravitational wave background. The gravitational waves induced by primordial curvature perturbations, referred to as scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs), could potentially be the physical origins of the gravitational wave background. Due to nonlinearity of Einstein's gravity, there is non-Gaussianity of SIGWs even when the sourced primordial curvature perturbation is Gaussian. This paper investigates the intrinsic non-Gaussianity of SIGWs influenced by formation of primordial black holes. Specifically, we examine whether spectral width of Gaussian primordial curvature perturbations can affect non-Gaussianity of SIGWs. In order to ensure us to correctly quantify the degree of non-Gaussianity, we introduce an oscillation average scheme that can conserve the exact results of skewness of SIGWs. In this framework, the oscillation of SIGWs not only suppresses the bispectrum amplitude but also leads to a flattened-type bispectrum. Based on our results of skewness, it is found that the primordial curvature power spectrum with a narrower width can enhance the intrinsic non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>The Non-Relativistic Effective Field Theory Of Dark Matter-Electron Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic excitations in atomic, molecular, and crystal targets are at the forefront of the ongoing search for light, sub-GeV dark matter (DM). In many light DM-electron interactions the energy and momentum deposited is much smaller than the electron mass, motivating a non-relativistic (NR) description of the electron. Thus, for any target, light DM-electron phenomenology relies on understanding the interactions between the DM and electron in the NR limit. In this work we derive the NR effective field theory (EFT) of general DM-electron interactions from a top-down perspective, starting from general high-energy DM-electron interaction Lagrangians. This provides an explicit connection between high-energy theories and their low-energy phenomenology in electron excitation based experiments. Furthermore, we derive Feynman rules for the DM-electron NR EFT, allowing observables to be computed diagrammatically, which can systematically explain the presence of in-medium screening effects in general DM models. We use these Feynman rules to compute absorption, scattering, and dark Thomson scattering rates for a wide variety of high-energy DM models.</description>

      <title>SMILES: Potentially Higher Ionizing Photon Production Efficiency in Overdense Regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topology of reionization and the environments where galaxies efficiently produce ionizing photons are key open questions. For the first time, we investigate the trend between ionizing photon production efficiency, $\xi_{\rm ion}$, and galaxy overdensity, $\log(1+\delta)$. We analyze the ionizing properties of 79 galaxies between $1.0 &lt; z &lt; 5.2$ using JWST NIRSpec medium-resolution spectra from the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES) program. Among these, 67 galaxies have H$\alpha$ coverage, spanning $1.0 &lt; z &lt; 3.1$. The galaxy overdensity, $\log(1+\delta)$, is measured using the JADES photometric catalog, which covers the SMILES footprint. For the subset with H$\alpha$ coverage, we find that $\log\xi_{\rm ion}$ is positively correlated with $\log(1+\delta)$, with a slope of $0.94_{-0.46}^{+0.46}$. Additionally, the mean $\xi_{\rm ion}$ for galaxies in overdense regions ($\log(1+\delta) &gt; 0.1$) is 2.43 times that of galaxies in lower density regions ($\log(1+\delta) &lt; 0.1$). This strong trend is found to be independent of redshift evolution. Furthermore, our results confirm the robust correlations between $\xi_{\rm ion}$ and the rest-frame equivalent widths of the [O III] or H$\alpha$ emission lines. Our results suggest that galaxies in high-density regions are efficient producers of ionizing photons.</description>

      <title>Directional Direct Detection of MeV Scale Boosted Dark Matter in Two Component Dark Matter Scenario via Dark Photon Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores a two-component dark matter model in which one component, heavier dark matter, annihilates into a lighter dark matter. The lighter dark matter is expected to generate detectable signals in detectors due to its enhanced momentum, enabling direct detection even for MeV-scale dark matter. We investigate the effectiveness of directional direct detections, especially the nuclear emulsion detector NEWSdm, in verifying these boosted dark matter particles through nuclear recoil. In particular, we focus on light nuclei, such as protons and carbon, as suitable targets for this detection method due to their high sensitivity to MeV-scale dark matter. By modeling the interactions mediated by a dark photon in a hidden U(1)$_D$ gauge symmetry framework, we calculate the expected dark matter flux and scattering rates for various detector configurations. Our results show that nuclear emulsions have the potential to yield distinct, direction-sensitive dark matter signals from the Galactic center, providing a new way to probe low-mass dark matter parameter spaces that evade conventional detection methods.</description>
