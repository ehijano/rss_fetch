      <title>An Attention-Based Stochastic Simulator for Multisite Extremes to Evaluate Nonstationary, Cascading Flood Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compound flood risks from spatially and temporally clustered extremes challenge traditional risk models and insurance portfolios that often neglect correlated risks across regions. Spatiotemporally clustered floods exhibit fat-tail behavior, modulated by low-frequency hydroclimatic variability and large-scale moisture transport. Nonstationary stochastic simulators and regional compound event models aim to capture such tail risk, but have not yet unified spatial and temporal extremes under low-frequency hydroclimatic variability. We introduce a novel attention-based framework for multisite flood generation conditional on a multivariate hydroclimatic signal with explainable attribution to global sub-decadal to multi-decadal climate variability. Our simulator combines wavelet signal processing, transformer-based multivariate time series forecasting, and modified Neyman-Scott joint clustering to simulate climate-informed spatially compounding and temporally cascading floods. Applied to a Mississippi River Basin case study, the model generates distributed portfolios of plausibly clustered flood risks across space and time, providing a basis for simulating spatiotemporally correlated losses characteristic of flood-induced damage.</description>

      <title>An End-to-End Differentiable, Graph Neural Network-Embedded Pore Network Model for Permeability Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of permeability in porous media is essential for modeling subsurface flow. While pure data-driven models offer computational efficiency, they often lack generalization across scales and do not incorporate explicit physical constraints. Pore network models (PNMs), on the other hand, are physics-based and efficient but rely on idealized geometric assumptions to estimate pore-scale hydraulic conductance, limiting their accuracy in complex structures. To overcome these limitations, we present an end-to-end differentiable hybrid framework that embeds a graph neural network (GNN) into a PNM. In this framework, the analytical formulas used for conductance calculations are replaced by GNN-based predictions derived from pore and throat features. The predicted conductances are then passed to the PNM solver for permeability computation. In this way, the model avoids the idealized geometric assumptions of PNM while preserving the physics-based flow calculations. The GNN is trained without requiring labeled conductance data, which can number in the thousands per pore network; instead, it learns conductance values by using a single scalar permeability as the training target. This is made possible by backpropagating gradients through both the GNN (via automatic differentiation) and the PNM solver (via a discrete adjoint method), enabling fully coupled, end-to-end training. The resulting model achieves high accuracy and generalizes well across different scales, outperforming both pure data-driven and traditional PNM approaches. Gradient-based sensitivity analysis further reveals physically consistent feature influences, enhancing model interpretability. This approach offers a scalable and physically informed framework for permeability prediction in complex porous media, reducing model uncertainty and improving accuracy.</description>

      <title>Surface tension estimation of bubble nuclei in magma using spinodal pressure and nonclassical nucleation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efforts to estimate the magma decompression rate from the vesicular texture of volcanic products have progressed through the development of theoretical models and laboratory experiments. The theoretical model is based on nucleation theory, with the surface tension between the melt and bubble nucleus being the parameter that most strongly governs nucleation. Since direct measurement of surface tension is difficult, it has been calculated by inverting the bubble number density from experimental samples using classical or nonclassical nucleation theory formulas. However, in the nonclassical case, which accounts for the supersaturation dependence of surface tension, the pressure at the spinodal limit (where surface tension becomes zero) was previously unknown, necessitating complex mathematical operations. In this study, the spinodal pressure determined from the Gibbs energy curve was substituted into the nonclassical formula by approximating the water-saturated silicate melt as a two-component symmetric regular solution composed of silicate and water. This approach allowed for a more straightforward estimation of surface tension using data from past decompression experiments. Nevertheless, the resulting surface tension values were more scattered than those obtained using the classical formula, suggesting that applying the nonclassical formula to magma vesiculation is not valid at present. Resolving this issue will likely require an integrated understanding of the dependence of surface tension on both supersaturation and bubble radius. Such understanding would enable more accurate estimation of surface tension and contribute to reconciling the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental bubble number density values.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic solutions for self-similarly expanding fault slip induced by fluid injection at constant rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the circular, self-similar expansion of frictional rupture due to fluid injected at a constant rate. Fluid migrates within a thin permeable layer parallel to and containing the fault plane. When the Poisson ratio $\nu=0$, self-similarity of the fluid pressure implies fault slip also evolves in an axisymmetric, self-similar manner, reducing the three-dimensional problem for the evolution of fault slip to a single self-similar dimension. The rupture radius grows as $\lambda \sqrt{4\alpha_{hy} t}$, where $t$ is time since the start of injection and $\alpha_{hy}$ is the hydraulic diffusivity of the pore fluid pressure. The prefactor $\lambda$ is determined by a single parameter, $T$, which depends on the pre-injection stress state and injection conditions. The prefactor has the range $0&lt;\lambda&lt;\infty$, the lower and upper limits of which correspond to marginal pressurization of the fault and critically stressed conditions, in which the fault-resolved shear stress is close to the pre-injection fault strength. In both limits, we derive solutions for slip by perturbation expansion, to arbitrary order. In the marginally pressurized limit ($\lambda\rightarrow 0$), the perturbation is regular and the series expansion is convergent. For the critically stressed limit ($\lambda\rightarrow \infty$), the perturbation is singular, contains a boundary layer and an outer solution, and the series is divergent. In this case, we provide a composite solution with uniform convergence over the entire rupture using a matched asymptotic expansion. We provide error estimates of the asymptotic expansions in both limits, and demonstrate optimal truncation of the singular perturbation in the critically stressed limit.</description>
