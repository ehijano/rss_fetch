      <title>Perpendicular ion heating in turbulence and reconnection: magnetic moment breaking by coherent fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interaction of an ion with a fluctuation in the electromagnetic fields that is localized in both space and time. We study the scale-dependence of the interaction in both space and time, deriving a generic form for the ion's energy change, which involves an exponential cutoff based on the characteristic timescale of the electromagnetic fluctuation. This leads to diffusion in energy in both $v_\perp$ and $v_\parallel$. We show how to apply our results to general plasma physics phenomena, and specifically to Alfv\'enic turbulence and to reconnection. Our theory can be viewed as a unification of previous models of stochastic ion heating, cyclotron heating, and reconnection heating in a single theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Advancing Resource Extraction Systems in Martian Volcanic Terrain: Rover Design, Power Consumption and Hazard Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a schematic plan for in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) in Martian volcanic terrains. The work investigated the complexity of volcanic terrains and Martian environmental hazards and suggested comprehensive engineering strategies to overcome the odds and establish a successful mining program in Martian volcanic regions. Slope stabilization methods - such as terracing and anchored drilling rigs - with terrain-adaptive rovers capable of autonomous operations on steep unstable slopes has been suggested as feasible solutions to navigate the complex geological terrains of Martian volcanoes. The mid range rover design with a mass of approximately 2.1 t, proposed here for mining operations, incorporates a six-wheel rocker-bogie suspension, anchoring-enabled drilling arm, dust-mitigation solar arrays, and advanced sensing systems for hazard detection and navigation. A comparative analysis regarding choice of roads and rails for building transport infrastructure has also been performed. We have also looked into the energy requirement of the rover to work under extreme environmental conditions of Mars and suggested a combination of solar and nuclear power to account for the huge energy requirements of sustained operations on Mars. The results demonstrate that mission success in these environments depends on integrating mechanical resilience, environmental adaptability, and operational autonomy, enabling sustainable access to resources in one of Mars' most geologically challenging settings.</description>

      <title>Neural Enhancement of the Traditional Wang-Sheeley-Arge Solar Wind Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model has been the cornerstone of operational solar wind forecasting for nearly two decades, owing to its simplicity and physics-based formalism. However, its performance is strongly dependent on several empirical parameters that are typically fixed or tuned manually, limiting its adaptability across varying solar conditions. In this study, we present a neural enhancement to the WSA framework (referred to as WSA+) that systematically optimizes the empirical parameters of the WSA solar wind speed relation using in-situ observations within a differentiable physics-constrained pipeline. The approach operates in two stages: first, a neural optimizer adjusts WSA parameters independently for each Carrington Rotation to better match the observed solar wind data. Then, a neural network learns to predict these optimized speed maps directly from magnetogram-derived features. This enables generalization of the optimization process and allows inference for new solar conditions without manual tuning. The developed WSA+ preserves the interpretability of the original relation while significantly improving the match with OMNI in-situ data across multiple performance metrics, including correlation and error statistics. It consistently outperforms the traditional WSA relation across both low and high solar activity periods, with average improvements of approximately 40 percent. By integrating data-driven learning with physical constraints, WSA+ offers a robust and adaptable enhancement, with immediate utility as a drop-in replacement in global heliospheric modeling pipelines.</description>
