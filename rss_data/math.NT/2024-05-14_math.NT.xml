      <title>Modularity of certain products of the Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the modularity of the functions of the form $r(\tau)^ar(2\tau)^b$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers with $(a,b)\neq (0,0)$ and $r(\tau)$ is the Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction, which may be considered as companions to the Ramanujan's function $k(\tau)=r(\tau)r(2\tau)^2$. In particular, we show that under some condition on $a$ and $b$, there are finitely many such functions generating the field of all modular functions on the congruence subgroup $\Gamma_1(10)$. Furthermore, we establish certain arithmetic properties of the function $l(\tau)=r(\tau)^{-2}r(2\tau)$, which can be used to evaluate these functions. We employ the methods of Lee and Park, and some properties of $\eta$-quotients and generalized $\eta$-quotients to prove our results.</description>

      <title>A Generalization of the Erd\H{o}s-Kac Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a natural number $n$, let $\omega\left(n\right)$ denote the number of distinct prime factors of $n$, let $Z$ denote a standard normal variable, and let $P_{n}$ denote the uniform distribution on $\left\{ 1,\ldots,n\right\} $. The Erd\H{o}s-Kac Theorem states that if $N\left(n\right)$ is a uniformly distributed variable on $\lbrace 1,\ldots,n \rbrace$, then $\omega\left(N\left(n\right)\right)$ is asymptotically normally distributed as $n\to \infty$ with both mean and variance equal to $\log \log n$. The contribution of this paper is a generalization of the Erd\H{o}s-Kac Theorem to a larger class of random variables by considering perturbations of the uniform probability mass $1/n$ in the following sense. Denote by $\mathbb{P}_{n}$ a probability distribution on $\left\{ 1,\ldots,n\right\} $ given by $\mathbb{P}_{n}\left(i\right)=1/n+\varepsilon_{i,n}$. We provide sufficient conditions on $\varepsilon_{i,n}$ so that the number of distinct prime factors of a $\mathbb{P}_{n}$-distributed random variable is asymptotically normally distributed, as $n\to \infty$, with both mean and variance equal to $\log \log n$. Our main result is applied to prove that the number of distinct prime factors of a positive integer with the Harmonic$\left(n\right)$ distribution also tends to the normal distribution, as $n\to \infty$. In addition, we explore sequences of distributions on the natural numbers such that $\omega(n)$ is normally distributed in the limit. In addition, one of our theorems and its corollaries generalize a result from the literature involving the limit of $Zeta\left(s\right)$ distributions as the parameter $s \to 1$.</description>

      <title>Square-full values of quadratic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $\textit{square-full}$ number is a positive integer for which all its prime divisors divide itself at least twice. The counting function of square-full integers of the form $f(n)$ for $n\leqslant N$ is denoted by $S^{{\mathstrut\hspace{0.05em}\blacksquare}}_f(N)$. We have known that for a relatively prime pair $(a,b)\in\mathbb N\times \mathbb N\cup\{0\}$ with a linear polynomial $f(x)=ax+b$, its counting function is $\asymp_{a,b} N^\frac{1}{2}$. Fix $\varepsilon&gt;0$, for an admissible quadratic polynomial $f(x)$, we prove that $$S^{{\mathstrut\hspace{0.05em}\blacksquare}}_f(N)\ll_{\varepsilon, f} N^{\varpi+\varepsilon}$$ for some absolute constant $\varpi&lt;1/2$. Under the assumption on the $abc$ conjecture, we expect the upper bound to be $O_{\varepsilon,f}(N^\varepsilon)$.</description>

      <title>Values of random polynomials under the Riemann hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known result states that the square-free counting function up to $N$ is $N/\zeta(2)+O(N^{1/2})$. This corresponds to the identity polynomial $\text{Id}(x)$. It is expected that the error term in question is $O_\varepsilon(N^{\frac{1}{4}+\varepsilon})$ for arbitraliy small $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Usually, it is more difficult to obtain similar order of error term for a higher degree polynomial $f(x)$ in place of $\text{Id}(x)$. Under the Riemann hypothesis, we show that the error term, on average in a weak sense, over polynomials of arbitrary degree, is of the expected order $O_\varepsilon(N^{\frac{1}{4}+\varepsilon})$.</description>

      <title>On uniform polynomial approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n$ be a positive integer and $\xi$ a transcendental real number. We are interested in bounding from above the uniform exponent of polynomial approximation $\widehat{\omega}_n(\xi)$. Davenport and Schmidt's original 1969 inequality $\widehat{\omega}_n(\xi)\leq 2n-1$ was improved recently, and the best upper bound known to date is $2n-2$ for each $n\geq 10$. In this paper, we develop new techniques leading us to the improved upper bound $2n-\frac{1}{3}n^{1/3}+\mathcal{O}(1)$.</description>

      <title>Cohomology with Sym^g coefficients for congruence subgroups of SL_4(Z) and Galois representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the computations in our prior work to find the cohomology in degree five of a congruence subgroup Gamma of SL_4(Z) with coefficients in Sym^g(K^4), twisted by a nebentype character eta, along with the action of the Hecke algebra. This is the top cuspidal degree. In this paper we take K to be a finite field of large characteristic, as a proxy for the complex numbers. For each Hecke eigenclass found, we produce the unique Galois representation that appears to be attached to it. The computations require modifications to our previous algorithms to accommodate the fact that the coefficients are not one-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Sums of Hurwitz class numbers, CM modular forms, and primes of the form $x^2+ny^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider sums of Hurwitz class numbers of the type $\sum_{t \equiv m \pmod{M}}H(4p-t^2)$, where $M$ is composite. For $M=6$ and $8$, we show that these sums can be expressed in terms of coefficients of CM cusp forms. This leads to explicit formulas which depend on the expression of $p$ in the form $x^2+ny^2$.</description>

      <title>A note on \'etale $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules in families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda$ be a complete noetherian local ring with finite residue field of characteristic $p$ and $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$ a $p$-adic field. We show that, by deformation of the structure sheaf on the (transversal) prismatic site of a bounded $p$-adic formal scheme $\mathfrak{X}$, the category of prismatic $(\Lambda,F)$-crystals on $\mathfrak{X}$ is equivalent to $\Lambda$-\'etale local systems on the generic adic fiber of $\mathfrak{X}$ and that the cohomology of $(\Lambda,F)$-crystals recovers the pro-\'etale cohomology of the corresponding local systems. The proof follows the strategy used in \cite{bhatt2023prismatic} and \cite{marks2023prismatic}. From this we construct an isomorphism between Iwasawa cohomology of a $p$-adic Lie extension of $K$ and prismatic cohomology. Following \cite{wu2021galois}, we then reprove Dee's classical result \cite{article} on the equivalence between families of Galois representations and \'etale $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules.</description>

      <title>Mordell-Tornheim zeta functions and functional equations for Herglotz-Zagier type functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mordell-Tornheim zeta function and the Herglotz-Zagier function $F(x)$ are two important functions in Mathematics. By generalizing a special case of the former, namely $\Theta(z, x)$, we show that the theories of these functions are inextricably woven. We obtain a three-term functional equation for $\Theta(z, x)$ as well as decompose it in terms of the Herglotz-Hurwitz function $\Phi(z, x)$. This decomposition can be conceived as a two-term functional equation for $\Phi(z, x)$. Through this result, we are not only able to get Zagier's identity relating $F(x)$ with $F(1/x)$ but also two-term functional equation for Ishibashi's generalization of $F(x)$, namely, $\Phi_k(x)$ which has been sought after for over twenty years. We further generalize $\Theta(z, x)$ by incorporating two Gauss sums, each associated to a Dirichlet character, and decompose it in terms of an interesting integral which involves the Fekete polynomial as well as the character polylogarithm. This result gives infinite families of functional equations of Herglotz-type integrals out of which only two, due to Kumar and Choie, were known so far. The first one among the two involves the integral $J(x)$ who special values have received a lot of attention, more recently, in the work of Muzzaffar and Williams, and in that of Radchenko and Zagier. Analytic continuation of our generalization of $\Theta(z, x)$ is also accomplished which allows us to obtain transformations between certain double series and Herglotz-type integrals or their explicit evaluations.</description>

      <title>On the distance problem over finite p-adic rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the distance problem in the setting of finite p-adic rings. In odd dimensions, our results are essentially sharp. In even dimensions, we clarify the conjecture and provide examples to support it. Surprisingly, compared to the finite field case, in this setting, we are able to provide a large family of sets such that the distance conjecture holds. By developing new restriction type estimates associated to circles and orbits, with a group theoretic argument, we will prove the $4/3$-parallel result in the two dimensions. This answers a question raised by Alex Iosevich. In a more general scenario, the existence/distribution of geometric/graph configurations will be also considered in this paper. Our results present improvements and extensions of recent results due to Ben Lichtin (2019, 2023). In comparison with Lichtin's method, our approach is much simpler and flexible, which is also one of the novelties in this paper.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the blow-up invariance for Hodge-Witt sheaves with modulus, which is a generalization of a result of Koizumi for Witt sheaves and that of Kelly-Miyazaki and Koizumi for Hodge sheaves.

Abstract: We prove a general independent equidistribution result for Gauss sums associated to $n$ monomials in $r$ variable multiplicative characters over a finite field, which generalizes several previous equidistribution results for Gauss and Jacobi sums. As an application, we show that any relation satisfied by these Gauss sums must be a combination of the conjugation relation $G(\chi)G(\overline\chi)=\pm q$, Galois conjugation invariance and the Hasse-Davenport product formula.</description>

      <title>A class of functional identities associated to curves over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Goss zeta values can be found, in some cases, as evaluations of a new type of rigid analytic function on projective curves $X$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, called "Pellarin $L$-series". In the case of genus $0$ and $1$, Pellarin and Green--Papanikolas further determined functional identities for Pellarin $L$-series, in partial analogy with the functional equation of Dirichlet $L$-series.
  The aim of this paper is to prove that a generalization of these functional identities holds in arbitrary genus. Our proof exploits the topological nature of divisors on the curve $X$, as well as the introduction of an "adjoint shtuka function". This allows us to reinterpret Pellarin $L$-series as dual versions of the special functions studied by Angl\`es, Ngo Dac, and Tavares Ribeiro.</description>

      <title>CM points on Shimura curves via QM-equivariant isogeny volcanoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study CM points on the Shimura curves $X_0^D(N)_{/\mathbb{Q}}$ and $X_1^D(N)_{/\mathbb{Q}}$, parametrizing abelian surfaces with quaternionic multiplication and extra level structure. A description of the locus of points with CM by a specified order is obtained for general level, via an isogeny-volcano approach in analogy to work of Clark and Clark--Saia in the $D=1$ case of modular curves. This allows for a count of all points with CM by a specified order on such a curve, and a determination of all primitive residue fields and primitive degrees of such points on $X_0^D(N)_{/\mathbb{Q}}$. We leverage computations of least degrees towards the existence of sporadic CM points on $X_0^D(N)_{/\mathbb{Q}}$.</description>

      <title>On Erd\H{o}s sums of almost primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1935, Erd\H{o}s proved that the sums $f_k=\sum_n 1/(n\log n)$, over integers $n$ with exactly $k$ prime factors, are bounded by an absolute constant, and in 1993 Zhang proved that $f_k$ is maximized by the prime sum $f_1=\sum_p 1/(p\log p)$. According to a 2013 conjecture of Banks and Martin, the sums $f_k$ are predicted to decrease monotonically in $k$. In this article, we show that the sums restricted to odd integers are indeed monotonically decreasing in $k$, sufficiently large. By contrast, contrary to the conjecture we prove that the sums $f_k$ increase monotonically in $k$, sufficiently large. Our main result gives an asymptotic for $f_k$ which identifies the (negative) secondary term, namely $f_k = 1 - (a+o(1))k^2/2^k$ for an explicit constant $a= 0.0656\cdots$. This is proven by a refined method combining real and complex analysis, whereas the classical results of Sathe and Selberg on products of $k$ primes imply the weaker estimate $f_k=1+O_{\varepsilon}(k^{\varepsilon-1/2})$. We also give an alternate, probability-theoretic argument related to the Dickman distribution. Here the proof reduces to showing a sequence of integrals converges exponentially quickly to $e^{-\gamma}$, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On the Constants of the Lang-Trotter Conjecture for CM Elliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2021, Daqing Wan and Ping Xi studied the equivalence of the Lang-Trotter conjecture for CM elliptic curves and the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture for primes represented by a quadratic polynomial. Wan and Xi provided an alternative description of the Lang-Trotter conjecture under the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture. They obtained an explicit constant $\overline{\omega}_{E,r}$ in the asymptotics of the Lang-Trotter conjecture. They further conjectured that this particular constant would be equal to the constant $C_{E,r}$ in the asymptotics of the original Lang-Trotter conjecture. In this paper, we verify the same for $20$ CM elliptic curves, which also establishes the equivalence of the Lang-Trotter Conjecture and the Hardy-Littlewood Conjecture with respect to $r$, for these CM elliptic curves.</description>

      <title>Moments and non-vanishing of $L$-functions over thin subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain an asymptotic formula for all moments of Dirichlet $L$-functions $L(1,\chi)$ modulo $p$ when averaged over a subgroup of characters $\chi$ of size $(p-1)/d$ with $\varphi(d)=o(\log p)$. Assuming the infinitude of Mersenne primes, the range of our result is optimal and improves and generalises the previous result of S. Louboutin and M. Munsch (2022) for second moments. We also use our ideas to get an asymptotic formula for the second moment of $L(1/2,\chi)$ over subgroups of characters of similar size. This leads to non-vanishing results in this family where the proportion obtained depends on the height of the smallest rational number lying in the dual group. Additionally, we prove that, in both cases, we can take much smaller subgroups for almost all primes $p$. Our method relies on pointwise and average estimates on small solutions of linear congruences which in turn leads us to use and modify some results for product sets of Farey fractions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a cuspidal automorphic representation of GL(2) over a global function field, we establish a comprehensive cuspidality criterion for symmetric powers. The proof is via passage to the Galois side, possible over function fields thanks to the Langlands correspondence of L. Lafforgue and additional results of G. Henniart and B. Lemaire. Our work is guided by the number fields results of Kim-Shahidi and Ramakrishnan.</description>

Abstract: Wiles' work on Fermat's last Theorem highlighted the power of $p$-adic methods to prove the existence of analytic continuations of $\zeta$ and $L$ functions. These methods have become considerably more sophisticated in recent years, and have produced a wealth of beautiful results: Hasse--Weil conjecture for genus $2$ curves, holomorphy of $L$-functions of symmetric powers of modular forms, etc. We present some of these advances.</description>

      <title>Values and derivative values at nonpositive integers of generalized multiple Hurwitz zeta functions, applications to Witten zeta functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to provide explicit formulas for values and derivative values along a direction of some generalized Hurwitz multizeta functions at nonpositive integers. We will express these values in terms of Bernoulli polynomials, and the derivative values in terms of Bernoulli polynomials, of derivative values at nonpositive integers of the Hurwitz zeta function, and of derivative values at nonpositive integers of some generalized Barnes zeta functions. Then we will apply these formulas in order to compute the values and the derivative values at $s=0$ of the Witten zeta functions $\zeta_{\mathfrak{g}_2}$ and $\zeta_{\mathfrak{so}(5)}$. As an application, we will find an explicit asymptotic formula for the number of representations of dimension $n$ of the exceptional Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_2$ using a generalized Meinardus-type theorem proved by Bridges, Brindle, Bringmann, and Franke.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we will modify the Breuil-Hellmann-Schraen's (more generally, resp.,Breuil-Ding's) local model for the trianguline variety (resp.,Bernstein paraboline variety) to certain semistable (resp., potentially semistable) non-crystalline point with regular Hodge-Tate weights. Then we prove the existence of expected companion points on the (definite) eigenvariety and locally analytic socle conjecture for certain semistable non-crystalline Galois representations (in other words, the so-called Steinberg case), under some wild hypothesis on on trianguline variety and the usual Taylor-Wiles assumptions.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a finite set of positive integers and $y\geq 1$. We give an effective lower bound of the cardinality of the set $\{n\in\mathcal{A};\,p|n\Longrightarrow p\leq y\}$ under the condition of a good knowledge of the level of distribution of the set $\mathcal{A}$. Some consequences are studied: an application to the friable values of irreducible polynomials or binary forms with integer coefficients, and an application to shifted friable numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study algebraic independence problem for the Taylor coefficients of the Anderson-Thakur series arisen as deformation series of positive characteristic multiple zeta values (abbreviated as MZV's). These Taylor coefficients are simply specialization of hyperderivatives of the Anderson-Thakur series. We consider the prolongation of t-motives associated with MZV's, and then determine the dimension of the t-motivic Galois groups in question under certain hypothesis. By using Papanikolas' theory, it enables us to obtain the desired algebraic independence result.</description>

Abstract: We study the zeros of cusp forms in the Miller basis whose vanishing order at infinity is a fixed number $m$. We show that for sufficiently large weights, the finite zeros in the fundamental domain of such forms, all lie on the circular part of the boundary of the fundamental domain. We further show and quantify an effective bound for the weight, which is linear in terms of $m$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the fields of definition of cyclic isogenies on elliptic curves to prove the following uniformity result: for any number field $F_0$ which satisfies an isogeny condition, there exists a constant $B:=B(F_0)\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ such that for any finite extension $L/F_0$ whose degree $[L:F_0]$ is coprime to $B$, one has for all elliptic curves $E_{/F_0}$ with $j$-invariant $\neq 0, 1728$ that any $L$-rational cyclic isogeny on $E$ must be $F_0$-rational. We also prove unconditional results for the mod-$\ell$ Galois representations of non-CM elliptic curves with an $F_0$-rational $\ell$-isogeny when $\ell$ is uniformly large.</description>

Abstract: Let $N$ denotes a sufficiently large even integer, we define $D_{1,2}(N)$ as the same as those in previous articles about Chen's theorem. In this paper, we show that $D_{1,2}(N) \geqslant 1.267 \frac{C(N) N}{(\log N)^2}$, improving previous record of Wu about $40\%$. We also get similar results on twin prime problem and additive representations of integers. An important step in the proof is the application of a theorem of Lichtman.</description>

Abstract: Let $d$ and $n$ be positive integers, and $E/F$ be a separable field extension of degree $m=\binom{n+d}{n}$. We show that if $|F| &gt; 2$, then there exists a point $P\in \mathbb{P}^n(E)$ which does not lie on any degree $d$ hypersurface defined over $F$. In other words, the $m$ Galois conjugates of $P$ impose independent conditions on the $m$-dimensional $F$-vector space of degree $d$ forms in $x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n$. As an application, we determine the maximal dimensions of linear systems $\mathcal{L}_1$ and $\mathcal{L}_2$ of hypersurfaces in $\mathbb P^n$ over a finite field $F$, where every $F$-member of $\mathcal{L}_1$ is reducible and every $F$-member of $\mathcal{L}_2$ is irreducible.</description>

      <title>The smooth Mordell-Weil group and mapping class groups of elliptic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a paper in smooth $4$-manifold topology, inspired by the Mordell-Weil Theorem in number theory. More precisely, we prove a smooth version of the Mordell-Weil Theorem and apply it to the `unipotent radical' case of a Thurston-type classification of mapping classes of simply-connected $4$-manifolds $M_d$ that admit the structure of an elliptic complex surface of arithmetic genus $d\geq 1$. Applications include Nielsen realization theorems for $M_d$.
  By combining this with known results, we obtain the following remarkable consequence: if the singular fibers of such an elliptic fibration are of the simplest (i.e.\ nodal) type, then the fibered structure is unique up topological isotopy. In particular, any diffeomorphism of $M_d,d\geq 3$ is topologically isotopic to a diffeomorphism taking fibers to fibers.</description>

Abstract: We derive formulae for Gram matrices arising in the Nyman--Beurling reformulation of the Riemann hypothesis. The development naturally leads upon series of the form $S(x) = \sum_{n\ge 1} R(nx)$ and their reciprocity relations. We give integral representations of these series; and we present decompositions of the quadratic forms associated with the Gram matrices along with a discussion of the components' properties.</description>
