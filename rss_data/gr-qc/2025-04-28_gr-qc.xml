      <title>Implications of Complexity Factor on Evolution of New Dynamical and Static Wormholes in $f(R, T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents new spherically symmetric and dynamical wormhole solutions supported by ordinary matter modeled as an anisotropic fluid, exhibiting a traversable nature. To achieve this goal, we adopt different approaches to obtain both evolving static and genuinely dynamical solutions, such as imposing a viable condition on the Ricci scalar, considering an anisotropic equation of state, and choosing a suitable energy density profile. For each derived shape function, we analyze the corresponding $2D$ and $3D$ embedding diagrams and verify their compatibility with the weak energy condition through density plots. The equilibrium conditions are also explored graphically to assess the stability of the obtained solutions, which are shown to be stable within the analyzed framework. Additionally, we investigate the complexity factor associated with each configuration, examining its dependence on both temporal evolution and the coupling parameter $\lambda$ of the $f(R,T)$ theory.</description>

      <title>Quintessence and false vacuum: Two sides of the same coin?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study late-time acceleration scenarios using a quintessence field initially trapped in a metastable false vacuum state. The false vacuum has non-zero vacuum energy and could drive exponential expansion if not coupled with gravity. Upon decay of the false vacuum, the quintessence field is released and begins to evolve. We assumed conditions where the effective scalar potential gradient must satisfy \(\nabla V_{\text{eff}} &gt; A\), characterized by a pressure term approximately \(\Delta p / p &gt; \mathcal {O} (\hbar)\) invoking the recently proposed string swampland criteria. We then derived the effective potential of the scalar with an upper bound on the coupling constant \(\lambda &lt; 0.6\). Further analysis revealed that \(V_{\text{eff}}\) shows a slow-roll behavior for \(0.1 &gt; \lambda &gt; -0.04\) in the effective dark energy equation of state (EoS) \(-0.8 &lt; w_0 &lt; -0.4\), stabilizing at points between \(1 &lt; A &lt; 2.718\). Our results suggest a stable scalar decoupled from its initial meta-stable state, could indeed lead to a more stable universe at late times. However, slight deviations in parameter orders could potentially violate the swampland criteria if \(V_{\text{eff}}\) grows too rapidly. Since this is not something we expect, it opens up the possibility that the current dark energy configuration might be a result of a slowly varying scalar rather than being arbitrary. \</description>

      <title>Observational analysis of bulk viscous modified Chaplygin gas in (2+1)-dimensional universe using MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates regarding cosmological implications of a bulk viscous modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) in (2+1)-dimensional Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime, incorporating both theoretical analysis and observational constraints. We derive analytical solutions for both viscous and non-viscous cases, revealing distinct behavior in energy density evolution, Hubble parameter dynamics, and deceleration parameter transitions. A comprehensive perturbation analysis illustrates how bulk viscosity dampens the structure growth oscillations, addressing a key challenge faced by Chaplygin gas models in higher dimensions. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques with Hubble parameter and Pantheon supernova datasets, we impose constraints on our model parameters, obtaining $H_0 = 67.90$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, showing remarkable consistency with Planck $\Lambda$CDM estimations despite the dimensional reduction. Our findings suggest that lower-dimensional viscous cosmology captures essential features of cosmic evolution while providing valuable theoretical insights into the interplay between dissipative effects and exotic equations of state.</description>

      <title>Constraining Population III stellar demographics with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave observatories will reach farther into the universe than currently possible, revealing black-hole mergers from early stellar binary systems such as Population III stars, whose properties are currently poorly constrained. We develop a method to infer the properties of their progenitor populations from gravitational-wave catalogs. Using Bayesian deep learning, we train an emulator for population-synthesis predictions of black-hole merger properties across redshift as a function of the initial stellar mass function, crucially accounting for systematic uncertainty due to the finite number of training simulations. Combined with a nonparametric model for star formation history, we analyze catalogs containing both Population I/II and III sources simulated with full Bayesian parameter estimation for a detector network of Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope with one year of observing time. We demonstrate our ability to separate these two populations at high redshifts where both make comparable contributions to the black-hole merger rate, excluding a Population III merger rate of zero at nearly 100% credibility. Moreover, we can place meaningful constraints on the Population III progenitor distributions; in particular, we constrain the spectral index of the initial mass function to within roughly +/-0.5 of the true value and the log of the star formation rate density to within ~25% over redshifts 10 to 20. By leveraging astrophysics-informed and astrophysics-agnostic models, we demonstrate the discriminative power of our combined inference approach and highlight the potential of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories to uncover the details of high-redshift stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from eccentric binary neutron star mergers: Systematic biases induced by quasi-circular templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of quasi-circular waveforms in matched-filter analyses of signals from eccentric binary neutron star mergers can lead to biases in the source's parameter estimation. We demonstrate that significant biases can be present already for moderate eccentricities $e_{0} \gtrsim 0.05$ and LIGO-Virgo-Kagra signals with signal-to-noise ratio $\gtrsim 12$. We perform systematic Bayesian mock analyses of unequal-mass non-spinning binary neutron star signals up to eccentricities $e_0 \sim 0.1$ using quasi-circular effective-one-body waveforms with spins. We find fractional signal-to-noise ratio losses up to tens of percent and up to 16-$\sigma$ deviations in the inference of the chirp mass. The latter effect is sufficiently large to lead to an incorrect (and ambiguous) source identification. The inclusion of spin precession in the quasi-circular waveform does not capture eccentricity effects. We conclude that high-precision observations with advanced (and next generation) detectors are likely to require standardized, accurate, and fast eccentric waveforms.</description>

      <title>Waveform models for the gravitational-wave memory effect: II. Time-domain and frequency-domain models for nonspinning binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear gravitational-wave (GW) memory effect$\unicode{x2014}$a permanent shift in the GW strain that arises from nonlinear GW interactions in the wave zone$\unicode{x2014}$is a prediction of general relativity which has not yet been observed. The amplitude of the GW memory effect from binary-black-hole (BBH) mergers is small compared to that of primary (oscillatory) GWs and is unlikely to be detected by current ground-based detectors. Evidence for its presence in the population of all the BBH mergers is more likely, once thousands of detections are made by these detectors. Having an accurate and computationally efficient waveform model of the memory signal will assist detecting the memory effect with current data-analysis pipelines. In this paper, we build on our prior work to develop analytical time-domain and frequency-domain models for the dominant nonlinear memory multipole signal ($l=2$, $m=0$) from nonspinning BBH mergers in quasicircular orbits. The model is calibrated for mass ratios between one and eight. There are three parts to the time-domain signal model: a post-Newtonian inspiral, a quasinormal-mode-based ringdown, and a phenomenological signal during the late inspiral and merger (which interpolates between the inspiral and ringdown). The time-domain model also has an analytical Fourier transform, which we compute in this paper. We assess the accuracy of our model using the mismatch between our waveform model and the memory signal computed from the oscillatory modes of a numerical-relativity surrogate model. We use the advanced LIGO sensitivity curve from the fourth observing run and find that the mismatch increases with the total mass of the system and is of order $10^{-2}\unicode{x2013}10^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>$\kappa$-General-Relativity II: An Astrophysical Observable from a 2-Body system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine gravitational waves (GWs) from Binary Black Holes (BBH) as possible suitable systems for investigating the physical validity of theories predicting the Relative Locality (RL) effect, an effect arising in the $\kappa$-Minkowski non-commutative spacetime, a central property in theories of Quantum Gravity (QG) Phenomenology. Hence, we are taking a step towards realizing the purpose of the phenomenological effort of having observational evidence to put constraints on QG approaches. In particular, we show that the RL effect induces an uncertainty in the observed rotational frequency during the inspiral phase. This uncertainty becomes stronger with increasing observational distance. It also increases with decreasing orbital radius, and accumulates over successive cycles. In terms of the post-Newtonian deviations, the uncertainty contributes at 1.25th order, an order that has not yet been directly constrained in GW analyses.</description>

      <title>First-order correction of tunneling and entropy in the Horndeski gravity-like hairy black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we apply tunneling formalism to analyze charged particles tunneling across a hairy black hole horizon. Such black hole solutions are essential for frameworks based on Horndeski's gravity theory. Applying a semi-classical technique, we examine the tunneling of charged particles from a hairy black hole and derive the generic tunneling spectrum of released particles, ignoring self-gravitational and interaction. It is studied to ignore the back-reaction impact of the radiated particle on the hairy black hole. We analyze the properties of the black hole, such as temperature and entropy, under the influence of quantum gravity and also observe that the first-order correction is present. We study tunneling radiation produced by a charged field equation in the presence of a generalized uncertainty effect. We modify the semi-classical technique by using the generalized uncertainty principle, the WKB approximation, and surface gravity.</description>

      <title>Dynamical von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai Oscillations of a Binary on a Spherical Orbit around a Rotating Supermassive Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a binary system orbiting a rotating supermassive black hole (SMBH). Using Fermi-Walker transport, we construct a local inertial reference frame in the Kerr spacetime and set up a Newtonian binary system. Assuming the binary moves on a spherical orbit with constant radius around the black hole, we derive the equations of motion governing its dynamics.
  We focus on von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (vZLK) oscillations, which arise when the binary is compact and its initial inclination exceeds a critical angle. In our previous work on a circular orbit in the equatorial plane, we found that for hard binary systems, these oscillations in eccentricity and inclination follow a regular pattern, whereas in soft binaries, they exhibit chaotic behavior with irregular periods and amplitudes, yet remain stable.
  In this study, we extend our analysis to a spherical orbit in the Kerr background. The libration of the binary's orbit in the latitudinal direction affects the vZLK oscillations: as the libration angle increases, the oscillation period shortens, and the maximum eccentricity grows, particularly when the oscillations become chaotic. Notably, when the binary is sufficiently soft yet remains stable, the oscillation period is reduced to the dynamical timescale rather than the secular timescale. This effect arises due to the interaction between the SMBH spin and the binary's angular momentum. As the Kerr rotation parameter increases or the radius of the spherical orbit decreases, both the enhancement of maximum eccentricity and the reduction in oscillation period become more pronounced.</description>

      <title>Conformal compactification and affine-null metric formulation of the Einstein equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In principle, global properties of solution of Einstein equations need to be addressed using the conformal Einstein equations, because this conformal compactification allows a clean definition of the `infinities' (spacelike, timelike and null infinity) of General Relativity. However, in numerical calculations often compactified coordinates in the physical space are used to reach these infinities. In this note, we discuss the conformal Einstein equations in spherical symmetry coupled to a massless scalar field and compare them with corresponding equations using a compactified coordinate in physical spacetime. The derivation of the field equations is based on metrics, in which the radial coordinate is an affine parameter along outgoing null rays. We show that the conformal equations within an affine-null metric formulation can be cast in a natural hierarchical form after the introduction of suitable auxiliary fields. The system of partial differential equations associated with the resulting (unphysical) conformal field equations proves to be identical to a system that employs a compactified coordinate in physical space along with well-constructed regularized fields. The reason for this equivalence is the introduction of new regularized fields in the physical spacetime after coordinate compactification to obtain a regular system of equations on the complete domain of the compactified coordinate. As part of this work, we also present the solution of the conformal field equations in affine-null coordinates near the conformal boundary, where the Bondi mass loss formula for a massless scalar field is recovered. The validity of the balance law of the mass loss at null infinity is demonstrated numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic vacua play a central role in quantum fields in cosmological spacetimes, where they serve as distinguished initial conditions and as reference states for the renormalization of observables. In this paper we introduce new methods based on linear complex structures which provide a powerful tool for determining adiabatic vacua. The new methods generalize both the standard WKB appoach and the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariants, and allow us to study the problem of many coupled bosonic degrees of freedom with general quadratic time-dependent Hamiltonian. We show that the adiabatic number operator and the adiabatic vacuum of finite order can be expressed in terms of the adiabatic complex structure of the same order. We compare our results to standard techniques which apply only to a single degree of freedom, and comment on its applicability to problems in quantum fields in cosmological spacetimes, many-body systems and quantum thermodynamics, where the Hamiltonian is time dependent with slowly-changing parameters.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of dilaton-inspired scalar field within the geometrical trinity of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the dilaton-inspired scalar field, formally rewritten by means of a Brans-Dicke Lagrangian, within the framework of \emph{geometrical trinity of gravity}. In this respect, we perform a stability analysis by adopting a non-flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric and considering the well-established exponential potential in three distinct gravitational frameworks: general relativity, teleparallel gravity, and symmetric-teleparallel gravity. By comparing the scalar field behaviors across these theories, we highlight the role of curvature, torsion, and non-metricity in shaping cosmic evolution. Our analysis reveals that, both in general relativity and teleparallel gravity, the dilaton-inspired field can drive the accelerated expansion of the universe, effectively behaving as cosmological constant at late times. In contrast, within the symmetric teleparallel gravity scenario, performing a complete linear stability analysis is prevented by the use of the non-coincident gauge. Nevertheless, the latter paradigm introduces complexity into the autonomous system, resulting in a structurally different analysis. For general relativity and teleparallel scenarios, we remark the regions of attractor solutions and unphysical domains in which we do not expect the viability of our dilaton-inspired Lagrangian. However, within the framework of symmetric-teleparallel gravity, the stability analysis reveals no attractor points for the chosen set of free parameters. In support of these findings, physical conclusions, kinematical studies, and consequences on Friedmann dynamics are thus explored.</description>

      <title>Particle motion and thermal effects around a Kalb-Ramond black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is devoted to examining particle dynamics and thermodynamic behavior of a black hole in the framework of Kalb-Ramond gravity, framing the investigation through the lens of the optical-mechanical analogy. Within this context, we derive a generalized modified dispersion relation, which inherently depends on the underlying spacetime geometry through its metric components. The analysis begins by exploring some physical quantities influenced by the geometry, including the effective index of refraction, the group velocity, and the time delay experienced by particle modes. We then investigate the interparticle potential, considering both massive and massless cases. The thermodynamic properties of the system are subsequently addressed using ensemble theory. In this treatment, we compute the pressure, internal energy, entropy, and heat capacity across three distinct regions: in the immediate vicinity of the event horizon, at the photon sphere, and in the asymptotic region. Notably, all calculations presented throughout this paper admit closed-form analytical solutions.</description>

      <title>Exploring Traversable Wormholes in $f(Q)$ gravity: Shadows and Quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work deals with some WH solutions in $f(Q)$ gravity theory for non-constant red-shift function subject to a power law model of $f(Q)$, $Q$ being the non-metricity scalar. Important properties of a WH configuration like the asymptotic flatness, traversability, flairing out condition and energy conditions have been checked for the obtained solutions. Shadows for these WHs have been determined and effect of non-metricity has been discussed. Finally, the paper gives an essence of Quasinormal modes and grey body factors for traversable WHs in general and $f(Q)$ wormholes in particular indicating a distinct signature of non-metricity influencing these observational tools.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Collapse and Formation of Regular Black Holes: Dymnikova, Hayward, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational collapse of a star can lead to the formation of a regular black hole. However, a key factor in this process is the transition of ordinary baryonic matter into a substance that forms the de Sitter core. However, the formation of de Sitter core during gravitational collapse remains an open question, particularly since ordinary baryonic matter does not naturally transition into the exotic matter required to form a de Sitter core. In this paper, we investigate the gravitational collapse of baryonic matter and its potential to form well-known regular black hole solutions, such as those proposed by Dymnikova and Hayward. We model the collapse process as a transition of baryonic matter into a new type of matter, accompanied by the release of energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. Using a generalized dynamical framework, we derive the energy density of the emitted radiation as a function of both the properties of the initial baryonic matter and the resulting exotic matter. Our findings demonstrate that the gravitational collapse can lead to the formation of various types of regular black holes, providing insights into the physical mechanisms underlying their creation. The detectable radiation signature offers a potential observational test for distinguishing between different black hole models.</description>

      <title>Black hole absorption cross sections: Spin and Regge poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the absorption of massless scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational fields propagating in the Schwarzschild black hole geometry. Using complex angular momentum techniques, we first derive a representation of the absorption cross section that separates it into smooth background integrals and a discrete Regge pole series. This decomposition reveals the physical mechanisms underlying black hole absorption, including classical capture, surface wave interference near the photon sphere, and subleading background effects. We then construct a refined high-frequency analytical approximation that captures both the dominant oscillations and the fine structure of the absorption spectra for scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational fields, incorporating spin-dependent phase corrections and higher-order effects. In addition, we provide a simplified expression that generalizes the sinc approximation to describe the leading oscillations for electromagnetic and gravitational fields. Our analysis offers a unified semiclassical interpretation of black hole absorption, combining geometric optics, surface wave dynamics, and resonant phenomena encoded by the Regge pole structure.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints in late time for an axially symmetric transitioning model with bulk viscous fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore an axially symmetric Bianchi type-I model of the universe with bulk viscous fluid as a source of gravitational field under the framework of Einstein's field equations by assuming barotropic bulk viscous pressure as $-3\zeta H^2$.
  The model parameters have been estimated with the help of four data sets: The Hubble 46 data set describes Hubble parameter values at various redshifts, Union 2.1 compilation data sets comprise a distance modulus of 580 SNIa supernovae at different redshifts, the Pantheon data set contains Apparent magnitudes of 1048 SNIa supernovae at various redshifts and finally BAO data set of volume averaged distances at 5 redshifts.
  The observational data is analyzed using the traditional Bayesian methodology, and the posterior distributions of the parameters are obtained using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. To get the best-fit values for the model parameters for MCMC analysis, we use the $ emcee $ package. For parameter estimation, we have also employed the minimizing $\chi^{2}$ function. We also tried to achieve these values statistically using combined data sets from the four described earlier. The OHD+BAO~and~OHD+Pan+BAO+Union combined data sets provide the best fit Hubble parameter value $H_0$ as $66.912 ^{+0.497}_{-0.501})$ Km/s/Mpc and $74.216 ^{+0.150}_{-0.148}$ Km/s/Mpc respectively. We have performed state finder diagnostics to discuss the nature of dark energy. Some other geometrical parameters like the Jerk parameter and the Om diagnostic are also being discussed to clarify the nature of the dark energy model. The study reveals that the model behaves like a quintessence in late time and approaches the $\Lambda$ CDM model.</description>

      <title>Unified Non-Singular Cosmology with Late-Time Acceleration through a Novel Parametrization of Bulk Viscosity Coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the influence of viscous fluids on cosmological dynamics within the framework of General Relativity. We introduce a novel time-dependent parametrization for the bulk viscosity coefficient, given by \(\zeta = \zeta_0 (t - t_0)^{-2n} \rho^{1/2}\), where \(\zeta_0\), \(t_0\), and \(n\) are model parameters. This formulation is designed to investigate whether bulk viscosity of this nature can effectively describe the evolution of the universe, particularly in scenarios that avoid initial singularities through a cosmological bounce. Remarkably, the general solutions emerging from our model exhibit significant flexibility, accommodating not only a bouncing universe but also an early inflationary phase and a late-time acceleration mimicking dark energy. The roles of \(\zeta_0\), \(t_0\), and \(n\) are pivotal, as they govern the cosmic evolution and determine the transitions between different phases. To validate the robustness of our model, we analyze key cosmological quantities such as the energy density, deceleration parameter, and the validity of various energy conditions. Furthermore, we employ statefinder diagnostics to probe the dark energy behavior and examine Hubble flow parameters to shed light on the inflationary aspects of the model. Lastly, we confront our theoretical predictions with observational data sets, including the BAO, DESI and Pantheon+SH0ES datasets, demonstrating the model's consistency with empirical cosmological trends.</description>

      <title>Regular black hole solutions in $(2 + 1)$-dimensional $f(R,T)$ gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate regular black hole solutions in the (2+1)-dimensional versions of General Relativity and $f(R, T)$ gravity, both coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics. By admitting that the matter content that generates such geometries satisfies the Maxwell limit condition, we obtain a class of regular black holes that give rise to new solutions and successfully reproduce particular cases found in earlier studies of (2-1)-dimensional General Relativity. Moreover, we discover the first regular black hole solutions in (2+1)-dimensional $f(R, T)$ gravity and explore both qualitatively and quantitatively the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor present in those solutions.</description>

      <title>Penrose inequality for integral energy conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Penrose inequality, a relation between the ADM mass and the area of any cross section of the black hole event horizon, was introduced as a test of the weak cosmic censorship: if it fails, the trapped surface is not necessarily behind the event horizon and a naked singularity could form. Since that original derivation, a variety of proofs have developed, mainly focused on the initial data formulation on maximal spacelike slices of spacetime. Most of these proofs are applicable only for classical fields, as the energy conditions required are violated in the context of quantum field theory. In this work we provide two generalizations of the Penrose inequality spherically symmetric spacetimes: a proof of a classical inequality using initial data and an average energy condition and proof of a generalized inequality for evaporating black holes with a connection to the weak cosmic censorship. The latter case could also be applicable to quantum fields. Finally, we provide physically motivated examples for both.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe asymptotic symmetries at spatial infinity of asymptotically flat spacetimes within the context of a generalization of the Beig-Schmidt-Ashtekar-Romano-framework. We demonstrate that it is possible to relax certain smoothness requirements of the asymptotic transformations considered previously, without violating asymptotic flatness. This leads to an enhancement of the asymptotic symmetry group that includes logarithmic supertranslations at spatial infinity. Our results complement several recent results which confirm the existence of logarithmic supertranslations at spatial infinity in the Hamiltonian formalism.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing by $k-n$ generalized black-bounce space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study gravitational lensing by $k-n$ generalized black-bounce space-times both in regimes of weak and strong field approximations. These metrics interpolate between regular black holes and one-way or traversable wormholes. First, we investigate the light-like geodesic trajectories and derive an analytical expression for the deflection angle in terms of the bounce parameter in the weak-field gravitational regime. We then turn to the strong-field gravitational regime and display the behavior of the bending angle as a function of both the impact parameter and the bounce parameter. Next, using the lens equations, we analyze how the observables for \textit{Sagittarius} A* behave concerning the bounce parameter. We obtain the shadow's radii for some black-bounce metrics and plot the graph of their sizes, comparing them with the Schwarzschild one.</description>

      <title>Approximating neutron-star radii using gravitational-wave only measurements with symbolic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary neutron star inspirals detected as gravitational waves carry information on components' masses and tidal deformabilities, but not radii, which are measured by electromagnetic observations of neutron stars. An expression for neutron-star radii as a function of gravitational-wave only data would be advantageous for the multi-messenger astronomy. Using pySR, a symbolic regression method trained on TOV solutions to piecewise polytropic EOS input, an approximate symbolic expression for neutron-star radius as a function of mass and tidal deformability is obtained. The approximation is tested on piecewise polytropic EOS NS data, as well as on NS sequences based on various non-polytropic EOSs based on realistic theories of dense matter, achieving consistent agreement between the ground truth values and the approximation for a broad range of NS parameters covering current astrophysical observations, with average radii differences of few hundred meters. Additionally, the approximation is applied to GW170817 gravitational-wave mass and tidal deformability posteriors, and compared to reported inferred radius distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the quantum gravity signatures that emerge in a gravitational wave detector placed inside a harmonic potential trap, where the quantum state of the graviton is either coherent, squeezed, or squeezed coherent. We compared the transition probabilities of the detector in scenarios where the gravitational wave is quantized versus when it is treated classically. Assuming the gravitational wave propagates in one direction and has only one type of polarization, we found that for graviton states such as coherent, squeezed, and squeezed coherent states, quantum gravity signatures can emerge in events that would not be possible when the graviton state is a quantum state with $n_G$ particles $(\ket{n_G})$, such as graviton annihilation and the increasing energy level of the detector by two levels in final state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove (Theorem 1.1.) that a class of quasi-Einstein structures on closed manifolds must admit a Killing vector field. This extends the rigidity theorem obtained in \cite{DL23} for the extremal black hole horizons and completes the classification of compact quasi-Einstein surfaces in this class. We also explore special cases of the quasi-Einstein equations related to integrability and the Hitchin equations, as well as to Einstein-Weyl structures and Kazdan-Warner type PDEs. This leads to novel explicit examples of quasi-Einstein structures on (non-compact) surfaces and on $S^2 \times S^1$.</description>

      <title>Peeking under the clouds: Is exoplanet imaging with the solar gravitational lens feasible?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanet imaging using the solar gravitational lens is an enticing prospect. The fundamental physical properties of the lens, including its angular resolution and light amplification, promise exceptional capabilities. These expectations, however, are tempered by the realization of numerous challenges, including imperfections of the lens itself, noise sources, the properties of the imaging target and difficult technical issues. We discuss, in particular, a subject not previously addressed, the impact of temporally varying surface features, notably a variable cloud cover, obscuring the target exoplanet. This has a substantial detrimental effect on image recovery, leading to our cautious assessment of the practical feasibility of using the Sun's gravitational field as an effective telescope.</description>

      <title>Studying replica wormholes and the Page curve with simplicial quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The replica paradigm has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating the black hole information paradox, offering a semiclassical route to reproducing the Page curve and suggesting unitary evolution for evaporating black holes. However, existing analyses have relied on simplified models such as JT gravity, and mostly remain limited to the $n \to 1^+$ limit in Euclidean signature. This work develops a framework based on Quantum Regge Calculus (QRC) that provides a lattice-like approach to address these gaps. A triangulation scheme is introduced that accommodates both gravitational and radiation degrees of freedom, enabling explicit evaluation of the fundamental components of the Regge gravity and radiation actions in a spherically symmetric setting. The formulation naturally incorporates analytic continuation techniques to probe the role of complex saddles in Lorentzian signature. A proof-of-principle implementation is carried out within a controlled minisuperspace reduction, revealing semiclassical saddles in the $n \to 1^+$ limit that recover the Page transition. While significant challenges remain (including the definition of the discrete configuration space, ambiguities in the gravitational measure, and the treatment of asymptotic boundaries), the framework developed here provides a promising foundation for further progress. The results suggest that sufficiently refined QRC calculations could extend the replica approach beyond existing models.</description>

      <title>Superradiant dark matter production from primordial black holes: Impact of multiple modes and gravitational wave emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotating primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe can emit particles through superradiance, a process particularly efficient when the particle's Compton wavelength is comparable to the PBH's gravitational radius. Superradiance leads to an exponential growth of particle occupation numbers in gravitationally bound states. We present an analysis of heavy bosonic dark matter (DM) production through three gravitational mechanisms: Hawking radiation, superradiant instabilities, and ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in. We consider PBHs that evaporate before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). For both scalar and vector DM, our analysis incorporates the evolution of a second superradiant mode. We demonstrate that the growth of a second superradiant mode causes the decay of the first mode, and thus the second mode cannot further enhance the DM abundance beyond that already achieved by the first mode. Our study also reveals that while superradiance generally enhances DM production, gravitational wave (GW) emission from the superradiant cloud may significantly modify this picture. For scalar DM, GW emission reduces the parameter space where superradiance effectively augments relic abundance. For vector DM, rapid GW emission from the superradiant cloud may yield relic abundances below those achieved through Hawking radiation alone. These findings demonstrate that multiple-mode effect and GW emission play critical roles in modeling DM production from PBHs in the early universe.</description>

      <title>A multi-messenger window into galactic magnetic fields and black hole mergers with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale (i.e., $\gtrsim {\rm kpc}$) and micro-Gauss scale magnetic fields have been observed throughout the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. These fields depend on the geometry and matter-energy composition, can display complicated behavior such as direction reversals, and are intimately related to the evolution of the source galaxy. Simultaneously, gravitational-wave astronomy offers a new probe into astrophysical systems, for example the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe the mergers of massive (i.e., $M ~&gt; 10^6$ M$_{\odot}$) black-hole binaries and provide extraordinary constraints on the evolution of their galactic hosts. In this work, we show how galactic, large-scale magnetic fields and their electromagnetic signatures are connected with LISA gravitational-wave observations via their common dependence on the massive black-hole binary formation scenario of hierarchical galaxy mergers. Combining existing codes, we astrophysically evolve a population of massive binaries from formation to merger and find that they are detectable by LISA with signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 10^3$ which is correlated with quantities from the progenitors' phase of circumbinary disk migration such as the maximum magnetic field magnitude $|\mathbf{B}| \approx 7 \,\mu$G, polarized intensity, and Faraday rotation measure. Interesting correlations result between these observables arising from their dependencies on the black-hole binary total mass, suggesting a need for further analyses of the full parameter space. We conclude with a discussion on this new multi-messenger window into galactic magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory of Chiral Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a (non-)Abelian gauge field acquires an isotropic background configuration during inflation, strong gravitational waves (GWs) with parity-violating polarization, known as chiral GWs, can be produced in addition to the intrinsic unpolarized GWs. However, previous studies have analyzed individual models, leaving the generality of this phenomenon unclear. To perform a model-independent analysis, we construct an effective field theory (EFT) of chiral GWs by extending the EFT of inflation and incorporating gauge fields. The resulting action unifies inflationary models with a $SU(2)$ gauge field, such as chromo-natural inflation and gauge-flation, and ones with a triplet of $U(1)$ gauge fields, systematically encompassing all possible GW production mechanisms consistent with the symmetry breaking induced by the gauge field background. We find that chiral GWs are generically and inevitably produced, provided that the effective energy density of the background gauge field is positive and the gauge kinetic function is not fine-tuned to a specific time dependence. This EFT offers a useful foundation for future phenomenological studies as well as for deepening our theoretical understanding of chiral GWs.</description>

      <title>Exploring Ultralight Dark Matter Self-Coupling via the Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole binary mergers serve as prominent sources of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). If dark matter-induced friction is present in the vicinity of these mergers, it can lead to suppression in the nanohertz frequency range of the SGWB spectrum. In particular, ultralight dark matter (ULDM) forming compact solitonic cores around supermassive black holes can imprint signatures in PTA observations. Our analysis places limits on the mass and self-interaction strength of ULDM, demonstrating that soliton-induced dynamical friction can significantly alter the SGWB spectrum. PTAs have the potential to exclude certain ULDM mass ranges while probing the effects of self-interactions, offering a novel avenue to investigate the fundamental properties of ULDM.</description>

      <title>Multi-Parameter Transitions in Cosmological Calibrators: A Resolution to the Hubble Tension from SH0ES Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble tension, characterized by discrepant measurements of the Hubble constant from early and late universe probes, remains one of the most significant challenges in cosmology. Building upon our previous analysis of individual parameter transitions in SH0ES data, we investigate the impact of simultaneous transitions in multiple Cepheid and SNIa calibration parameters at specific cosmic distances. We allow various combinations of transitions in Cepheid absolute magnitude ($M^W_H$), period-luminosity relation slope ($b_W$), metallicity coefficient ($Z_W$), and SNIa absolute magnitude ($M_B$). Our comprehensive analysis reveals a consistent preferred transition distance of approximately 23 Mpc across different parameter combinations. The most statistically favored model allows simultaneous transitions in $b_W$, $Z_W$, and $M_B$, yielding $\Delta \text{AIC} \simeq -9.2$ and $\Delta \text{BIC} \simeq -3.0$ compared to the baseline SH0ES model. This provides strong evidence for inhomogeneities in standard candle calibrations. We demonstrate that the post-transition SNIa absolute magnitude aligns more closely with CMB-based constraints, resulting in a reduced Hubble constant value that alleviates the tension. Our findings suggest that the Hubble tension might be resolved through proper modeling of calibration parameter inhomogeneities rather than requiring new physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cosmic strings in the complex symmetron model, a scalar-tensor theory with a spontaneously broken local $U(1)$ symmetry in low matter density regions. Using numerical simulations, we show that these strings preferentially attach to matter halos, leading to the stabilization of string loops. While the requirement for screening of fifth-force interactions in the solar system limits observable signatures in theories with universal coupling to matter, analogous topological defects in the dark sector may still influence cosmic structure formation, offering a novel avenue to constrain dark-sector interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a scale-critical trapped surface formation result for the Einstein--Maxwell--charged scalar field (EMCSF) system, without any symmetry assumptions. Specifically, we establish a scale-critical semi-global existence theorem from past null infinity and show that the focusing of gravitational waves, the concentration of electromagnetic fields, or the condensation of complex scalar fields, each individually, can lead to the formation of a trapped surface. In addition, we capture a nontrivial charging process along past null infinity, which introduces new difficulties due to the abnormal behavior of the matter fields. Nevertheless, the semi-global existence result and the formation of a trapped surface remain valid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03661v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, enlightened by the definition of the photon surface given by Claudel, Virbhadra and Ellis, we give a quasi-local definition of the particle surface. From this definition, one can study the evolution of the circular orbits in general spacetime. Especially, we pointed out that this definition can be used to get the spherical circular orbits in stationary spacetimes which cannot be got by the definition of Claudel, Virbhadra and Ellis. Further, we give a condition to exclude the particle surface in spacetime without gravity. Simultaneously, we give a quasi-local definition of the stability of the particle surface in general spacetime. From this definition, one can get the evolution equation of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) in general spacetime. To verify the correctness of these definitions, we studied the circular orbits in some special cases and the results are all consistent with the previous results.</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript, we address the issue of the loss of SU(2) internal symmetry in Loop Quantum Cosmology and its relationship with Loop Quantum Gravity. Drawing inspiration from Yang-Mills theory and employing the framework of fiber bundle theory, we propose a new gauge-invariant symmetry-reduction approach. Using this method, we successfully identify a cosmological sector of General Relativity in terms of Ashtekar variables that preserves the SU(2) structure of the theory as well as part of the diffeomorphism gauge symmetry. Additionally, we analyse the properties of cylindrical functions and the classical constraint algebra, revealing that certain cylindrical functions exhibit distinctive symmetry features.</description>

      <title>Strong Gravitational Lensing Effects of the Rotating Short-Haired Black Hole and Constraints from EHT Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the short hairs that have a significant impact only near the event horizon, studying their strong gravitational lensing effects is of great significance for revealing the properties of these hairs. In this study, we systematically investigated the strong gravitational lensing effects in the rotating short-haired black hole and constrained its hair parameter $Q_m$. Specifically, \(Q_m\) causes the event horizon radius, photon - orbit radius, and impact parameter to be lower than those of the Kerr black hole. Regarding the lensing coefficients \(\bar{a}\) and \(\bar{b}\), as the spin parameter \(a\) increases, \(\bar{a}\) shows an increasing trend, while \(\bar{b}\) shows a decreasing trend. In the observational simulations of M87* and Sgr A*, the angular position and angular separation of the relativistic image increase with the increase of \(a\), while the magnification of the image shows an opposite trend. The existence of \(Q_m\) only intensifies these trends, while parameter $k$ suppresses such tendencies. More importantly, the rotating short-haired black hole exhibits a significant difference in time delay compared to other black hole models. Especially in the simulation of M87*, the time delay deviation between the rotating short-haired black hole and the Kerr black hole, as well as the Kerr-Newman black hole, can reach dozens of hours. Through a comparative analysis with the observational data from the EHT, we effectively constrain the parameter space of the rotating short-haired black hole. The results indicate that this model has potential application prospects in explaining cosmic black hole phenomena and provides a possible theoretical basis for differentiating between different black hole models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to simplify and popularise the construction from the 2013 paper by Apostolov, Calderbank, and Gauduchon, which (among other things) derives the Plebanski-Demianski family of solutions of GR using ideas of complex geometry. The starting point of this construction is the observation that the Euclidean versions of these metrics should have two different commuting complex structures, as well as two commuting Killing vector fields. After some linear algebra, this leads to an ansatz for the metrics, which is half-way to their complete determination. Kerr metric is a special 2-parameter subfamily in this class, which makes these considerations directly relevant to Kerr as well. This results in a derivation of the Kerr metric that is self-contained and elementary, in the sense of being mostly an exercise in linear algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General relativistic Riemann solvers are typically complex, fragile and unwieldy, at least in comparison to their special relativistic counterparts. In this paper, we present a new high-resolution shock-capturing algorithm on curved spacetimes that employs a local coordinate transformation at each inter-cell boundary, transforming all primitive and conservative variables into a locally flat spacetime coordinate basis (i.e., the tetrad basis), generalizing previous approaches developed for relativistic hydrodynamics. This algorithm enables one to employ a purely special relativistic Riemann solver, combined with an appropriate post-hoc flux correction step, irrespective of the geometry of the underlying Lorentzian manifold. We perform a systematic validation of the algorithm using the Gkeyll simulation framework for both general relativistic electromagnetism and general relativistic hydrodynamics, highlighting the algorithm's superior convergence and stability properties in each case when compared against standard analytical solutions for black hole magnetosphere and ultra-relativistic black hole accretion problems. However, as an illustration of the generality and practicality of the algorithm, we also apply it to more astrophysically realistic magnetosphere and fluid accretion problems in the limit of high black hole spin, for which standard general relativistic Riemann solvers are often too unstable to produce useful solutions.</description>

      <title>Impact of relativistic waveforms in LISA's science objectives with extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) are one of the key targets for future space-based gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA. The scientific potential of these sources can only be fully realized with fast and accurate waveform models. In this work, we extend the \textsc{FastEMRIWaveform} (\texttt{FEW}) framework by providing fully relativistic waveforms at adiabatic order for circular, equatorial orbits in Kerr spacetime, for mass ratios up to $10^{-3}$. We investigate the significance of including relativistic corrections in the waveform for both vacuum and non-vacuum environments. Specifically, we develop relativistic non-vacuum EMRI waveforms including two different environmental effects in the EMRI waveforms: power-law migration torques, and superradiance scalar clouds. For EMRIs in vacuum, we find that non-relativistic waveforms incorrectly estimate the predicted source's horizon redshift by approximately $35\%$ error. Our analysis shows that incorporating relativistic corrections enhances constraints on accretion disks, modeled through power-law torques, and improves the constraints on disk parameter estimates (error $\simeq 8\%$), representing a significant improvement over previous estimates. Additionally, we assess the evidence for models in a scenario where ignoring the accretion disk biases the parameter estimation (PE), reporting a $\log_{10}$ Bayes factor of $1.1$ in favor of the accretion disk model. In a fully relativistic setup, we also estimate the parameters of superradiant scalar clouds with relative errors $\simeq 0.3\%$ for the scalar cloud's mass. These results demonstrate that incorporating relativistic effects is essential for LISA science objectives with EMRIs.</description>

      <title>The maximum radiated energy and final spin of high speed collision of two black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We performed a series of 769 full numerical simulations of high energy collision of black holes to search for the maximum gravitational energy emitted $E_{rad}$, during their merger. We consider equal mass binaries with spins pointing along their orbital angular momentum $\vec{L}$ and perform a search over impact parameters $b$ and initial linear momenta $p/m=\gamma v$ to find the maximum $E_{rad}$ for a given spin $\vec{S}$. The total radiated energy proves to have a weak dependence on the intrinsic spin $s$ of the holes, for the sequence $s=+0.8, 0.0, -0.8$ studied here. We thus estimate the maximum $E_{rad}^{max}/M_{ADM}\approx32\%\pm2\%$ for these direct merger encounters. We also explore the radiated angular momentum and the maximum spin of the merger remnant (within these configurations), finding $\alpha_f^{max}=0.987$. We then use the zero frequency limit expansion to analytically model the radiated energy in the small impact parameter and large initial linear momentum regime.</description>

      <title>Divergent Energy-Momentum Fluxes In Nonlocal Gravity Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the second order perturbations of the Deser-Woodard II (DWII), Vardanyan-Akrami-Amendola-Silvestri (VAAS) and Amendola-Burzilla-Nersisyan (ABN) nonlocal gravity models in an attempt to extract their associated gravitational wave energy-momentum fluxes. In Minkowski spacetime, the gravitational spatial momentum density is supposed to scale at most as $1/r^{2}$, in the $r \rightarrow \infty$ limit, where $r$ is the observer-source spatial distance. The DWII model has a divergent flux because its momentum density goes as $1/r$; though this can be avoided when we set to zero the first derivative of its distortion function at the origin. Meanwhile, the ABN model also suffers from a divergent flux because its momentum density goes as $r^{2}$. The momentum density from the VAAS model was computed on a cosmological background expressed in a Fermi-Normal-Coordinate system, and was found to scale as $r$. For generic parameters, therefore, none of these three Dark Energy models appear to yield well-defined gravitational wave energies, as a result of their nonlocal gravitational self-interactions.</description>

      <title>Big Bang as spacetime defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03538v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the suggestion that it is possible to eliminate the Big Bang curvature singularity of the Friedmann cosmological solution by considering a particular type of degenerate spacetime metric. Specifically, we take the 4-dimensional spacetime metric to have a spacelike 3-dimensional defect with a vanishing determinant of the metric. This new solution suggests the existence of another "side" of the Big Bang (perhaps a more appropriate description than "pre-Big-Bang" phase used in our original paper). The corresponding new solution for defect wormholes is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a stable cosmological model of a closed universe in the presence of conventional scalar field. The stability of the model and absence of singularity is ensured by spatial curvature without the need for additional peculiar matter. We reconstruct the Lagrangian and numerically compute observational predictions, including the number of e-folds, the spectral index $n_s$, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We present several sets of parameters that satisfy the current observational data.</description>

      <title>Timelike boundary and corner terms in the causal set action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The causal set action of dimension $d$ is investigated for causal sets that are Poisson sprinklings into submanifolds of $d$-dimensional Minkowski space. Evidence, both analytic and numerical, is provided for the conjecture that the mean of the causal set action over sprinklings into a manifold with a timelike boundary, diverges like $l^{-1}$ in the continuum limit as the discreteness length $l$ tends to zero. A novel conjecture for the contribution to the causal set action from co-dimension 2 corners, also known as joints, is proposed and justified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the role of the equilibrium equation in bootstrapped Newtonian gravity (BNG) by including terms inspired by the post-Newtonian expansion of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equation. We then compare (approximate) BNG solutions for homogenous stars with their Newtonian and General Relativistic exact solutions. Regardless of the additional terms from the conservation equation, BNG stars do not exhibit a Buchdahl limit. However, specific extra terms added to this equation can cause the pressure to become negative inside stars with compactness smaller than the critical values for BNG black hole formation.</description>

      <title>Black Holes Rule Out Heavy Tachyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present direct observational constraints on tachyons; particles with group velocity greater than $c$ in vacuum in a Lorentz invariant theory. Since tachyons may have no direct couplings to Standard Model particles, the most robust and model independent constraints come from gravitational effects, especially black holes. We compute the Hawking radiation of tachyons from black holes, finding it to be significantly enhanced in the presence of heavy tachyons. For a black hole of mass $M$ and tachyons of mass $m$ with $g$ degrees of freedom, the black hole lifetime is found to be $t_{bh} \approx 192 \pi \hbar M/(g c^2 m^2)$ (or doubled for fermions). This implies that the observation of black holes of a few solar masses, with lifetime of several billion years, rules out tachyons of mass $m &gt; 3 \times 10^9$ GeV. This means there cannot exist any tachyons associated with unification scales or quantum gravity. So while there already exists theoretical reasons to be skeptical of tachyons, our work provides a complementary direct observational constraint.</description>

      <title>Black-hole spectroscopy from a giant quantum vortex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black-hole spectroscopy aims to infer physical properties of black holes by detecting the spectrum of quasinormal modes (QNMs) they emit while settling towards equilibrium. Unlike normal modes, which are resonances of energy-conserving systems, QNMs are damped oscillations arising when a system loses energy due to open boundaries or via dissipation. The detection of the full QNM spectrum of black holes is challenging due to rapidly decaying amplitudes of these resonances, limiting observations only to the longest-lived mode. Theoretical and numerical studies suggest that environmental confinement due to surrounding plasma or dark matter modify the QNM spectrum. Here, we employ black-hole spectroscopy to show how spatial confinement similarly affects the spectrum of nanometre-scale interface waves surrounding a giant quantum vortex in superfluid helium-4, an experimentally accessible quantum system that emulates dynamics in rotating curved spacetime. In the available parameter space, we observe regimes in which multiple QNMs emerge from the interface noise spectrum. In agreement with theoretical predictions, their real and imaginary frequencies are shifted with respect to those expected in the unbounded system. Our results demonstrate the critical role of spatial confinement in shaping the QNM spectrum, highlighting the importance of environmental effects on spectral stability of astrophysical compact objects.</description>

      <title>Lectures on the Bondi--Metzner--Sachs group and related topics in infrared physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These are the extended lecture notes for a minicourse presented at the I S\~ao Paulo School on Gravitational Physics discussing the Bondi--Metzner--Sachs (BMS) group, the group of symmetries at null infinity on asymptotically flat spacetimes. The BMS group has found many applications in classical gravity, quantum field theory in flat and curved spacetimes, and quantum gravity. These notes build the BMS group from its most basic prerequisites (such as group theory, symmetries in differential geometry, and asymptotic flatness) up to modern developments. These include its connections to the Weinberg soft graviton theorem, the memory effect, its use to construct Hadamard states in quantum field theory in curved spacetimes, and other ideas. Advanced sections briefly discuss the main concepts behind the infrared triangle in electrodynamics, superrotations, and the Dappiaggi--Moretti--Pinamonti group in expanding universes with cosmological horizons. New contributions by the author concerning asymptotic (conformal) Killing horizons are discussed at the end.</description>

      <title>Modeling a Non-Singular Universe with Late-Time Acceleration through a Novel Inhomogeneous Barotropic Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigated the effects of incorporating barotropic fluids on cosmological solutions within the general relativity (GR) framework. We proposed a modified version of the barotropic fluid with the EoS, $p=\zeta _0 \rho +\zeta _1 \rho \left(t-t_0\right){}^{-2 n}$, where $\zeta_0$, $\zeta_1$, $t_0$ and $n$ are some constants. Our goal is to explore if this type of EoS might help explain the universe's development, concentrating on the scenario where the universe bounces instead of singularities. Interestingly the generic solutions derived from our model are sufficiently adaptable to illustrate the bounce scenario, cosmic inflation and late-time dark-energy behaviour. The parameters $\zeta_0$, $\zeta_1$, $t_0$, and $n$ define the universe's phase in this non-singular solution. We investigated several elements of cosmic development, including as the energy density, deceleration parameter, and energy conditions, in order to validate our model. Stability analysis showed that the perturbations approach to zero as the time evolves, indicating the model is stable under scalar perturbation. Additionally, we looked at the statefinder diagnostics and Hubble flow dynamics to get more understanding of the model's dark energy and inflationary behaviour, respectively. Additionally, we conducted a study of the models' relevance to the observational datasets from BAO, DESI and Pantheon+SH0ES.</description>

      <title>Tunneling of Bell Particles, Page Curve and Black Hole Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that the quantum states of black hole responsible for the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy are given by a thin shell of Bell particles located at the region just underneath the horizon. We argue that the configuration can be stabilized by a new kind of degeneracy pressure which is suggested by a noncommutative geometry in the interior of the black hole. Black hole singularity is avoided. We utilize the work of Parikh and Wilczek \cite{Parikh:1999mf} to include the effect of tunneling on the Bell particles. We show that partially tunneled Bell particles give the Page curve of Hawking radiation, and the entirety of information initially stored in the black hole is returned to the outside via the Hawking radiation. In view of entropic force, the location of these Bell states is naturally related to the island and the quantum extremal surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the phase shift in the gravitational wave signal induced by fast oscillations of scalar dark matter surrounding binary systems, which could be probed by the future experiments LISA and DECIGO. This effect depends on the local matter density and the mass of the dark matter particle. We compare it to the phase shift due to a standard dynamical friction term, which should generically be present. We find that the effect associated with the oscillations only dominates over the dynamical friction for dark matter masses below $10^{-21}$ eV, with masses below $10^{-23}$ eV implying cloud sizes that are too large to be realistic. Moreover, for masses of the order of $10^{-21}$ eV, LISA and DECIGO would only detect this effect for dark matter densities greater than that in the solar system by a factor $10^5$ or $10^4$ respectively. We conclude that this signal can be ignored for most dark matter scenarios unless very dense clouds of very light dark matter are created early in the Universe at a redshift $z\sim 10^4$.</description>

      <title>Too Hot to Handle: Searching for Inflationary Particle Production in Planck Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-adiabatic production of massive particles is a generic feature of many inflationary mechanisms. If sufficiently massive, these particles can leave features in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) that are not well-captured by traditional correlation function analyses. We consider a scenario in which particle production occurs only in a narrow time-interval during inflation, eventually leading to CMB hot- or coldspots with characteristic shapes and sizes. Searching for such features in CMB data is analogous to searching for late-Universe hot- or coldspots, such as those due to the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. Exploiting this data-analysis parallel, we perform a search for particle-production hotspots in the Planck PR4 temperature dataset, which we implement via a matched-filter analysis. Our pipeline is validated on synthetic observations and found to yield unbiased constraints on sufficiently large hotspots across $\approx 60\%$ of the sky. After removing point sources and tSZ clusters, we find no evidence for new physics and place novel bounds on the coupling between the inflaton and massive particles. These bounds are strongest for larger hotspots, produced early in inflation, whilst sensitivity to smaller hotspots is limited by noise and beam effects. Through such methods we can constrain particles with masses $\mathcal{O}(100)$ times larger than the inflationary Hubble scale, which represents possibly the highest energies ever directly probed with observational data.</description>

      <title>Consistency of EFT illuminated via relative entropy: A case study in scalar field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21062v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description when the EFT is generated via the interaction with heavy fields in UV theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiation is a universal friction-increasing agent. When two fluid layers are in relative motion, the inevitable exchange of radiation between such layers gives rise to an effective force, which tries to prevent the layers from sliding. This friction is often modeled as a Navier-Stokes shear viscosity. However, non-Newtonian corrections are expected to appear at distances of about one optical depth from the layers' interface. Such corrections prevent the viscous stress from becoming too large. Here, we set the foundations of a rigorous theory for these corrections, valid along incompressible flows. We show that, in the linear regime, the infinite Chapman-Enskog series can be computed analytically, leading to universal formulas for all transport coefficients, which apply to any fluid, with any composition, with radiation of any type (also neutrinos), and with nearly any type of radiative process. We then show that, with an appropriate shear-heat coupling coefficient, Israel-Stewart theory can correctly describe most non-Newtonian features of radiative shear stresses.</description>

Abstract: The Hubble crisis is the discrepancy in the values of the Hubble constant inferred from diverse observations in the late and early Universe, being of the order 5$\sigma$. Instead of resolution, the conflict is getting larger with further late-time observations. A fundamental constant should be and remain constant throughout the cosmological history and thus at all redshifts. The fact that it turns out to be a function of redshift in the $\Lambda$CDM model points out that either there is a problem with the current cosmological model, indicating unknown new physics, or there are unknown systematics in some of the observations. In this work, we investigate the redshift dependence of the Hubble constant in the $\gamma\delta$CDM cosmological model, which is a new cosmological model based on $f(R)$ gravity in an anisotropic background. Through data analysis with the Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, the cosmic chronometers Hubble, and both the old and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillation data, we establish that the Hubble constant in our model does not evolve with redshift. We also confirm that our model fits the aforementioned data better than the $\Lambda$CDM model by checking various information criteria. The value of the Hubble constant obtained in the $\gamma\delta$CDM model is in the 1$\sigma$ bound of the late Universe observations.</description>

      <title>Single versus multifield scalar potentials from string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the properties of string effective theories with scalar field(s) and a scalar potential. We first claim that in most examples known, such theories are multifield, with at least 2 non-compact field directions; the few counter-examples appear to be very specific and isolated. Such a systematic multifield situation has important implications for cosmology. Characterising properties of the scalar potential $V$ is also more delicate in a multifield setting. We provide several examples of string effective theories with $V&gt;0$, where the latter admits an asymptotically flat direction along an off-shell field trajectory: in other words, there exists a limit $\varphi \rightarrow \infty$ for which $\frac{|\partial_{\varphi} V|}{V} \rightarrow 0$. It is thus meaningless to look for a lower bound to this single field quantity in a multifield setting; the complete gradient $\nabla V$ is then better suited. Restricting to on-shell trajectories, this question remains open, especially when following the steepest descent or more generally a gradient flow evolution. Interestingly, single field statements in multifield theories seem less problematic for $V&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>Tuning the cosmic instrument: robust cosmology through combined probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As wide-field surveys yield increasingly precise data, multiprobe analyses offer significant advantages. In this work, we use our previously developed framework for jointly analyzing cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure data. We analyze combinations of three CMB (Planck PR3, Planck PR4, and ACT+WMAP) datasets, DESI Y1 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data, and a $9\times 2$pt low-$z$ dataset comprising KiDS-1000, BOSS DR12, and Planck CMB lensing/Integrated Sachs Wolfe (including all cross-correlations). We first assess internal consistency, finding a mild ($&lt;2\sigma$) tension between CMB and low-$z$ datasets in the full parameter space and hints of systematics in Planck PR3 and KiDS-1000. We then derive constraints in $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ and, motivated by recent DESI results, dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) and free neutrino mass extensions. In $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$, we derive a novel $9\times2$pt constraint of $S8=0.777^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$ and find strong consistency among CMB datasets. In $w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$, adding low-$z$ to CMB+BAO tightens $(w_0,w_a)$ constraints by 50\% (in figure-of-merit terms) in our baseline combination of Planck PR4 + low-$z$ + BAO. The posterior accommodates a cosmological constant ($w_0 = -1, w_a = 0$) within $1\sigma$, in contrast to the $\sim2\sigma$ preference for evolving dark energy from CMB+BAO alone. For neutrino masses, our baseline dataset yields a systematics-robust constraint of $M_\nu&lt;0.12\mathrm{eV}$ in $\nu\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$. Allowing dynamical dark energy and free neutrino mass ($\nu w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) broadens and shifts the neutrino mass posterior higher, yielding a $1.8\sigma$ constraint ($M_\nu=0.16^{+0.09}_{-0.09}\mathrm{eV}$) in our baseline. Our analysis demonstrates the power of multiprobe analyses for assessing tensions, identifying systematics and providing robust constraints.</description>

      <title>Generalized Free Energy Landscapes from Iyer-Wald Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generalized free energy landscape plays a pivotal role in understanding black hole thermodynamics and phase transitions. In general relativity, one can directly derive the generalized free energy from the contributions of black holes exhibiting conical singularities. In this work, we extend this idea to general covariant theories. By employing Noether's second theorem, we present an alternative formulation of the Lagrangian, which can elucidate the role of conical singularities. We demonstrate that, in general, the contribution from conical singularities depends on the specific implementation of the regularization scheme and is not uniquely determined; this feature is explicitly exhibited and confirmed in three-dimensional new massive gravity. Nevertheless, these ambiguities can be absorbed into the second-order (and higher) corrections induced by conical singularities when the gravitational theory is described by the Lagrangian $L(g_{ab},R_{abcd})$. Moreover, for certain theories such as general relativity and Bumblebee gravity, this contribution simplifies to a well-defined result. However, the interpretation of the generalized free energy in Bumblebee gravity is somewhat different, with its extrema corresponding to the geometry of conical singularities. Our results uncover the particular properties of the generalized free energy beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and pre-compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of the paper is to introduce a convergence \`a la Gromov-Hausdorff for Lorentzian spaces, building on $\epsilon$-nets consisting of causal diamonds and relying only on the time separation function. This yields a geometric notion of convergence, which can be applied to synthetic Lorentzian spaces (Lorentzian pre-length spaces) or smooth spacetimes. Among the main results, we prove a Lorentzian counterpart of the celebrated Gromov's pre-compactness theorem for metric spaces, where controlled covers by balls are replaced by controlled covers by diamonds. This yields a geometric pre-compactness result for classes of globally hyperbolic spacetimes, satisfying a uniform doubling property on Cauchy hypersurfaces and a suitable control on the causality. The final part of the paper establishes several applications: we show that Chru\'sciel-Grant approximations are an instance of the Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence here introduced, we prove that timelike sectional curvature bounds are stable under such a convergence, we introduce timelike blow-up tangents and discuss connections with the main conjecture of causal set theory.</description>
