      <title>A Payoff-Based Policy Gradient Method in Stochastic Games with Long-Run Average Payoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the significant potential for various applications, stochastic games with long-run average payoffs have received limited scholarly attention, particularly concerning the development of learning algorithms for them due to the challenges of mathematical analysis. In this paper, we study the stochastic games with long-run average payoffs and present an equivalent formulation for individual payoff gradients by defining advantage functions which will be proved to be bounded. This discovery allows us to demonstrate that the individual payoff gradient function is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the policy profile and that the value function of the games exhibits the gradient dominance property. Leveraging these insights, we devise a payoff-based gradient estimation approach and integrate it with the Regularized Robbins-Monro method from stochastic approximation theory to construct a bandit learning algorithm suited for stochastic games with long-run average payoffs. Additionally, we prove that if all players adopt our algorithm, the policy profile employed will asymptotically converge to a Nash equilibrium with probability one, provided that all Nash equilibria are globally neutrally stable and a globally variationally stable Nash equilibrium exists. This condition represents a wide class of games, including monotone games.</description>

      <title>A Participatory Budgeting based Truthful Budget-Limited Incentive Mechanism for Time-Constrained Tasks in Crowdsensing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crowdsensing, also known as participatory sensing, is a method of data collection that involves gathering information from a large number of common people (or individuals), often using mobile devices or other personal technologies. This paper considers the set-up with multiple task requesters and several task executors in a strategic setting. Each task requester has multiple heterogeneous tasks and an estimated budget for the tasks. In our proposed model, the Government has a publicly known fund (or budget) and is limited. Due to limited funds, it may not be possible for the platform to offer the funds to all the available task requesters. For that purpose, in the first tier, the voting by the city dwellers over the task requesters is carried out to decide on the subset of task requesters receiving the Government fund. In the second tier, each task of the task requesters has start and finish times. Based on that, firstly, the tasks are distributed to distinct slots. In each slot, we have multiple task executors for executing the floated tasks. Each task executor reports a cost (private) for completing the floated task(s). Given the above-discussed set-up, the objectives of the second tier are: (1) to schedule each task of the task requesters in the available slots in a non-conflicting manner and (2) to select a set of executors for the available tasks in such a way that the total incentive given to the task executors should be at most the budget for the tasks. For the discussed scenario, a truthful incentive based mechanism is designed that also takes care of budget criteria. Theoretical analysis is done, and it shows that the proposed mechanism is computationally efficient, truthful, budget-feasible, and individually rational. The simulation is carried out, and the efficacy of the designed mechanism is compared with the state-of-the-art mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Buy-Many Mechanisms for Many Unit-Demand Buyers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent line of research has established a novel desideratum for designing approximately-revenue-optimal multi-item mechanisms, namely the buy-many constraint. Under this constraint, prices for different allocations made by the mechanism must be subadditive, implying that the price of a bundle cannot exceed the sum of prices of individual items it contains. This natural constraint has enabled several positive results in multi-item mechanism design bypassing well-established impossibility results. Our work addresses the main open question from this literature of extending the buy-many constraint to multiple buyer settings and developing an approximation.
  We propose a new revenue benchmark for multi-buyer mechanisms via an ex-ante relaxation that captures several different ways of extending the buy-many constraint to the multi-buyer setting. Our main result is that a simple sequential item pricing mechanism with buyer-specific prices can achieve an $O(\log m)$ approximation to this revenue benchmark when all buyers have unit-demand or additive preferences over m items. This is the best possible as it directly matches the previous results for the single-buyer setting where no simple mechanism can obtain a better approximation.
  From a technical viewpoint we make two novel contributions. First, we develop a supply-constrained version of buy-many approximation for a single buyer. Second, we develop a multi-dimensional online contention resolution scheme for unit-demand buyers that may be of independent interest in mechanism design.</description>

      <title>PackIt! Gamified Rectangle Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze PackIt!, a turn-based game consisting of packing rectangles on an $n \times n$ grid. PackIt! can be easily played on paper, either as a competitive two-player game or in \emph{solitaire} fashion. On the $t$-th turn, a rectangle of area $t$ or $t+1$ must be placed in the grid. In the two-player format of PackIt! whichever player places a rectangle last wins, whereas the goal in the solitaire variant is to perfectly pack the $n \times n$ grid. We analyze conditions for the existence of a perfect packing over $n \times n$, then present an automated reasoning approach that allows finding perfect games of PackIt! up to $n = 50$ which includes a novel SAT-encoding technique of independent interest, and conclude by proving an NP-hardness result.</description>

      <title>Results about sets of desirable gamble sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent sets of desirable gamble sets is used as a model for representing an agents opinions and choice preferences under uncertainty. In this paper we provide some results about the axioms required for coherence and the natural extension of a given set of desirable gamble sets. We also show that coherent sets of desirable gamble sets can be represented by a proper filter of coherent sets of desirable gambles.</description>
