      <title>From reasonable postulates to generalised Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian mechanics describes the evolution of a system through its Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian typically also represents the energy observable, a Noether-conserved quantity associated with the time-invariance of the law of evolution. In both quantum and classical mechanics, Hamiltonian mechanics demands a precise relationship between time evolution and observable energy, albeit using slightly different terminology. We distil basic conditions satisfied in both quantum and classical mechanics, including canonical coordinate symmetries and inner product invariance. We express these conditions in the framework of generalised probabilistic theories, which includes generalizing the definition of energy eigenstates in terms of time-invariant properties of the Hamiltonian system. By postulating these conditions to hold, we derive a unified Hamiltonian system model. This unified framework describes quantum and classical mechanics in a consistent language, facilitating their comparison. We moreover discuss alternative theories: an equation of motion given by a mixture of commutation relations, an information-restricted version of quantum theory, and Spekken's toy theory. The findings give a deeper understanding of the Hamiltonian in quantum and classical theories and point to several potential research topics.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Classical Three-Body Thermalization in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-dimensional systems, such as nanowires or electrons moving along strong magnetic field lines, have peculiar thermalization physics. The binary collision of point-like particles, typically the dominant process for reaching thermal equilibrium in higher dimensional systems, cannot thermalize a 1D system. We study how dilute classical 1D gases thermalize through three-body collisions. We consider a system of identical classical point particles with pairwise repulsive inverse power-law potential $V_{ij} \propto 1/|x_i-x_j|^n$ or the pairwise Lennard-Jones potential. Using Monte Carlo methods, we compute a collision kernel and use it in the Boltzmann equation to evolve a perturbed thermal state with temperature $T$ toward equilibrium. We explain the shape of the kernel and its dependence on the system parameters. Additionally, we implement molecular dynamics simulations of a many-body gas and show agreement with the Boltzmann evolution in the low density limit. For the inverse power-law potential, the rate of thermalization is proportional to $\rho^2 T^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{n}}$ where $\rho$ is the number density. The corresponding proportionality constant decreases with increasing $n$.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic variational structure of higher-derivative formulations of classical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the geometric structure of higher-derivative formulations of classical mechanics. It is shown that every even-order formulation of classical mechanics higher than the second order is intrinsically variational, in the sense that the equations of motion are always derivable from a minimum action principle, even when the system is non-Hamiltonian. Particular emphasis is placed on the fourth-order formulation, as that is shown to be the lowest order for which the governing equations are intrinsically variational. The Noether symmetries and associated conservation laws of the fourth-order formulation, including its Hamiltonian, are derived along with the natural auxiliary conditions. The intrinsic variational structure of higher-derivative formulations makes it possible to treat non-Hamiltonian systems as if they were Hamiltonian, with immediate classical applications. A case study of the classical damped harmonic oscillator is presented for illustration, and an action is formulated for a higher-order Navier-Stokes equation.</description>

      <title>Lost work and exergy: two views of the same concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the fundamental equation for a system and for a process, and by considering irreversibility within the system, we show that the lost work concept emerges naturally from the formalism. We then argue that if irreversibility is considered within the surroundings the lost work becomes what is known as exergy. Therefore, lost work and exergy are two views of the same concept, which in turn integrates a broader and more fundamental concept: entropy generation. It is our opinion that the clarification of the meanings of lost work and exergy, as well as the discussion that leads to an understanding of their differences and similarities, has not received the attention in the literature that it deserves. This paper fills that gap, and it is hoped that the discussion of these two concepts here will be useful for both students and teachers.</description>
