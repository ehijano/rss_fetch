      <title>Endoscopic decomposition of elliptic Fargues-Scholze L-packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this note is to show that the local L-packet of Fargues-Scholze [FS], corresponding to an elliptic L-parameter, has an endoscopic decomposition. Our argument is strongly motivated by a beautiful paper of Chenji Fu [Fu], where the stable case is proven.</description>

      <title>On Almost Strong Approximation in Reductive Algebraic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a slight weakening of the classical property of strong approximation, which we call {\it almost strong approximation}, for connected reductive algebraic group over global fields with respect to special sets of valuations. While nonsimply connected groups (in particular, all algebraic tori) always fail to have strong approximation -- and even almost strong approximation -- with respect to any finite set of valuations, we show that under appropriate assumptions they do have almost strong approximation with respect to (infinite) {\it tractable} sets of valuations, i.e. those sets that contain all archimedean valuations and a generalized arithmetic progression minus a set having Dirichlet density zero. Almost strong approximation is likely to have a variety of applications, and as an example we use almost strong approximation for tori to extend the essential part of the result of Radhika and Raghunathan (cf. \cite[Theorem 5.1]{RadRag}) on the congruence subgroup problem for inner forms of type $\textsf{A}_n$ to all absolutely almost simple simply connected groups.</description>

      <title>Principalization on logarithmically foliated orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In characteristic zero, we construct principalization of ideals on smooth orbifolds endowed with a normal crossings divisor and a foliation. We then illustrate how the method can be used in the general study of foliations via two applications. First, we provide a resolution of singularities of Darboux totally integrable foliations in arbitrary dimensions -- including rational and meromorphic Darboux foliations. Second, we show how to transform a generically transverse section into a transverse section.</description>

      <title>Construction of logarithmic cohomology theories I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for constructing cohomology theories of logarithmic schemes with strict normal crossing boundaries by employing techniques from logarithmic motivic homotopy theory over $\mathbb{F}_1$. This method recovers the K-theory of the open complement of a strict normal crossing divisor from the K-theory of schemes as well as logarithmic topological Hochschild homology from the topological Hochschild homology of schemes. In our applications, we establish that the K-theory of non-regular schemes is representable in the logarithmic motivic homotopy category, and we introduce the logarithmic cyclotomic trace for the regular log regular case.</description>

Abstract: Following the approach of Kawamata and Canonaco-Stellari, we establish Orlov's representability theorem for smooth tame Deligne-Mumford stacks with projective coarse moduli spaces over a quasiexcellent ring of finite Krull dimension. This generalizes a previous result of Canonaco-Stellari for smooth projective varieties over a field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the analogue of the Serre-Swan theorem in a context of supergeometry. This theorem gives an equivalence of the category of locally free supersheaves of bounded rank over locally ringed superspace with the category of finitely generated super projective modules over its coordinate superring, under the assumptions that every locally free supersheaf is generated by global sections and it is acyclic.</description>

      <title>Lower bound for the Cheeger constant of random complex curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a lower bound for the Cheeger constant and the spectral gap for random complex curves in $\C P^2$. The complex curve is endowed with the restriction of the ambient Fubini-Study metric, and the probability measure is the Gaussian measure induced by the $\mathscr{L}^2$-Hermitian product on the space of complex homogeneous polynomialsof degree $d$ in $3$ variables. The proof relies on our previous  bounds for the systole and the curvature of random complex curves, together with an isoperimetric inequality for small ovals on complex curves. More generally, we establish such lower bounds for random complex curves within complex projective manifolds.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To each multiple point $p$ in a line arrangement $\mathcal A$ in the complex projective plane we associate a derivation $\tilde D_p \in D_0( \mathcal A)$. We show first that these derivations span a large subspace of $D_0(\mathcal A)$. To each such derivation $\tilde D_p \in D_0(\mathcal A)$ we associate a polynomial $g_p$ which seems to play a key role in the characterization of the freeness of $\mathcal A$, as well as in the study of the position of the multiple points of $\mathcal A$ with respect to unions of lines.</description>

      <title>Positive Polytopes with Few Facets in the Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study adjoint hypersurfaces of geometric objects obtained by intersecting simple polytopes with few facets in $\mathbb{P}^5$ with the Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}(2,4)$. These generalize the positive Grassmannian, which is the intersection of $\mathrm{Gr}(2,4)$ with the simplex. We show that if the resulting object has five facets, it is a positive geometry and the adjoint hypersurface is unique. For the case of six facets we show that the adjoint hypersurface is not necessarily unique and give an upper bound on the dimension of the family of adjoints. We illustrate our results with a range of examples. In particular, we show that even if the adjoint is not unique, a positive hexahedron can still be a positive geometry.</description>

      <title>Re-Embeddings of Special Border Basis Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Border basis schemes are open subschemes of the Hilbert scheme of $\mu$ points in an affine space $\mathbb{A}^n$. They have easily describable systems of generators of their vanishing ideals for a natural embedding into a large affine space $\mathbb{A}^{\mu\nu}$. Here we bring together several techniques for re-embedding affine schemes into lower dimensional spaces which we developed in the last years. We study their efficacy for some special types of border basis schemes such as MaxDeg border basis schemes, L-shape and simplicial border basis schemes, as well as planar border basis schemes. A particular care is taken to make these re-embeddings efficiently computable and to check when we actually get an isomorphism with $\mathbb{A}^{n\mu}$, i.e., when the border basis scheme is an affine cell.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize Cohen--Macaulay and $\varphi$-rational perfect schemes in terms of their perverse \'etale mod $p$ sheaves. Using inversion of adjunction, we prove that sufficiently small Schubert varieties in the Witt affine flag variety are perfections of globally $+$-regular varieties, and hence they are $\varphi$-rational. Our methods apply uniformly to all affine Schubert varieties in equicharacteristic, as well as classical Schubert varieties, thereby answering a question of Bhatt. As a corollary, we deduce that scheme-theoretic local models always have $\varphi$-split special fiber.</description>

      <title>On smooth-group actions on reductive groups and spherical buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field, and suppose that $\Gamma$ is a smooth $k$-group that acts on a connected, reductive $k$-group $\widetilde G$. Let $G$ denote the maximal smooth, connected subgroup of the group of $\Gamma$-fixed points in $\widetilde G$. Under fairly general conditions, we show that $G$ is a reductive $k$-group, and that the image of the functorial embedding $\mathscr{S}(G) \longrightarrow \mathscr{S}(\widetilde G)$ of spherical buildings is the set of ``$\Gamma$-fixed points in $\mathscr{S}(\widetilde G)$'', in a suitable sense. In particular, we do not need to assume that $\Gamma$ has order relatively prime to the characteristic of $k$ (nor even that $\Gamma$ is finite), nor that the action of $\Gamma$ preserves a Borel-torus pair in $\widetilde G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a short proof of a version of the Ohsawa-Takegoshi-Manivel $L^2$ extension theorem as a corollary of a Skoda-type $L^2$ division theorem with bounded generators. The new division theorem is of independent interest: the boundedness of generators allows to send the parameter $\alpha&gt;1$ of the usual $L^2$ division theorems to 1 in the norm of the datum of the division. As an aside, we also use the new division theorem to prove a Brian\c{c}on-Skoda-type result.</description>

      <title>Solving generic parametric linear matrix inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) $A = A_0+x_1A_1+\cdots+x_nA_n\succeq 0$ with the $A_i$'s being $m\times m$ symmetric matrices, with entries in a ring $\mathcal{R}$. When $\mathcal{R} = \mathbb{R}$, the feasibility problem consists in deciding whether the $x_i$'s can be instantiated to obtain a positive semidefinite matrix. When $\mathcal{R} = \mathbb{Q}[y_1, \ldots, y_t]$, the problem asks for a formula on the parameters $y_1, \ldots, y_t$, which describes the values of the parameters for which the specialized LMI is feasible. This problem can be solved using general quantifier elimination algorithms, with a complexity that is exponential in $n$. In this work, we leverage the LMI structure of the problem to design an algorithm that computes a formula $\Phi$ describing a dense subset of the feasible region of parameters, under genericity assumptions. The complexity of this algorithm is exponential in $n, m$ and $t$ but becomes polynomial in $n$ when $m$ is fixed. We apply the algorithm to a parametric sum-of-squares problem and to the convergence analyses of certain first-order optimization methods, which are both known to be equivalent to the feasibility of certain parametric LMIs, hence demonstrating its practical interest.</description>

The basic idea behind the proposed algorithm is that a hyperplane can be used to completely separate a given set of data points mapped to n dimensional space, if the given data points are linearly separable in the n dimensions. Since points are the foundational elements of any geometrical construct, by manipulating the position of points used for the construction of a given hyperplane, the position of the hyperplane itself can be manipulated. The paper includes testing data against other classifiers on a variety of standard machine learning datasets. With a focus on support vector machines, since they and our proposed classifier use the same geometrical construct of hyperplane, and the versatility of SVMs make them a good bench mark for comparison. Since the algorithm focuses on moving the points through the hyperspace to which the dataset has been mapped, it has been dubbed as moving points algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the curvature and symplectic asphericity properties of symmetric products of surfaces. We show that these spaces can be used to answer nuanced questions arising in the study of closed Riemannian manifolds with positive scalar curvature. For example, we prove that symmetric products of surfaces sharply distinguish between two distinct notions of macroscopic dimension introduced by Gromov and the second-named author. As a natural generalization of this circle of ideas, we address the Gromov--Lawson and Gromov conjectures in the Kaehler projective setting and draw new connections between the theories of the minimal model, positivity in algebraic geometry, and macroscopic dimensions.</description>

Abstract: A ribbon is a non-reduced curve modelled on the first infinitesimal neighbourhood of a smooth curve in a surface. This paper is devoted to describe some properties of coherent sheaves on such a curve and their Simpson moduli space. In particular we give necessary and sufficent conditions for the existence of semistable quasi locally free sheaves (in the sense of Dr\'ezet) of a fixed complete type and we compute the dimension of the Zariski closure in the moduli space of the locus of semistable quasi locally free sheaves of a fixed complete type. We also show when vector bundles on the reduced subcurve deform to sheaves supported on the ribbon. We find a special kind of non quasi locally free sheaves which, as generalized line bundles, are direct images of quasi locally free sheaves on an appropriate blow up of the ribbon. Finally, we give a conjectural description of the irreducible components of the Simpson moduli space, explaining precisely which parts have already been proved and what lacks for the complete result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2006.16553v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, the existence of Ulrich bundles on projective bundles $\mathbb P(E) \to X$ is discussed. In the case, that the base variety $X$ is a curve or surface, a close relationship between Ulrich bundles on $X$ and those on $\mathbb P(E)$ is established for specific polarisations. This yields the existence of Ulrich bundles on a wide range of projective bundles over curves and surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.08217v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the enumerative geometry of lines on smooth cubic surfaces is governed by the arithmetic of the base field. In 1949, Segre proved that the number of lines on a smooth cubic surface over any field is 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 15, or 27. Over a given field, each of these line counts may or may not be realized by some cubic surface. We give a sufficient criterion for each of these line counts in terms of the Galois theory of the base field.</description>

Abstract: We study multiplicities of jumping numbers of multiplier ideals in a smooth variety of arbitrary dimension. We prove that the multiplicity function is a quasi-polynomial, hence proving that the Poincar\'e series is a rational function. We further study when the various components of the quasi-polynomial have the highest possible degree and relate it to jumping numbers contributed by Rees valuations. Finally, we study the special case of monomial ideals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.00566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any fixed globally F-regular projective variety X over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic, we study the F-signature of section rings of X with respect to the ample Cartier divisors on X. In particular, we define an F-signature function on the ample cone of X and show that it is locally Lipschitz continuous. We further prove that the F-signature function extends to the boundary of the ample cone. We also establish an effective comparison between the F-signature function and the volume function on the ample cone. As a consequence, we show that for divisors that are nef but not big, the extension of the F-signature is zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any integer $n\geq 2$, we prove that for any large enough integer $d$, with large probability the injectivity radius of a random degree $d$ complex hypersurface in $\C P^n$ is larger than $d^{-\frac{1}2(3n+2)}$. Here the hypersurface is endowed with the restriction of the ambient Fubini-Study metric, and the probability measure is induced by the Fubini-Study $L^2$-Hermitian product on the space of homogeneous complex polynomials of degree $d$ in $(n+1)$-variables. We also prove that with high probability, the sectional curvatures of the random hypersurface are bounded by  $d^{\frac{3}2(n+2)}$,  and that its spectral gap is bounded below by $\exp(-d^{\frac{1}4(3n+15)})$. These results extend to random  submanifolds of higher codimension in any complex projective manifold. Independently, we prove that the diameter of a degree $d$ divisor is bounded by $Cd^3$, which generalizes and amends the bound given in~\cite{feng1999diameter} for planar curves.</description>

      <title>Structure of connected nested automorphism groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nested group is an increasing union of a sequence of algebraic groups. In this paper, we describe maximal nested unipotent subgroups of $\mathrm{Aut}(X)$, where $X$ is an affine variety. It turns out that they are similar to the group of triangular automorphisms of $\mathbb{A}^n$. We show that if an abstract subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut}(X)$ consists of unipotent elements, then it is closed if and only if it is nested. This implies that a connected nested subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut}(X)$ is closed, answering a question of Kraft and Zaidenberg (2022, arXiv:2203.11356).
  We also extend the recent description of maximal commutative unipotent subgroups by Regeta and van Santen (2024, arXiv:2112.04784), offering a direct construction method and relating them to our description.</description>

Abstract: We construct a new type of spectral sequences for the mixed Hodge structures on the cohomology of locally symmetric varieties. These spectral sequences converge to the edge components in the Hodge triangles, and the E1-terms are expressed by group cohomology associated to the cusps. They already degenerate at E1 in a certain range, which gives a simple expression of some Hodge components. An identity of holomorphic Euler numbers is obtained as a consequence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the sheafified version of the cohomological integrality conjecture for stacks obtained as a quotient of a smooth affine symmetric algebraic variety by a reductive algebraic group equipped with an invariant function. A crucial step is the definition of the BPS sheaf as a complex of monodromic mixed Hodge modules. We prove the purity of the BPS sheaf when the situation arises from a smooth affine weakly symplectic algebraic variety with a weak moment map. This situation gives local models for 1-Artin derived stacks with self-dual cotangent complex. We then apply these results to prove a conjecture of Halpern-Leistner predicting the purity of the Borel-Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks (or more generally, derived stacks with self-dual cotangent complex) having a proper good moduli space. One striking application is the purity of the Borel--Moore homology of the moduli stack of principal Higgs bundles over a smooth projective curve for a reductive group.</description>

Abstract: We count points on character varieties associated with punctured surfaces and regular semisimple generic conjugacy classes in reductive groups. We find that the number of points are palindromic polynomials. This suggests a $P=W$ conjecture for these varieties. We also count points on the corresponding additive character varieties and find that the number of points are also polynomials, which we conjecture have non-negative coefficients. These polynomials can be considered as the reductive analogues of the Kac polynomials of comet-shaped quivers.</description>

Abstract: We give a self-contained classification of $1_*$-generic minimal border rank tensors in $\mathbb{C}^m \otimes \mathbb{C}^m \otimes \mathbb{C}^m$ for $m \leq 5$. Together with previous results, this gives a classification of all minimal border rank tensors in $\mathbb{C}^m \otimes \mathbb{C}^m \otimes \mathbb{C}^m$ for $m \leq 5$: there are $107$ isomorphism classes (only $37$ up to permuting factors). We fully describe possible degenerations among the tensors. We prove that there are no $1$-degenerate minimal border rank tensors in $\mathbb{C}^m \otimes \mathbb{C}^m \otimes \mathbb{C}^m $ for $m \leq 4$.</description>

Abstract: An effective method of computing division polynomials in terms of Mumford coordinates is presented. As an example, division polynomials for $3$- and $4$-torsion divisors on a genus two curve are obtained explicitly in terms of Mumford coordinates, and $x$-, $y$-coordinates of the support of torsion divisors. As a result, $n$-torsion divisors on a given curve can be computed directly from the division polynomials. Alternatively, these divisors are obtained by solving the Jacobi inversion problem at points of the Jacobian variety of order $n$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have previously proposed a study of arrangements of small circles which also surround regions in the plane realized as the images of natural real algebraic maps yielding Morse-Bott functions by projections. Among studies of arrangements, families of smooth regular submanifolds in smooth manifolds, this study is fundamental, explicit, and new, surprisingly.
  We have obtained a complete list of local changes of the graphs the regions naturally collapse to in adding a (generic) small circle to an existing arrangement of the proposed class. Here, we propose a similar and essentially different class of arrangements of circles. The present study also yields real algebraic maps and nice real algebraic functions similarly and we present a similar study.
  We are interested in topological properties and combinatorics among such arrangements and regions and applications to constructing such real algebraic maps and manifolds explicitly and understanding their global structures.</description>

      <title>Realizations of planar graphs as Poincar'e-Reeb graphs of refined algebraic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algebraic domains are regions in the plane surrounded by mutually disjoint non-singular real algebraic curves. Poincar'e-Reeb Graphs of them are graphs they naturally collapse: such graphs are formally formulated by Sorea, for example, around 2020. Their studies found that nicely embedded planar graphs are Poincar'e-Reeb graphs of some algebraic domains. These graphs are generic with respect to the projection to the horizontal axis. Problems, methods and results are elementary and natural and they apply natural approximations nicely for example.
  We present our new approach to extension of the result to a non-generic case and an answer. We first formulate generalized algebraic domains, surrounded by non-singular real algebraic curves which may intersect with normal crossings. Such domains and certain classes of them appear in related studies of graphs and regions surrounded by algebraic curves explicitly.</description>

      <title>Arrangements of circles, the regions surrounded by them and labeled Poincar\'e-Reeb graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in arrangements of circles and the regions surrounded by them. {\it Poincar\'e-Reeb graphs} have been fundamental and strong tools in studying shapes of regions surrounded by real algebraic curves, since around 2020. They are natural graphs the regions naturally collapse to and were first formulated by Sorea with several researchers. Studying shapes of such regions is one of fundamental studies in real algebraic geometry and combinatorics for example. This is surprisingly new and recently developing.
  Our study introduces labels on vertices and edges of such graphs encoding information of the circles where we concentrate on regions surrounded by circles. The author studied local changes of Poincar\'e-Reeb graphs by addition of circles under certain rules before and we discuss changes of new types. The author has started related studies motivated by singularity theory of real algebraic maps and found first that our regions are the images of natural real algebraic maps, generalizing natural projections of spheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.06338v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the Zilber--Pink conjecture for curves in $Y(1)^n$ whose Zariski closure in $(\mathbb{P}^1)^n$ passes through the point $(\infty, \ldots, \infty)$, going beyond the asymmetry condition of Habegger and Pila. Our proof is based on a height bound following Andr\'e's G-functions method. The principal novelty is that we exploit relations between evaluations of G-functions at unboundedly many non-archimedean places.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that if $R$ is a G-ring then every fully dualizable $R$-linear cocomplete category is equivalent to a twist by a $\mathbb{G}_m$-gerbe of the category of modules over a finite \'etale $R$-algebra. We also show that this holds more generally over an arbitrary commutative ring under an additional compact generation hypothesis. We include variants of these results that apply to $R$-linear graded categories, and to the context of $\infty$-categories linear over connective commutative ring spectra.</description>

      <title>Admissible pairs and $p$-adic Hodge structures II: The bi-analytic Ax-Lindemann theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reinterpret and generalize the construction of local Shimura varieties and their non-minuscule analogs by viewing them as moduli spaces of admissible pairs. Our main application is a bi-analytic Ax-Lindemann theorem comparing, in the basic case, rigid analytic subvarieties for the two distinct analytic structures induced by the Hodge and Hodge-Tate period maps and their lattice refinements. The theorem implies, in particular, that the only bi-analytic subdiamonds are special subvarieties, generalizing the bi-analytic characterization of special points given in Part I. These results suggest that there is a purely local, $p$-adic theory of bi-analytic geometry that runs in parallel to the global, archimedean theory of bi-algebraic geometry arising in the study of unlikely intersection and functional transcendence for Shimura varieties and more general period domains for variations of Hodge structure.</description>

      <title>Admissible pairs and $p$-adic Hodge structures I: Transcendence of the de Rham lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an algebraically closed non-archimedean extension $C/\mathbb{Q}_p$, we define a Tannakian category of $p$-adic Hodge structures over $C$ that is a local, $p$-adic analog of the global, archimedean category of $\mathbb{Q}$-Hodge structures in complex geometry. In this setting the filtrations of classical Hodge theory must be enriched to lattices over a complete discrete valuation ring, Fontaine's integral de Rham period ring $B^+_\mathrm{dR}$, and a pure $p$-adic Hodge structure is then a $\mathbb{Q}_p$-vector space equipped with a $B^+_\mathrm{dR}$-lattice satisfying a natural condition analogous to the transversality of the complex Hodge filtration with its conjugate. We show $p$-adic Hodge structures are equivalent to a full subcategory of basic objects in the category of admissible pairs, a toy category of cohomological motives over $C$ that is equivalent to the isogeny category of rigidified Breuil-Kisin-Fargues modules and closely related to Fontaine's $p$-adic Hodge theory over $p$-adic subfields. As an application, we characterize basic admissible pairs with complex multiplication in terms of the transcendence of $p$-adic periods. This generalizes an earlier result for one-dimensional formal groups and is an unconditional, local, $p$-adic analog of a global, archimedean characterization of CM motives over $\mathbb{C}$ conditional on the standard conjectures, the Hodge conjecture, and the Grothendieck period conjecture (known unconditionally for abelian varieties by work Cohen and Shiga and Wolfart).</description>

      <title>Galois Symmetry of $Gal(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})$ on Topological Manifold Structures of Varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a definition of the profinite normal structure set for the set of all manifolds in a fixed profinite homotopy type. Using this framework, we prove that the Galois action of $Gal(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})$ on the underlying topological manifold structures of smooth, complete, simply-connected complex varieties defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ of dimension at least $3$ factors through the abelianization of $Gal(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})$. Moreover, this abelian action extends canonically to the entire profinite normal structure set. This result provides an answer to the question by Sullivan in the case of topological manifold structures of simply-connected varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Gauss and Jacobi sums from a viewpoint of motives. We exhibit isomorphisms between Chow motives arising from the Artin-Schreier curve and the Fermat varieties over a finite field, that can be regarded as (and yield a new proof of) classically known relations among Gauss and Jacobi sums such as Davenport-Hasse's multiplication formula. As a key step, we define motivic analogues of the Gauss and Jacobi sums as algebraic correspondences, and show that they represent the Frobenius endomorphisms of such motives. This generalizes Coleman's result for curves. These results are applied to investigate the group of invertible Chow motives with coefficients in a cyclotomic field.</description>

      <title>On the Geometry and Optimization of Polynomial Convolutional Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study convolutional neural networks with monomial activation functions. Specifically, we prove that their parameterization map is regular and is an isomorphism almost everywhere, up to rescaling the filters. By leveraging on tools from algebraic geometry, we explore the geometric properties of the image in function space of this map - typically referred to as neuromanifold. In particular, we compute the dimension and the degree of the neuromanifold, which measure the expressivity of the model, and describe its singularities. Moreover, for a generic large dataset, we derive an explicit formula that quantifies the number of critical points arising in the optimization of a regression loss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the average number of surjections from class groups of quadratic function fields over $\mathbb F_q(t)$ onto finite odd order groups $H$, once $q$ is sufficiently large. These yield the first known moments of these class groups, as predicted by the Cohen--Lenstra heuristics, apart from the case $H = \mathbb Z/3\mathbb Z$. The key input to this result is a topological one, where we compute the stable rational homology groups of Hurwitz spaces associated to non-splitting conjugacy classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combinatorics of dimer models on brane tilings describe a large class of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theories that afford quiver descriptions and have toric moduli spaces. We introduce a combinatorial optimization method leveraging simulated annealing to explicitly construct geometrically consistent brane tilings, providing a proof of concept for efficient generation of gauge theories using metaheuristic techniques. The implementation of this idea recovers known examples and allows us to derive a new brane tiling with $26$ quantum fields, illustrating the potential of metaheuristic techniques as a valuable addition to the toolbox for constructing and analyzing gauge theories from brane tilings.</description>
