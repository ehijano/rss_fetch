      <title>Relaxed Clique Percolation and Disinformation-Resilient Domains for Social Commerce Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Must we trace and block all fake content in a social commerce network so that genuine users may enjoy fake-free information? Such efforts largely fail, because, as we get better at spam detection, spammers use the same advances for anti-detection. As a fundamentally new approach, we show that an online platform can aggregate and route user-generated content in a smart personalized way, which fosters and relies on "collective social responsibility". We introduce the notion of information aggregation domain, or simply, domain: composed for a given "central" node (user account), a domain is a connected set of nodes whose user-generated content is eligible to be used to meet the central node's information needs. Admitting malicious information sources - "bad citizen" nodes - into "good citizen" nodes' domains puts the good citizens at risk for disinformation attacks. We show how a platform can limit this risk by exploiting the social link structure between its nodes without the need to know which nodes are good or bad citizens. We introduce Relaxed Clique Percolation (RCP), a class of policies to compose personalized disinformation-resilient domains. Then, we define "RCP cores" and show how they can be used to efficiently compose resilient domains for all network nodes at once. Finally, we analyze the properties of RCP domains found in real-world social networks including Slashdot, Facebook, Flickr, and Yelp, to affirm that in practice, RCP domains turn out to be large and spatially diverse.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Contagion Origins: Optimal Estimation through Maximum-Likelihood and Starlike Tree Approximation in Markovian Spreading Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the source of epidemic-like spread in networks is crucial for tasks like removing internet viruses or finding the rumor source in online social networks. The challenge lies in tracing the source from a snapshot observation of infected nodes. How do we accurately pinpoint the source? Utilizing snapshot data, we apply a probabilistic approach, focusing on the graph boundary and the observed time, to detect sources via an effective maximum likelihood algorithm. A novel starlike tree approximation extends applicability to general graphs, demonstrating versatility. We highlight the utility of the Gamma function for analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the likelihood ratio between nodes. Comprehensive evaluations confirm algorithmic effectiveness in diverse network scenarios, advancing rumor source detection in large-scale network analysis and information dissemination strategies.</description>

      <title>Ellipsoidal embeddings of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their flexibility to represent almost any kind of relational data, graph-based models have enjoyed a tremendous success over the past decades. While graphs are inherently only combinatorial objects, however, many prominent analysis tools are based on the algebraic representation of graphs via matrices such as the graph Laplacian, or on associated graph embeddings. Such embeddings associate to each node a set of coordinates in a vector space, a representation which can then be employed for learning tasks such as the classification or alignment of the nodes of the graph. As the geometric picture provided by embedding methods enables the use of a multitude of methods developed for vector space data, embeddings have thus gained interest both from a theoretical as well as a practical perspective. Inspired by trace-optimization problems, often encountered in the analysis of graph-based data, here we present a method to derive ellipsoidal embeddings of the nodes of a graph, in which each node is assigned a set of coordinates on the surface of a hyperellipsoid. Our method may be seen as an alternative to popular spectral embedding techniques, to which it shares certain similarities we discuss. To illustrate the utility of the embedding we conduct a case study in which analyse synthetic and real world networks with modular structure, and compare the results obtained with known methods in the literature.</description>

      <title>LLM-Driven Agents for Influencer Selection in Digital Advertising Campaigns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the digital world, influencers are pivotal as opinion leaders, shaping the views and choices of their influencees. Modern advertising often follows this trend, where marketers choose appropriate influencers for product endorsements, based on thorough market analysis. Previous studies on influencer selection have typically relied on numerical representations of individual opinions and interactions, a method that simplifies the intricacies of social dynamics. With the development of large language models (LLMs), we now have the opportunity to capture the nuanced exchanges of information within social networks. Hence, in this work, we first introduce an Influencer Dynamics Simulator (IDS), helping promoters identify and select the right influencers to market their products, based on LLM simulation. Concretely, we first propose an influencer-influencee engagement-based pre-selection module to screen potential influencer candidates. Subsequently, a simulation is constructed for these candidates and their influencees. Each user is represented as an LLM-based agent, drawing from their interaction history to deduce their profile and interests. The influencee agents will predict their behavior in response to influencer advertising. Finally, we develop a ranking metric designed to pinpoint influencers who are most likely to drive product purchases based on feedback from their influencees. To evaluate our framework, we collect a real-world advertising network dataset, including social relations, post and comment content, and user behaviors. Our dataset covers six products in diverse categories with their promoter influencers. Experiments show that IDS accurately identifies influencers from hundreds of candidates and provides valuable insights through detailed comments and specific attitudes.</description>

      <title>Multi-perspective Memory Enhanced Network for Identifying Key Nodes in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying key nodes in social networks plays a crucial role in timely blocking false information. Existing key node identification methods usually consider node influence only from the propagation structure perspective and have insufficient generalization ability to unknown scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-perspective Memory Enhanced Network (MMEN) for identifying key nodes in social networks, which mines key nodes from multiple perspectives and utilizes memory networks to store historical information. Specifically, MMEN first constructs two propagation networks from the perspectives of user attributes and propagation structure and updates node feature representations using graph attention networks. Meanwhile, the memory network is employed to store information of similar subgraphs, enhancing the model's generalization performance in unknown scenarios. Finally, MMEN applies adaptive weights to combine the node influence of the two propagation networks to select the ultimate key nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous methods.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Information Enhancement Network for Cascade Prediction in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding information cascades in networks is a fundamental issue in numerous applications. Current researches often sample cascade information into several independent paths or subgraphs to learn a simple cascade representation. However, these approaches fail to exploit the hierarchical semantic associations between different modalities, limiting their predictive performance. In this work, we propose a novel Hierarchical Information Enhancement Network (HIENet) for cascade prediction. Our approach integrates fundamental cascade sequence, user social graphs, and sub-cascade graph into a unified framework. Specifically, HIENet utilizes DeepWalk to sample cascades information into a series of sequences. It then gathers path information between users to extract the social relationships of propagators. Additionally, we employ a time-stamped graph convolutional network to aggregate sub-cascade graph information effectively. Ultimately, we introduce a Multi-modal Cascade Transformer to powerfully fuse these clues, providing a comprehensive understanding of cascading process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>MOTIV: Visual Exploration of Moral Framing in Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a visual computing framework for analyzing moral rhetoric on social media around controversial topics. Using Moral Foundation Theory, we propose a methodology for deconstructing and visualizing the \textit{when}, \textit{where}, and \textit{who} behind each of these moral dimensions as expressed in microblog data. We characterize the design of this framework, developed in collaboration with experts from language processing, communications, and causal inference. Our approach integrates microblog data with multiple sources of geospatial and temporal data, and leverages unsupervised machine learning (generalized additive models) to support collaborative hypothesis discovery and testing. We implement this approach in a system named MOTIV. We illustrate this approach on two problems, one related to Stay-at-home policies during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the other related to the Black Lives Matter movement. Through detailed case studies and discussions with collaborators, we identify several insights discovered regarding the different drivers of moral sentiment in social media. Our results indicate that this visual approach supports rapid, collaborative hypothesis testing, and can help give insights into the underlying moral values behind controversial political issues.

      <title>Simple Graph Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The burdensome training costs on large-scale graphs have aroused significant interest in graph condensation, which involves tuning Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on a small condensed graph for use on the large-scale original graph. Existing methods primarily focus on aligning key metrics between the condensed and original graphs, such as gradients, distribution and trajectory of GNNs, yielding satisfactory performance on downstream tasks. However, these complex metrics necessitate intricate computations and can potentially disrupt the optimization process of the condensation graph, making the condensation process highly demanding and unstable. Motivated by the recent success of simplified models in various fields, we propose a simplified approach to metric alignment in graph condensation, aiming to reduce unnecessary complexity inherited from GNNs. In our approach, we eliminate external parameters and exclusively retain the target condensed graph during the condensation process. Following the hierarchical aggregation principles of GNNs, we introduce the Simple Graph Condensation (SimGC) framework, which aligns the condensed graph with the original graph from the input layer to the prediction layer, guided by a pre-trained Simple Graph Convolution (SGC) model on the original graph. As a result, both graphs possess the similar capability to train GNNs. This straightforward yet effective strategy achieves a significant speedup of up to 10 times compared to existing graph condensation methods while performing on par with state-of-the-art baselines. Comprehensive experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SimGC in prediction accuracy, condensation time, and generalization capability. Our code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the evolution history of networked complex systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution processes of complex systems carry key information in the systems' functional properties. Applying machine learning algorithms, we demonstrate that the historical formation process of various networked complex systems can be extracted, including protein-protein interaction, ecology, and social network systems. The recovered evolution process has demonstrations of immense scientific values, such as interpreting the evolution of protein-protein interaction network, facilitating structure prediction, and particularly revealing the key co-evolution features of network structures such as preferential attachment, community structure, local clustering, degree-degree correlation that could not be explained collectively by previous theories. Intriguingly, we discover that for large networks, if the performance of the machine learning model is slightly better than a random guess on the pairwise order of links, reliable restoration of the overall network formation process can be achieved. This suggests that evolution history restoration is generally highly feasible on empirical networks.</description>

      <title>InstaSynth: Opportunities and Challenges in Generating Synthetic Instagram Data with ChatGPT for Sponsored Content Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) raise concerns about lowering the cost of generating texts that could be used for unethical or illegal purposes, especially on social media. This paper investigates the promise of such models to help enforce legal requirements related to the disclosure of sponsored content online. We investigate the use of LLMs for generating synthetic Instagram captions with two objectives: The first objective (fidelity) is to produce realistic synthetic datasets. For this, we implement content-level and network-level metrics to assess whether synthetic captions are realistic. The second objective (utility) is to create synthetic data that is useful for sponsored content detection. For this, we evaluate the effectiveness of the generated synthetic data for training classifiers to identify undisclosed advertisements on Instagram. Our investigations show that the objectives of fidelity and utility may conflict and that prompt engineering is a useful but insufficient strategy. Additionally, we find that while individual synthetic posts may appear realistic, collectively they lack diversity, topic connectivity, and realistic user interaction patterns.</description>

      <title>Closing the Information Gap in Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), also known as Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), has shifted from being a stigmatized topic on the fringes of scientific inquiry to a legitimate subject of scientific interest with a need for high quality, curated data, and rigorous scientific investigation. This paper presents a preliminary scoping review and analysis of scholarly literature related to UAP from 1967 until 2023, exploring a diverse range of research areas across disciplines to illustrate scholarly discourse about the topic. The paper focuses on characterizing papers published in recent years and notes that Library &amp; Information Science is unrepresented in the current UAP literature. The paper also discusses how researchers across the iFields can contribute to UAP studies through inherent expertise such as data curation and data science as well as information behavior and information literacy, among others. The paper concludes by emphasizing that UAP Studies offer a rich intellectual realm for information science research, with the iFields well positioned to play a crucial role in supporting and engaging in the study of UAP.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Worker Recruitment in Collaborative Mobile Crowdsourcing: A Graph Neural Network Trust Evaluation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04366v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaborative Mobile Crowdsourcing (CMCS) allows platforms to recruit worker teams to collaboratively execute complex sensing tasks. The efficiency of such collaborations could be influenced by trust relationships among workers. To obtain the asymmetric trust values among all workers in the social network, the Trust Reinforcement Evaluation Framework (TREF) based on Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) is proposed in this paper. The task completion effect is comprehensively calculated by considering the workers' ability benefits, distance benefits, and trust benefits in this paper. The worker recruitment problem is modeled as an Undirected Complete Recruitment Graph (UCRG), for which a specific Tabu Search Recruitment (TSR) algorithm solution is proposed. An optimal execution team is recruited for each task by the TSR algorithm, and the collaboration team for the task is obtained under the constraint of privacy loss. To enhance the efficiency of the recruitment algorithm on a large scale and scope, the Mini-Batch K-Means clustering algorithm and edge computing technology are introduced, enabling distributed worker recruitment. Lastly, extensive experiments conducted on five real datasets validate that the recruitment algorithm proposed in this paper outperforms other baselines. Additionally, TREF proposed herein surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art trust evaluation methods in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nodes in networks that exhibit high connectivity, also called ``hubs'', play a critical role in determining the structural and functional properties of networked systems. However, there is no clear definition of what constitutes a hub node in a network, and the classification of network hubs in existing work has either been purely qualitative or relies on ad hoc criteria for thresholding continuous data that do not generalize well to networks with certain degree sequences. Here we develop a set of efficient nonparametric methods that classify hub nodes in directed networks using the Minimum Description Length principle, effectively providing a clear and principled definition for network hubs. We adapt our methods to both unweighted and weighted networks and demonstrate them in a range of example applications using real and synthetic network data.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing News Consumption on Social Media Platforms Using Large Language Models and Realistic Bot Accounts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarization, declining trust, and wavering support for democratic norms are pressing threats to U.S. democracy. Exposure to verified and quality news may lower individual susceptibility to these threats and make citizens more resilient to misinformation, populism, and hyperpartisan rhetoric. This project examines how to enhance users' exposure to and engagement with verified and ideologically balanced news in an ecologically valid setting. We rely on a large-scale two-week long field experiment (from 1/19/2023 to 2/3/2023) on 28,457 Twitter users. We created 28 bots utilizing GPT-2 that replied to users tweeting about sports, entertainment, or lifestyle with a contextual reply containing two hardcoded elements: a URL to the topic-relevant section of quality news organization and an encouragement to follow its Twitter account. To further test differential effects by gender of the bots, treated users were randomly assigned to receive responses by bots presented as female or male. We examine whether our over-time intervention enhances the following of news media organization, the sharing and the liking of news content and the tweeting about politics and the liking of political content. We find that the treated users followed more news accounts and the users in the female bot treatment were more likely to like news content than the control. Most of these results, however, were small in magnitude and confined to the already politically interested Twitter users, as indicated by their pre-treatment tweeting about politics. These findings have implications for social media and news organizations, and also offer direction for future work on how Large Language Models and other computational interventions can effectively enhance individual on-platform engagement with quality news and public affairs.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks for Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new scattering networks for signals measured on simplicial complexes, which we call \emph{Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks} (MHSNs). Our construction is based on multiscale basis dictionaries on simplicial complexes, i.e., the $\kappa$-GHWT and $\kappa$-HGLET, which we recently developed for simplices of dimension $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$ in a given simplicial complex by generalizing the node-based Generalized Haar-Walsh Transform (GHWT) and Hierarchical Graph Laplacian Eigen Transform (HGLET). The $\kappa$-GHWT and the $\kappa$-HGLET both form redundant sets (i.e., dictionaries) of multiscale basis vectors and the corresponding expansion coefficients of a given signal. Our MHSNs use a layered structure analogous to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to cascade the moments of the modulus of the dictionary coefficients. The resulting features are invariant to reordering of the simplices (i.e., node permutation of the underlying graphs). Importantly, the use of multiscale basis dictionaries in our MHSNs admits a natural pooling operation that is akin to local pooling in CNNs, and which may be performed either locally or per-scale. These pooling operations are harder to define in both traditional scattering networks based on Morlet wavelets, and geometric scattering networks based on Diffusion Wavelets. As a result, we are able to extract a rich set of descriptive yet robust features that can be used along with very simple machine learning methods (i.e., logistic regression or support vector machines) to achieve high-accuracy classification systems with far fewer parameters to train than most modern graph neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our MHSNs in three distinct types of problems: signal classification, domain (i.e., graph/simplex) classification, and molecular dynamics prediction.</description>
