      <title>Technology Adoption and Network Externalities in Financial Systems: A Spatial-Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework for analyzing technology adoption in financial networks that incorporates spatial spillovers, network externalities, and their interaction. The framework characterizes adoption dynamics through a master equation whose solution admits a Feynman-Kac representation as expected cumulative adoption pressure along stochastic paths through spatial-network space. From this representation, I derive the Adoption Amplification Factor -- a structural measure of technology leadership that captures the ratio of total system-wide adoption to initial adoption following a localized shock. A Levy jump-diffusion extension with state-dependent jump intensity captures critical mass dynamics: below threshold, adoption evolves through gradual diffusion; above threshold, cascade dynamics accelerate adoption through discrete jumps. Applying the framework to SWIFT gpi adoption among 17 Global Systemically Important Banks, I find strong support for the two-regime characterization. Network-central banks adopt significantly earlier ($\rho = -0.69$, $p = 0.002$), and pre-threshold adopters have significantly higher amplification factors than post-threshold adopters (11.81 versus 7.83, $p = 0.010$). Founding members, representing 29 percent of banks, account for 39 percent of total system amplification -- sufficient to trigger cascade dynamics. Controlling for firm size and network position, CEO age delays adoption by 11-15 days per year.</description>

      <title>Quantile Vector Autoregression without Crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers estimation and model selection of quantile vector autoregression (QVAR). Conventional quantile regression often yields undesirable crossing quantile curves, violating the monotonicity of quantiles. To address this issue, we propose a simplex quantile vector autoregression (SQVAR) framework, which transforms the autoregressive (AR) structure of the original QVAR model into a simplex, ensuring that the estimated quantile curves remain monotonic across all quantile levels. In addition, we impose the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty on the SQVAR model to mitigate the explosive nature of the parameter space. We further develop a Bayesian information criterion (BIC)-based procedure for selecting the optimal penalty parameter and introduce new frameworks for impulse response analysis of QVAR models. Finally, we establish asymptotic properties of the proposed method, including the convergence rate and asymptotic normality of the estimator, the consistency of AR order selection, and the validity of the BIC-based penalty selection. For illustration, we apply the proposed method to U.S. financial market data, highlighting the usefulness of our SQVAR method.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Deep Learning: A Probabilistic Framework for Modeling Uncertainty in Structured Temporal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I propose a novel framework that integrates stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with deep generative models to improve uncertainty quantification in machine learning applications involving structured and temporal data. This approach, termed Stochastic Latent Differential Inference (SLDI), embeds an It\^o SDE in the latent space of a variational autoencoder, allowing for flexible, continuous-time modeling of uncertainty while preserving a principled mathematical foundation. The drift and diffusion terms of the SDE are parameterized by neural networks, enabling data-driven inference and generalizing classical time series models to handle irregular sampling and complex dynamic structure.
  A central theoretical contribution is the co-parameterization of the adjoint state with a dedicated neural network, forming a coupled forward-backward system that captures not only latent evolution but also gradient dynamics. I introduce a pathwise-regularized adjoint loss and analyze variance-reduced gradient flows through the lens of stochastic calculus, offering new tools for improving training stability in deep latent SDEs. My paper unifies and extends variational inference, continuous-time generative modeling, and control-theoretic optimization, providing a rigorous foundation for future developments in stochastic probabilistic machine learning.</description>

      <title>Identification in Nonlinear Dynamic Panel Models under Partial Stationarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00264v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a general identification approach for a wide range of nonlinear panel data models, including binary choice, ordered response, and other types of limited dependent variable models. Our approach accommodates dynamic models with any number of lagged dependent variables as well as other types of endogenous covariates. Our identification strategy relies on a partial stationarity condition, which allows for not only an unknown distribution of errors, but also temporal dependencies in errors. We derive partial identification results under flexible model specifications and establish sharpness of our identified set in the binary choice setting. We demonstrate the robust finite-sample performance of our approach using Monte Carlo simulations, and apply the approach to the empirical analysis of income categories using various ordered choice models.</description>

      <title>Latent Variable Modelling by Supervised Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04488v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new methodological framework for estimating inferential models with latent variables. It also introduces a new latent variable regression model called LARX: an extension of the ubiquitous autoregressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX) in which any or all input variables can be latent. In deriving the LARX model, a minor contribution is also made to the field of matrix calculus: A new matrix operator is defined and applied to solve a class of Lagrangian optimisation problems with interactions between multiple coefficient vectors subject to case-by-case constraints.
  In the empirical section, the LARX model is used to re-examine the relationship between stock market performance and real economic activity in the United States. The LARX model attains an out-of-sample R-squared of up to 79.7% compared to 50.3% for the baseline OLS approach. It also reveals new information about the underlying drivers of the relationship between stock returns and economic growth, including the predictive power of sector rotations.</description>
