      <title>Robustness Verification of Binary Neural Networks: An Ising and Quantum-Inspired Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary neural networks (BNNs) are increasingly deployed in edge computing applications due to their low hardware complexity and high energy efficiency. However, verifying the robustness of BNNs against input perturbations, including adversarial attacks, remains computationally challenging because the underlying decision problem is inherently combinatorial. In this paper, we propose an Ising- and quantum-inspired framework for BNN robustness verification. We show that, for a broad class of BNN architectures, robustness verification can be formulated as a Quadratic Constrained Boolean Optimization (QCBO) problem and subsequently transformed into a Quadratic Unconstrained Boolean Optimization (QUBO) instance amenable to Ising and quantum-inspired solvers. We demonstrate the feasibility of this formulation on binarized MNIST by solving the resulting QUBOs with a free energy machine (FEM) solver and simulated annealing. We also show the deployment of this framework on quantum annealing and digital annealing platforms. Our results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired computing and Ising computing as a pathway toward trustworthy AI systems.</description>

      <title>From Snapshot Sensing to Persistent EM World Modeling: A Generative-Space Perspective for ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) world modeling is emerging as a foundational capability for environment-aware and embodiment-enabled wireless systems. However, most existing mmWave sensing solutions are designed for snapshot-based parameter estimation and rely on hardware-intensive architectures, making scalable and persistent world modeling difficult to achieve. This article rethinks mmWave sensing from a system-level perspective and introduces a generative-space framework, in which sensing is realized through controlled traversal of a low-dimensional excitation space spanning frequency, waveform, and physical embodiment. This perspective decouples spatial observability from rigid antenna arrays and transmit-time multiplexing, enabling flexible and scalable sensing-by-design radios. To illustrate the practicality of this framework, we present a representative realization called Multi-RF Chain Frequency-as-Aperture Clip-on Aperture Fabric (MRC-FaA-CAF), where multiple FMCW sources coordinate frequency-selective modules distributed along guided-wave backbones. This architecture enables interference-free excitation, preserves beat-frequency separability, and maintains low calibration overhead. Case studies show that generative-space-driven sensing can achieve update rates comparable to phased arrays while avoiding dense RF replication and the latency penalties of TDM-MIMO systems. Overall, this work positions generative-space-driven sensing as a practical architectural foundation for mmWave systems that move beyond snapshot sensing toward persistent EM world modeling.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic approximate optimization using single-photon avalanche diode arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are central to science and engineering and specialized hardware from quantum annealers to classical Ising machines are being actively developed to address them. These systems typically sample from a fixed energy landscape defined by the problem Hamiltonian encoding the discrete optimization problem. The recently introduced Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm (PAOA) takes a different approach: it treats the optimization landscape itself as variational, iteratively learning circuit parameters from samples. Here, we demonstrate PAOA on a 64$\times$64 perimeter-gated single-photon avalanche diode (pgSPAD) array fabricated in 0.35 $\mu$m CMOS, the first realization of the algorithm using intrinsically stochastic nanodevices. Each p-bit exhibits a device-specific, asymmetric (Gompertz-type) activation function due to dark-count variability. Rather than calibrating devices to enforce a uniform symmetric (logistic/tanh) activation, PAOA learns around device variations, absorbing residual activation and other mismatches into the variational parameters. On canonical 26-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick instances, PAOA achieves high approximation ratios with $2p$ parameters ($p$ up to 17 layers), and pgSPAD-based inference closely tracks CPU simulations. These results show that variational learning can accommodate the non-idealities inherent to nanoscale devices, suggesting a practical path toward larger-scale, CMOS-compatible probabilistic computers.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Digital Twins for the Smart Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter provides an introduction to the foundations of digital twins and makes the case for employing them in smart grids. As engineered systems become more complex and autonomous, digital twin technology gains importance as the unified technological platform for design, testing, operation, and maintenance. Smart grids are prime examples of such complex systems, in which unique design and operation challenges arise from the combination of physical and software components. As high-fidelity in-silico replicas of physical components, digital twins provide safe and cost-efficient experimentation facilities in the design and verification phase of smart grids. In the operation phase of smart grids, digital twins enable automated load balancing of grids through real-time simulation and decision-making. These, and an array of similar benefits, position digital twins as crucial technological components in smart grids.</description>

      <title>Semantic Waveforms for AI-Native 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a semantic-aware waveform design framework for AI-native 6G networks that jointly optimizes physical layer resource usage and semantic communication efficiency and robustness, while explicitly accounting for the hardware constraints of RF chains. Our approach, called Orthogonal Semantic Sequency Division Multiplexing (OSSDM), introduces a parametrizable, orthogonal-base waveform design that enables controlled degradation of the wireless transmitted signal to preserve semantically significant content while minimizing resource consumption. We demonstrate that OSSDM not only reinforces semantic robustness against channel impairments but also improves semantic spectral efficiency by encoding meaningful information directly at the waveform level. Extensive numerical evaluations show that OSSDM outperforms conventional OFDM waveforms in spectral efficiency and semantic fidelity. The proposed semantic waveform co-design opens new research frontiers for AI-native, intelligent communication systems by enabling meaning-aware physical signal construction through the direct encoding of semantics at the waveform level.</description>

      <title>3D Wi-Fi Signal Measurement in Realistic Digital Twin Testbed Environments Using Ray Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient modeling of indoor wireless signal propagation is crucial for the deployment of next-generation Wi-Fi. This paper presents a digital twin-based measurement system that integrates real-world 3D environment reconstruction with deterministic ray tracing for physically grounded electromagnetic modeling. Building geometry is obtained through LiDAR scanning, followed by object segmentation and assignment of ITU-R standard material parameters. The propagation process is simulated with a GPU-accelerated ray-tracing engine that generates path-level channel attributes, including delay, power, angular dispersion, and Ricean K-factor. Under identical runtime constraints, the proposed system is evaluated against a commercial measurement simulator, demonstrating up to 21 dB higher path gain and consistently improved signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio in line-of-sight conditions. Additionally, experiments against onsite RSSI measurements confirm a high spatial correlation of 0.98 after calibration, proving the system's fidelity in real-world settings. Furthermore, coverage analysis across 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands demonstrates the capability of system to model frequency-dependent material attenuation for Wi-Fi 6E/7 networks. Finally, the system offers interactive 3D visualization and on-demand data extraction, highlighting its potential for digital twin-driven wireless system design and optimization.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Sensing and Fusion in mmWave Beamforming for Connected Vehicles: A Transformer Based Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication, utilizing beamforming techniques to address the inherent path loss limitation, is considered as one of the key technologies to support ever increasing high throughput and low latency demands of connected vehicles. However, adopting standard defined beamforming approach in highly dynamic vehicular environments often incurs high beam training overheads and reduction in the available airtime for communications, which is mainly due to exchanging pilot signals and exhaustive beam measurements. To this end, we present a multi-modal sensing and fusion learning framework as a potential alternative solution to reduce such overheads. In this framework, we first extract the representative features from the sensing modalities by modality specific encoders, then, utilize multi-head cross-modal attention to learn dependencies and correlations between different modalities, and subsequently fuse the multimodal features to obtain predicted top-k beams so that the best line-of-sight links can be proactively established. To show the generalizability of the proposed framework, we perform a comprehensive experiment in four different vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) scenarios from real world multimodal and 60 GHz mmWave wireless sensing data. The experiment reveals that the proposed framework (i) achieves up to 96.72% accuracy on predicting top-15 beams correctly, (ii) incurs roughly 0.77 dB average power loss, and (iii) improves the overall latency and beam searching space overheads by 86.81% and 76.56% respectively for top-15 beams compared to standard defined approach.</description>

      <title>CORPGEN: Simulating Corporate Environments with Autonomous Digital Employees in Multi-Horizon Task Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning is a key challenge for autonomous agents, yet existing benchmarks evaluate agents on single tasks in isolation. Real organizational work requires managing many concurrent long-horizon tasks with interleaving, dependencies, and reprioritization. We introduce Multi-Horizon Task Environments (MHTEs): a distinct problem class requiring coherent execution across dozens of interleaved tasks (45+, 500-1500+ steps) within persistent execution contexts spanning hours. We identify four failure modes that cause baseline CUAs to degrade from 16.7% to 8.7% completion as load scales 25% to 100%, a pattern consistent across three independent implementations. These failure modes are context saturation (O(N) vs O(1) growth), memory interference, dependency complexity (DAGs vs. chains), and reprioritization overhead. We present CorpGen, an architecture-agnostic framework addressing these failures via hierarchical planning for multi-horizon goal alignment, sub-agent isolation preventing cross-task contamination, tiered memory (working, structured, semantic), and adaptive summarization. CorpGen simulates corporate environments through digital employees with persistent identities and realistic schedules. Across three CUA backends (UFO2, OpenAI CUA, hierarchical) on OSWorld Office, CorpGen achieves up to 3.5x improvement over baselines (15.2% vs 4.3%) with stable performance under increasing load, confirming that gains stem from architectural mechanisms rather than specific CUA implementations. Ablation studies show experiential learning provides the largest gains.</description>

      <title>Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tool Descriptions Are Smelly! Towards Improving AI Agent Efficiency with Augmented MCP Tool Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes how Foundation Model (FM)-based agents interact with external systems by invoking tools. However, to understand a tool's purpose and features, FMs rely on natural-language tool descriptions, making these descriptions a critical component in guiding FMs to select the optimal tool for a given (sub)task and to pass the right arguments to the tool. While defects or smells in these descriptions can misguide FM-based agents, their prevalence and consequences in the MCP ecosystem remain unclear.
  To address this, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of 856 tools spread across 103 MCP servers, assessing their description quality and their impact on agent performance. We identify six components of tool descriptions from the literature, develop a scoring rubric utilizing these components, then formalize tool description smells based on this rubric. By operationalizing this rubric through an FM-based scanner, we find that 97.1% of the analyzed tool descriptions contain at least one smell, with 56% failing to state their purpose clearly. While augmenting these descriptions for all components improves task success rates by a median of 5.85 percentage points and improves partial goal completion by 15.12%, it also increases the number of execution steps by 67.46% and regresses performance in 16.67% of cases. These findings highlight a trade-off between agent performance and cost, as well as the context sensitivity of the performance gain. Furthermore, component ablations show that compact variants of different component combinations often preserve behavioral reliability while reducing unnecessary token overhead, enabling more efficient use of the FM context window and lower execution costs.</description>

      <title>Web-Scale Multimodal Summarization using CLIP-Based Semantic Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Web-Scale Multimodal Summarization, a lightweight framework for generating summaries by combining retrieved text and image data from web sources. Given a user-defined topic, the system performs parallel web, news, and image searches. Retrieved images are ranked using a fine-tuned CLIP model to measure semantic alignment with topic and text. Optional BLIP captioning enables image-only summaries for stronger multimodal coherence.The pipeline supports features such as adjustable fetch limits, semantic filtering, summary styling, and downloading structured outputs. We expose the system via a Gradio-based API with controllable parameters and preconfigured presets.Evaluation on 500 image-caption pairs with 20:1 contrastive negatives yields a ROC-AUC of 0.9270, an F1-score of 0.6504, and an accuracy of 96.99%, demonstrating strong multimodal alignment. This work provides a configurable, deployable tool for web-scale summarization that integrates language, retrieval, and vision models in a user-extensible pipeline.</description>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) promises significant speedups, particularly when operating on quantum datasets. However, its progress is hindered by the scarcity of suitable training data. Existing synthetic data generation methods fall short in capturing essential entanglement properties, limiting their utility for QML. To address this, we introduce QuFoundry, a low-depth quantum data generation framework that produces entangled, high-quality samples emulating diverse classical and quantum distributions, enabling more effective development and evaluation of QML models in representative-data settings.</description>

      <title>Emergent human-like working memory from artificial neurons with intrinsic plasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Working memory enables the brain to integrate transient information for rapid decision-making. Artificial networks typically replicate this via recurrent or parallel architectures, yet incur high energy costs and noise sensitivity. Here we report IPNet, a hardware-software co-designed neuromorphic architecture realizing human-like working memory via neuronal intrinsic plasticity. Exploiting Joule-heating dynamics of Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), IPNet physically emulates biological memory volatility. The memory behavior of the proposed architecture shows similar trends in n-back, free recall and memory interference tasks to that of reported human subjects. Implemented exclusively with MTJ neurons, the architecture with human-like working memory achieves 99.65% accuracy on 11-class DVS gesture datasets and maintains 99.48% on a novel 22-class time-reversed benchmark, outperforming RNN, LSTM, and 2+1D CNN baselines sharing identical backbones. For autonomous driving (DDD-20), IPNet reduces steering prediction error by 14.4% compared to ResNet-LSTM. Architecturally, we identify a 'Memory-at-the-Frontier' effect where performance is maximized at the sensing interface, validating a bio-plausible near-sensor processing paradigm. Crucially, all results rely on raw parameters from fabricated devices without optimization. Hardware-in-the-loop validation confirms the system's physical realizability. Separately, energy analysis reveals a reduction in memory power of 2,874x compared to LSTMs and 90,920x versus parallel 3D-CNNs. This capacitor-free design enables a compact ~1.5um2 footprint (28 nm CMOS): a &gt;20-fold reduction over standard LIF neurons. Ultimately, we demonstrate that instantiating human-like working memory via intrinsic neuronal plasticity endows neural networks with the dual biological advantages of superior dynamic vision processing and minimal metabolic cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid pace of development in quantum computing technology has sparked a proliferation of benchmarks for assessing the performance of quantum computing hardware and software. Good benchmarks empower scientists, engineers, programmers, and users to understand a computing system's power, but bad benchmarks can misdirect research and inhibit progress. In this Perspective, we survey the science of quantum computer benchmarking. We discuss the role of benchmarks and benchmarking, and how good benchmarks can drive and measure progress towards the long-term goal of useful quantum computations, i.e., "quantum utility". We explain how different kinds of benchmark quantify the performance of different parts of a quantum computer, survey existing benchmarks, examine recent trends in benchmarking, and highlight important open research questions in this field.</description>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning has shown promise for high-dimensional data analysis, yet many existing approaches rely on linear unitary operations and shared trainable parameters across outputs. These constraints limit expressivity and scalability relative to the multi-layered, non-linear architectures of classical deep networks. We introduce superposed parameterised quantum circuits to overcome these limitations. By combining flip-flop quantum random-access memory with repeat-until-success protocols, a superposed parameterised quantum circuit embeds an exponential number of parameterised sub-models in a single circuit and induces polynomial activation functions through amplitude transformations and post-selection. We provide an analytic description of the architecture, showing how multiple parameter sets are trained in parallel while non-linear amplitude transformations broaden representational power beyond conventional quantum kernels. Numerical experiments underscore these advantages: on a 1D step-function regression a two-qubit superposed parameterised quantum circuit cuts the mean-squared error by three orders of magnitude versus a parameter-matched variational baseline; on a 2D star-shaped two-dimensional classification task, introducing a quadratic activation lifts accuracy to 81.4\% and reduces run-to-run variance three-fold. These results position superposed parameterised quantum circuits as a hardware-efficient route toward deeper, more versatile parameterised quantum circuits capable of learning complex decision boundaries.</description>

      <title>ECMSim: A high-performance interactive web application for real-time spatiotemporal simulation of cardiac ECM signaling and diffusion</title>

Abstract: Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is central to a wide variety of healthy and diseased tissue processes. Unfortunately, predicting ECM remodeling under various chemical and mechanical conditions has proven to be excessively challenging, due in part to its complex regulation by intracellular and extracellular molecular reaction networks that are spatially and temporally dynamic. We introduce ECMSim, which is a highly interactive, real-time, and web application designed to simulate heterogeneous matrix remodeling. The current model simulates cardiac scar tissue with configurable input conditions using a large-scale model of the cardiac fibroblast signaling network. Cardiac fibrosis is a major component of many forms of heart failure. ECMSim solves 1.37 million coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and executes approximately 4.84 million operations per time step in real time, encompassing 137 molecular species and 259 regulatory interactions per cell across a 100x100 spatial array (10,000 cells), which accounts for inputs, receptors, intracellular signaling cascades, ECM production, feedback loops, and molecular diffusion. The algorithm is represented by a set of ODEs that are coupled with ECM molecular diffusion. The equations are solved on demand using compiled C++ and the WebAssembly standard. The software enables the investigation of pathological or experimental conditions, hypothetical scenarios, matrix remodeling, or the testing of the effects of an experimental drug(s) with a target receptor.</description>

      <title>How to Train Your Resistive Network: Generalized Equilibrium Propagation and Analytical Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03546</link>

Abstract: Machine learning is a powerful method of extracting meaning from data; unfortunately, current digital hardware is extremely energy-intensive. There is interest in an alternative analog computing implementation that could match the performance of traditional machine learning while being significantly more energy-efficient. However, it remains unclear how to train such analog computing systems while adhering to locality constraints imposed by the physical (as opposed to digital) nature of these systems. Local learning algorithms such as Equilibrium Propagation and Coupled Learning have been proposed to address this issue. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to exactly calculate gradients using a graph theoretic and analytical framework for Kirchhoff's laws. We also introduce Generalized Equilibrium Propagation, a framework encompassing a broad class of Hebbian learning algorithms, including Coupled Learning and Equilibrium Propagation, and show how our algorithm compares. We demonstrate our algorithm using numerical simulations and show that we can train resistor networks without the need for a replica or readout over all resistors, only at the output layer. We also show that under the analytical gradient approach, it is possible to update only a subset of the resistance values without a strong degradation in performance.</description>
