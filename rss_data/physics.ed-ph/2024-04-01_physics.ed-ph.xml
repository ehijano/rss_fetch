      <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles: A Series of Laboratory Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The following laboratory procedure provides students with a hands-on experience in nanomaterials chemistry and characterization. This three-day protocol is easy to follow for undergraduates with basic chemistry or materials science backgrounds and is suitable for inclusion in upper division courses in inorganic chemistry or materials science. Students use air-free chemistry procedures to synthesize and separate iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles and subsequently modify the nanoparticle surface using a chemical stripping agent. The morphology and chemical composition of the nanoparticles are characterized using electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering measurements. Additionally, magnetic characterization of the particles is performed using an open-source (3D-printed), inexpensive magnetophotometer. Possible modifications to the synthesis procedure including the incorporation of dopants to modify the magnetic response and alternative characterization techniques are discussed. The three-day synthesis, purification, and characterization laboratory will prepare students with crucial skills for advanced technology industries such as semiconductor manufacturing, nanomedicine, and green chemistry.</description>

      <title>A Versatile Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference Experiment in Optical Fiber for the Undergraduate Laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference is a quantum optics laboratory experiment that has recently become more accessible to undergraduate students. The experiment consists of two identical photons simultaneously entering a non-polarizing beam splitter. The wavefunctions destructively interfere and the photon pairs bunch at the outputs whereas classically they are equally likely to exit different outputs. Due to the precision needed to achieve indistinguishability, setup and alignment of this experiment is often considered to be too difficult and time consuming to be appropriate for an undergraduate lab, with an end goal of merely demonstrating the HOM interference dip. Here, we present an alternative optical fiber-based apparatus that gives a consistently reproducible experiment with interference occurring in a fused-fiber coupler instead of a traditional beam splitter. We use a commercially available fiber coupled biphoton source that requires minimal alignment and increases coherence length of the interference. In addition, our biphoton source provides direct temperature based control of the frequency degeneracy of the photon pairs produced, allowing for students to investigate physical properties of HOM interference such as coherence length and interference visibility. Through use of standard opto-mechanical parts combined with the commercially available fiber integrated biphoton source and laser, our apparatus is a middle ground between built-from-scratch and pre-aligned setups.</description>
