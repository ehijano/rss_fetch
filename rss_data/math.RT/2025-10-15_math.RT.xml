      <title>Unitary representations attached to parabolic subgroups: the case of abelian unipotent radical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the unitary representations with integral infinitesimal character in Lusztig's category of unipotent representations in the case when the geometric parameter space comes from the action of a Levi subgroup on the abelian nilradical of a (maximal) parabolic subalgebra. We organise the unitary representations into microlocal Arthur packets. This is a test case for investigating a conjectural description of unitary representations with integral infinitesimal character.</description>

      <title>Stranding $\mathfrak{sl}_n$ webs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12035v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Webs are a kind of planar, directed, edge-labeled graph that encode invariant vectors for quantum representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_n$. The theory of webs developed organically for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$, where they are also known as noncrossing matchings and the Temperley-Lieb algebra, before being formalized by Kuperberg for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ as the morphisms in a diagrammatic categorification of quantum representations called the spider category. Various models extend webs to $n \geq 4$. Only Cautis-Kamnitzer-Morrison prove a full set of relations for their webs, though Fontaine's webs are better adapted to computations, more graph-theoretically natural, and directly generalize webs for $n=2$ and $n=3$.
  This paper formalizes the theory of Fontaine's webs, proving the existence of a deep and powerful global structure on these webs called strandings. We do three key things: 1) give a state-sum formula to construct ($U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_n)$-invariant) web vectors from the orientation of strandings on Fontaine's webs; 2) list and prove a complete set of relations, connecting strandings to the local data of binary labelings that are well-established in the literature; and 3) provide applications and examples of how strandings facilitate computations.</description>

      <title>Quivers with Involutions and Shifted Twisted Yangians via Coulomb Branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To a quiver with involution, we study the Coulomb branch of the 3d $\mathcal{N} = 4$ involution-fixed part of the quiver gauge theory. We show that there is an algebra homomorphism from the corresponding shifted twisted Yangian to the quantized Coulomb branch algebra. This gives a new instance of 3D mirror symmetries.</description>

      <title>Triangulated Categories Admitting Linear Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main result of this paper is that there is an additive equivalence between $\overline{\mathcal{C}}_n$, the Paquette-Yildirim completion of the discrete cluster categories of Dynkin type $A_{\infty}$, and the perfect derived category of a certain DG algebra. This additive equivalence preserves some of the triangulated structure: it commutes with the suspension functor and preserves triangles with at least two indecomposable terms. In the process, we introduce the notion of a linear generator $G$ in a Krull-Schmidt, Hom-finite triangulated category. It turns out that the existence of a linear generator affords a large amount of control over $\mathcal{T}$. For example, it allows us to describe all indecomposable objects in $\mathcal{T}$ in terms of $G$, to determine all triangles of $\mathcal{T}$ with at least two indecomposable objects, and to show that the Rouquier dimension of $\mathcal{T}$ is at most one. Moreover, we prove that there is an additive equivalence (which preserves some of the triangulated structure) between $\mathcal{T}$ and the perfect derived category of a certain DG algebra. Finally, we show that any triangulated category with a linear generator is additively equivalent to a thick subcategory of $\overline{\mathcal{C}}_n$.</description>

      <title>GKLO representations of twisted Yangians in type $\mathsf{AI}$ and quantizations of symmetric quotients of the affine Grassmannian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an analogue of Gerasimov-Kharchev-Lebedev-Oblezin (GKLO) representations for twisted Yangians of type $\mathsf{AI}$, using the recently found current presentation of these algebras due to Lu, Wang and Zhang. These new representations allow us to define interesting truncations of twisted Yangians, which, in the spirit of Ciccoli-Drinfeld-Gavarini quantum duality, reflect the Poisson geometry of homogeneous spaces. As our main result, we prove that a truncated twisted Yangian quantizes a scheme supported on quotients of transverse slices in the affine Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>Semisimple module categories with fusion rules of the compact full flag manifold type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify semisimple left module categories over the representation category of a type A quantum group whose fusion rules arise from the maximal torus. The classification is connected to equivariant Poisson structures on compact full flag manifolds in the operator-algebraic setting, and on semisimple coadjoint orbits in the algebraic setting. We also provide an explicit construction based on the BGG categories of deformed quantum enveloping algebras, whose unitarizability corresponds to being of quotient type. Finally, we present a brief discussion of the non-quantum case.</description>

      <title>Positivity properties of canonical bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the canonical basis of a modified quantum group $\dot{\mathbf{U}}$ exhibits strong positivity properties for the canonical basis elements arising from spherical parabolic subalgebras. Our main result establishes that the structure constants for both the multiplication with arbitrary canonical basis elements in $\dot{\mathbf{U}}$ and the action on the canonical basis elements of arbitrary tensor products of simple lowest and highest weight modules by these elements belong to $\mathbb{N}[v,v^{-1}]$. This implies, in particular, for quantum groups of finite type, the structure constants for multiplication and for action on tensor product with respect to canonical basis are governed by positive coefficients.
  A key ingredient is the thickening construction, an algebraic technique that embeds a suitable approximation of the tensor of a lowest weight module and a highest weight module of $\dot{\mathbf{U}}$ into the negative part $\tilde{\mathbf{U}}^-$ of a larger quantum group. This allows us to inherit the desired positivity for the tensor product from the well-established positivity of the canonical basis of $\tilde{\mathbf{U}}^-$.</description>

      <title>Matrix generators for Weil representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $r$ be an odd prime and $\mathbb{F}$ a field containing a primitive $r$th root of unity. Then for all $\ell \geq 1$, there is a faithful representation $f: \operatorname{Sp}_{2\ell}(r) \rightarrow \operatorname{GL}_{r^\ell}(\mathbb{F})$ called the Weil representation. We provide explicit matrices generating $\operatorname{Sp}_{2\ell}(r)$ in $\operatorname{GL}_{r^\ell}(\mathbb{F})$, which we have implemented in Magma. We also describe such generators for the irreducible Weil representations of $\operatorname{Sp}_{2\ell}(r)$, which are of degree $(r^{\ell} \pm 1)/2$ and arise as irreducible constituents of the Weil representations.</description>

Abstract: We study the automorphic period associated to a $G$-Hamiltonian variety $M$ whose dual is $\check{M} = T^*(\check{G}/\check{L})$, where $\check{G}$ is a general linear group and $\check{L}$ is a Levi subgroup. For certain cuspidal Eisenstein series, we prove that their period is equal to a finite sum of special values of $L$-functions. This sum is indexed by the fixed points of the associated extended $L$-parameter on $\check{M}$, confirming a conjecture by Ben-Zvi-Sakellaridis-Venkatesh in this case.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ be two lattices of finite covolume in a semisimple Lie group $G$. We prove a spectral rigidity result for the representation spectra of the right regular representations $L^2(\Gamma_1 \backslash G)$ and $L^2(\Gamma_2 \backslash G)$ of $G$. This can be thought of as an analogue of the strong multiplicity one theorem and it generalises a result by the first author and Rajan to the case of non-uniform lattices.</description>

      <title>Polishchuk's conjecture and Kazhdan-Laumon representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their 1988 paper "Gluing of perverse sheaves and discrete series representations," D. Kazhdan and G. Laumon constructed an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$ associated to a reductive group $G$ over a finite field with the aim of using it to construct discrete series representations of the finite Chevalley group $G(\mathbb{F}_q)$. The well-definedness of their construction depended on their conjecture that this category has finite cohomological dimension. This was disproven by R. Bezrukavnikov and A. Polishchuk in 2001, who found a counterexample in the case $G = SL_3$. In the same paper, Polishchuk then made an alternative conjecture: though this counterexample shows that the Grothendieck group $K_0(\mathcal{A})$ is not spanned by objects of finite projective dimension, he noted that a graded version of $K_0(\mathcal{A})$ can be thought of as a module over Laurent polynomials and conjectured that a certain localization of this module is generated by objects of finite projective dimension, and suggested that this conjecture could lead toward a proof that Kazhdan and Laumon's construction is well-defined. He proved this conjecture in Types $A_1, A_2, A_3$, and $B_2$. In the present paper, we prove Polishchuk's conjecture in full generality, and go on to prove that Kazhdan and Laumon's construction is indeed well-defined, giving a new geometric construction of discrete series representations of $G(\mathbb{F}_q)$.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Cohomology of Dominant Line Bundles for Real Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13473v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In \cite{Broer1993}, it was shown that certain line bundles on $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}}=T^*G/B$ have vanishing higher cohomology. We prove a generalization of this theorem for real reductive algebraic groups. More specifically, if $\mathcal{N}_\theta$ denotes the cone of nilpotent elements in a Cartan subspace $\mathfrak{p},$ we have a similar construction of a resolution of singularities $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}.$ We prove that for a certain cone of weights $H^i(\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta},\mathcal{O}_{\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}}(\lambda))=0$ for $i&gt; 0.$ This follows by combining a simple calculation of the canonical bundle for $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}$ with Grauert-Riemenschneider vanishing. Restricting to the structure sheaf, we get a characterization of the singularities of the normalization of $\mathcal{N}_\theta.$ We use this to show that for groups of QCT (Definition 2), $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{N}_\theta]$ is equivalent as a $K$-representation to a certain cohomologically induced module giving a new proof of a result in \cite{KostantRallis1971}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the Tits building B(G) of a finite group of Lie type G(Fq), we study the edge zeta function, which enumerates edge-geodesic cycles in the 1-skeleton. We show that every nonzero edge eigenvalue becomes a power of q after raising to a bounded exponent k depending on the type of G. The proof is uniform across types using a Hecke algebra approach. This extends previous results for type A and for oppositeness graphs to the full edge-geodesic setting and all finite groups of Lie type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify the elementary classical and quantum Lifshitz systems. Lifshitz systems are systems where space and time scale anisotropically. That is, there is a constant $z$ such that under scaling by a factor of $\lambda$,
  \begin{equation*}
  \boldsymbol{x}\rightarrow \lambda \boldsymbol{x} \text{ and } t\rightarrow \lambda^{z}t
  \end{equation*}
  There are seven Lie groups, called the Lifshitz groups, which characterise all Lifshitz symmetries.
  Elementary classical Lifshitz systems are the symplectic manifolds with a transitive Lifshitz action, which turn out to be coadjoint orbits of the Lifshitz groups and their one-dimensional central extensions up to covering. Elementary quantum Lifshitz systems are the projective unitary irreducible representations of the Lifshitz groups.</description>

      <title>Totally positive Toeplitz matrices: classical and modern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25163v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By a theorem of Edrei, an infinite, normalised totally nonnegative upper-triangular Toeplitz matrix is determined by a pair of nonnegative parameter sequences, the `Schoenberg parameters', where nonzero parameters correspond to the roots and poles of a naturally associated generating function. These totally nonnegative Toeplitz matrices and their parameters also arise in the classification of characters of the infinite symmetric group by later work of Thoma. Moreover the Schoenberg parameters have an asymptotic interpretation in terms of irreducible representations of S_n and their Young diagrams by Vershik-Kerov. In this article we consider infinite totally positive Toeplitz matrices as limits of finite ones, and we obtain two further asymptotic descriptions of the Schoenberg parameters that are now related to quantum cohomology of the flag variety as n goes to infinity. One is related to asymptotics of normalised quantum parameters, and the other to asymptotics of the Chern classes of the tautological line bundles. We also describe the asymptotics of (quantum) Schubert classes in terms of the Schoenberg parameters. Our limit formulas relate to and were motivated by a tropical analogue of this theory that we survey. In the tropical setting one finds an asymptotic relationship between the `tropical Schoenberg parameters' and the weight map from Lusztig's parametrisation of the canonical basis.</description>
