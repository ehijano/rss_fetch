      <title>Mapping atmospheric features of the planetary-mass brown dwarf SIMP 0136 with JWST NIRISS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze James Webb Space Telescope Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph time-series spectroscopy data to characterize the atmosphere of the planetary-mass brown dwarf SIMP J01365662+093347. Principal component analysis reveals that 81\% of spectral variations can be described by two components, implying that variability within a single rotational phase is induced by at least three distinct spectral regions. By comparing our data to a grid of Sonora Diamondback atmospheric models, we confirm that the time-averaged spectrum cannot be explained by a single model but require a linear combination of at least three regions. Projecting these models onto the principal component plane shows that the overall variability is highly correlated with changes in temperature, cloud coverage, and possibly effective metallicity. We also extract brightness maps from the lightcurve and establish North-South asymmetry in the atmosphere. A combined multidimensional analysis of spectro-photometric variability links the three spectral regions to three atmospheric layers. Forsterite cloud and water abundance at each level form unique harmonics of atmospheric variability observed in different spectral bands. Atmospheric retrievals on the time-averaged spectrum are consistent with an optically thick iron cloud deck beneath a patchy forsterite cloud layer and with the overall adiabatic curve. We also demonstrate two new analysis methods: a regionally-resolved spectra retrieval that relies on multi-wavelength spherical harmonics maps, and a method to constrain brightness maps using Doppler information present in the spectra. Future observations of variable brown dwarfs of higher spectral resolution or spanning multiple rotations should help break mapping degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric composition and circulation of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b with joint NIRPS, HARPS and CRIRES+ transit spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-hot Jupiters like WASP-121b provide unique laboratories for studying atmospheric chemistry and dynamics under extreme irradiation. Constraining their composition and circulation is key to tracing planet formation pathways. We present a comprehensive characterisation of WASP-121b using high-resolution transit spectroscopy from HARPS, NIRPS, and CRIRES+ across nine transits, complemented by five TESS sectors, two EulerCam light curves simultaneous with HARPS/NIRPS, and an extensive RV dataset refining orbital parameters. Cross-correlation detects Fe, CO, and V with SNRs of 5.8, 5.0, and 4.7, respectively. Retrieval analysis constrains H$_2$O to $-6.52^{+0.49}_{-0.68}$ dex, though its signal might be muted by the H$^-$ continuum. We measure volatile/refractory ratios, key to uncover planetary chemistry, evolution, and formation. Retrieved values align with solar composition in chemical equilibrium, suggesting minimal disequilibrium chemistry at the probed pressures (around $10^{-4}$-$10^{-3}$ bar). We update WASP-121b's orbital parameters analysing its largest RV dataset to date. Comparing orbital velocities from RVs and atmospheric retrieval reveals a non-zero circulation offset, $\mathrm{\Delta K}_{\mathrm{p}} = -15 \pm 3 \ \mathrm{km}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ (assuming $\mathrm{M}_{\star} = 1.38 \pm 0.02 \ \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), consistent with drag-free or weak-drag 3D GCM predictions, though sensitive to stellar mass. These results provide new constraints on WASP-121b's thermal structure, dynamics, and chemistry, underscoring the power of multi-instrument and multi-wavelength high-resolution spectroscopy to probe exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>3D Simulations of Convective Entrainment in Gas Giants: Rotation and Decreasing Luminosity as Barriers to Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations from Juno and Cassini suggest that Jupiter and Saturn may possess fuzzy cores -- central regions where the abundance of heavy elements varies smoothly with depth. Such gradients pose a longstanding puzzle for models of planetary evolution and formation, which predict that vigorous convection would homogenize the interior of gas giants within the first $\sim 10^6$--$10^8~\mathrm{years}$ of cooling. Previous 3D simulations and analytic predictions for the propagation of a convection zone into a stable region have demonstrated that the rapid rotation of gas giants can significantly slow convective mixing, but not enough to stop it. Another piece of the puzzle is luminosity. Gas giants cool as they age, and with that comes a declining heat flux over time. Recent ideas suggest that when this declining luminosity is combined with rotational effects, convection may stall. We explore this possibility using 3D hydrodynamic simulations that include both rotation and a surface cooling flux that decreases as $1/t$. Our results demonstrate that, even without rotation, a declining luminosity can suppress mixing sufficiently to preserve an initial compositional gradient in the deep interior of gas giants. If confirmed by more realistic simulations, this may help to explain the long-term survival of fuzzy cores.</description>

      <title>Energy Transition Domain and Its Application in Constructing Gravity-Assist Escape Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Note proposes the concept and theory of energy transition domain (ETD) defined by the mechanical energy of spacecraft in the Earth-Moon planar circular restricted three-body problem (PCR3BP) inspired by the pioneering work from Ano{\`e} et al. (2024) on the ETD defined by the two-body energy with respect to the secordary body in the PCR3BP. An effective construction method of gravity-assist escape trajectories is then proposed. Firstly, the concept of the ETD defined by the mechanical energy is presented, and its dependency on the Jacobi energy is analyzed. This dependency may provide prior knowledge about selecting the range of the Jacobi energy in the construction of escape trajectories. Then, gravity-assist escape trajectories departing from the 167 km low Earth orbit and 36000 km geosynchronous Earth orbit are constructed based on the ETD. The initial states are selected in the sphere of influence of the Moon, and the trajectories are searched from the forward and backward integration. Finally, the obtained solutions are presented and analyzed.</description>

      <title>Improved characterization of the TOI-2141 system: a dense sub-Neptune with non-transiting inner and outer companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to refine the fundamental parameters of the TOI-2141 planetary system, which includes a transiting sub-Neptune orbiting a Sun-like star in a relatively long orbit of 18.26 days, by combining new photometric and spectroscopic observations. We analyze new space-based photometry from TESS and CHEOPS as well as 61 radial velocity measurements from HARPS-N. We perform individual and joint photometric and RV analyses using several modeling tools within a Bayesian model comparison framework. We refine the radius and mass of the transiting planet TOI-2141 b to 3.15 $\pm$ 0.04 $R_\oplus$ and 20.1 $\pm$ 1.6 $M_\oplus$, respectively, five and two times more precise than the previously reported values. Our radial velocity analysis reveals two additional non-transiting companions with orbital periods of 5.46 and 60.45 days. Despite the innermost planet's high geometric transit probability, we find no evidence for transits in the photometric data. The bulk properties of TOI-2141 b suggest a significant volatile envelope atop an Earth-like core, with modeling indicating a hydrogen-rich atmosphere that may have experienced mild photoevaporation over the system's history. Planets b and c must exhibit a modest mutual inclination of at least 2.4 degrees.</description>

      <title>Probing the Moon from Future Asteroid Impacts: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Earth--Moon system has been experiencing impacts from asteroids and comets for billions of years. The Moon, as an airless body, has preserved a distinct record of these events in form of impact craters and ejecta deposits, offering valuable insights into the impact history and surface evolution of the Moon. However, the ancient impact relics can only provide limited information to the lunar interior structure, with an absence of the Moon's immediately dynamic response to the impact events. With human lunar exploration entering an era of sustained presence, e.g., lunar research station and human return, we propose a new concept to probe the lunar subsurface and interior by investigating the future asteroid impacts in real time. This can be achieved by integrating 1) ground- and space-based telescopes, 2) lunar-based seismometers and rovers, and 3) in-situ investigations around the impact sites. A promising opportunity arises with the possible lunar impact of the 60-m-sized asteroid 2024~YR4 in 2032 (impact probability $\sim$4.3\%), an event of once-in-ten-thousand-years rarity. Comprehensive observations of such events would greatly enhance our understanding of the Moon's structure and evolution, and have significant implications for the future lunar resource utilization and planetary defense missions.</description>

      <title>Onset of CN Emission in 3I/ATLAS: Evidence for Strong Carbon-Chain Depletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar objects provide a direct window into the environmental conditions around stars other than the Sun. The recent discovery of 3I/ATLAS, the second interstellar comet ever observed, offers a unique opportunity to investigate the physical and chemical properties of interstellar objects and to compare them with those of comets in our own Solar System. In this Letter we present the results of a 10-night spectroscopic and photometric monitoring campaign with the 2.4 m Hiltner and 1.3 m McGraw-Hill telescopes at the MDM Observatory. The campaign was conducted between August 8 and 17 while 3I/ATLAS was inbound at heliocentric distances of 3.2 - 2.9 au. Our observations captured the onset of optical gas-driven activity. Nightly spectra reveal a weak CN emission feature in the coma of 3I/ATLAS, absent during the first nights but steadily strengthening thereafter. We measure a CN production rate of $\sim$8$\times$10$^{23}$ s$^{-1}$, towards the lower end of activity observed in Solar System comets. Simultaneous photometry also indicates a small but measurable increase in the coma's radial profile and increasing $r$-band $Af\rho$ with values in the order of $\sim300$ cm. Our upper limit on the C$_2$-to-CN ratio ($\log Q(\mathrm{C}_2)/Q(\mathrm{CN})&lt;-1.05$) places 3I/ATLAS among the most carbon-chain depleted comets known. The derived gas-to-dust production ratio of $\log Q (\mathrm{CN})/Af\rho&lt;21.49$ is likewise at the low end of the Solar System comet distribution. Further observations of 3I/ATLAS are required to verify the apparent carbon-chain depletion and to explore whether such composition represents a recurring trait of the interstellar comet population.</description>

      <title>Detecting water ice and vapor disks originating from icy planetary bodies around white dwarfs with future PRIMA observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of atmospheres of polluted white dwarfs provide insights into the elemental composition of accreted exoplanets and exo-asteroids. However, they poorly constrain the abundance of ice-forming volatile elements due to the properties of white dwarf atmospheres. Instead of focusing solely on atmospheric observations, we propose observing circumstellar water ice and vapor disks formed by the tidal disruption of icy bodies using the future PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) far-infrared enhanced survey spectrometer. PRIMA has the potential to measure volatile abundances in colder circumstellar regions inaccessible by shorter-wavelength observations. We employ a simple disk emission model with disk parameter ranges inferred from previous observations and disk evolution simulations. We find the 44-$\mu$m water ice feature promising for observing icy disks. For white dwarfs within 60 pc, 1-hour PRIMA observations could detect water ice with a mass above $10^{20}$ g, representing a potential lower limit of circumstellar disk mass. Water vapor rotational lines also abundantly emerge within the PRIMA wavelength coverage, and 5-hour observations for white dwarfs within 20 pc could detect water vapor with a total disk mass $\gtrsim 10^{20}$ g, depending on the H$_2$/H$_2$O ratio. 19 metal polluted white dwarfs within 20 pc and 210 within 60 pc could be optimal targets for water vapor and ice observations, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of the water content and isotopic composition of water-rich asteroids and comets are of key interest for understanding the late accretion stage of the Solar System cometary and chondritic materials. The PRobe far-infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) can make an important contribution to solving this long-standing problem by carrying out direct measurements of the D/H ratio in a significant sample of Oort cloud and Kuiper belt comets, sampling the isotopic composition of the present-day outer Solar System. This would allow comparisons between different comet reservoirs, and with inner Solar System measurements in meteorites, as well as searching for correlations with physical parameters, such as hyperactivity, providing quantitative constraints on the dynamical and chemical models of the early Solar System.</description>

      <title>ALMA High-resolution Observation for the Transitional Disk around IRAS 04125+2902</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the youngest transiting planet was discovered around the T Tauri star, IRAS 04125+2902, in the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region. This system is crucial for understanding the early stages of planet formation. We used Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 6 data to investigate the IRAS 04125+2902 system in detail. The dust continuum emission reveals a ring-gap transitional disk structure with an inclination of 35.6$^{\circ}$. In addition, two-dimensional super-resolution imaging based on Sparse Modeling and the one-dimensional modeling of disk brightness distribution suggest the existence of an inner emission, which may be attributed to an inner disk, although free-free emission from the central star is not ruled out. Furthermore, we identified the $^{12}$CO $J$=2-1 emission, and the dynamical mass of the central star is estimated to be 0.7-1.0 $M_{\odot}$. The asymmetry of the dust ring and the velocity distortion around the central star are, if at all, weak, suggesting that the inner disk, if it exists, is not highly inclined with respect to the outer disk. Radiative transfer calculations of dust continuum emission suggest that the inner and the outer disk may be misaligned by $\sim$10$^\circ$, which may be confirmed in future observations with higher resolution and sensitivity. Our results suggest that IRAS 04125+2902 is a dynamically complex system, where the binary orbit, outer disk, inner disk, and planetary orbit are mutually misaligned, providing insight into the early orbital evolution of young systems.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of the Radius Gap in a Sample of Kepler, K2 and TESS exoplanets orbiting M Dwarf Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary radii are derived for 218 exoplanets orbiting 161 M dwarf stars. Stellar radii are based on an analysis of APOGEE high-resolution near-IR spectra for a subsample of the M-dwarfs; these results are used to define a stellar radius-M$_{\rm K_{\rm s}}$ calibration that is applied to the sample of M-dwarf planet hosts. The planetary radius distribution displays a gap over R$_{\rm p}$$\sim$1.6-2.0 R$_{\oplus}$, bordered by two peaks at R$_{\rm p}$$\sim$1.2-1.6 R$_{\oplus}$ (super-Earths) and 2.0-2.4 R$_{\oplus}$ (sub-Neptunes). The radius gap is nearly constant with exoplanetary orbital period (a power-law slope of m=$+0.01^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$), which is different (2-3$\sigma$) from m$\sim$$-$0.10 found previously for FGK dwarfs. This flat slope agrees with pebble accretion models, which include photoevaporation and inward orbital migration. The radius gap as a function of insolation is approximately constant over the range of S$_{\rm p}$$\sim$20-250 S$_{\oplus}$. The R$_{\rm p}$-P$_{\rm orb}$ plane exhibits a sub-Neptune desert for P$_{\rm orb}$$&lt;$2d, that appears at S$_{\rm p}$$&gt;$120 S$_{\oplus}$, being significantly smaller than S$_{\rm p}$$&gt;$650 S$_{\oplus}$ found in the FGK planet-hosts, indicating that the appearance of the sub-Neptune desert is a function of host-star mass. Published masses for 51 exoplanets are combined with our radii to determine densities, which exhibit a gap at $\rho_{\rm p}$$\sim$0.9$\rho_{\oplus}$, separating rocky exoplanets from sub-Neptunes. The density distribution within the sub-Neptune family itself reveals two peaks, at $\rho_{\rm p}$$\sim$0.4$\rho_{\oplus}$ and $\sim$0.7$\rho_{\oplus}$. Comparisons to planetary models find that the low-density group are gas-rich sub-Neptunes, while the group at $&lt;$$\rho_{\rm p}$$&gt;$$\sim$0.7$\rho_{\oplus}$ likely consists of volatile-rich water worlds.</description>

      <title>Radiative Transfer Modeling of a Shadowed Protoplanetary Disk assisted by a Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations and detailed modeling of a protoplanetary disk around the T Tauri star, V1098 Sco. Millimeter wavelength data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) show a ring of large dust grains with a central cavity that is filled with molecular gas. Near-infrared data with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) detect the scattered starlight from the disk surface and reveal a large shadow that extends over it's entire southern half. We model the ALMA continuum and line data to determine the outer disk geometry and the central stellar mass. Using radiative transfer models, we demonstrate that a misaligned inner disk, tilted in both inclination and position angle with respect to the outer disk, can reproduce the salient scattered light features seen with the VLT. Applying an image threshold algorithm to compare disk morphologies and training a neural network on a set of high signal-to-noise models, we forward model the data and determine the inner disk geometry. We find that the rotation axes of the inner and outer disks are misaligned by 38 degrees and constrain the mass and location of a perturbing planetary or substellar companion. The technique of simulation based inference that is illustrated here is broadly applicable for radiative transfer modeling of other objects.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the possible atmospheres on TRAPPIST-1 b: insights from 3D climate modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST observations of the secondary eclipse of TRAPPIST-1 b at 12.8 and 15 microns revealed a very bright dayside. These measurements are consistent with an absence of atmosphere. Previous 1D atmospheric modeling also excludes -- at first sight -- CO2-rich atmospheres. However, only a subset of the possible atmosphere types has been explored and ruled out to date. Recently, a full thermal phase curve of the planet at 15 microns with JWST has also been observed, allowing for more information on the thermal structure of the planet.
  We first looked for atmospheres capable of producing a dayside emission compatible with secondary eclipse observations. We then tried to determine which of these are compatible with the observed thermal phase curve.
  We used a 1D radiative-convective model and a 3D global climate model (GCM) to simulate a wide range of atmospheric compositions and surface pressures. We then produced observables from these simulations and compared them to available emission observations.
  We found several families of atmospheres compatible at 2-sigma with the eclipse observations. Among them, some feature a flat phase curve and can be ruled out with the observation, and some produce a phase curve still compatible with the data (i.e., thin N2-CO2 atmospheres, and CO2 atmospheres rich in hazes). We also highlight different 3D effects that could not be predicted from 1D studies (redistribution efficiency, atmospheric collapse).
  The available observations of TRAPPIST-1 b are consistent with an airless planet, which is the most likely scenario. A second possibility is a thin CO2-poor residual atmosphere. However, our study shows that different atmospheric scenarios can result in a high eclipse depth at 15 microns. It may therefore be hazardous, in general, to conclude on the presence of an atmosphere from a single photometric point.</description>

      <title>First JWST thermal phase curves of temperate terrestrial exoplanets reveal no thick atmosphere around TRAPPIST-1 b and c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report JWST/MIRI 15 $\mu$m phase curves of TRAPPIST-1 b and c, revealing thermal emission consistent with their irradiation levels, assuming no efficient heat redistribution. We find that TRAPPIST-1 b shows a high dayside brightness temperature (490 $\pm$ 17 K), no significantly detectable nightside emission ($F_{\rm b, Night, max}$ = $39_{-27}^{+55}$ ppm), and no phase offset -- features consistent with a low-albedo, airless ultramafic rocky surface. TRAPPIST-1 c exhibits a lower dayside brightness temperature (369 $\pm$ 23 K), and a nightside flux statistically indistinguishable from that of TRAPPIST-1 b ($F_{\rm c, Night, max}$ = $62_{-43}^{+60}$ ppm). Atmosphere models with surface pressures $\geq$1 bar and efficient greenhouse effects are strongly disfavoured for both planets. TRAPPIST-1 b is unlikely to possess any substantial atmosphere, while TRAPPIST-1 c may retain a tenuous, greenhouse-poor O$_2$-dominated atmosphere or be similarly airless with a more reflective surface. These results suggest divergent evolutionary pathways or atmospheric loss processes, despite similar compositions. These measurements tightly constrain atmosphere retention in the inner TRAPPIST-1 system.</description>

      <title>Sub-Jupiter Gas Giants Orbiting Giant Stars Uncovered using a Bayesian Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant stars have been shown to be rich hunting grounds for those aiming to detect giant planets orbiting beyond ~0.5 AU. Here we present two planetary systems around bright giant stars, found by combining the radial-velocity (RV) measurements from the EXPRESS and PPPS projects, and using a Bayesian framework. HIP18606 is a naked-eye (V=5.8 mags) K0III star and is found to host a planet with an orbital period of ~675 days, a minimum mass (Msini) of 0.8 MJ, and a circular orbit. HIP111909 is a bright (V=7.4 mags) K1III star, and hosts two giant planets on circular orbits with minimum masses of Msini=1.2 MJ and Msini=0.8 MJ, and orbital periods of ~490 d and ~890 d, for planets b and c respectively, strikingly close to the 5:3 orbital period ratio. Analysis of 11 known giant star planetary systems arrive at broadly similar parameters to those published, whilst adding a further two new worlds orbiting these stars. With these new discoveries, we have found a total of 13 planetary systems (including three multiple systems) within the 37 giant stars that comprise the EXPRESS and PPPS common sample. Periodogram analyses of stellar activity indicators present possible peaks at frequencies close to proposed Doppler signals in at least two planetary systems, HIP24275 and HIP90988, calling for more long-term activity studies of giant stars. Even disregarding these possible false-positives, extrapolation leads to a fraction of 25-30% of low-luminosity giant stars hosting planets. We find the mass-function exponentially rises towards the lowest planetary masses, however there exists a ~93% probability that a second population of giant planets with minimum masses between 4-5 MJ, is present, worlds that could have formed by the gravitational collapse of fragmenting proto-planetary disks. Finally, our noise modelling reveals a lack of statistical evidence for the presence of correlated noise...(Abridged)</description>

      <title>J-VAR: the northern variable sky in 7 filters -- First Data Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. The analysis of variability of astronomical sources is of extraordinary interest, as it allows the study of astrophysical phenomena in real time. This paper presents the Javalambre Variability Survey (J-VAR) which leverages the narrow band filters available at the Javalambre Auxiliary Survey Telescope (JAST80) at the Observatorio Astrof\'isico de Javalambre (OAJ).
  Methods. The JAST80 equipped with T80Cam, providing a field of view of 2\,square degrees and a pixel scale of 0.55\,arcsec/pixel has been designed for wide-field studies. The main characteristic is the availability of a variety of narrow band filters strategically located on stellar spectral features (the $J0395$ in correspondence of the Ca H+K doublet, the $J0515$ of the Mg $b$ triplet, the $J0660$ of the H$\alpha$ line, and the $J0861$ of the Ca~triplet). This project combines, for the first time, the wide-field with a variety of narrow band filters for a unique variability survey, observing each field 11~times with a standardised observing sequence. The median limiting magnitude for individual exposures are 19.1 mag in $J0395$ and $J0515$, $19.6$ mag in $J0660$ and $J0861$, $19.8$ mag in $i$, and $20.2$ in $g$ and $r$. The typical FWHM of the $r$-band images is $1.5$ arcsec.
  Results. This article introduces the first data release of J-VAR including more than 6000 individual asteroids, 10\,detected optical transients (4\,discovered supernovae), and 1.3 million light curves of point-sources. On average, J-VAR delivers an unprecedented $\sim$5000 light curves per square degree of 11\,epochs in 7\,bands, opening research opportunities for theoretical studies and new discoveries alike.</description>

      <title>Solar models with protosolar accretion and turbulent mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (abridged) Recent analyses have reported low lithium but high beryllium abundances on the solar surface; however, standard solar models (SSMs) predict Li abundances that are ~30$\sigma$ away from the observed value. In this study, we aim to develop solar models and compare them with the Li and Be abundance constraints. We examine the effect of protosolar accretion and turbulent mixing below the base of the surface convective zone. We compute ~200 solar evolutionary models for each case to optimize input parameters using target quantities, similar to the SSM framework. We confirm that turbulent mixing helps reproduce the surface Li and Be abundances within ~0.6$\sigma$ by enhancing burning. It suppresses gravitational settling, leading to a better matching of the He surface abundance ($\lesssim$0.3$\sigma$) and a smaller compositional gradient. We derive a new protosolar helium abundance $Y_{\rm proto}=0.2651\pm0.0035$. Turbulent mixing decreases the central metallicity ($Z_{\mathrm{center}}$) by $\approx$4.4%, even though accretion increases $Z_{\rm center}$ by $\approx$4.4%, as suggested by our previous study. Unfortunately, the reduction in $Z_{\rm center}$ implies that our models do not reproduce constraints on observed neutrino fluxes by $6.2\sigma$ for $^8{\rm B}$ and $2.7\sigma$ for CNO. Including turbulent mixing in solar models appears indispensable to reproduce the observed atmospheric abundances of Li and Be. However, the resulting tensions in terms of neutrino fluxes, even in the models with the protosolar accretion, show that the solar modeling problem remains, at least partly. We suggest that improved electron screening, as well as other microscopic properties, may help alleviate this problem. An independent confirmation of the neutrino fluxes measured by the Borexino experiment would also be extremely valuable.</description>

      <title>Are Local Group Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies the First Safe Planet-hosting Environments?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore whether Local Group dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies might have hosted Earth-like planets dwelling unexposed for several billions of years to major galactic threats to life, such as supernovae and gamma-ray bursts. To this aim, we developed a novel semiempirical model that exploits the observed chemical abundances and star formation histories of a selected sample of local dSphs, to explore whether their stars may have (i) reached the minimum metallicity to trigger planet formation and (ii) avoided exposure to destructive events long enough to provide time for possible biological development. From our work two scenarios emerge. If planet formation is possible for ${\rm[Fe/H]}\lesssim-1$, then in all dSphs with $5\times10^{3}L_{\odot}\leq L_V\leq2\times10^{7}L_{\odot}$ a fraction $\approx0.1\%-10\%$ of stars might have safely hosted terrestrial planets for more than $1$ Gyr. In this scenario, ancient ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs, $L_V\leq10^{5}L_{\odot}$) would have been the first to reach this condition in the history of the Local Group. Conversely, if planets form for ${\rm[Fe/H]}\geq-0.6$ then they should not exist in UFDs, while only $\approx0.001\%-0.1\%$ of stars in dSphs with $L_V\geq3\times10^{5}L_{\odot}$ would host planets dwelling in safe conditions for long times. Interestingly, we find a "luminosity sweet spot" at $L_V\sim10^{6}L_{\odot}$ where dSphs in our sample safely host terrestrial planets up to $4$ Gyr and in any planet formation scenario explored. In conclusion, planet formation at low metallicity is key to understanding which types of galaxies might have formed Earth-like planets that dwelt unexposed to galactic threats over several billions of years, first in the history of the Local Group.</description>

      <title>Tertiary Tides with Eccentric Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within hierarchical triple stellar systems, there exists a tidal process unique to them, known as tertiary tides. In this process, the tidal deformation of a tertiary in a hierarchical triple drains energy from the inner binary, causing the inner binary's orbit to shrink. Previous work has uncovered the rate at which tertiary tides drain energy from inner binaries, as a function of orbital and tidal parameters, for hierarchical triples in which the orbits are all circular and coplanar. However, not all hierarchical triples have orbits which are circular and coplanar, which requires an understanding of what happens when this condition is relaxed. In this paper, we study how eccentricities affect tertiary tides, and their influence on the subsequent dynamical evolution of the host hierarchical triple. We find that eccentricities in the outer orbit undergo tidal circularisation as quickly as binary tidal synchronisation, and are therefore trivial, but that eccentricities in the inner binary completely change the behaviour of tertiary tides, draining energy from the outer orbit as well as the inner orbit. As with the circular orbit case, tertiary tides become significant when the tertiary is large enough to come close to filling its Roche Lobe, and dominate tidal evolution when interactions between the inner binary pair are weak. Empirical equations that approximate this behaviour are provided for ease of implementing this process in other stellar evolution codes, and the implications of these results are discussed.</description>

      <title>SO2, silicate clouds, but no CH4 detected in a warm Neptune</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: WASP-107b is a warm (~740 K) transiting planet with a Neptune-like mass of ~30.5 Earth masses and Jupiter-like radius of ~0.94 Jupiter radius, whose extended atmosphere is eroding. Previous observations showed evidence for water vapour and a thick high-altitude condensate layer in WASP-107b's atmosphere. Recently, photochemically produced sulphur dioxide (SO2) was detected in the atmosphere of a hot (~1200 K) Saturn-mass planet from transmission spectroscopy near 4.05 microns, but for temperatures below 1000 K sulphur is predicted to preferably form sulphur allotropes instead of SO2. Here we report the 9-sigma detection of two fundamental vibration bands of SO2, at 7.35 microns and 8.69 microns, in the transmission spectrum of WASP-107b using the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) of the JWST. This discovery establishes WASP-107b as the second irradiated exoplanet with confirmed photochemistry, extending the temperature range of exoplanets exhibiting detected photochemistry from ~1200 K down to ~740 K. Additionally, our spectral analysis reveals the presence of silicate clouds, which are strongly favoured (~7-sigma) over simpler cloud setups. Furthermore, water is detected (~12-sigma), but methane is not. These findings provide evidence of disequilibrium chemistry and indicate a dynamically active atmosphere with a super-solar metallicity.</description>

      <title>A novel metric for assessing climatological surface habitability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05838v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planetary surface habitability has so far been considered, in the main, upon a global scale. The increasing number of 3D modelling studies of (exo)planetary climate has highlighted the need for a more nuanced understanding of surface habitability. Using satellite-derived data of photosynthetic life to represent the observed surface habitability of modern Earth, we validate a set of climatologically-defined metrics previously used in habitability studies. The comparison finds that the metrics defined by surface temperature alone show spatial patterns of habitability distinct to those defined by aridity or water availability, with no metric able to completely replicate the observed habitability. We build upon these results to introduce a new metric defined by the observed thermal limits of modern Earth-based life, along with surface water fluxes as an analogue for water and nutrient availability. Furthermore, we pay attention to not only the thermal bounds of macroscopic complex life, but additionally the limits of microbial life which have been vital to the generation of Earth's biosignatures, thus expanding considerations of climatic habitability out of a historically binary definition. Repeating the validation for our metric, along with another which uses a similar definition that incorporates conditions for both temperature and water availability, shows a significant improvement in capturing the broad patterns of surface habitability, laying the groundwork for more comprehensive assessments of potential life-supporting climates upon other planets.</description>

      <title>The tidal heating of the exoplanet 55 Cnc e. The role of the orbital eccentricity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Observations with warm Spitzer and JWST revealed high and variable brightness in the planet 55 Cnc e.
  Aims. Inventory of the tidal effects on the rotational and orbital evolution of the planet 55 Cnc e enhanced by the nonzero orbital eccentricity.
  Methods. The creep-tide theory is used in simulations and dynamical analyses that explore the difficult trapping of the planet rotation in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance and the most probable synchronization of the rotation.
  Results. The strong tidal dissipation of energy, enhanced by the non-zero orbital eccentricity, may explain the observed brightness anomalies. However, the strong dissipation should also circularize the orbit. The observed non-zero eccentricity, if true, would indicate that an unknown planet in a close orbital resonance with 55 Cnc e perturbing the motion of this planet should exist.</description>

      <title>Planetary dynamos driven by semiconvection in stably stratified layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stably stratified fluid layers are common in gaseous planets, stellar interiors, and planetary cores, and have long been considered incapable of sustaining dynamo action. Here, we show that semiconvection - driven by a destabilizing thermal gradient within an overall stably stratified medium - can, in fact, give rise to self-sustained magnetic fields. Motivated by recent models suggesting that large portions of Jupiter and Saturn may be semiconvective, we perform direct numerical simulations in spherical shells, operating in the planetary-relevant regime of low magnetic Prandtl numbers. From a primary semiconvection instability, a layered convection state spontaneously develops, consisting of a convective region beneath a stably stratified layer of comparable thickness. Fluid motions in this convective region are strong enough to produce magnetic fields with key features observed in planetary dynamos, including strong dipolarity, realistic field strengths, and spectral characteristics. These results provide the first direct evidence that semiconvection can drive dynamo action in stably stratified regions of gas giants and stellar interiors, with important implications for understanding astrophysical magnetic field generation.</description>

      <title>Destruction of "Peas in a Pod?" A Candidate Multi-planet System Around the Nearby, Bright Star, HD208487</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We re-investigate the HD208487 system to test the reality of the proposed HD208487c world. We also search for additional companions using applied Bayesian statistics and 15+ years of new RV data from the HARPS and the PFS instruments that were taken post-discovery of HD208487b.
  The RV data was analyzed with GLS Periodograms, followed by Bayesian analysis using the EMPEROR code. We scrutinised various stellar activity indices to search for any corresponding peaks in the power spectra, correlations with the RV measurements, or significant signals from a Bayesian analysis methodology. Finally, photometric data was checked to test for any transits or possible activity manifestations that could lead to possible false RV signals or excess noise.
  Our analysis points towards a candidate second planet in the system, positioned near the period of a previously proposed and subsequently challenged signal. This signal, HD208487c, would relate to a cool Saturn with an orbital period of 923.06 +2.02 -2.76 d and a minimum mass of Mj sini = 0.32 +/- 0.01Mj. Our analysis also gives rise to a newly discovered candidate planet, HD208487d, which would be the result of a cool super-Neptune/sub-Saturn with a period of 1380.13 +19.20 -8.25 d and a minimum mass of Mj sini = 0.15 +/- 0.01Mj. Neither stellar activity indices nor photometric data show signals statistically matching these periods.
  We have uncovered a candidate three planet system that would consist of an inner gas giant, a central Saturn and an outer super-Neptune/sub-Saturn. A dynamical analysis suggests that gravitational scattering of an initially ordered, equally-spaced system in a long resonant chain of six Neptunes can explain the current proposed architecture of HD208487. More RVs may also shed light on the reality of a fourth Doppler signal uncovered in the data that sits close to the 2:1 period-ratio with signal of HD208487c.</description>

      <title>Modeling Orbital Decay of Low-Earth Orbit Satellites due to Atmospheric Drag: A Simplified Analytical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are crucial for communications, navigation, and Earth observation. However, their operational lifetimes are strongly influenced by orbital decay due to atmospheric drag. This work presents a simplified analytical model of orbital decay in LEO, incorporating atmospheric density variations and satellite parameters. Using standard drag force equations and density models, we explore how altitude, satellite mass, and cross-sectional area affect decay timescales. Comparisons are made with existing NASA models and previous literature. The results highlight the importance of accurate atmospheric density representation and solar activity in predicting satellite lifetimes, especially relevant in the context of increasing space debris and mega-constellations.</description>

      <title>ORBIT-2: Scaling Exascale Vision Foundation Models for Weather and Climate Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse observations and coarse-resolution climate models limit effective regional decision-making, underscoring the need for robust downscaling. However, existing AI methods struggle with generalization across variables and geographies and are constrained by the quadratic complexity of Vision Transformer (ViT) self-attention. We introduce ORBIT-2, a scalable foundation model for global, hyper-resolution climate downscaling. ORBIT-2 incorporates two key innovations: (1) Residual Slim ViT (Reslim), a lightweight architecture with residual learning and Bayesian regularization for efficient, robust prediction; and (2) TILES, a tile-wise sequence scaling algorithm that reduces self-attention complexity from quadratic to linear, enabling long-sequence processing and massive parallelism. ORBIT-2 scales to 10 billion parameters across 65,536 GPUs, achieving up to 4.1 exaFLOPS sustained throughput and 74--98% strong scaling efficiency. It supports downscaling to 0.9 km global resolution and processes sequences up to 4.2 billion tokens. On 7 km resolution benchmarks, ORBIT-2 achieves high accuracy with $R^2$ scores in the range of 0.98--0.99 against observational data.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved protoplanetary disk physics in DQ Tau with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accretion variability is ubiquitous in YSOs. While large outbursts may strongly affect the disk, the effects of moderate bursts are less understood. We aim to study the physical response of the disk around the eccentric binary system DQ Tau to its periodic accretion changes. We organized a multi-wavelength campaign centered on four JWST/MIRI spectra. We targeted three periastrons (high accretion state) and one apastron (quiescence). We used optical and near-infrared spectroscopy and photometry to measure how the accretion luminosity varies. We decomposed the multi-epoch SEDs into stellar, accretion, and rim components. We fitted the solid-state features using various opacity curves and the molecular features using slab models. We find the inner disk of DQ Tau to be highly dynamic. The temperature, luminosity, and location of the inner dust rim vary in response to the movement of stars and the L_acc variations. This causes variable shadowing of the outer disk, leading to an anti-correlation between the rim temperature and the strength of the silicate feature. The dust mineralogy remains constant, dominated by large amorphous olivine and pyroxene grains, with smaller fractions of crystalline forsterite. The excitation of CO (1550-2260 K), HCN (880-980 K), and hot H2O (740-860 K) molecules as well as the luminosity of the [NeII] line correlate with the accretion rate, while the warm (650 K) and cold (170-200 K) H2O components are mostly constant. CO emission, originating from a hot (&gt;1500 K) region likely within the dust sublimation radius, is most sensitive to L_acc changes. In comparison with other T Tauri disks, DQ Tau is highly C-poor and displays moderately inefficient pebble drift. We conclude that even moderate accretion rate changes affect the thermal structure in the planet-forming disk regions on short timescales, providing a crucial benchmark for understanding disk evolution.</description>
