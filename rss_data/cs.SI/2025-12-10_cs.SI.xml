      <title>Finding core subgraphs of directed graphs via discrete Ricci curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ricci curvature and its associated flow offer powerful geometric methods for analyzing complex networks. While existing research heavily focuses on applications for undirected graphs such as community detection and core extraction, there have been relatively less attention on directed graphs.
  In this paper, we introduce a definition of Ricci curvature and an accompanying curvature flow for directed graphs. Crucially, for strongly connected directed graphs, this flow admits a unique global solution. We then apply this flow to detect strongly connected subgraphs from weakly connected directed graphs. (A weakly connected graph is connected overall but not necessarily strongly connected). Unlike prior work requiring graphs to be strongly connected, our method loosens this requirement. We transform a weakly connected graph into a strongly connected one by adding edges with very large artificial weights. This modification does not compromise our core subgraph detection. Due to their extreme weight, these added edges are automatically discarded during the final iteration of the Ricci curvature flow.
  For core evaluation, our approach consistently surpasses traditional methods, achieving better results on at least two out of three key metrics. The implementation code is publicly available at https://github.com/12tangze12/Finding-core-subgraphs-on-directed-graphs.</description>

      <title>Scaffolding Reshapes Dialogic Engagement in Collaborative Problem Solving: Comparative Analysis of Two Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supporting learners during Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) is a necessity. Existing studies have compared scaffolds with maximal and minimal instructional support by studying their effects on learning and behaviour. However, our understanding of how such scaffolds could differently shape the distribution of individual dialogic engagement and behaviours across different CPS phases remains limited. This study applied Heterogeneous Interaction Network Analysis (HINA) and Sequential Pattern Mining (SPM) to uncover the structural effects of scaffolding on different phases of the CPS process among K-12 students in authentic educational settings. Students with a maximal scaffold demonstrated higher dialogic engagement across more phases than those with a minimal scaffold. However, they were extensively demonstrating scripting behaviours across the phases, evidencing the presence of overscripting. Although students with the minimal scaffold demonstrated more problem solving behaviours and fewer scripting behaviours across the phases, they repeated particular behaviours in multiple phases and progressed more to socialising behaviours. In both scaffold conditions, problem solving behaviours rarely progressed to other problem solving behaviours. The paper discusses the implications of these findings for scaffold design and teaching practice of CPS, and highlights the distinct yet complementary value of HINA and SPM approaches to investigate students' learning processes during CPS.</description>

      <title>Fairness-aware PageRank via Edge Reweighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link-analysis algorithms, such as PageRank, are instrumental in understanding the structural dynamics of networks by evaluating the importance of individual vertices based on their connectivity. Recently, with the rising importance of responsible AI, the question of fairness in link-analysis algorithms has gained traction. In this paper, we present a new approach for incorporating group fairness into the PageRank algorithm by reweighting the transition probabilities in the underlying transition matrix. We formulate the problem of achieving fair PageRank by seeking to minimize the fairness loss, which is the difference between the original group-wise PageRank distribution and a target PageRank distribution. We further define a group-adapted fairness notion, which accounts for group homophily by considering random walks with group-biased restart for each group. Since the fairness loss is non-convex, we propose an efficient projected gradient-descent method for computing locally-optimal edge weights. Unlike earlier approaches, we do not recommend adding new edges to the network, nor do we adjust the restart vector. Instead, we keep the topology of the underlying network unchanged and only modify the relative importance of existing edges. We empirically compare our approach with state-of-the-art baselines and demonstrate the efficacy of our method, where very small changes in the transition matrix lead to significant improvement in the fairness of the PageRank algorithm.</description>

      <title>Framing Climate Change on YouTube: North-South Divides in Narratives and Public Engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change debates have gained increasing visibility on social media, with YouTube emerging as one of the most influential platforms for political communication. Reaching billions of users worldwide, it functions both as a news outlet and as a space for public discourse. While existing studies of climate discourse on YouTube often adopt a global perspective, this study examines the platform through the lens of the Global North-South divide. We analyse a dataset of 758 climate-related videos and their comment sections, applying topic modelling and sentiment analysis to identify recurring discursive patterns. Through these patterns, we recognise parallels with respect to debates in international climate negotiations. The findings reveal notable differences. Videos from the Global North and Global South reflect real-world divides, with the North emphasising the need for policies to curb carbon emissions, while the South highlights developmental priorities. A key area of convergence between the regions lies in the shared recognition of the importance of emissions reduction and international agreements. Audience responses, however, diverge more sharply: comment sections under Global North videos are dominated by criticism, conspiracy, and climate fatigue, whereas those under Global South videos are generally more supportive, constructive, and knowledge-oriented. Overall, the study demonstrates how YouTube reflects and reshapes global climate politics, while also revealing the gap between curated narratives and public sentiment. Bridging these divides may contribute to more inclusive and cooperative approaches to climate action.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary perspective of large language models on shaping research insights into healthcare disparities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introduction. Advances in large language models (LLMs) offer a chance to act as scientific assistants, helping people grasp complex research areas. This study examines how LLMs evolve in healthcare disparities research, with attention to public access to relevant information. Methods. We studied three well-known LLMs: ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini. Each week, we asked them a consistent prompt about research themes in healthcare disparities and tracked how their answers changed over a one-month period. Analysis. The themes produced by the LLMs were categorized and cross-checked against H-index values from the Web of Science to verify relevance. This dual approach shows how the outputs of LLMs develop over time and how such progress could help researchers navigate trends. Results. The outputs aligned with actual scientific impact and trends in the field, indicating that LLMs can help people understand the healthcare disparities landscape. Time-series comparisons showed differences among the models in how broadly and deeply they identified and classified themes. Conclusion. The study offers a framework that uses the evolution of multiple LLMs to illuminate AI tools for studying healthcare disparities, informing future research and public engagement strategies.</description>

      <title>WikIPedia: Unearthing a 20-Year History of IPv6 Client Addressing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their article editing policies, Wikimedia sites like Wikipedia have become inadvertent time capsules for IPv6 addresses. When Wikimedia users make edits without signing into an account, their IP addresses are used in lieu of a username. Wikimedia site dumps therefore provide researchers with over two decades worth of timestamped client IPv6 addresses to understand address assignments and how they have changed over time and space.
  In this work, we extract 19M unique IPv6 addresses from Wikimedia sites like Wikipedia that were used by editors from 2003 to 2024. We use these addresses to understand the prevalence of IPv6 in countries corresponding to Wikimedia site languages, how IPv6 adoption has grown over time, and the prevalence of EUI-64 addressing on client devices like desktops, laptops, and mobile phones.</description>

      <title>On the Relationship between Space-Time Accessibility and Leisure Activity Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how accessibility shapes participation in leisure activities is central to promoting inclusive and vibrant urban life. Conventional accessibility measures often focus on potential access from fixed home locations, overlooking the constraints and opportunities embedded in daily routines. In this study, we apply a space-time accessibility (STA) metric rooted in the capability approach, capturing feasible leisure opportunities between home and work given a certain time budget, individual transport modes, and urban infrastructure. Using high-resolution GPS data from 2,415 residents in the Paris region, we assess how STA influences total travel time and leisure participation, measured as the diversity of leisure locations visited. Our analysis shows that most individuals, especially active transport users, choose destinations aligned with their STA-defined opportunity sets, underscoring the metric's validity in capturing capability sets. Structural equation modeling reveals that STA directly fosters leisure diversity but also reduces travel time, which in turn is associated with lower diversity of visited leisure locations. These findings highlight the value of person-centered, capability-informed accessibility metrics for understanding inequalities in urban mobility and informing transport planning strategies that expand real freedoms to participate in social life across diverse population groups.</description>

      <title>Beyond Community Notes: A Framework for Understanding and Building Crowdsourced Context Systems for Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms are increasingly developing features that display crowdsourced context alongside posts, modeled after X's Community Notes. These systems, which we term Crowdsourced Context Systems (CCS), have the potential to reshape our information ecosystem as major platforms embrace them as alternatives to top-down fact-checking. To deeply understand the features and implications of such systems, we perform a systematic literature review of existing CCS research and analyze several real-world CCS implementations. Based on our analysis, we develop a framework with two distinct components. First, we present a theoretical model to help conceptualize and define CCS. Second, we identify a design space encompassing six key aspects of CCS: participation, inputs, curation, presentation, platform treatment, and transparency. We discuss key normative implications of different CCS design and implementation choices. Our paper integrates these theoretical, design, and ethical perspectives to establish a foundation for future human-centered research on Crowdsourced Context Systems.</description>

      <title>Shift Bribery over Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In shift bribery, a briber seeks to promote his preferred candidate by paying voters to raise their ranking. Classical models of shift bribery assume voters act independently, overlooking the role of social influence. However, in reality, individuals are social beings and are often represented as part of a social network, where bribed voters may influence their neighbors, thereby amplifying the effect of persuasion. We study Shift bribery over Networks, where voters are modeled as nodes in a directed weighted graph, and arcs represent social influence between them. In this setting, bribery is not confined to directly targeted voters its effects can propagate through the network, influencing neighbors and amplifying persuasion. Given a budget and individual cost functions for shifting each voter's preference toward a designated candidate, the goal is to determine whether a shift strategy exists within budget that ensures the preferred candidate wins after both direct and network-propagated influence takes effect. We show that the problem is NP-Complete even with two candidates and unit costs, and W[2]-hard when parameterized by budget or maximum degree. On the positive side, we design polynomial-time algorithms for complete graphs under plurality and majority rules and path graphs for uniform edge weights, linear-time algorithms for transitive tournaments for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform arc weights, and pseudo-polynomial algorithms for cluster graphs. We further prove the existence of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with treewidth as parameter for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform arc weights and pseudo-FPT with cluster vertex deletion number for two candidates and uniform arc weights. Together, these results give a detailed complexity landscape for shift bribery in social networks.</description>

      <title>Towards agent-based-model informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a framework for designing neural networks that remain consistent with the underlying principles of agent-based models. We begin by highlighting the limitations of standard neural differential equations in modeling complex systems, where physical invariants (like energy) are often absent but other constraints (like mass conservation, information locality, bounded rationality) must be enforced. To address this, we introduce Agent-Based-Model informed Neural Networks (ABM-NNs), which leverage restricted graph neural networks and hierarchical decomposition to learn interpretable, structure-preserving dynamics. We validate the framework across three case studies of increasing complexity: (i) a generalized Generalized Lotka--Volterra system, where we recover ground-truth parameters from short trajectories in presence of interventions; (ii) a graph-based SIR contagion model, where our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning baselines (GCN, GraphSAGE, Graph Transformer) in out-of-sample forecasting and noise robustness; and (iii) a real-world macroeconomic model of the ten largest economies, where we learn coupled GDP dynamics from empirical data and demonstrate counterfactual analysis for policy interventions</description>
