      <title>Quasispecies dynamics with time lags and periodic fluctuations in replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasispecies theory provides the conceptual and theoretical bases for describing the dynamics of biological information of replicators subject to large mutation rates. This theory, initially conceived within the framework of prebiotic evolution, is also being used to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of RNA viruses and heterogeneous cancer cells populations. In this sense, efforts to approximate the initial quasispecies theory to more realistic scenarios have been made in recent decades. Despite this, how time lags in RNA synthesis and periodic fluctuations impact quasispecies dynamics remains poorly studied. In this article, we combine the theory of delayed ordinary differential equations and topological Leray-Schauder degree to investigate the classical quasispecies model in the single-peak fitness landscape considering time lags and periodic fluctuations in replication. First, we prove that the dynamics with time lags under the constant population constraint remains in the simplex in both forward and backward times. With backward mutation and periodic fluctuations, we prove the existence of periodic orbits regardless of time lags. Nevertheless, without backward mutation, neither periodic fluctuation nor the introduction of time lags leads to periodic orbits. However, in the case of periodic fluctuations, solutions converge exponentially to a periodic oscillation around the equilibria associated with a constant replication rate. We check the validity of the error catastrophe hypothesis assuming no backward mutation; we determine that the error threshold remains sound for the case of time of periodic fitness and time lags with constant fitness. Finally, our results show that the error threshold is not found with backward mutations.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Interactions Shape Survival During Population Range Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An organism that is newly introduced into an existing population has a survival probability that is dependent on both the population density of its environment and the competition it experiences with the members of that population. Expanding populations naturally form regions of high and low density, and simultaneously experience ecological interactions both internally and at the boundary of their range. For this reason, systems of expanding populations are ideal for studying the combination of density and ecological effects. Conservation ecologists have been studying the ability of an invasive species to establish for some time, attributing success to both ecological and spatial factors. Similar behaviors have been observed in spatially structured cell populations, such as those found in cancerous tumors and bacterial biofilms. In these scenarios, novel organisms may be the introduction of a new mutation or bacterial species with some form of drug resistance, leading to the possibility of treatment failure. In order to gain insight into the relationship between population density and ecological interactions, we study an expanding population of interacting wild-type cells and mutant cells. We simulate these interactions in time and study the spatially dependent probability for a mutant to survive or to take over the front of the population wave (gene surfing). Additionally, we develop a mathematical model that describes this survival probability and find agreement when the payoff for the mutant is positive (corresponding to cooperation, exploitation, or commensalism). By knowing the types of interactions, our model provides insight into the spatial distribution of survival probability. Conversely, given a spatial distribution of survival probabilities, our model provides insight into the types of interactions that were involved to generate it.</description>

      <title>Phenotypic heterogeneity in temporally fluctuating environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many biological systems regulate phenotypic heterogeneity as a fitness-maximising strategy in uncertain and dynamic environments. Analysis of such strategies is typically confined both to a discrete set of environmental conditions, and to a discrete (often binary) set of phenotypes specialised to each condition. In this work, we extend theory on both fronts to encapsulate both a discrete and continuous spectrum of phenotypes arising in response to two broad classes of environmental efluctuations that drive changes in the phenotype-dependent growth rates; specifically, stochastic environments that are temporally uncorrelated (specifically, white-noise processes) and correlated (specifically, Poisson and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes). For tractability, we restrict analysis to an exponential growth model, and consider biologically relevant simplifications that pertain to the relative timescale of phenotype switching. These assumptions yield a series of analytical and semi-analytical expressions that reveal environments in which both discrete and continuous phenotypic heterogeneity is evolutionary advantageous.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Systems Framework for Modeling COVID-19 with L\'evy Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural fluctuations have played a crucial role in affecting the dynamics of pervasive diseases such as the coronavirus. Examining the effects of irregular unsettling disturbances on epidemic models is important for understanding these dynamics. In this study, we introduce a mathematical model for the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) dynamics of the coronavirus, incorporating perturbations in the contact rate through Levy noise. The utilization of the Levy process is essential for the protection and control of diseases. We delve into the dynamics of both the deterministic model and the global positive solution of the stochastic model, establishing their existence and uniqueness. Additionally, we explore conditions for the termination and persistence of the infection. Furthermore, we derive the basic reproduction number, a critical determinant of disease extinction or persistence. Numerical results indicate that COVID-19 dissipates from the population when the reproduction number is less than one in the presence of significant or minor noise. Conversely, controlling epidemic diseases becomes challenging when the reproduction number exceeds one. To illustrate this phenomenon, we provide numerical simulations, offering insights into the dynamics of the disease and the efficacy of control measures</description>
