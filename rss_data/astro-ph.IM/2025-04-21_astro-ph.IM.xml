      <title>Exoplaneteers Keep Calling Plots "Allan Variance" Plots When They Aren't</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I highlight that there is a substantial number of papers (at least 11 published since 2024) which all refer to a specific type of plot as an "Allan variance" plot, when in fact they seem to be plotting the standard deviation of the residuals versus bin size. The Allan variance quantifies the stability of a time series by calculating the average squared difference between successive time-averaged segments over a specified interval; it is not equivalent to the standard deviation. This misattribution seems particularly prolific in the exoplanet transit spectroscopy community. However, I emphasize that it does not impact the scientific analyses presented in those works. I discuss where this confusion seems to stem from and encourage the community to ensure statistical measures are named correctly to avoid confusion.</description>

      <title>SolarZip: An Efficient and Adaptive Compression Framework for Solar EUV Imaging Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13504v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: With the advancement of solar physics research, next-generation solar space missions and ground-based telescopes face significant challenges in efficiently transmitting and/or storing large-scale observational data. Aims: We develop an efficient compression and evaluation framework for solar EUV data, specifically optimized for Solar Orbiter Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) data, significantly reducing data volume while preserving scientific usability. Methods: We systematically evaluated four error-bounded lossy compressors across two EUI datasets. However, the existing methods cannot perfectly handle the EUI datasets (with continuously changing distance and significant resolution differences). Motivated by this, we develop an adaptive hybrid compression strategy with optimized interpolation predictors. Moreover, we designed a two-stage evaluation framework integrating distortion analysis with downstream scientific workflows, ensuring that observational analysis is not affected at high compression ratios. Results: Our framework SolarZip achieved up to 800x reduction for Full Sun Imager (FSI) data and 500x for High Resolution Imager (HRI$_{\text{EUV}}$) data. It significantly outperformed both traditional and advanced algorithms, achieving 3-50x higher compression ratios than traditional algorithms, surpassing the second-best algorithm by up to 30%. Simulation experiments verified that SolarZip can reduce data transmission time by up to 270x while ensuring the preservation of scientific usability. Conclusions: The SolarZip framework significantly enhances solar observational data compression efficiency while preserving scientific usability by dynamically selecting optimal compression methods based on observational scenarios and user requirements. This provides a promising data management solution for deep space missions like Solar Orbiter.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Limits of TESS Stellar Rotation Measurements with the K2-TESS Overlap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has provided stellar rotation periods across much of the sky through high-precision light curves, but the reliability and completeness of these measurements require careful evaluation. We assess the accuracy of TESS-derived rotation periods by leveraging a cross-matched sample of ~23,000 stars observed by both TESS and the K2 mission, treating K2 periods as a benchmark. Using causal pixel models to extract light curves and the Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram to identify rotation signals, we quantify the empirical uncertainties, reliability, and completeness of TESS rotation period measurements. We find that uncertainties on TESS-derived rotation periods are typically below 3% for stars with periods &lt; 10 days. Rotation periods are generally reliable out to 10 days, with &gt;80% of measurements matching the K2 benchmark. Completeness and reliability drop dramatically for periods beyond ~12 days due to the 27-day sector limitation. Stricter cuts on TESS magnitude and LS power improve reliability; the highest LS power tested (&gt;0.2) ensures &gt;90% reliability below 10 days but removes over half of potential detections. Stitching consecutive-sector light curves reduces period uncertainties but does not improve overall reliability or completeness due to persistent systematics. Our findings and code provide a framework for interpreting TESS-derived rotation periods and inform the selection of quality cuts to optimize studies of stellar rotation, young associations, and gyrochronology.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of BEACON to Ultra-High Energy Diffuse and Transient Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-high energy neutrinos ($E&gt;10^{17}$ eV) can provide insight into the most powerful accelerators in the universe, however their flux is extremely low. The Beamforming Elevated Array for COsmic Neutrinos (BEACON) is a detector concept which efficiently achieves sensitivity to this flux by employing phased radio arrays on mountains, which search for the radio emission of up-going extensive air showers created by Earth-skimming tau neutrinos. Here, we calculate the point-source effective area of BEACON and characterize its sensitivity to transient neutrino fluences with both short ($&lt;15$ min) and long ($&gt; 1$ day) durations. Additionally, by integrating the effective area, we provide an updated estimate of the diffuse flux sensitivity. With just 100 stations, BEACON achieves sensitivity to short-duration transients such as nearby short gamma-ray bursts. With 1000 stations, BEACON achieves a sensitivity to long-duration transients, as well as the cosmogenic flux, ten times greater than existing experiments at 1 EeV. With an efficient design optimized for ultrahigh energy neutrinos, BEACON is capable of discovering the sources of neutrinos at the highest energies.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Effects of Temperature, Clouds, and Gravity on K I doublet in L dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of surface gravity, effective temperature, and cloudiness on the potassium doublet (\ion{K}{1}) at 1.17 {\mu}m in brown dwarf spectra. Using pseudo-Voigt profiles to fit the \ion{K}{1} doublet in Sonora Diamondback atmospheric model spectra, we find that gravity and cloudiness affect the spectra differently in mid to late-L dwarfs. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) is strongly correlated with surface gravity, while the maximum depth strongly correlates with cloudiness. This method allows us to separate the effects of clouds and surface gravity on the \ion{K}{1} 1.17 {\mu}m doublet. We also find that the FWHM and maximum depth of the doublet can help to estimate the effective temperature and surface gravity in early to mid-L dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Forecast measurement of the 21 cm global spectrum from Lunar orbit with the Vari-Zeroth-Order Polynomial (VZOP) method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmic 21 cm signal serves as a crucial probe for studying the evolutionary history of the Universe. However, detecting the 21 cm signal poses significant challenges due to its extremely faint nature. To mitigate the interference from the Earth's radio frequency interference (RFI), the ground and the ionospheric effects, the Discovering the Sky at the Longest Wavelength (DSL) project will deploy a constellation of satellites in Lunar orbit, with its high-frequency daughter satellite tasked with detecting the global 21 cm signal from cosmic dawn and reionization era (CD/EoR). We intend to employ the Vari-Zeroth-Order Polynomial (VZOP) for foreground fitting and subtracting. We have studied the effect of thermal noise, thermal radiation from the Moon, the Lunar reflection, anisotropic frequency-dependent beam, inaccurate antenna beam pattern, and RFI contamination. We discovered that the RFI contamination can significantly affect the fitting process and thus prevent us from detecting the signal. Therefore, experimenting on the far side of the moon is crucial. We also discovered that using VZOP together with DSL, after 1080 orbits around the Moon, which takes about 103 days, we can successfully detect the CD/EoR 21 cm signal.</description>

      <title>On the presence of a fifth force at the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aims: The presence of a Yukawa-like correction to Newtonian gravity is investigated at the Galactic Center, leading to a new upper limit for the intensity of such a correction. Methods: We perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using the astrometric and spectroscopic data of star S$2$ collected at the Very Large Telescope by GRAVITY, NACO and SINFONI instruments, covering the period from $1992$ to $2022$. Results: The precision of the GRAVITY instrument allows us to derive the most stringent upper limit at the Galactic Center for the intensity of the Yukawa contribution ($\propto \, \alpha e^{- \lambda r}$) to be $|\alpha| &lt; 0.003$ for a scale length $\lambda = 3 \cdot 10^{13}\, \rm m\, (\sim 200 \, \rm AU)$. This improves by roughly one order of magnitude all estimates obtained in previous works.</description>

      <title>De-jittering Ariel: an optimized algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The European Space Agency's Ariel mission, scheduled for launch in 2029, aims to conduct the first large-scale survey of atmospheric spectra of transiting exoplanets. Ariel achieves the high photometric stability on transit timescales required to detect the spectroscopic signatures of chemical elements with a payload design optimized for transit photometry that either eliminates known systematics or allows for their removal during data processing without significantly degrading or biasing the detection. Jitter in the spacecraft's line of sight is a source of disturbance when measuring the spectra of exoplanet atmospheres. We describe an improved algorithm for de-jittering Ariel observations simulated in the time domain. We opt for an approach based on the spatial information on the Point Spread Function (PSF) distortion from jitter to detrend the optical signals. The jitter model is based on representative simulations from Airbus Defence and Space, the prime contractor for the Ariel service module. We investigate the precision and biases of the retrieved atmospheric spectra from the jitter-detrended observations. At long wavelengths, the photometric stability of the Ariel spectrometer is already dominated by photon noise. Our algorithm effectively de-jitters both photometric and spectroscopic data, ensuring that the performance remains photon noise-limited across the entire Ariel spectrum, fully compliant with mission requirements. This work contributes to the development of the data reduction pipeline for Ariel, aligning with its scientific goals, and may also benefit other astronomical telescopes and instrumentation.</description>
