      <title>Bayesian weighted time-lapse full-waveform inversion using a receiver-extension strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-lapse full-waveform inversion (FWI) has become a powerful tool for characterizing and monitoring subsurface changes in various geophysical applications. However, non-repeatability (NR) issues caused, for instance, by GPS inaccuracies, often make it difficult to obtain unbiased time-lapse models. In this work we explore the portability of combining a receiver-extension FWI approach and Bayesian analysis to mitigate time-lapse noises arising from NR issues. The receiver-extension scheme introduces an artificial degree of freedom in positioning receivers, intending to minimize kinematic mismatches between modeled and observed data. Bayesian analysis systematically explores several potential solutions to mitigate time-lapse changes not associated with reservoir responses, assigning probabilities to each scenario based on prior information and available evidence. We consider two different subsurface models to demonstrate the potential of proposed approaches. First, using the Marmousi model, we investigate two NR scenarios associated with background noise in seismic data. Second, using a challenging deep-water Brazilian pre-salt setting, we investigate several NR scenarios to simulate real-world challenges. Our results demonstrate that combining Bayesian analysis with the receiver-extension FWI strategy can mitigate adverse NR effects successfully, producing cleaner and more reliable time-lapse models than conventional approaches. The results also reveal that the proposed Bayesian weighted procedure is a valuable tool for determining time-lapse estimates through statistical analysis of pre-existing models, allowing its application in ongoing time-lapse (4D) projects.</description>

      <title>Resurgence of Lunar Volcanism: Role of Localized Radioactive Enrichment in a Numerical Model of Magmatism and Mantle Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a 2-D numerical model of magmatism and mantle convection to understand the volcanism on the Procellarum KREEP terrane (PKT) of the Moon, which continued for billions of years with two peaks of activities at 3.5-4 Gyr ago and around 2 Gyr ago. In our model, the effects of the PKT on lunar evolution are considered by initially imposing a region of localized radioactive enrichment. The calculated volcanism has two peaks induced by different mechanisms. The first peak occurs at 3.5-4 Gyr ago when magma generated in the deep mantle by internal heating ascends to the surface as partially molten plumes. The basaltic blocks in the uppermost mantle formed by this magmatism, then, sink to the deep mantle, triggering further plumes that cause the resurgence of volcanism at $\sim$2 Gyr ago. Our model shows that localized radioactive enrichment is important for the long-lasting volcanism with a couple of peaks.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed deep learning quantifies propagated uncertainty in seismic structure and hypocenter determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08854v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subsurface seismic velocity structure is essential for earthquake source studies, including hypocenter determination. Conventional hypocenter determination methods ignore the inherent uncertainty in seismic velocity structure models, and the impact of this oversight has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we address this issue by employing a physics-informed deep learning (PIDL) approach that quantifies uncertainty in seismic velocity structure modeling and its propagation to hypocenter determination by introducing neural network ensembles trained on active seismic survey data, earthquake observation data, and the physical equation of wavefront movement. An analysis of an earthquake in southwest Japan using our method revealed that accounting for such uncertainty propagation significantly reduced the bias and uncertainty underestimation in the hypocenter determination, enabling quantitative evaluation of the focal depth relative to the plate boundary. Our results highlight the potential of PIDL for various geophysical inverse problems, such as investigating earthquake source parameters, which inherently suffer from uncertainty propagation.</description>

      <title>A sufficient condition for inviscid shear instability: Hurdle theorem and its application to alternating jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple method to identify unstable parameter regions in general inviscid unidirectional shear flow stability problems. The theory is applicable to a wide range of basic flows, including those that are non-monotonic. We illustrate the method using a model of Jupiter's alternating jet streams based on the quasi-geostrophic equation. The main result is that the flow is unstable if there is an interval in the flow domain for which the reciprocal Rossby Mach number (a quantity defined in terms of the zonal flow and potential vorticity distribution), surpasses a certain threshold or `hurdle'. The hurdle height approaches unity when we can take the hurdle width to greatly the atmosphere's intrinsic deformation length, as holds on gas giants. In this case, the Kelvin-Arnol'd sufficient condition of stability accurately detects instability. These results improve the theoretical framework for explaining the stable maintenance of Jupiter and Saturn's jets over decadal timescales.</description>
