      <title>Linear preservers of parallel matrix pairs with respect to the $k$-numerical radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $1 \leq k &lt; n$ be integers. Two $n \times n$ matrices $A$ and $B$ form a parallel pair with respect to the $k$-numerical radius $w_k$ if $w_k(A + \mu B) = w_k(A) + w_k(B)$ for some scalar $\mu$ with $|\mu| = 1$; they form a TEA (triangle equality attaining) pair if the preceding equation holds for $\mu = 1$. We classify linear bijections on $\mathbb M_n$ and on $\mathbb H_n$ which preserve parallel pairs or TEA pairs. Such preservers are scalar multiples of $w_k$-isometries, except for some exceptional maps on $\mathbb H_n$ when $n=2k$.</description>

      <title>The Riesz $\alpha$-energy of log-concave functions and related Minkowski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the first order variation of the Riesz $\alpha$-energy of a log-concave function $f$ with respect to the Asplund sum. Such a variational formula induces the Riesz $\alpha$-energy measure of log-concave function $f$, which will be denoted by $\mathfrak{R}_{\alpha}(f, \cdot)$. We pose the related Riesz $\alpha$-energy Minkowski problem aiming to find necessary and/or sufficient conditions on a pregiven Borel measure $\mu$ defined on $\Rn$ so that $\mu=\mathfrak{R}_{\alpha}(f,\cdot)$ for some log-concave function $f$. Assuming enough smoothness, the Riesz $\alpha$-energy Minkowski problem reduces to a new Monge-Amp\`{e}re type equation involving the Riesz $\alpha$-potential. Moreover, this new Minkowski problem can be viewed as a functional counterpart of the recent Minkowski problem for the chord measures in integral geometry posed by Lutwak, Xi, Yang and Zhang (Comm.\ Pure\ Appl.\ Math.,\ 2024). The Riesz $\alpha$-energy Minkowski problem will be solved under certain mild conditions on $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Gabor frames with atoms in M^q(R) but not in M^p(R) for any 1\leq p &lt; q \leq 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper consists of two parts. In the first half, we solve the question raised by Heil as to whether the atom of a Gabor frame must be in $M^p(\mathbb{R})$ for some $1&lt;p&lt;2$. Specifically,
  for each $0&lt;\alpha \beta \leq 1$ and $1&lt;q\leq 2$ we explicitly construct Gabor frames $\mathcal{G}(g,\alpha,\beta)$ with atoms in $M^q(\mathbb{R})$ but not in $M^{p}(\mathbb{R})$ for any $1\leq p&lt;q$. To construct such Gabor frames, we use box functions as the window functions and show that $$f = \sum_{k,n\in \mathbb{Z}} \langle f,M_{\beta n}T_{\alpha k} \mathcal{F}(\chi_{[0,\alpha]})\rangle M_{\beta n}T_{\alpha k} ( \mathcal{F}(\chi_{[0,\alpha]}))$$ holds for $f\in M^{p,q}(\mathbb{R})$ with unconditional convergence of the series for any $0&lt;\alpha\beta \leq 1$, $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and $1\leq q&lt;\infty$.
  In the second half of this paper, we study two questions related to unconditional convergence of Gabor expansions in modulation spaces. Under the assumption that the window functions are chosen from $M^p(\mathbb{R})$ for some $1\leq p\leq 2,$ we will prove several equivalent statements that the equation $f = \sum_{k,n\in \mathbb{Z}} \langle f, M_{\beta n}T_{\alpha k} \gamma \rangle M_{\beta n}T_{\alpha k} g$ can be extended from $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ to $M^q(\mathbb{R})$ for all $f\in M^q(\mathbb{R})$ and all $p\leq q\leq p'$ with unconditional convergence of the series. Finally, we characterize all Gabor systems $\{M_{\beta n}T_{\alpha k}g\}_{n,k\in \mathbb{Z}}$ in $M^{p,q}(\mathbb{R})$ for any $1\leq p,q&lt;\infty$ for which $f = \sum \langle f, \gamma_{k,n} \rangle M_{\beta n}T_{\alpha k} g$ with unconditional convergence of the series for all $f$ in $M^{p,q}(\mathbb{R})$ and all alternative duals $\{\gamma_{k,n}\}_{k,n\in \mathbb{Z}}$ of $\{M_{\beta n}T_{\alpha k} g\}_{n,k\in \mathbb{Z}}$.</description>

      <title>Sparse Recovery for Overcomplete Frames: Sensing Matrices and Recovery Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signal models formed as linear combinations of few atoms from an over-complete dictionary or few frame vectors from a redundant frame have become central to many applications in high dimensional signal processing and data analysis. A core question is, by exploiting the intrinsic low dimensional structure of the signal, how to design the sensing process and decoder in a way that the number of measurements is essentially close to the complexity of the signal set. This chapter provides a survey of important results in answering this question, with an emphasis on a basis pursuit like convex optimization decoder that admits a wide range of random sensing matrices. The results are quite established in the case signals are sparse in an orthonormal basis, while the case with frame sparse signals is much less explored. In addition to presenting the latest results on recovery guarantee and how few random heavier-tailed measurements fulfill these recovery guarantees, this chapter also aims to provide some insights in proof techniques. We also take the opportunity of this book chapter to publish an interesting result (Theorem 3.10) about a restricted isometry like property related to a frame.</description>

      <title>Statistical and Geometrical properties of regularized Kernel Kullback-Leibler divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the statistical and geometrical properties of the Kullback-Leibler divergence with kernel covariance operators (KKL) introduced by Bach [2022]. Unlike the classical Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence that involves density ratios, the KKL compares probability distributions through covariance operators (embeddings) in a reproducible kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and compute the Kullback-Leibler quantum divergence. This novel divergence hence shares parallel but different aspects with both the standard Kullback-Leibler between probability distributions and kernel embeddings metrics such as the maximum mean discrepancy. A limitation faced with the original KKL divergence is its inability to be defined for distributions with disjoint supports. To solve this problem, we propose in this paper a regularised variant that guarantees that the divergence is well defined for all distributions. We derive bounds that quantify the deviation of the regularised KKL to the original one, as well as finite-sample bounds. In addition, we provide a closed-form expression for the regularised KKL, specifically applicable when the distributions consist of finite sets of points, which makes it implementable. Furthermore, we derive a Wasserstein gradient descent scheme of the KKL divergence in the case of discrete distributions, and study empirically its properties to transport a set of points to a target distribution.</description>

      <title>The Smirnov Property for weighted Lebesgue spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.02470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish lower norm bounds for multivariate functions within weighted Lebesgue spaces, characterized by a summation of functions whose components solve a system of nonlinear integral equations. We elaborate on the Smirnov property, an integrability condition for the weights that guarantees the uniqueness of solutions to the system. In portfolio selection theory, the Smirnov property is crucial for the identification of a mean-variance optimal portfolio, composed of standard European Options on several underlying assets. We present sufficient conditions on weights to satisfy this property and provide counterexamples where either the Smirnov property does not hold or the uniqueness of solutions fails.</description>

      <title>The essential adjointness of pseudo-differential operators on $\mathbb{Z}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11216v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the setting of the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$ we consider a pseudo-differential operator $A$ whose symbol belongs to a class defined on $\mathbb{Z}^n\times \mathbb{T}^n$, where $\mathbb{T}^n$ is the $n$-torus. We realize $A$ as an operator acting between the discrete Sobolev spaces $H^{s_j}(\mathbb{Z}^n)$, $s_j\in\mathbb{R}$, $j=1,2$, with the discrete Schwartz space serving as the domain of $A$. We provide a sufficient condition for the essential adjointness of the pair $(A,\,A^{\dagger})$, where $A^{\dagger}$ is the formal adjoint of $A$.</description>

      <title>Reducing Isotropy and Volume to KLS: Faster Rounding and Volume Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.02146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the volume of a convex body in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ in the general membership oracle model can be computed to within relative error $\varepsilon$ using $\widetilde{O}(n^{3.5}\psi^{2} + n^3/\varepsilon^{2})$ oracle queries, where $\psi$ is the KLS constant. With the current bound of $\psi=\widetilde{O}(1)$, this gives an $\widetilde{O}(n^{3.5} + n^3/\varepsilon^{2})$ algorithm, improving on the Lov\'{a}sz-Vempala $\widetilde{O}(n^{4}/\varepsilon^{2})$ algorithm from 2003. The main new ingredient is an $\widetilde{O}(n^{3}\psi^{2})$ algorithm for isotropic transformation of a well-rounded convex body; we apply this iteratively to isotropicize a general convex body. Following this, we can apply the $\widetilde{O}(n^{3}/\varepsilon^{2})$ volume algorithm of Cousins and Vempala for well-rounded convex bodies. We also give an efficient implementation of the new algorithm for convex polytopes defined by $m$ inequalities in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$: polytope volume can be estimated in time $\widetilde{O}(mn^{c}/\varepsilon^{2})$ where $c&lt;3.7$ depends on the current matrix multiplication exponent and improves on the previous best bound.</description>

      <title>Local convergence rates for Wasserstein gradient flows and McKean-Vlasov equations with multiple stationary solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-linear versions of log-Sobolev inequalities, that link a free energy to its dissipation along the corresponding Wasserstein gradient flow (i.e. corresponds to Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequalities in this context), are known to provide global exponential long-time convergence to the free energy minimizers, and have been shown to hold in various contexts. However they cannot hold when the free energy admits critical points which are not global minimizers, which is for instance the case of the granular media equation in a double-well potential with quadratic attractive interaction at low temperature. This work addresses such cases, extending the general arguments when a log-Sobolev inequality only holds locally and, as an example, establishing such local inequalities for the granular media equation with quadratic interaction either in the one-dimensional symmetric double-well case or in higher dimension in the low temperature regime. The method provides quantitative convergence rates for initial conditions in a Wasserstein ball around the stationary solutions. The same analysis is carried out for the kinetic counterpart of the gradient flow, i.e. the corresponding Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. The local exponential convergence to stationary solutions for the mean-field equations, both elliptic and kinetic, is shown to induce for the corresponding particle systems a fast (i.e. uniform in the number or particles) decay of the particle system free energy toward the level of the non-linear limit.</description>
