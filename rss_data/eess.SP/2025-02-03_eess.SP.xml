      <title>Frequency Diverse Array OFDM System for Joint Communication and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequency-diverse array (FDA) offers a time-varying beamforming capability without the use of phase shifters. The autoscanning property is achieved by applying a frequency offset between the antennas. This paper analyzes the performance of an FDA joint communication and sensing system with the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation. The performance of the system is evaluated against the scanning frequency, number of antennas and number of subcarriers. The utilized metrics; integrated sidelobe level (ISL) and error vector magnitude (EVM) allow for straightforward comparison with a standard single-input single-output (SISO) OFDM system.</description>

      <title>Beamforming with Oversampled Time-Modulated Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-modulated array (TMA) is a simple array architecture in which each antenna is connected via a multi-throw switch. The switch acts as a modulator switching state faster than the symbol rate. The phase shifting and beamforming is achieved by a cyclic shift of the periodical modulating signal across antennas. In this paper, the TMA mode of operation is proposed to improve the resolution of a conventional phase shifter. The TMAs are analyzed under constrained switching frequency being a small multiple of the symbol rate. The presented generic signal model gives insight into the magnitude, phase and spacing of the harmonic components generated by the quantized modulating sequence. It is shown that the effective phase-shifting resolution can be improved multiplicatively by the oversampling factor ($O$) at the cost of introducing harmonics. Finally, the array tapering with an oversampled modulating signal is proposed. The oversampling provides $O+1$ uniformly distributed tapering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>SDM Optical Systems with MMSE Equalizers: Information Rates and Performance Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The information rate of coupled space-division multiplexing (SDM) transmission systems is impaired by the stochastic effects of mode-dependent gain (MDG) and mode-dependent loss (MDL), turning it into a random variable and reducing its average value. In systems operating with minimum mean squared error (MMSE) equalizers and no channel-state information (CSI), co-channel interference further reduces the instantaneous and average information rates. Analytical solutions for the average information rate in MDG- and MDL-impaired systems under strong coupling have been presented in early studies assuming ideal maximum-likelihood (ML) equalization. However, to the best of our knowledge, a solution encompassing co-channel interference under MMSE equalization has not been presented yet. In this work, we derive statistical models for the MMSE equalizer coefficients and develop analytical solutions for the post-filtering information rate. We also use these statistical models and analytical solutions to carry out MDG and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) monitoring in coupled SDM systems. The derived analytical solutions and monitoring techniques are validated by Monte-Carlo simulations, exhibiting a suitable accuracy within practical operational values.</description>

      <title>A General-Purpose Neuromorphic Sensor based on Spiketrum Algorithm: Hardware Details and Real-life Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically inspired computational paradigm, enabling energy-efficient data processing through spike-based information transmission. Despite notable advancements in hardware for SNNs, spike encoding has largely remained software-dependent, limiting efficiency. This paper addresses the need for adaptable and resource-efficient spike encoding hardware by presenting an area-optimized hardware implementation of the Spiketrum algorithm, which encodes time-varying analogue signals into spatiotemporal spike patterns. Unlike earlier performance-optimized designs, which prioritize speed, our approach focuses on reducing hardware footprint, achieving a 52% reduction in Block RAMs (BRAMs), 31% fewer Digital Signal Processing (DSP) slices, and a 6% decrease in Look-Up Tables (LUTs). The proposed implementation has been verified on an FPGA and successfully integrated into an IC using TSMC180 technology. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in real-world applications, including sound and ECG classification. This work highlights the trade-offs between performance and resource efficiency, offering a flexible, scalable solution for neuromorphic systems in power-sensitive applications like cochlear implants and neural devices.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communication System Based on Radio Frequency Resonance Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the challenge of complex beam control in traditional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, research has proposed establishing adaptive beam alignment by utilizing retro-directive antenna (RDA) arrays to create echo resonance between the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE), thereby reducing system computational load. However, in conventional resonant beam systems (RBS), the use of the same frequency for uplink and downlink inevitably leads to echo interference issues. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative design for an resonance beam-based integrated sensing and communication (RB-ISAC) system to achieve efficient passive sensing and bidirectional communication. In this system, the UE does not actively transmit signals but instead relies on a passive phase conjugation and frequency conversion structure to separate the uplink and downlink carrier frequencies. Additionally, through effective compensation for signal propagation loss, resonance is achieved after multiple iterations, at which point the beam's field distribution becomes a low-diffraction-loss, high-focusing pattern, automatically aligning the transmitter with the receiver. This enables high-precision passive positioning while facilitating uplink and downlink communication. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system can achieve resonance after multiple iterations, and can support uplink and downlink communication within a range of 5 meters while achieving passive direction of arrival (DOA) estimation with an error of less than 2 degrees.</description>

      <title>RIS Meets O-RAN: A Practical Demonstration of Multi-user RIS Optimization through RIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) along with artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud and edge networking, and virtualization are important enablers for designing flexible and software-driven programmable wireless networks. In addition, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) represent an innovative technology to direct incoming radio signals toward desired locations by software-controlled passive reflecting antenna elements. Despite their distinctive potential, there has been limited exploration of integrating RIS with the O-RAN framework, an area that holds promise for enhancing next-generation wireless systems. This paper addresses this gap by designing and developing the RIS optimization xApps within an O-RAN-based real-time 5G environment. We perform extensive measurement experiments using an end-to-end 5G testbed including the RIS prototype in a multi-user scenario. The results demonstrate that the RIS can be utilized either to boost the performance of the selected user or to provide the fairness among the users or to balance the tradeoff between the performance and fairness.</description>

      <title>Uplink Rate Splitting Multiple Access with Imperfect Channel State Information and Interference Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the performance of uplink rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) in a two-user scenario, addressing an under-explored domain compared to its downlink counterpart. With the increasing demand for uplink communication in applications like the Internet-of-Things, it is essential to account for practical imperfections, such as inaccuracies in channel state information at the receiver (CSIR) and limitations in successive interference cancellation (SIC), to provide realistic assessments of system performance. Specifically, we derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability, throughput, and asymptotic outage behavior of uplink users, considering imperfect CSIR and SIC. We validate the accuracy of these derived expressions using Monte Carlo simulations. Our findings reveal that at low transmit power levels, imperfect CSIR significantly affects system performance more severely than SIC imperfections. However, as the transmit power increases, the impact of imperfect CSIR diminishes, while the influence of SIC imperfections becomes more pronounced. Moreover, we highlight the impact of the rate allocation factor on user performance. Finally, our comparison with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) highlights the outage performance trade-offs between RSMA and NOMA. RSMA proves to be more effective in managing imperfect CSIR and enhances performance through strategic message splitting, resulting in more robust communication.</description>

      <title>An Integrated Sensing and Communications System Based on Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system based on affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) waveform. To this end, a metric set is designed according to not only the maximum tolerable delay/Doppler, but also the weighted spectral efficiency as well as the outage/error probability of sensing and communications. This enables the analytical investigation of the performance trade-offs of AFDM-ISAC system using the derived analytical relation among metrics and AFDM waveform parameters. Moreover, by revealing that delay and the integral/fractional parts of normalized Doppler can be decoupled in the affine Fourier transform-Doppler domain, an efficient estimation method is proposed for our AFDM-ISAC system, whose unambiguous Doppler can break through the limitation of subcarrier spacing. Theoretical analyses and numerical results verify that our proposed AFDM-ISAC system may significantly enlarge unambiguous delay/Doppler while possessing good spectral efficiency and peak-to-sidelobe level ratio in high-mobility scenarios.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Secure RIS-Enabled ISAC: Passive RIS vs. Active RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) communications standard is anticipated to provide integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) as a fundamental service. These ISAC systems present unique security challenges because of the exposure of information-bearing signals to sensing targets, enabling them to potentially eavesdrop on sensitive communication information with the assistance of sophisticated receivers. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have shown promising results in enhancing the physical layer security of various wireless communication systems, including ISAC. However, the performance of conventional passive RIS (pRIS)-enabled systems are often limited due to multiplicative fading, which can be alleviated using active RIS (aIRS). In this paper, we consider the problem of beampattern gain maximization in a secure pRIS/aRIS-enabled ISAC system, subject to signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio constraints at communication receivers, and information leakage constraints at an eavesdropping target. For the challenging non-convex problem of joint beamforming design at the base station and the pRIS/aRIS, we propose a novel successive convex approximation (SCA)-based method. Unlike the conventional alternating optimization (AO)-based methods, in the proposed SCA-based approach, all of the optimization variables are updated simultaneously in each iteration. The proposed method shows significant performance superiority for pRIS-aided ISAC system compared to a benchmark scheme using penalty-based AO method. Moreover, our simulation results also confirm that aRIS-aided system has a notably higher beampattern gain at the target compared to that offered by the pRIS-aided system for the same power budget. We also present a detailed complexity analysis and proof of convergence for the proposed SCA-based method.</description>

      <title>Learning Sheaf Laplacian Optimizing Restriction Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to propose a novel framework to infer the sheaf Laplacian, including the topology of a graph and the restriction maps, from a set of data observed over the nodes of a graph. The proposed method is based on sheaf theory, which represents an important generalization of graph signal processing. The learning problem aims to find the sheaf Laplacian that minimizes the total variation of the observed data, where the variation over each edge is also locally minimized by optimizing the associated restriction maps. Compared to alternative methods based on semidefinite programming, our solution is significantly more numerically efficient, as all its fundamental steps are resolved in closed form. The method is numerically tested on data consisting of vectors defined over subspaces of varying dimensions at each node. We demonstrate how the resulting graph is influenced by two key factors: the cross-correlation and the dimensionality difference of the data residing on the graph's nodes.</description>

      <title>Using gradient of Lagrangian function to compute efficient channels for the ideal observer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely accepted that the Bayesian ideal observer (IO) should be used to guide the objective assessment and optimization of medical imaging systems. The IO employs complete task-specific information to compute test statistics for making inference decisions and performs optimally in signal detection tasks. However, the IO test statistic typically depends non-linearly on the image data and cannot be analytically determined. The ideal linear observer, known as the Hotelling observer (HO), can sometimes be used as a surrogate for the IO. However, when image data are high dimensional, HO computation can be difficult. Efficient channels that can extract task-relevant features have been investigated to reduce the dimensionality of image data to approximate IO and HO performance. This work proposes a novel method for generating efficient channels by use of the gradient of a Lagrangian-based loss function that was designed to learn the HO. The generated channels are referred to as the Lagrangian-gradient (L-grad) channels. Numerical studies are conducted that consider binary signal detection tasks involving various backgrounds and signals. It is demonstrated that channelized HO (CHO) using L-grad channels can produce significantly better signal detection performance compared to the CHO using PLS channels. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed L-grad method can achieve significantly lower computation time compared to the PLS method.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Strategies for Parkinson Tremor Classification Using Wearable Sensor Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder requiring early and accurate diagnosis for effective management. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool to enhance PD classification and diagnostic accuracy, particularly by leveraging wearable sensor data. This survey comprehensively reviews current ML methodologies used in classifying Parkinsonian tremors, evaluating various tremor data acquisition methodologies, signal preprocessing techniques, and feature selection methods across time and frequency domains, highlighting practical approaches for tremor classification. The survey explores ML models utilized in existing studies, ranging from traditional methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests to advanced deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM). We assess the efficacy of these models in classifying tremor patterns associated with PD, considering their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we discuss challenges and discrepancies in current research and broader challenges in applying ML to PD diagnosis using wearable sensor data. We also outline future research directions to advance ML applications in PD diagnostics, providing insights for researchers and practitioners.</description>

      <title>Fully Distributed and Quantized Algorithm for MPC-based Autonomous Vehicle Platooning Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent transportation systems have recently emerged to address the growing interest for safer, more efficient, and sustainable transportation solutions. In this direction, this paper presents distributed algorithms for control and optimization over vehicular networks. First, we formulate the autonomous vehicle platooning framework based on model-predictive-control (MPC) strategies and present its objective optimization as a cooperative quadratic cost function. Then, we propose a distributed algorithm to locally optimize this objective at every vehicle subject to data quantization over the communication network of vehicles. In contrast to most existing literature that assumes ideal communication channels, log-scale data quantization over the network is addressed in this work, which is more realistic and practical. In particular, we show by simulation that the proposed log-quantized algorithm reaches optimal convergence with less residual and optimality gap. This outperforms the existing literature considering uniform quantization which leads to a large optimality gap and residual.</description>

      <title>Distributed Observer Design for Tracking Platoon of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) aim to advance innovative strategies relating to different modes of transport, traffic management, and autonomous vehicles. This paper studies the platoon of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) and proposes a distributed observer to track the state of the CAV dynamics. First, we model the CAV dynamics via an LTI interconnected system. Then, a consensus-based strategy is proposed to infer the state of the CAV dynamics based on local information exchange over the communication network of vehicles. A linear-matrix-inequality (LMI) technique is adopted for the block-diagonal observer gain design such that this gain is associated in a distributed way and locally to every vehicle. The distributed observer error dynamics is then shown to follow the structure of the Kronecker matrix product of the system dynamics and the adjacency matrix of the CAV network. The notions of survivable network design and redundant observer scheme are further discussed in the paper to address resilience to link and node failure. Finally, we verify our theoretical contributions via numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: This work considers a problem of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in which the goal of sensing is to detect a binary state. Unlike most approaches that minimize the total detection error probability, in our work, we disaggregate the error probability into false alarm and missed detection probabilities and investigate their information-theoretic three-way tradeoff including communication data rate. We consider a broadcast channel that consists of a transmitter, a communication receiver, and a detector where the receiver's and the detector's channels are affected by an unknown binary state. We consider and present results on two different state-dependent models. In the first setting, the state is fixed throughout the entire transmission, for which we fully characterize the optimal three-way tradeoff between the coding rate for communication and the two possibly nonidentical error exponents for sensing in the asymptotic regime. The achievability and converse proofs rely on the analysis of the cumulant-generating function of the log-likelihood ratio. In the second setting, the state changes every symbol in an independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) manner, for which we characterize the optimal tradeoff region based on the analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.</description>

      <title>Reliability Modeling for Beyond-5G Mission Critical Networks Using Effective Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate reliability modeling for ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) and hyper-reliable low latency communication (HRLLC) networks is challenging due to the complex interactions between network layers required to meet stringent requirements. In this paper, we propose such a model. We consider the acknowledged mode of the radio link control (RLC) layer, utilizing separate buffers for transmissions and retransmissions, along with the behavior of physical channels. Our approach leverages the effective capacity (EC) framework, which quantifies the maximum constant arrival rate a time-varying wireless channel can support while meeting statistical quality of service (QoS) constraints. We derive a reliability model that incorporates delay violations, various latency components, and multiple transmission attempts. Our method identifies optimal operating conditions that satisfy URLLC/HRLLC constraints while maintaining near-optimal EC, ensuring the system can handle peak traffic with a guaranteed QoS. Our model reveals critical trade-offs between EC and reliability across various use cases, providing guidance for URLLC/HRLLC network design for service providers and system designers.</description>

      <title>Language Bias in Self-Supervised Learning For Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is used in deep learning to train on large datasets without the need for expensive labelling of the data. Recently, large Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models such as XLS-R have utilised SSL to train on over one hundred different languages simultaneously. However, deeper investigation shows that the bulk of the training data for XLS-R comes from a small number of languages. Biases learned through SSL have been shown to exist in multiple domains, but language bias in multilingual SSL ASR has not been thoroughly examined. In this paper, we utilise the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) to identify language-specific subnetworks within XLS-R and test the performance of these subnetworks on a variety of different languages. We are able to show that when fine-tuning, XLS-R bypasses traditional linguistic knowledge and builds only on weights learned from the languages with the largest data contribution to the pretraining data.</description>

      <title>Multi-Frame Blind Manifold Deconvolution for Rotating Synthetic Aperture Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotating synthetic aperture (RSA) imaging system captures images of the target scene at different rotation angles by rotating a rectangular aperture. Deblurring acquired RSA images plays a critical role in reconstructing a latent sharp image underlying the scene. In the past decade, the emergence of blind convolution technology has revolutionised this field by its ability to model complex features from acquired images. Most of the existing methods attempt to solve the above ill-posed inverse problem through maximising a posterior.
  Despite this progress, researchers have paid limited attention to exploring low-dimensional manifold structures of the latent image within a high-dimensional ambient-space. Here, we propose a novel method to process RSA images using manifold fitting and penalisation in the content of multi-frame blind convolution. We develop fast algorithms for implementing the proposed procedure. Simulation studies demonstrate that manifold-based deconvolution can outperform conventional deconvolution algorithms in the sense that it can generate a sharper estimate of the latent image in terms of estimating pixel intensities and preserving structural details.</description>

      <title>Leveraging power of deep learning for fast and efficient elite pixel selection in time series SAR interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a new convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) based architecture for selection of elite pixels (i.e., less noisy) in time series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (TS-InSAR). The model utilizes the spatial and temporal relation among neighboring pixels to identify both persistent and distributed scatterers. We trained the model on ~20,000 training images (interferograms), each of size 100 by 100 pixels, extracted from InSAR time series interferograms containing both artificial features (buildings and infrastructure) and objects of natural environment (vegetation, forests, barren or agricultural land, water bodies). Based on such categorization, we developed two models, tailormade to detect elite pixels in urban and coastal sites. Training labels were generated from elite pixel selection outputs generated from the wavelet-based InSAR (WabInSAR) software. We used 4 urban and 7 coastal sites for training and validation respectively, and the predicted elite pixel selection maps reveal that the proposed models efficiently learn from WabInSAR-generated labels, reaching a test accuracy of 94%. The models accurately discard pixels affected by geometric and temporal decorrelation while selecting pixels corresponding to urban objects and those with stable phase history unaffected by temporal and geometric decorrelation. The density of pixels in urban areas is comparable to and higher for coastal areas than WabInSAR outputs. With significantly reduced time computation (order of minutes) and improved density of elite pixels, the proposed models can efficiently process long InSAR time series stacks and generate deformation maps quickly, making the time series InSAR technique more suitable for varied (non-urban and urban) terrains and unaddressed land deformation applications.</description>

      <title>Novel Synchronization Scheme for Cooperative ISAC Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carrier frequency and timing synchronization play the fundamental roles in cooperative integrating communication and sensing (ISAC). To mitigate the effects of synchronization error, this paper develops a novel synchronization scheme in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems. First, we characterize the impacts of pilot contamination on synchronization performance, i.e., Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). Furthermore, a maximum likelihood algorithm is presented to estimate the CFO and TO among the pairing APs. Then, to minimize the sum of CRBs, we devise a synchronization strategy based on a pilot-sharing scheme by jointly optimizing the cluster classification, synchronization overhead, and pilot-sharing scheme, while simultaneously considering the overhead and each AP's synchronization requirements. To solve this NP-hard problem, we simplify it into two sub-problems, namely cluster classification problem and the pilot sharing problem. To strike a balance between synchronization performance and overhead, we first classify the clusters by using the K-means algorithm, and propose a criteria to find a good set of master APs. Then, the pilot-sharing scheme is obtained by using the swap-matching operations. Simulation results validate the accuracy of our derivations and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme over the benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming Design and Bit Allocation in Massive MIMO with Resolution-Adaptive ADCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) have emerged as a promising technology for reducing power consumption and complexity in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems while maintaining satisfactory spectral and energy efficiencies (SE/EE). In this work, we first identify the essential properties of optimal quantization and leverage them to derive a closed-form approximation of the covariance matrix of the quantization distortion. The theoretical finding facilitates the system SE analysis in the presence of low-resolution ADCs. We then focus on the joint optimization of the transmit-receive beamforming and bit allocation to maximize the SE under constraints on the transmit power and the total number of active ADC bits. To solve the resulting mixed-integer problem, we first develop an efficient beamforming design for fixed ADC resolutions. Then, we propose a low-complexity heuristic algorithm to iteratively optimize the ADC resolutions and beamforming matrices. Numerical results for a $64 \times 64$ MIMO system demonstrate that the proposed design offers $6\%$ improvement in both SE and EE with $40\%$ fewer active ADC bits compared with the uniform bit allocation. Furthermore, we numerically show that receiving more data streams with low-resolution ADCs can achieve higher SE and EE compared to receiving fewer data streams with high-resolution ADCs.</description>

Abstract: Multimodal language modeling has enabled breakthroughs for representation learning, yet remains unexplored in the realm of functional brain data for pathology detection. This paper pioneers EEG-language models (ELMs) trained on clinical reports and 15000 EEGs. We propose to combine multimodal alignment in this novel domain with timeseries cropping and text segmentation, enabling an extension based on multiple instance learning to alleviate misalignment between irrelevant EEG or text segments. Our multimodal models significantly improve pathology detection compared to EEG-only models across four evaluations and for the first time enable zero-shot classification as well as retrieval of both neural signals and reports. In sum, these results highlight the potential of ELMs, representing significant progress for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Trade-offs in Quantized Hybrid Radar Fusion: A CRB-Rate Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While recent advancements have highlighted the role of low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, the specific impact of ADC resolution on hybrid radar fusion (HRF), where we fuse monostatic and bistatic sensing systems remains relatively unexplored. The uplink (UL) paths in HRF, comprising both direct and reflected signals within the same frequency band, pose unique challenges, particularly given that the reflected signal is often significantly weaker than the direct path, making HRF systems susceptible to ADC resolution. To investigate the influence of quantization and ADC resolution on HRF, we employ the quantized Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) as a metric for sensing accuracy. This work derives the quantized CRB specifically for HRF systems and the quantized communication rate. We extend our analysis to obtain lower bounds on the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and UL communication rate, which we use to characterize quantized HRF systems. Using these derived bounds, we analyze the quantized HRF system through the lens of CRB-rate boundaries. We obtain the CRB-rate boundary through two optimization problems, where each solution point represents a trade-off boundary between the sensing accuracy and the communication rate. Extensive simulations illustrate the influence of ADC resolution, dynamic range (DR), and various system parameters on the CRB-rate boundary of HRF systems. These results offer critical insights into the design of efficient and high-performance HRF systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the uplink of a grant-free cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (GF-CF-MaMIMO) system. We propose an algorithm for distributed joint activity detection, channel estimation, and data detection (JACD) based on expectation propagation (EP) called JACD-EP. We develop the algorithm by factorizing the a posteriori probability (APP) of activities, channels, and transmitted data, then, mapping functions and variables onto a factor graph, and finally, performing a message passing on the resulting factor graph. If users with the same pilot sequence are sufficiently distant from each other, the JACD-EP algorithm is able to mitigate the effects of pilot contamination which naturally occurs in grant-free systems due to the large number of potential users and limited signaling resources. Furthermore, it outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for JACD in GF-CF-MaMIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Wearable Accelerometer Foundation Models for Health via Knowledge Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern wearable devices can conveniently record various biosignals in the many different environments of daily living, enabling a rich view of individual health. However, not all biosignals are the same: high-fidelity biosignals, such as photoplethysmogram (PPG), contain more physiological information, but require optical sensors with a high power footprint. Alternatively, a lower-fidelity biosignal such as accelerometry has a significantly smaller power footprint and is available in almost any wearable device. While accelerometry is widely used for activity recognition and fitness, it is less explored for health biomarkers and diagnosis. Here, we show that an accelerometry foundation model can predict a wide variety of health targets. To achieve improved performance, we distill representational knowledge from PPG encoders to accelerometery encoders using 20 million minutes of unlabeled data, collected from ~172K participants in the Apple Heart and Movement Study under informed consent. We observe strong cross-modal alignment on unseen data, e.g., 99.2% top-1 accuracy for retrieving PPG embeddings from accelerometry embeddings. We show that distilled accelerometry encoders have significantly more informative representations compared to self-supervised or supervised encoders trained directly on accelerometry data, observed by at least 23%-49% improved performance for predicting heart rate and heart rate variability. We also show that distilled accelerometry encoders are readily predictive of a wide array of downstream health targets, i.e., they are generalist foundation models. We believe accelerometry foundation models for health may unlock new opportunities for developing digital biomarkers from any wearable device.</description>

      <title>Multiple testing in multi-stream sequential change detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04130v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-stream sequential change detection involves simultaneously monitoring many streams of data and trying to detect when their distributions change, if at all. Here, we theoretically study multiple testing issues that arise from detecting changes in many streams. We point out that any algorithm with finite average run length (ARL) must have a trivial worst-case false detection rate (FDR), family-wise error rate (FWER), per-family error rate (PFER), and global error rate (GER); thus, any attempt to control these Type I error metrics is fundamentally in conflict with the desire for a finite ARL (which is typically necessary in order to have a small detection delay). One of our contributions is to define a new class of metrics which can be controlled, called error over patience (EOP). We propose algorithms that combine the recent e-detector framework (which generalizes the Shiryaev-Roberts and CUSUM methods) with the recent e-Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and e-Bonferroni procedures. We prove that these algorithms control the EOP at any desired level under very general dependence structures on the data within and across the streams. In fact, we prove a more general error control that holds uniformly over all stopping times and provides a smooth trade-off between the conflicting metrics. Additionally, if finiteness of the ARL is forfeited, we show that our algorithms control the worst-case Type I error.</description>

      <title>UAV-Assisted MEC Architecture for Collaborative Task Offloading in Urban IoT Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising technology to meet the increasing demands and computing limitations of complex Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, implementing MEC in urban environments can be challenging due to factors like high device density, complex infrastructure, and limited network coverage. Network congestion and connectivity issues can adversely affect user satisfaction. Hence, in this article, we use unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted collaborative MEC architecture to facilitate task offloading of IoT devices in urban environments. We utilize the combined capabilities of UAVs and ground edge servers (ESs) to maximize user satisfaction and thereby also maximize the service provider's (SP) profit. We design IoT task-offloading as joint IoT-UAV-ES association and UAV-network topology optimization problem. Due to NP-hard nature, we break the problem into two subproblems: offload strategy optimization and UAV topology optimization. We develop a Three-sided Matching with Size and Cyclic preference (TMSC) based task offloading algorithm to find stable association between IoTs, UAVs, and ESs to achieve system objective. We also propose a K-means based iterative algorithm to decide the minimum number of UAVs and their positions to provide offloading services to maximum IoTs in the system. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed task offloading scheme over benchmark schemes through simulation-based evaluation. The proposed scheme outperforms by 19%, 12%, and 25% on average in terms of percentage of served IoTs, average user satisfaction, and SP profit, respectively, with 25% lesser UAVs, making it an effective solution to support IoT task requirements in urban environments using UAV-assisted MEC architecture.</description>
