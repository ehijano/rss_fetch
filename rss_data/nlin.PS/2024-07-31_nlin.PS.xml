      <title>Solitary Waves and Interacting Longons in Galerkin-truncated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compacton, peakon, and Burgers-Hopf equations regularized by the Galerkin truncation preserving finite Fourier modes are found to support new travelling waves and interacting solitonic structures amidst weaker less-ordered components (`longons'). Different perspectives focusing on the zero-Hamiltonian solitonic, chaotic-looking, and stationary longons are also offered.</description>

      <title>Interplay between local and global order controls bifurcations in nonreciprocal systems without a conservation law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the generic bifurcation behavior of local and global order in short-range interacting nonreciprocal lattice systems without conservation laws. We show that a critical magnitude of nearest-neighbor correlations within the respective lattices controls the emergence of coherent oscillations of global order as a result of frustration. Local order is maintained during these oscillations, implying non-trivial spatio-temporal correlations. Ghost states emerge in the strong-interaction regime. The residence time in either of these states eventually diverges, giving rise to ordered non-equilibrium steady states via a saddle-node-infinite-period bifurcation. Our work provides a comprehensive microscopic understanding of collective phenomena in nonreciprocal matter without conservation laws, which may be relevant e.g. for understanding enzyme clustering.</description>

      <title>Strongly Nonlinear Wave Propagation in Elasto-plastic Metamaterials: Low-order Dynamic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear elastic metamaterials are known to support a variety of dynamic phenomena that enhance our capacity to manipulate elastic waves. Since these properties stem from complex, subwavelength geometry, full-scale dynamic simulations are often prohibitively expensive at scales of interest. Prior studies have therefore utilized low-order effective medium models, such as discrete mass-spring lattices, to capture essential properties in the long-wavelength limit. While models of this type have been successfully implemented for a wide variety of nonlinear elastic systems, they have predominantly considered dynamics depending only on the instantaneous kinematics of the lattice, neglecting history-dependent effects, such as wear and plasticity. To address this limitation, the present study develops a lattice-based modeling framework for nonlinear elastic metamaterials undergoing plastic deformation. Due to the history- and rate-dependent nature of plasticity, the framework generally yields a system of differential-algebraic equations whose computational cost is significantly greater than an elastic system of comparable size. We demonstrate the method using several models inspired by classical lattice dynamics and continuum plasticity theory, and explore means to obtain empirical plasticity models for general geometries.</description>

      <title>Normal dispersion Kerr cavity solitons: beyond the mean field limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict the existence of a novel type of temporal localized structure in injected Kerr-Gires-Tournois interferometers. These bright pulses exist in the normal dispersion regime, yet they do not correspond to the usual scenario of domain wall locking that induces complex shape multi-stability, weak stability as well as a reduced domain of existence. The new states are observed beyond the mean-field limit and out of the bistable region. Their shape is uniquely defined, with peak intensities beyond that of the upper steady state, and they are stable over a broad range of the injection field, highlighting their potential for optical frequency comb generation.</description>

      <title>Canard cascading in networks with adaptive mean-field coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Canard cascading (CC) is observed in dynamical networks with global adaptive coupling. It is a fast-slow phenomenon characterized by a recurrent sequence of fast transitions between distinct and slowly evolving quasi-stationary states. In this letter, we uncover the dynamical mechanisms behind CC, using an illustrative example of globally and adaptively coupled semiconductor lasers, where CC represents sequential switching on and off the lasers. Firstly, we show that CC is a robust and truly adaptive network effect that is scalable with network size and does not occur without adaptation. Secondly, we uncover multiple saddle slow manifolds (unstable quasi-stationary states) linked by heteroclinic orbits (fast transitions) in the phase space of the system. This allows us to identify CC with a novel heteroclinic canard orbit that organises different unstable quasi-stationary states into an intricate fast-slow limit cycle. Although individual quasi-stationary states are unstable (saddles), the CC cycle as a whole is attractive and robust to parameter changes.</description>

      <title>Breakthrough-Induced Loop Formation in Evolving Transport Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08878v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transport networks, such as vasculature or river networks, provide key functions in organisms and the environment. They usually contain loops whose significance for the stability and robustness of the network is well documented. However, the dynamics of their formation is usually not considered. Such structures often grow in response to the gradient of an external field. During evolution, extending branches compete for the available flux of the field, which leads to effective repulsion between them and screening of the shorter ones. Yet, in remarkably diverse processes, from unstable fluid flows to the canal system of jellyfish, loops suddenly form near the breakthrough when the longest branch reaches the boundary of the system. We provide a physical explanation for this universal behavior. Using a 1D model, we explain that the appearance of effective attractive forces results from the field drop inside the leading finger as it approaches the outlet. Furthermore, we numerically study the interactions between two fingers, including screening in the system and its disappearance near the breakthrough. Finally, we perform simulations of the temporal evolution of the fingers to show how revival and attraction to the longest finger leads to dynamic loop formation. We compare the simulations to the experiments and find that the dynamics of the shorter finger are well reproduced. Our results demonstrate that reconnection is a prevalent phenomenon in systems driven by diffusive fluxes, occurring both when the ratio of the mobility inside the growing structure to the mobility outside is low and near the breakthrough.</description>
