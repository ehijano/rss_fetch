      <title>Discrepancies between spectroscopy and HST photometry in tagging multiple stellar populations in 22 globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple populations (MPs) in globular clusters (GCs) are stars distinct by their abundances of light elements. The MPs can be directly separated by measuring abundances of C, N, O, Na, Al, Mg with spectroscopy or indirectly from photometric sequences created by the impact of different chemistry on band passes of particular filters, such as the HST pseudo-colours in the ultraviolet. An attempt to link HST pseudo-colours maps (PCMs) and spectroscopy was done by Marino et al. (2019), using abundances mostly from our FLAMES survey. However, we uncovered that an incomplete census of stars in common was used in their population tagging. We correct the situation by building our own PCMs and matching them with our abundances in 20 GCs, plus two GCs from other sources, doubling the sample with spectroscopic abundances available. We found that the pseudo-colour (magF275W-2*magF336W+magF438W) does not have a monotonic trend with Na abundances, enhanced by proton-capture reactions in MPs. Moreover, on average about 16% of stars with spectroscopic Na abundances show a discrepant tagging of MPs with respect to the HST photometry. Stars with chemistry of second generation (SG) are mistaken for first generation (FG) objects according to HST photometry and vice versa. In general, photometric indices tend to overestimate the fraction of FG stars, in particular in low mass GCs. We offer a simple explanation for these findings. Finally, we publish all our PCMs, with more than 31,800 stars in 22 GCs, with star ID and coordinates, for easy check and reproduction, as it should be in science papers.</description>

      <title>High-velocity blue-shifted Fe XXV He$\alpha$ line during a superflare of the RS CVn-type star IM Peg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) detected a superflare, releasing $5\times 10^{37}$ erg in 2$-$10 keV, of the RS CVn-type star IM Peg at 10:41 UT on 2023 July 23 with its Gas Slit Camera (GSC; 2$-$30 keV). We conducted X-ray follow-up observations of the superflare with Neutron Star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER; 0.2$-$12 keV) starting at 16:52 UT on July 23 until 06:00 UT on August 2. NICER X-ray spectra clearly showed emission lines of the Fe XXV He$\alpha$ and Fe XXVI Ly$\alpha$ for $\sim 1.5$ days since the MAXI detection. The Fe XXV He$\alpha$ line was blue-shifted with its maximum Doppler velocity reaching $-2200 \pm 600$ $\mathrm{km \: s^{-1}}$, suggesting an upward-moving plasma during the flare, such as a coronal mass ejection (CME) and/or chromospheric evaporation. This is the first case that the Fe XXV He$\alpha$ line is blue-shifted during a stellar flare and its velocity overwhelmingly exceeds the escape velocity of the star ($-230$ $\mathrm{km \: s^{-1}}$). One hour before the most pronounced blueshift detection, a signature of reheating the flare plasma was observed. We discuss the origin of the blueshift, a CME or high-velocity chromospheric evaporation.</description>

      <title>Determination method of binary fractions by the integrated spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We need to resolve the individual stars for binary fraction determinations of stellar systems. Therefore, it is not possible to obtain the binary fractions for dense or distant stellar systems. % We proposed a method to determine the binary fraction of a dense or distant stellar system. The method is to first determine the binary fraction variation for any two adjacent regions and then add up those binary fraction variations along the radial direction to obtain the binary fraction for a stellar system. Binary fraction variation is derived by using ten binary fraction-sensitive spectral absorption feature indices (SAFIs) and the binary fraction variation calibrations in terms of these SAFIs. Using this method, we first presented the binary fraction variations for twenty-one Galactic globular clusters (GCs). By comparisons, we find that they agree well with the binary fractions based on the main-sequence fiducial line method by previous studies. This verifies that the above mentioned method is feasible. Next, we presented the binary fraction variations of thirteen Galactic GCs. We gave the relationships between binary fraction and various parameters, and found that binary fraction is negatively correlated with NHB and NRR, binary fraction of some studies is not strongly correlated with NBS, and the number of GCs with large binary fraction is greater at extreme blue horizontal branch population ratio. At last, if we want to obtain more accurate binary fraction, we suggest that the spectroscopic and photometric observations are conducted at an appropriate area interval for a stellar system.</description>

      <title>The Gaia-ESO Survey: No sign of multiple stellar populations in open clusters from their sodium and oxygen abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The light element (anti-)correlations shown by globular clusters (GCs) are the main spectroscopic signature of multiple stellar populations. These internal abundance variations provide us with fundamental constraints on the formation mechanism of stellar clusters. Aims: Using Gaia-ESO, the largest and most homogeneous survey of open clusters (OCs), we intend to check whether these stellar aggregates display the same patterns. Based on previous studies of many GCs, several young and massive clusters in the Magellanic Clouds, as well as a few OCs, we do not expect to find any anti-correlation, given the low mass of Milky Way OCs. Methods: We used the results based on UVES spectra of stars in Gaia-ESO to derive the distribution of Na and O abundances and seevwhether they show an unexplained dispersion or whether they are anti-correlated. By selecting only high-probability members with high-precision stellar parameters, we ended up with more than 700 stars in 74 OCs. We examined the O-Na distribution in 28 OCsvwith at least 4 stars available as well as the Na distribution in 24 OCs, with at least 10 stars available. Results: We find that the distribution of Na abundances is compatible with a single-value population, within the errors. The fewvapparent exceptions can be explained by differences in the evolutionary phase (main sequence and giant post first dredge-up episode) or by difficulties in analysing low gravity giants. We did not find any indication of an Na-O anti-correlation in any of the clusters for which O has been derived. Conclusions: Based on the very small spread we find, OCs maintain the status of single stellar populations. However, a definitive answer requires studying more elements and larger samples covering different evolutionary phases. This will be possible with the next generation of large surveys</description>

      <title>The evolution of coronal shock wave properties and their relation with solar energetic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shock waves driven by fast and wide coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are highly efficient particle accelerators involved in the production of solar energetic particle (SEP) events. The gradual SEP event measured by STEREO-A and B on October 11, 2013 had notable properties: (1) it occurred in isolation with very low background particle intensities, (2) it had a clear onset of SEPs measured in situ allowing detailed timing analyses, and (3) it was associated with a fast CME event magnetically connected with STA and B. These allowed us to investigate the temporal connection between the rapidly evolving shock properties, such as compression ratio, Mach number and geometry, and the intensity and composition of SEPs measured in situ. We use shock reconstruction techniques and multi-viewpoint imaging data from STA and B, SOHO, and SDO spacecraft to determine the kinematic evolution of the expanding shock wave. Using 3D magneto-hydrodynamic modelling we obtained shock wave properties along an ensemble of magnetic field lines connected to STA and B, estimating their uncertainties. Using a velocity dispersion analysis of the SEP data, we time shift the SEP time series and analyze the relations between their properties and the modeled shock ones, as well as the energy dependence of these relations. We find a very good temporal agreement between the formation of the modelled shock wave and the estimated release times for both electrons and protons. This simultaneous release suggests a common acceleration process. This early phase is marked at both STEREOs by elevated electron-to-proton ratios that coincide with the highly quasi-perpendicular phase of the shock, suggesting that the rapid evolution of the shock as it transits from the low to the high corona modifies the conditions under which particles are accelerated. We discuss these findings in terms of basic geometry and acceleration processes.</description>

      <title>A portrait of the rotation of Ultra-Cool Dwarfs revealed by TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the results of a search for rotation signature in 250 Gaia DR3 Ultra-Cool Dwarfs (UCDs) with TESS light curves. We identified 71 targets with unambiguous periodicities, of which 61 present rotation signatures and a single source behavior, with periods between 0.133 and 5.81 days. Five UCDs show double-dip features, namely variations with two periods, one approximately double or half the other. The remaining ten UCDs with unambiguous variability present a likely non-single behavior. We also found 20 UCDs showing complex behavior in their light curves, with noticeable fluctuations and irregular structure, with a few exhibiting apparent changes in their temporal structure. The remaining 159 targets show noisy light curves corresponding to low-amplitude signals, whose temporal variation cannot be easily identified. The distribution of the UCDs with rotation signature in the CMD diagram points to a lack of rotating objects within about $11.5&lt;M_{G}&lt;12.5$ and $G-G_{RP}&lt;1.5$ separating them into two regimes, one mainly composed of less massive late-M stars with $P_{rot} \geq 1.0$ d, and another mainly composed of more massive early-M stars with $P_{rot}&lt;1.0$ d. It is important to emphasize that by separating stars into age intervals, one observes that UCDs with $P_{rot} \geq 1.0$ d tend to be located in regions of younger objects, and, in contrast, those with $P_{rot}&lt;1.0$ d are mainly concentrated in regions of older objects. Whether these trends of stars contrasting the sample separation is physical or produced by observational biases is a question to be verified in future studies.</description>

      <title>A search for Galactic post-AGB stars in Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. When low and intermediate-mass stars leave the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase, and before they reach the Planetary Nebulae stage, they enter a very brief and rather puzzling stellar evolutionary stage named post-AGB.
  Aims. To provide a reliable catalogue of galactic post-AGB stars together with their physical and evolutionary properties obtained through Gaia DR3 astrometry and photometry.
  Methods. We started by identifying post-AGB stars or possible candidates from the bibliography with their Gaia DR3 counterpart sources. Using the available photometry, interstellar extinction, literature spectroscopically derived temperatures or spectral types and parallax-derived distances from Gaia DR3, we fitted their Spectral Energy Distributions and we estimated their luminosities and circumstellar extinctions. When compared to models, luminosity values allowed us to disclose objects that are likely post-AGB stars from other target types. Their position on the HR diagram allows direct comparison with updated post-AGB evolutionary tracks and an estimation of their masses and evolutionary ages.
  Results. We obtained a sample of 69 reliable post-AGB candidates that meet our classification criteria, providing their coordinates, distances, effective temperature, total extinction, luminosity, mass, and evolutionary age. In addition, similar data for other stellar objects in our initial compilation, such as supergiant stars or young stellar objects, is provided.
  Conclusions. We have filtered out the data that have the best precision in parallaxes and distances to obtain more accurate luminosities, which allows us to classify with confidence the objects of the sample among different stellar phases. This allows us to provide a small but reliable sample of post-AGB objects. Derived mean evolutionary time and average mass values are in agreement with theoretical expectations.</description>

      <title>Searching for gravitational waves from stellar-mass binary black holes early inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early inspiral from stellar-mass binary black holes can emit milli-Hertz gravitational wave signals, making them detectable sources for space-borne gravitational wave missions like TianQin. However, the traditional matched filtering technique poses a significant challenge for analyzing this kind of signals, as it requires an impractically high number of templates ranging from $10^{31}$ to $10^{40}$. We propose a search strategy that involves two main parts: initially, we reduce the dimensionality of the simulated signals using incremental principal component analysis (IPCA). Subsequently we train the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on the compressed TianQin data obtained from IPCA, aiming to develop both a detection model and a point parameter estimation model. The compression efficiency for the trained IPCA model achieves a cumulative variance ratio of 95.6% when applied to $10^6$ simulated signals. To evaluate the performance of CNN we generate the receiver operating characteristic curve for the detection model which is applied to the test data with varying signal-to-noise ratios. At a false alarm probability of 5% the corresponding true alarm probability for signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50 is 86.5%. Subsequently, we introduce the point estimation model to evaluate the value of the chirp mass of corresponding sBBH signals with an error. For signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50, the trained point estimation CNN model can estimate the chirp mass of most test events, with a standard deviation error of 2.48 $M_{\odot}$ and a relative error precision of 0.12.</description>

      <title>Searching for rapid pulsations in solar flare X-ray data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most studies of quasi-periodic pulsations in solar flares have identified characteristic periods in the 5 - 300s range. Due to observational limitations there have been few attempts to probe the &lt; 5s period regime and understand the prevalence of such short-period quasi-periodic pulsations. However, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) has observed approximately 1500 solar flares to date in high cadence 16 Hz burst mode, providing us with an opportunity to study short-period quasi-periodic pulsations at X-ray energies. We systematically analyse every solar flare observed by Fermi/GBM in burst mode, estimating the prevalence of quasi-periodic pulsations in multiple X-ray energy bands. To better understand these results, we complement this with analysis of synthetic solar flare lightcurves, both with and without oscillatory signals present. Using these synthetic lightcurves, we can understand the likely false alarm and true positive rates in the real solar GBM data. We do not find strong evidence for widespread short-period quasi-periodic pulsations, indicating either a low base occurrence rate of such signatures or that their typical signal-to-noise ratios must be low - less than 1 - in Fermi/GBM data. Finally, we present a selection of the most interesting potential quasi-periodic pulsation events that were identified in the GBM solar X-ray data.</description>

      <title>Transition from decaying to decayless kink oscillations of solar coronal loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition of an impulsively excited kink oscillation of a solar coronal loop to an oscillation with a stationary amplitude, i.e., the damping pattern, is determined using the low-dimensional self-oscillation model. In the model, the decayless kink oscillations are sustained by the interaction of the oscillating loop with an external quasi-steady flow. The analytical solution is based on the assumption that the combined effect of the effective dissipation, for example, by resonant absorption, and interaction with an external flow, is weak. The effect is characterised by a dimensionless coupling parameter. The damping pattern is found to depend upon the initial amplitude and the coupling parameter. The approximate expression shows a good agreement with a numerical solution of the self-oscillation equation. The plausibility of the established damping pattern is demonstrated by an observational example. Notably, the damping pattern is not exponential, and the characteristic decay time is different from the time determined by the traditionally used exponential damping fit. Implications of this finding for seismology of the solar coronal plasmas are discussed. In particular, it is suggested that a very rapid, in less than the oscillation period, decay of the oscillation to the stationary level, achieved for larger values of the coupling parameter, can explain the relative rareness of the kink oscillation events.</description>

      <title>Foam: A Python package for forward asteroseismic modelling of gravity modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asteroseismology, the study of stellar pulsations, offers insights into the internal structures and evolution of stars. Analysing the variations in a star's brightness allows the determination of fundamental properties such as mass, radius, age, and chemical composition. Asteroseismology heavily relies on computational tools, but a significant number of them are closed-source, thus inaccessible to the broader astronomic community. This manuscript presents Foam, a Python package designed to perform forward asteroseismic modelling of stars exhibiting gravity modes. It automates and streamlines a considerable fraction of the modelling process, comparing grids of theoretical stellar models and their oscillation frequencies to observed frequency sets in stars. Foam offers the flexibility to employ diverse modelling approaches, allowing users to choose different methodologies for matching theoretically predicted oscillations to observations. It provides options to utilise various sets of observables for comparison with their theoretical counterparts, employ different merit functions for assessing goodness of fit, and to incorporate nested subgrids in a statistically rigorous manner. For applications of these methodologies in modelling observed gravity modes, refer to Michielsen et al. (2021) and Michielsen et al. (2023).</description>

      <title>The largest metallicity difference in twin systems: high-precision abundance analysis of the benchmark pair Krios &amp; Kronos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims.We conduct a high-precision differential abundance analysis of the remarkable binary system HD 240429/30 (Krios and Kronos, respectively), whose difference in metallicity is one of the highest detected in systems with similar components to date (approximately 0.20 dex). A condensation temperature TC trend study was performed to search for possible chemical signatures of planet formation. In addition, other potential scenarios have been proposed to explain this disparity. Methods. Fundamental atmospheric parameters (Te f f , log g, [Fe/H], vturb) were calculated using the latest version of the FUNDPAR code employing high resolution MAROON-X spectra. We applied a full line-by-line differential technique to measure the abundances of 26 elements in both stars with equivalent widths and spectral synthesis taking advantage of the non-solar scaled opacities. Results.We found a difference in metallicity of approximately 0.230 dex, being Kronos more metal rich than Krios. The analysis encompassed the examination of the diffusion effect and primordial chemical differences, concluding that the observed chemical discrepancies in the binary system cannot be solely attributed to any of these processes. The results also shown a noticeable excess of Li by approximately 0.56 dex in Kronos, and an enhancement of refractories with respect to Krios. A photometric study with TESS data was carried out, without finding any signal of possible transiting planets around the stars. Several potential planet formation scenarios were also explored to account for the observed excess in both metallicity and lithium in Kronos. Planetary engulfment is a plausible explanation, considering the ingestion of an exceptionally large mass, approximately approximately 27.8M_Earth, but no scenario is definitively ruled out.</description>

      <title>Detailed chemical abundances of the globular cluster Terzan 6 in the inner bulge</title>

Abstract: We used near-infrared spectroscopy at medium-high resolution (R=8,000$-$25,000) to perform the first comprehensive chemical study of the intermediate luminosity bulge globular cluster Terzan~6. We derived detailed abundances and abundance patterns of 27 giant stars, likely members of Terzan~6, based on their accurate Hubble Space Telescope proper motions and line-of-sight radial velocities. From the spectral analysis of these stars, we determined an average heliocentric radial velocity of 143.3$\pm$1.0 km s$^{-1}$ with a velocity dispersion of 5.1$\pm$0.7 km s$^{-1}$ and an average [Fe/H]=$-0.65\pm0.01$ and a low 1$\sigma$ dispersion of 0.03 dex. We also measured some depletion of [Mn/Fe] with respect to the solar-scaled values and enhancement of for [Ca/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [O/Fe], [Al/Fe], [Na/Fe], and, to a lower extent, for [K/Fe], consistent with previous measurements of other bulge globular clusters and favoring the scenario of a rapid bulge formation and chemical enrichment. Some spread in the light element abundances suggest the presence of first- and second-generation stars, typical of genuine globulars. Finally, we measured some depletion of carbon and low $\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$ isotopic ratios, as in previous studies of field and cluster bulge giants, indicating that extra-mixing mechanisms should be at work during the post main sequence evolution in the high metallicity regime as well.</description>

      <title>Global Coronal Plasma Diagnostics Based on Multi-slit EUV Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Full-disk spectroscopic observations of the solar corona are highly desired to forecast solar eruptions and their impact on planets and to uncover the origin of solar wind. In this paper, we introduce a new multi-slit design (5 slits) to obtain extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectra simultaneously. The selected spectrometer wavelength range (184-197 \r{A}) contains several bright EUV lines that can be used for spectral diagnostics. The multi-slit approach offers an unprecedented way to efficiently obtain the global spectral data but the ambiguity from different slits should be resolved. Using a numerical simulation of the global corona, we primarily concentrate on the optimization of the disambiguation process, with the objective of extracting decomposed spectral information of six primary lines. This subsequently facilitates a comprehensive series of plasma diagnostics, including density (Fe XII 195.12/186.89 \r{A}), Doppler velocity (Fe XII 193.51 \r{A}), line width (Fe XII 193.51 \r{A}) and temperature diagnostics (Fe VIII 185.21 \r{A}, Fe X 184.54 \r{A}, Fe XI 188.22 \r{A}, Fe XII 193.51 \r{A}). We find a good agreement between the forward modeling parameters and the inverted results at the initial eruption stage of a coronal mass ejection, indicating the robustness of the decomposition method and its immense potential for global monitoring of the solar corona.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetric Radio Imaging of Faint Gyrosynchrotron Emission from a CME : A Possible Indication of the Insufficiency of Homogeneous Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geo-effectiveness of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is determined primarily by their magnetic fields. Modeling of Gyrosynchrotron (GS) emission is a promising remote sensing technique to measure the CME magnetic field at coronal heights. However, faint GS emission from CME flux ropes is hard to detect in the presence of bright solar emission from the solar corona. With high dynamic-range spectropolarimetric meter wavelength solar images provided by the Murchison Widefield Array, we have detected faint GS emission from a CME out to $\sim 8.3\ R_\odot$, the largest heliocentric distance reported to date. High-fidelity polarimetric calibration also allowed us to robustly detect circularly polarized emission from GS emission. For the first time in literature, Stokes V detection has jointly been used with Stokes I spectra to constrain GS models. One expects that the inclusion of polarimetric measurement will provide tighter constraints on GS model parameters. Instead, we found that homogeneous GS models, which have been used in all prior works, are unable to model both the total intensity and circular polarized emission simultaneously. This strongly suggests the need for using inhomogeneous GS models to robustly estimate the CME magnetic field and plasma parameters.</description>

      <title>Dust evolution during the protostellar collapse: influence on the coupling between the neutral gas and the magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling between the magnetic field and the gas during the collapsing phase of star-forming cores is strongly affected by the dust size distribution, which is expected to evolve. We aim to investigate the influence of key parameters on the evolution of the dust distribution as well as on the magnetic resistivities during the protostellar collapse. We perform collapsing single zone simulations with shark. The code computes the evolution of the dust distribution, accounting for different grain growth and destruction processes. It also computes the magnetic resistivities. We find that the dust distribution significantly evolves during the protostellar collapse, shaping the magnetic resistivities. The peak size of the distribution, the population of small grains and consequently the magnetic resistivities are controlled by both coagulation and fragmentation rates. Under standard assumptions, the small grains coagulate very early as they collide by ambipolar drift, yielding magnetic resistivities orders of magnitude away from the non-evolving dust case. In particular, the ambipolar resistivity \eta_AD is very high prior to nH=10^10 cm^-3, and as a consequence magnetic braking should be ineffective. In this case, large size protoplanetary disks should result, which is inconsistent with recent observations. To alleviate this tension, we identify mechanisms to reduce the ambipolar resistivity during the protostellar collapse. The most promising are namely: electrostatic repulsion and grain-grain erosion. The evolution of the magnetic resistivities during the protostellar collapse and consequently the shape of the magnetic field in the early life of the protoplanetary disk strongly depends on the possibility to repopulate the small grains or to prevent their early coagulation. Therefore, it is crucial to better constrain the collision outcomes and the dust grain elastic properties.</description>

Abstract: A direct dynamical test of the sunspot-cycle is carried out which indicates that a stochastically forced non-linear oscillator characterizes its dynamics. The sunspot series is then decomposed into its eigen time-delay coordinates. The analysis of these coordinates reveals that the sunspot series exhibits bistability, and suggests the possibility of modeling the solar cycle as a stochastically and periodically forced bistable oscillator, accounting for the Poloidal and Toroidal modes of the solar magnetic field. Such a representation of the sunspot series in terms of stochastic bistable dynamical system enables us to conjecture stochastic resonance as the key mechanism in amplifying the planetary influence of Jupiter on the sun, and that extreme events, due to turbulent convection noise inside the sun, dictate crucial phases of the sunspot cycle, such as the Maunder minimum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are the primary driver of the plasma thermodynamics in the upper solar atmosphere, especially in the corona. However, magnetic field measurements in the solar corona are sporadic, thereby limiting us from the complete understanding of physical processes occurring in the coronal plasma. In this paper, we explore the diagnostic potential of a coronal emission line in the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), i.e., Ne VIII 770 \AA to probe the coronal magnetic fields. We utilize 3D 'Magneto-hydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere' (MAS) models as input to the FORWARD code to model polarization in Ne VIII line produced due to resonance scattering, and interpret its modification due to collisions and the magnetic fields through the Hanle effect. The polarization maps are synthesized both on the disk as well as off-the-limb. The variation of this polarization signal through the different phases of solar cycle 24 and the beginning phase of solar cycle 25 is studied in order to understand the magnetic diagnostic properties of this line owing to different physical conditions in the solar atmosphere. The detectability of the linear polarization signatures of the Hanle effect significantly improves with increasing solar activity, consistently with the increase in the magnetic field strength and the intensity of the mean solar brightness at these wavelengths. We finally discuss the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements by considering realistic instrument designs.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Invisible: A Study of Gaia18ajz, a Candidate Black Hole Revealed by Microlensing</title>

Abstract: Identifying black holes is essential for comprehending the development of stars and uncovering novel principles of physics. Gravitational microlensing provides an exceptional opportunity to examine an undetectable population of black holes in the Milky Way. In particular, long-lasting events are likely to be associated with massive lenses, including black holes. We present an analysis of the Gaia18ajz microlensing event, reported by the Gaia Science Alerts system, which has exhibited a long timescale and features indicative of the annual microlensing parallax effect. Our objective is to estimate the parameters of the lens based on the best-fitting model. We utilized photometric data obtained from the Gaia satellite and terrestrial observatories to investigate a variety of microlensing models and calculate the most probable mass and distance to the lens, taking into consideration a Galactic model as a prior. Subsequently, weapplied a mass-brightness relation to evaluate the likelihood that the lens is a main sequence star. We also describe the DarkLensCode (DLC), an open-source routine which computes the distribution of probable lens mass, distance and luminosity employing the Galaxy priors on stellar density and velocity for microlensing events with detected microlensing parallax. We modelled Gaia18ajz event and found its two possible models with most likely Einstein timescale of $316^{+36}_{-30}$ days and $299^{+25}_{-22}$ days. Applying Galaxy priors for stellar density and motion, we calculated the most probable lens mass of $4.9^{+5.4}_{-2.3} M_\odot$ located at $1.14^{+0.75}_{-0.57}\,\text{kpc}$ or $11.1^{+10.3}_{-4.7} M_\odot$ located at $1.31^{+0.80}_{-0.60}\,\text{kpc}$. Our analysis of the blended light suggests that the lens is likely a dark remnant of stellar evolution, rather than a main sequence star.</description>

      <title>Unequal-mass, highly-spinning binary black hole mergers in the stable mass transfer formation channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing database of gravitational-wave (GW) detections with the binary black holes (BHs) merging in the distant Universe contains subtle insights into their formation scenarios. One of the puzzling properties of detected GW sources is the possible (anti)correlation between mass ratio q of BH-BH binaries and their effective spin. We use rapid binary evolution models to demonstrate that the isolated binary evolution followed by efficient tidal spin-up of stripped helium core produces a similar pattern in Xeff vs q distributions of BH-BH mergers. In our models, the progenitors of unequal BH-BH systems in the stable mass transfer formation scenario are more likely to efficiently shrink their orbits during the second Roche-lobe overflow than the binaries that evolve into nearly equal-mass component systems. This makes it easier for unequal-mass progenitors to enter the tidal spin-up regime and later merge due to GW emission. Our results are, however, sensitive to some input assumptions, especially, the stability of mass transfer and the angular momentum loss during non-conservative mass transfer. We note that mass transfer prescriptions widely adopted in rapid codes favor the formation of BH-BH merger progenitors with unequal masses and moderate separations. We compare our results with detailed stellar model grids and find reasonable agreement after appropriate calibration of the physics models. We anticipate that future detections of unequal-mass BH-BH mergers could provide valuable constraints on the role of the stable mass transfer formation channel. A significant fraction of BH-BH detections with mass ratio q in range (0.4 - 0.7) would be consistent with the mass ratio reversal scenario during the first, relatively conservative mass transfer, and a non-enhanced angular momentum loss during the second, highly non-conservative mass transfer phase.</description>

      <title>Quasi-stars as a Means of Rapid Black Hole Growth in the Early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: JWST observations demonstrate that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) exist by redshifts $z \gtrsim 10$, providing further evidence for "direct collapse" black hole (BH) formation, whereby massive ($\sim 10^{3-5} M_{\odot}$) SMBH seeds are generated within a few Myr as a byproduct of the rapid inflow of gas into the centers of protogalaxies. Here we analyze the intermediate "quasi-star" phase that accompanies some direct collapse models, during which a natal BH accretes mass from and energetically sustains (through accretion) an overlying gaseous envelope. We argue that previous estimates of the maximum BH mass that can be reached during this stage, $\sim 1\%$ of the total quasi-star mass, are unphysical, and arise from underestimating the efficiency with which energy can be transported outward from regions close to the BH. We construct new quasi-star models that consist of an inner, "saturated-convection" region (which conforms to a convection-dominated accretion flow near the BH) matched to an outer, adiabatic envelope. These solutions exist up to a BH mass of $\sim 60\%$ the total quasi-star mass, at which point the adiabatic envelope contains only 2\% of the mass (with the remaining $\sim 38\%$ in the saturated-convection region), and this upper limit is reached within a time of $20-40$ Myr. We conclude that quasi-stars remain a viable route for producing SMBHs at large redshifts, consistent with recent JWST observations.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of black hole formation via collisions in stellar systems: An analysis of data from simulations and observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the theoretical relation between star clusters and black holes within, focusing on the potential role of nuclear star clusters (NSCs), globular clusters (GCs), and ultra compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) as environments that allow for black hole formation via stellar collisions. This study aims to identify the optimal conditions for stellar collisions across a range of stellar systems leading to the formation of very massive stars that subsequently collapse into black holes. We analyze data from numerical simulations and observations of diverse stellar systems, encompassing various initial conditions, initial mass functions, and evolution scenarios. We computed a critical mass, determined by the interplay of collision time, system age, and initial properties of the star cluster. The efficiency of black hole formation ($\epsilon_{\mathrm{BH}}$) is defined as the ratio of initial stellar mass divided by critical mass. We find that stellar systems with a ratio of initial stellar mass over critical mass above 1 exhibit a high efficiencies in terms of black hole formation, ranging from $30-100\%$. While there is some scatter, potentially attributed to complex system histories and the presence of gas, the results highlight the potential for achieving high efficiencies via a purely collisional channel in black hole formation. In conclusion, this theoretical exploration elucidates the connection between star clusters and black hole formation. The study underscores the significance of UCDs, GCs, and NSCs as environments conducive to the black hole formation scenario via stellar collisions. The defined black hole formation efficiency ($\epsilon_{\mathrm{BH}}$) is shown to be influenced by the ratio of the initial stellar mass to the critical mass.</description>
