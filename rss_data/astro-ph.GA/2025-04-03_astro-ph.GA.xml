      <title>A power spectral study of PHANGS galaxies with JWST MIRI: On the spatial scales of dust and PAHs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) consists of a diversity of structures across a range of spatial scales, intimately tied to galactic evolution. In this work, Fourier analysis is used to characterize the spatial structures of dust and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the ISM of PHANGS-JWST galaxies, observed in the four photometric mid-infrared (MIR) filters from F770W to F2100W (i.e., 7.7 to 21$\mu$m)). We quantify the abundance of structure on different spatial scales using the power-law slope, $\alpha$, of the spatial power spectra. The distribution of $\alpha$ across all length scales differs significantly between filters, with steeper slopes for PAH-dominated filters ($\alpha_{F770W} = 2.19^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$, $\alpha_{F1130W} = 1.88^{+0.25}_{-0.37}$) and shallower for the dust-continuum ($\alpha_{F1000W} = 1.48^{+0.33}_{-0.47}$, $\alpha_{F2100W} = 0.94^{+0.23}_{-0.28}$). The distribution of $\alpha$ across galaxies is narrower for PAH-dominated than for thermal dust-dominated bands, highlighting that PAHs trace photo-dissociation regions dominated by similar physical processes, whereas dust structures are an integrated property over the diverse evolutionary histories of their host galaxies. Unlike dust structures, PAH-sensitive bands display a break in the power spectrum: below a characteristic scale, $\ell_0=160\mathrm{pc}^{+110\mathrm{pc}}_{-50\mathrm{pc}}$, PAH structures are suppressed.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Dust Distribution in Ionizing-photon Escape: NIRCam and MIRI Imaging of a Lyman Continuum-emitting Galaxy at z ~ 3.8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present deep JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging of Ion1, a previously confirmed Lyman Continuum (LyC)-emitting galaxy at $z_{spec}=3.794$. Together with existing HST imaging, these new observations from the JADES program enable a joint analysis of Ion1's LyC, rest-frame UV, stellar, and dust emission with unprecedented detail. We report the first detection of dust emission at rest-frame $\sim3 \mu$m in a high-redshift LyC-emitting galaxy using MIRI/F1500W. Our analysis suggests a porous distribution of dust in Ion1, with regions exhibiting evidence of dust deficit coinciding both with LyC-emitting regions and with the peak of H$\alpha$ emission. Furthermore, multi-band NIRCam imaging reveals a strong FUV-to-optical color gradient, where LyC-emitting regions appear significantly bluer than the rest of Ion1. Spatially resolved SED fitting confirms that this color gradient is primarily driven by spatially varying dust attenuation. Together, these findings suggest that Ion1's LyC emission originates from a compact star-forming complex near its stellar-light centroid, where stellar feedback carves out low HI column density channels, facilitating LyC escape. However, only a fraction of these LyC photons - specifically those along sightlines with minimal HI obscuration - ultimately escape and reach observers. This work underscores the critical role of dust and neutral gas geometry in shaping LyC escape in galaxies at high redshifts. Anisotropic LyC escape may be a common feature in the early Universe, which must be properly incorporated to constrain the Epoch of Reionization.</description>

      <title>Cluster-lensed supernova yields from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through gravitational lensing, galaxy clusters can magnify supernovae (SNe) and create multiple images of the same SN. This enables measurements of cosmological parameters, which will be increasingly important in light of upcoming telescopic surveys. We study the prospects of detecting strongly lensed SNe in cluster fields with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman)'s High Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS) and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We employed two approaches: one focusing on known multiply imaged galaxies behind clusters, along with the SN rates specific to those galaxies, and another based on the expected number of lensed SNe exploding in a given volume behind a galaxy cluster. We collected all the clusters in the literature that feature a well-constrained lens model and multiply imaged galaxies behind clusters with high-quality data for the lensed galaxies. This allowed us to determine the SN rate for each galaxy. We provide predictions for 46 clusters visible to the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, as well as for 9 observable by Roman's HLTDS, depending on whether the clusters fall within the survey's observing field. We predict that the number of multiply imaged SNe discovered by LSST in its first three years is $3.95 \pm 0.89$ from the first approach or $4.94 \pm 1.02$ from the second. For the HLTDS, the expected number of multiply imaged SNe ranges from $0.38 \pm 0.15$ to $5.2 \pm 2.2$, depending on the specific cluster observed, however, the fields to be targeted remain a matter of discussion. We conclude that LSST offers great prospects for detecting multiply imaged SNe. Our predictions are effectively lower limits, as we only considered the most massive and well-studied clusters. We provide a recommendation for HLTDS observing field selection, namely: either MACS J0553.4-3342 or Abell 1758a should be observed by the survey.</description>

      <title>Formation and Environmental Context of Giant Bulgeless Disk Galaxies in the Early Universe: Insights from Cosmological Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant bulgeless disk galaxies, theoretically expected to be rare in the early Universe, have been confirmed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to exist as early as 2 billion years after the Big Bang. These morphologically extreme systems offer valuable insights into the physics of disk formation and the interplay between galaxies and their dark-matter halos. Using cosmological simulations, we identify analogs of such galaxies with stellar masses around $10^{11} M_\odot$ and half-light radii up to 6 kpc at $z \sim 3$ and characterize the factors that contribute to their formation. These galaxies form in young cosmic knots, populating host halos of high spin, low concentration, and spherical shapes. They feature dynamically coherent circum-galactic medium, as well as gas-rich, coherent mergers, which preserve their disk morphology and drive their large sizes. Interestingly, all the simulated giant disks harbor a compact, aligned inner disk, marginally resolvable in JWST images with a S\'ersic index near unity. These findings highlight the environmental and structural conditions necessary for forming and sustaining giant bulgeless disks and provide a theoretical framework for interpreting JWST observations of extreme disk morphologies in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>The MASSIVE Survey. XX. A Triaxial Stellar Dynamical Measurement of the Supermassive Black Hole Mass and Intrinsic Galaxy Shape of Giant Radio Galaxy NGC 315</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole mass and intrinsic shape of the stellar halo of the massive radio galaxy NGC 315 as part of the MASSIVE survey. High signal-to-noise ratio spectra from integral-field spectrographs at the Gemini and McDonald Observatories provide stellar kinematic measurements in $304$ spatial bins from the central ${\sim}0.3''$ out to $30''$. Using ${\sim} 2300$ kinematic constraints, we perform triaxial stellar orbit modeling with the TriOS code and search over ${\sim}$15,000 galaxy models with a Bayesian scheme to simultaneously measure six mass and intrinsic shape parameters. NGC 315 is triaxial and highly prolate, with middle-to-long and short-to-long axis ratios of $p=0.854$ and $q=0.833$ and a triaxiality parameter of $T=0.89$. The black hole mass inferred from our stellar kinematics is $M_\mathrm{BH} = \left(3.0 {\pm} 0.3\right) {\times} 10^{9}\ M_\odot$, which is higher than $M_\mathrm{BH}=(1.96^{+0.30}_{-0.13}) {\times} 10^{9} M_\odot$ inferred from CO kinematics (scaled to our distance). When the seven galaxies with $M_\mathrm{BH}$ measurements from both stellar and CO kinematics are compared, we find an intrinsic scatter of 0.28 dex in $M_\mathrm{BH}$ from the two tracers and do not detect statistically significant biases between the two methods in the current data. The implied black hole shadow size (${\approx} 4.7\, \mu{\rm as}$) and the relatively high millimeter flux of NGC 315 makes this galaxy a prime candidate for future horizon-size imaging studies.</description>

      <title>Lighting up the nano-hertz gravitational wave sky: opportunities and challenges of multimessenger astronomy with PTA experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments have the potential to unveil continuous gravitational wave (CGW) signals from individual massive black hole binaries (MBHBs). Detecting them in both gravitational waves (GW) and the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum will open a new chapter in multimessenger astronomy. We investigate the feasibility of conducting multimessenger studies by combining the CGW detections from an idealized 30-year SKA PTA and the optical data from the forthcoming LSST survey. To this end, we employed the $\texttt{L-Galaxies}$ semi-analytical model applied to the $\texttt{Millennium}$ simulation. We generated 200 different all-sky lightcones that include galaxies, massive black holes, and MBHBs whose emission is modeled based on their star formation histories and gas accretion physics. We predict an average of $\approx 33$ CGW detections, with signal-to-noise ratios $ S/N &gt; 5$. The detected MBHBs are typically at $z &lt; 0.5$, with masses of $ \sim 3 \times 10^{9} M_{\odot}$, mass ratios $&gt; 0.6$ and eccentricities $\lesssim 0.2$. In terms of EM counterparts, we find less than 15% of these systems to be connected with an AGN detectable by LSST, while their host galaxies are easily detectable ($ &lt; 23$ mag) massive ($ M_{\star} &gt; 10^{11} M_{\odot}$) ellipticals with typical star formation rates ($10^{-15} yr^{-1} &lt; sSRF &lt; 10^{-10} yr^{-1}$). Although the CGW-EM counterpart association is complicated by poor sky localization (only 35% of these CGWs are localized within $\rm 100\, deg^2$), the number of galaxy host candidates can be considerably reduced (thousands to tens) by applying priors based on the galaxy-MBH correlations. However, picking the actual host among these candidates is highly non-trivial, as they occupy a similar region in any optical color-color diagram. Our findings highlight the considerable challenges entailed in opening the low-frequency multimessenger GW sky.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Baryon Cycle: Fueling Star Formation via Inflows in Milky Way-like Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies are not isolated systems; they continuously interact with their surroundings by ejecting gas via stellar feedback and accreting gas from the environment. Understanding the interplay between outflows from the disc and the surrounding circumgalactic medium (CGM) is key to learning how star-forming galaxies evolve. Our goal is to understand how gas in the CGM is accreted onto the inner regions of the disc, making it available for the formation of stars, exploring the connection between stellar feedback and gas accretion from the CGM in Milky Way-like galaxies. We focus on the distribution of vertical and radial gas flows to and from the disc as a function of galactocentric radius, and examine the implications of these processes for the evolution of such galaxies. We use the Arepo code coupled with the SMUGGLE sub-grid model to perform hydrodynamic N-body simulations of 9 different galaxies surrounded by a hot CGM. Each simulation features a gaseous disc with different mass and scale length, allowing us to examine how disc structure impacts gas dynamics. We find evidence of a crucial link between stellar feedback and gas accretion from the CGM, which together play an essential role in sustaining ongoing star formation in the disc. In particular, the ejection of gas from the disc plane by stellar feedback leads to the generation of a baryon cycle in which the CGM gas is mainly accreted onto the external regions of the disc ($ \approx 3-10$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ of gas is accreted into the whole disc). From these regions it is then transported to the centre with radial mass rates $\approx 1-4$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ on average, owing to angular momentum conservation, forming new stars and starting the whole cycle again. We find that both vertical accretion onto the inner regions of the disc and the radial transport of gas from the disc outskirts are necessary to sustain star formation.</description>

      <title>HI 21-cm Absorption Associated with Foreground Galaxies on Top of Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic search for HI 21-cm absorption in Quasar-Galaxy Pairs (QGPs) provides a powerful means to map the distribution of cold gas around high-redshift star-forming galaxies. Fiber spectroscopy of high-redshift quasars enables the serendipitous detection of foreground star-forming galaxies at extremely small impact parameters, forming a unique subset of QGPs known as Galaxies On Top Of Quasars (GOTOQs). In this study, we present results from a pilot upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) survey of three GOTOQs, where we achieved a remarkable 100\% detection rate of HI 21-cm absorption. By combining our findings with existing literature, we establish that GOTOQs constitute a distinct population in terms of HI 21-cm absorption, with significantly higher detection rates than those observed in Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ (DLA)-based or metal absorption-based searches. For the GOTOQs, we find a strong correlation between the line-of-sight reddening and the HI 21-cm optical depth, characterized by $\int \tau\, dv\, (\rm{km\,s^{-1}}) = 13.58^{+2.75}_{-2.35} E(B-V) + 0.68^{+1.06}_{-1.27}$, consistent with the Milky Way sightlines. We also show that the HI 21-cm detection rates and optical depth declines rapidly with the impact parameter. With upcoming wide-field spectroscopic surveys expected to substantially expand the catalog of known GOTOQs, the success of this pilot survey lays the foundation for constructing a statistically significant sample of intervening HI 21-cm absorbers.</description>

      <title>Filamentary Hierarchies and Superbubbles I: Characterizing filament properties across a simulated spiral galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High resolution surveys reveal that the interstellar medium in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies consists of interlinked hierarchies of filamentary structure and superbubbles extending from galactic to subpc scales. The characterization of filament properties across this hierarchy is of fundamental importance for the origin of giant molecular clouds and their star clusters. In this paper we characterize the properties of filaments greater than 25 pc in length that are produced in the multi-scale galactic MHD simulations of Zhao et al. 2024. By adapting the FilFinder algorithm of Koch &amp; Rosolowsky, 2015, we extract over 500 filaments ranging up to 10 kpc scales, to derive the probability distribution functions for filament masses and lengths, magnetic field orientations, and the gravitational stability and fragmentation patterns of filaments. We find power-law distributions for filament masses and lengths. The former has a power law index $\alpha_m = 1.85$ that is nearly identical to that of observed GMC mass functions in extragalactic and Galactic surveys, suggesting that GMC properties are inherited from their host filaments. The fragmentation of magnetized filaments on 200 pc scales or less occurs when they exceed an average critical line mass, as predicted by theory. On larger scales however, kpc filaments form out of the cold neutral medium (CNM) and fragmentation follows local variations in the critical line mass along spiral arms or at the boundaries of superbubbles.</description>

      <title>JWST reveals the diversity of nuclear obscuring dust in nearby AGN: nuclear isolation of MIRI/MRS datacubes and continuum spectral fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the capabilities of the mid-infrared instrument (MIRI) of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to advance our knowledge of AGN dust using the spectral fitting technique on an AGN collection of 21 nearby (z&lt;0.05) AGN (7 type-1 and 14 type-2) observations obtained with the medium resolution spectroscopy (MRS) mode. This collection includes publicly available AGN and data from the collaboration of Galactic Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). We developed a tool named MRSPSFisol that decomposes MRS cubes into point-like and extended contributions. We found statistically good fits for 12 targets with current AGN dust models. The model that provides good fits (chi2/dof&lt;2) for {these 12 targets} assumes a combination of clumpy and smooth distribution of dust in a flare-disk geometry where the dust grain size is a free parameter. Still, two and one AGN statistically prefer the disk+wind and the classical clumpy torus model, respectively. However, the currently available models fail to reproduce 40% of the targets, likely due to the extreme silicate features not well reproduced by the models and signatures of water-ice and aliphatic hydrocarbon absorption features in most targets. New models exploring, for instance, new chemistry, are needed to explain the complexity of AGN dust continuum emission observed by JWST.</description>

      <title>A machine-learning photometric classifier for massive stars in nearby galaxies II. The catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass loss is a key aspect of stellar evolution, particularly in evolved massive stars, yet episodic mass loss remains poorly understood. To investigate this, we need evolved massive stellar populations across various galactic environments. However, spectral classifications are challenging to obtain in large numbers, especially for distant galaxies. We addressed this by leveraging machine-learning techniques. We combined \textit{Spitzer} photometry and Pan-STARRS1 optical data to classify point sources in 26 galaxies within 5 Mpc, and a metallicity range 0.07-1.36 Z$_\odot$. \textit{Gaia} DR3 astrometry was used to remove foreground sources. Classifications are derived using a machine-learning model developed by Maravelias et al. (2022). We report classifications for 1,147,650 sources, with 276,657 sources ($\sim24\%$) being robust. Among these are 120,479 Red Supergiants (RSGs; $\sim11\%$). The classifier performs well even at low metallicities ($\sim0.1$ Z$_\odot$) and distances under 1.5 Mpc, with a slight decrease in accuracy beyond $\sim3$ Mpc due to \textit{Spitzer}'s resolution limits. We also identified 21 luminous RSGs ($\textrm{log}(L/L_\odot)\ge5.5$), 159 dusty Yellow Hypergiants in M31 and M33, as well as 6 extreme RSGs ($\textrm{log}(L/L_\odot)\ge6$) in M31, challenging observed luminosity limits. Class trends with metallicity align with expectations, though biases exist. This catalog serves as a valuable resource for individual-object studies and \textit{James Webb} Space Telescope target selection. It enables follow-up on luminous RSGs and Yellow Hypergiants to refine our understanding of their evolutionary pathways. Additionally, we provide the largest spectroscopically confirmed catalog of massive stars and candidates to date, comprising 5,273 sources (including $\sim330$ other objects).</description>

      <title>Impact of cosmic web on the properties of galaxies in IllustrisTNG simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the cosmic web on galaxy properties in the IllustrisTNG simulations. To disentangle the effects of galaxy groups and cosmic filaments, we classify the cosmic web environment into four categories: group, group-dominated, filament-dominated, and field. By controlling for stellar mass, we reveal evident differences in specific star formation rates (sSFR), quenched fraction, gas fractions, local density, and stellar ages among central galaxies in different cosmic web environments, particularly for lower-mass galaxies. However, these differences largely diminish when the effect of local overdensity is further accounted for, indicating its dominant role. Additionally, we observe distinct differences in these properties among satellite galaxies across environments, mainly driven by stellar mass, halo mass, and overdensity. Notably, residual differences between satellites in field and filament-dominated region persist even after controlling for these factors, suggesting a stronger susceptibility of satellite galaxies to filaments compared to centrals. Our findings highlight the importance of differentiating between central and satellite to accurately assess the environmental effects of the cosmic web. Our analysis suggests that the relationship between galaxy properties and their distance from filaments arises from a combination of factors, including stellar and halo mass, groups, overdensity, and the intrinsic influence of the cosmic web. Additionally, we find that the effect of the cosmic web on galaxy properties is reduced at $z=0.5$, compared to $z=0$. Furthermore, central galaxies near thick filaments tend to exhibit slightly to moderately lower sSFR and cold gas fractions compared to those near thin filaments.</description>

      <title>Enhanced sub-resolution star formation models in cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the crucial components in simulating the growth and evolution of galaxies within a cosmological framework is the modeling of star formation (SF) and its corresponding feedback. Traditionally, the implemented SF law follows the empirical Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, which links the SF rate (SFR) in a gas element to the total gas density. More recently, an even stronger correlation has been observed between the SFR and the amount of molecular hydrogen ($\mathrm{H}_2$). This opens up the question of whether molecular hydrogen is a necessary precursor for SF or is instead a tracer of the total amount of gas, both of which would explain the observed correlations. In this study, we examine the impact of using an $\mathrm{H}_2$-based SF law on the formation of Milky Way-mass galaxies using cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations. We find that the galaxy modeled with our approach exhibits a well-defined, disc-like morphology. Compared to the traditional recipe, our model delays the onset of SF by approximately $500 \, \mathrm{Myr}$ resulting in a lower SFR, a smaller disc size, and a higher proportion of neutral to ionized gas within the disc region. These findings highlight the importance of including sophisticated SF models which can be compared to several observations -- including those related to $\mathrm{H}_2$ -- to better understand the processes affecting galaxy formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Physical Properties and HI-to-H2 Transition Across Taurus Linear Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the atomic-to-molecular transition is essential for understanding the evolution of interstellar medium. The linear edge of Taurus molecular cloud, clearly identified in the $^{13}$CO(1-0) intensity map, serves as an ideal site for investigating this transition. Utilizing the Arizona Radio Observatory Sub-Millimeter Telescope, we obtained mapping observations of CO(2-1), $^{13}$CO(2-1), and CO(3-2) across this linear edge. The intensity ratio between CO(2-1) and $^{13}$CO(2-1) indicates a lower limit of the $^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratio of $54\pm 17$. Based on multi-transition observations of CO and $^{13}$CO, we performed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fit of the physical properties across this edge using non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium analysis with the RADEX code, based on the Large velocity Gradient (LVG) assumption. The number density profile exhibits a pronounced jump coinciding with the H$_2$ infrared emission peak. The cold HI gas within the molecular cloud, manifested as HI-Narrow Self-Absorption (HINSA) features, is detected along the cloud edge. Our quantitative comparison with numerical simulations provides tentative evidence that shocks induced by colliding gas flows may contribute to the atomic-to-molecular phase transition observed along the linear edge.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the properties of the first galaxies with JWST and ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is challenging our understanding of the nature of the very first galaxies in the Universe, having discovered a surprising abundance of very massive galaxies in early cosmic epochs. By applying a model of primeval dust, we estimate the far-infrared (FIR)-continuum luminosities for galaxies of different masses at redshifts $z\gtrsim7$. In particular, we predict observed fluxes for different available bands (3-10) of the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-mm Array (ALMA), considering typical conservative values expected for the properties of first galaxies (e.g., gas-phase metallicities, dust-to-metal ratio, star formation efficiency). As expected, FIR fluxes increase with stellar mass for all ALMA bands, but with a steeper slope for bands 9 and 10. Encouragingly, first galaxies are affected by a strong negative-K correction, in such a way that sources with similar properties are brighter in bands 3-8 at higher redshifts. Such behavior is stronger for bands 6-7. Although the trends for bands 9-10 are not clear, the highest fluxes for such bands are reached towards extreme $z\gtrsim 15$. Counterintuitively, our results suggest that JWST sources with similar masses and dust properties would be more easily detectable with ALMA if they are located at higher $z$.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength properties of $z\gtrsim 6$ LISA detectable events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the intrinsic and observational properties of $z\gtrsim 6$ galaxies hosting coalescing massive black holes (MBHs) that gives rise to gravitational waves (GWs) detectable with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We adopt a zoom-in cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of galaxy formation and black hole (BH) co-evolution, zoomed-in on a $M_h \sim 10^{12}~\rm M_{\odot}$ dark matter halo at z = 6, which hosts a fast accreting super-massive black hole (SMBH) and a star-forming galaxy. Following the SMBH formation backward in time, we identify the merging events that concurred to its formation and we pick up the ones that are detectable with LISA. Among these LISA detectable events (LDEs), we select those that, based on their intrinsic properties are expected to be bright in one or more electromagnetic (EM) bands. We post-process these events with dust radiative transfer calculations to make predictions about their spectral energy distributions and continuum maps in the JWST to ALMA wavelength range. We compare the spectra arising from galaxies hosting the merging MBHs with those arising from AGN powered by single accreting BHs. We find that it will be impossible to identify an LDE from the continuum SEDs because of the absence of specific imprints from the merging MBHs. We also compute the profile of the H$_{\rm \alpha}$ line arising from LDEs, considering the contribution from their star-forming regions and the accreting MBHs. We find that the presence of two accreting MBHs would be difficult to infer even if both MBHs accrete at super-Eddington rates. We conclude that the combined detection of GW and EM signals from $z\gtrsim 6$ MBHs is challenging not only because of the poor sky-localization provided by LISA, but also because the loudest GW emitters are not massive enough to leave significant signatures in the emission lines arising from the broad line region.</description>

      <title>The Interstellar Medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) is the material that fills the space between the stars in all galaxies; it is a multi-phase medium in pressure equilibrium, with densities and temperatures covering over 6 orders of magnitude. Although accounting for only a small fraction of the mass of any given galaxy, it is a vital component, since it holds the material responsible for galaxy growth through star formation. Studying the ISM requires careful observations at all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. This article describes the multi-phase nature of the ISM, and then puts it in the context of galaxy evolution models, emphasising the importance of the cycling of baryons in and out of galaxies. Within this framework, the ISM plays a central role: it connects the physical processes operating on very large physical- and time-scales which control the accretion of gas onto galaxies, and the small scale processes that regulate star formation.</description>

      <title>Multiscale exploration of SMACS J0723.3--7327's intracluster light and past dynamical history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work an analysis of the intracluster light (ICL) in the galaxy cluster SMACS J0723.3-7327 (hereafter, SMACS J0723) using JWST/NIRCam deep imaging in six filters (F090W to F444W) is presented. The images were processed for low surface brightness (LSB) science, with additional correction for instrumental scattering in the short-wavelength channels, and analysed using wavelet-based decomposition. The ICL, brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and satellite galaxies were extracted and modelled, with 2D maps for each component. ICL and ICL+BCG fractions, computed across all filters within a 400 kpc radius, exhibit a flat trend with wavelength, averaging 28% and 34%, respectively. Flux ratios between the BCG and the next brightest members (M$_{12}$, M$_{13}$ and M$_{14}$) also display minimal wavelength dependence. These results indicate that SMACS J0723 is a dynamically evolved cluster with a dominant BCG and well-developed ICL. Five prominent ICL substructures are analysed, contributing to 10-12% of the total ICL+BCG flux budget, slightly exceeding simulation predictions. Their short dynamical timescales suggest an instantaneous ICL injection rate of several $10^3 L_{\odot}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, consistent with active dynamical assembly. These findings support a scenario where SMACS J0723's ICL growth is currently driven by galaxy mergers involving the BCG and other bright satellites, rather than by the accretion of pre-processed ICL from a recent cluster merger. However, extrapolating the current injection rate to the cluster's lifetime indicates that additional mechanisms are required to match the growth observed in other clusters over cosmic times.</description>

      <title>Chemical Components in the Virgo Overdensity and Hercules-Aquila Cloud: hints of more than one merger event in GSE-like debris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using elemental abundances for 1.26 million K giants in the LAMOST DR8 value-added catalog, we analyze the chemical abundances of the Virgo Overdensity (VOD) and Hercules-Aquila Cloud (HAC). We find two distinct chemical populations in both overdensities, which is in disagreement with the mainstream hypothesis that both overdensities are composed of materials from a single merger event, namely Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE). The two populations show different chemical trends: one exhibits low metallicities and high $\alpha$ abundances, and the other shows high metallicities and low $\alpha$ abundances, which is associated with the recently discovered Nereus and Virgo Radial Merger (VRM) components in the local stellar halo, respectively. The Nereus component in these overdensities uniquely exhibits a decreasing trend in the [Fe/H]-[Mn/Fe] plane. Out of all observed Milky Way dwarf galaxies, this trend is only found in the Sculptor dwarf galaxy, which provides clues for the properties of Nereus progenitor. We also find that the velocity ellipse with high aniostropy parameters that is usually considered to be part of GSE are actually a mix of the two components. Both overdensities are well-mixed in kinematic spaces, confirming recent claims that the debris of merger pairs are kinematically indistinguishable in a recent simulation. We find that the velocity ellipses of the VRM stars in these overdensities have large inclination angles, which may be an indication of the merger time in simulated merger events.</description>

      <title>Investigate Substructures of the Inner Halo Using the StarGO Algorithm with APOGEE DR17</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We applied Stars' Galactic Origin (StarGO) algorithm in 7D space (i.e., [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], $L_{z}$, $J_{r}$, $J_{z}$, $E$) to analyze stars in the inner halo with APOGEE DR17. We identified some known substructures, including Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), Sagittarius Stream (Sgr), LMS-1 (Wukong), Thamnos, Metal-Weak Thick Disk (MWTD) and Aleph. Additionally, we identified an undefined metal-poor group (UDG, with [Fe/H] $&lt;-0.8$ dex) probably linked to known substructure like Aleph, as well as a high $\alpha$-abundance substructure (HAS) associated with both the Nyx and Nyx-2 streams. Chemical abundance of the HAS supports the argument that Nyx and Nyx-2 share a common origin. We discovered three substructures, which we refer to as new-substructure candidate-1,2,3 (NSTC-1,2,3). Despite exhibiting disk-like dynamics, these NSTCs demonstrate notably low [Mg/Fe] ($&lt;$ 0.2 dex) and [Al/Fe] ($&lt;$ $-0.15$ dex), similar to the properties of dwarf galaxies. Their high orbital energy and low [$\alpha$/Fe] indicate the association with recent accretion events.</description>

      <title>JWST MIRI reveals the diversity of nuclear mid-infrared spectra of nearby type-2 quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type-2 quasars (QSO2s) are active galactic nuclei (AGN) seen through a significant amount of dust and gas that obscures the central supermassive black hole and the broad line region. Here we present new mid-infrared spectra of the central kiloparsec of five optically-selected QSO2s at redshift z~0.1 obtained with JWST/MIRI/MRS. These QSO2s belong to the QSOFEED sample and they have log Lbol=45.5-46.0 erg/s, global SFRs that place them above the main sequence, and practically identical optical spectral shape and [OIII] luminosity, but their nuclear mid-infrared spectra exhibit an unexpected diversity of both continua and features. They show: 1) 9.7 micron silicate features going from emission (strength of S9.7=0.5) to relatively strong absorption (S9.7=-1.0) and 18 and 23 micron silicates either in emission or flat. In addition, two of the QSO2s show absorption bands of CO, H2O, and aliphatic grains, indicating different levels of nuclear obscuration across the sample. 2) [NeV]/[NeII] ratios ranging from 0.1 to 2.1 and [NeIII]/[NeII] from 1.0 to 3.5, indicating different coronal line and ionizing continuum strengths. 3) Warm molecular gas masses of 1-4x10^7 Msun and warm-to-cold gas mass ratios of 1-2%, with molecular gas excitation likely due to jet-induced shocks in J1430+1339, and to UV heating and/or turbulence in J1509+0434. 4) PAH emission features with equivalent widths ranging from &lt;0.002 to 0.075 micron, from which we measure a larger contribution from neutral molecules (PAH 11.3/6.2=1.3-3.4) and SFRs&lt;3-7 Msun/yr. This unprecedented dataset allowed us to start exploring the role of various AGN and galaxy properties including ionizing continuum, obscuration, electron density, and jet-ISM interactions on some of the spectral differences listed above, but larger samples are now required to fully understand the diversity of QSO2s' nuclear mid-infrared spectra.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the scale of star formation across the Perseus spiral arm using young clusters around Cas OB5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cas OB5 is an OB association located at a distance of 2.5-3 kpc that intercepts the Perseus spiral arm. It carries a moderate amount of reddening ($A_V \sim$ 2-3 mag) and contains several well-known open clusters within its boundaries, such as King 12, NGC 7788, and NGC 7790. The availability of modern clustering algorithms, together with \textit{Gaia} DR3 kinematics and complementary spectroscopic data, makes it a suitable site for studies of Galactic structure. We seek to quantify the spatial scale of star formation in the spiral arms, using Cas OB5 as a pilot target before extending our study to more distant and extinguished regions of the Galaxy. We selected 129,695 candidate OBA stars in a 6x8 deg$^2$ region around Cas OB5. We applied a spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting process to this sample to derive the physical parameters. Through this process, we found 56 379 OBA stars, which we then clustered using HDBSCAN. We identified 17 open clusters inside this area, four of which appear to form a coherent structure that we identify as Cas OB5. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that these clusters belong to two different age groups despite sharing a similar position and kinematics. Spectroscopic observations confirm the youth of NGC 7788 (10-15 Myr) compared to NGC 7790 ($110\pm15\:$Myr). We have determined a spatial scale for star formation of a few tens of pc to a few hundreds of pc, comparing the clustered to the diffuse population of Cas~OB5 across this part of the Perseus arm. A spectroscopic analysis was required to complement the clustering algorithm, so that we could separate younger OCs (tracers of the spiral arm) from older ones. These results highlight the need to combine these techniques to fully disentangle the Milky Way structure.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic simulations of the Disc of Gas Around Supermassive black holes (HDGAS) -II; The transition from neutral atomic to molecular gas phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use HDGAS hydrodynamic simulations to study the impact of active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback on the conversion of atomic-gas to molecular-gas within the circumnuclear-disc (CND) of a typical AGN-dominated galaxy. The comparison of CI, CII, and CO line intensities and their ratios in the HDGAS post-processing radiative-transfer analysis reveals the complex interplay between AGN-activity, cold molecular gas properties, and the physical processes governing the evolution of star-formation in galaxies. Our results demonstrate that the CI/CO intensity ratio serves as a reliable indicator of the atomic-to-molecular gas transition. We present the probability distribution function (PDF) and abundance trends of various metal species related to molecular H$2$ gas, highlighting differences in clumpiness and intensity maps between AGN feedback and NoAGN models. The profile of the integrated intensity (moment-0) maps shows that the AGN-feedback model exhibits a lower CI/CO intensity ratio in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (&lt; 50 pc), indicating a smaller atomic-gas abundance and the presence of positive AGN-feedback. Our simulations have successfully predicted the presence of faint-CO emissions extending to larger radii from the galactic center. We also explore the relationships between CII/CO and CI/CII intensity ratios, as well as the ratios versus CO intensity, which provides insights into the "CO-dark" issues. One notable feature in the later time-scale of the AGN model is the presence of a "CO-dark" region, where the intensity of CO emission ($\rm I_{CO}$) is depleted relative to the H$_2$ column density ($N_{\rm H_2}$) compared to the NoAGN model.</description>

      <title>The Vertical Metallicity Gradient of the Galactic Disk for Mono-Age Stellar Populations in LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vertical metallicity gradient of the Galactic disk offers valuable insights into the disk's formation and chemical evolution over time. We utilized the LAMOST-LRS young stellar sample to investigate this gradient and found that it approaches zero as stellar effective temperature (or age) increases (or decreases) across various Galactocentric distances. To validate this result, we analyzed 295 open clusters younger than 3 Gyr and 976 classical cepheids within the Galactic disk. The findings confirmed that, within a given narrow age range, the vertical metallicity gradient is effectively zero. This relationship between metallicity and age supports the ``upside-down'' disk formation theory, as it indicates that the youngest and most metal-rich stars dominate the midplane, while older and more metal-poor stars formed at larger vertical heights and currently tend to be at these heights. Overall, our results align well with theoretical predictions, offering further insight into the chemical evolution and structural properties of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Studying stellar populations in Omega Centauri with phylogenetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature and formation history of our Galaxy's largest and most enigmatic stellar cluster, known as Omega Centauri (ocen) remains debated. Here, we offer a novel approach to disentangling the complex stellar populations within ocen based on phylogenetics methodologies from evolutionary biology. These include the Gaussian Mixture Model and Neighbor-Joining clustering algorithms applied to a set of chemical abundances of ocen stellar members. Instead of using the classical approach in astronomy of grouping them into separate populations, we focused on how the stars are related to each other. In this way, we could identify stars that likely formed in globular clusters versus those originating from prolonged in-situ star formation and how these stars interconnect. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that ocen might be a nuclear star cluster of a galaxy accreted by the Milky Way with a mass of about 10^9M_sun. Furthermore, we revealed the existence of a previously unidentified in-situ stellar population with a distinct chemical pattern unlike any known population found in the Milky Way to date. Our analysis of ocen is an example of the success of cross-disciplinary research and shows the vast potential of applying evolutionary biology tools to astronomical datasets, opening new avenues for understanding the chemical evolution of complex stellar systems.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Nature of Virgil: An Obscured AGN Lurking Within an Apparently Normal Lyman-{\alpha} Emitter During Cosmic Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the MIRI Extremely Red Object Virgil, a Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter at $z_{spec} = 6.6379 \pm 0.0035$ with the photometric properties of a Little Red Dot. Leveraging new JWST/MIRI imaging from the MIDIS and PAHSPECS programs, we confirm Virgil's extraordinary nature among galaxies in JADES/GOODS-South, exhibiting a strikingly red NIRCam-to-MIRI color (F444W $-$ F1500W = $2.84\pm0.04$~mag). Deep NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy from the OASIS program offers key insights into the host galaxy, revealing properties of an average star-forming galaxy during Cosmic Reionization, such as a subsolar metallicity, low-to-moderate dust content, and a relatively high ionization parameter and electron temperature. By estimating the star formation rate of Virgil from UV and H$\alpha$, we find evidence that the galaxy is either entering or fading out of a bursty episode. Although line-ratio diagnostics employed at high-$z$ would classify Virgil as an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), this classification becomes ambiguous once redshift evolution is considered. Nonetheless, Virgil occupies the same parameter space as recently confirmed AGNs at similar redshifts. The new deep MIRI data at 15~$\mu$m reinforce the AGN nature of Virgil, as inferred from multiple spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes. Virgil's rising infrared SED and UV excess resemble those of Dust-Obscured Galaxies (DOGs) studied with Spitzer at Cosmic Noon, particularly blue-excess HotDOGs. Our results highlight the need for a multi-wavelength approach incorporating MIRI to uncover such extreme sources at $z\gtrsim6$ and to shed light on the interplay between galaxy evolution and early black hole growth during Cosmic Reionization.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Variable Continuum Lags in PG 2130+099</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadband photometric reverberation mapping (RM) provides a measure of the size of the continuum-emitting region in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Previous monitoring campaigns of PG 2130+099 disagree as to whether the continuum emitting region size is consistent with that predicted for a standard optically thick geometrically thin accretion disk. We present $\sim$6 months of observations from several robotic telescopes, providing the highest cadence and widest wavelength coverage photometric RM study of PG 2130+099 to date. Our results indicate that inferred size of the continuum-emitting region in PG 2130+099, like many recently observed AGN, is larger than the simplest predictions for an irradiated geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk. We also perform a flux-flux analysis, finding a variable spectrum broadly consistent with a disk, and a constant component with enhanced $\textit{i}$-band emission, potentially due to H$\alpha$. We find some evidence of increasing lag with luminosity, but previous lag measurements are too uncertain to be definitive.</description>

      <title>Tidal interaction can stop galactic bars: on the LMC non-rotating bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Using Gaia DR3 data, Jim\'enez-Arranz et al. (2024a) computed the LMC bar pattern speed using three different methods. One of them suggested that the LMC might be hosting a bar that barely rotates, and is slightly counter-rotating with respect to the LMC disc, with a pattern speed of $\Omega_p = -1.0 \pm 0.5$ km/s/kpc. Aims: To confirm that tidal interactions can trigger the LMC hosting a non-rotating bar due to its interaction with the SMC, which could cause the LMC bar to slow down significantly until it (momentarily) stops. Methods: We analyse a subset of models (K9 and K21) from the KRATOS suite (Jim\'enez-Arranz et al. 2024b) where we detected non-rotating bars. We make use of two different methods to track the evolution of the bar pattern speed: the program patternSpeed.py (Dehnen et al. 2023), and temporal finite-differences of the change rate the bar major axis' phase angle. Results: In the second LMC-SMC-like pericenter passage of K9, the bar of the LMC-like galaxy weakens to almost disappear and regenerates with a pattern speed that suffers a slowdown from $\Omega_p \sim 20$ km/s/kpc to $\Omega_p \sim 0$ km/s/kpc in less than 75 Myr. Then, the bar rotates at less than $\Omega_p \sim 3-5$ km/s/kpc for around 100 Myr, until it recovers the initial (before interaction) pattern speed of $\Omega_p \sim 10$ km/s/kpc. The results for the K21 simulation are comparable. Conclusions: This work is the first direct evidence that galactic bars can be slowed down or even stopped by tidal interaction, which strengthens the possibility of the LMC hosting a non-rotating bar, and can add an alternative formation scenario for observed slow-rotating bars.</description>

      <title>Open cluster age calibration from colour-magnitude morphological indices using Gaia DR3 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star clusters are crucial for understanding how stars evolve. Their colour-magnitude diagrams show the effects of stellar evolution of approximately coeval objects with the same chemical composition. Furthermore, the determination of their astrophysical parameters (age, distance, colour excess and metallicity) together with their spatial distribution provides information about the structure and the evolution of the Galaxy itself. Using data from the \textit{Gaia} DR3 and 2MASS catalogues, we develop methodologies for characterizing open clusters. Precise membership lists, mean astrometric parameters and radii are obtained. Using photometric data from both data sources, we carried out new age calibrations that rely on morphological indices based on colour ($\Delta BR$) and magnitude ($\Delta G$) differences between the red clump and the turnoff for a sample of 34 open clusters with ages covering the interval $8.3 &lt; \log[t({\rm yr})] &lt; 9.9$. A set of age calibration functions based on \textit{Gaia} morphological age indices are determined for the first time. We demonstrate their accuracy, obtaining a mean residual of 0.06 dex in $\log[t(yr)]$. Our results also show that stellar evolution models tend to predict the difference $\Delta G$. However, they typically overestimate the difference $\Delta BR$ for objects younger than $\log[t({\rm yr})] = 8.8$.</description>

      <title>Encyclopedia Magneticum: Scaling Relations from Cosmic Dawn to Present Day</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy and halo scaling relations, connecting a broad range of parameters, are well established from observations. The origin of many of these relations and their scatter is still a matter of debate. It remains a sizable challenge for models to simultaneously and self-consistently reproduce as many scaling relations as possible. We introduce the Magneticum Pathfinder hydrodynamical cosmological simulation suite, to date the suite that self-consistently covers the largest range in box volumes and resolutions. It is the only cosmological simulation suite that is tuned on the hot gas content of galaxy clusters instead of the stellar mass function. By assessing the successes and shortcomings of tuning to the hot gas component of galaxy clusters, we aim to further our understanding of the physical processes shaping the Universe. We analyze the importance of the hot and cold gas components for galaxy and structure evolution. We analyze 28 scaling relations, covering large-scale global parameters as well as internal properties for halos ranging from massive galaxy clusters down to galaxies, and show their predicted evolution from z=4 to z=0 in comparison with observations. These include the halo-to-stellar-mass and Kennicutt--Schmidt relations, the cosmic star formation rate density as well as the Fundamental Plane. Magneticum Pathfinder matches a remarkable number of the observed scaling relations from z=4 to z=0, including challenging relations like the number density of quiescent galaxies at cosmic dawn, the mass--size evolution, the mass--metallicity relation, the Magorrian relation, and the temperature--mass relation. We compile our data to allow for straightforward future comparisons. Galaxy properties and scaling relations arise naturally and the large scatter in observables at high redshift is crucial to distinguish the various galaxy formation models reproducing the z=0 relations.</description>

      <title>Thermal Desorption Kinetics, Binding Energies, and Entrapment of Methyl Mercaptan Ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organosulfur species are potential major carriers of sulfur in the interstellar medium, as well as interesting ingredients in prebiotic chemistry. The most fundamental question regarding these species is under which conditions they reside in the gas versus solid phase. Here, we characterize the thermal desorption kinetics, binding energies, and entrapment of the organosulfur methyl mercaptan (CH$_3$SH, or MeSH) in different ice environments, comparing them with those of methanol (CH$_3$OH, or MeOH) ices. The derived multi-layer (pure MeSH-MeSH) and sub-monolayer (layered MeSH-H$_2$O) binding energies are surprisingly similar, corresponding to snow line locations where the disk midplane temperature is ~105 K. In both H$_2$O-dominated and more realistic H$_2$O:CO$_2$-dominated ices, 100% of the MeSH is entrapped, almost exclusively desorbing at the molecular volcano desorption peak, indicating that MeSH is retained at the water snow line if initially mixed with water ice during formation. Additionally, the presence of MeSH in an ice mixture enhances the entrapment of CO$_2$ and MeOH (up to 100%) until the onset of volcano desorption; without MeSH, both desorb at their respective pure desorption temperatures and also co-desorb with water. Compared to MeOH, MeSH binds less well to water, explaining why MeSH escapes during water ice crystallization rather than co-desorbing with water. These results show the larger relative size of MeSH compared to MeOH significantly impacts its ability to bind to water and its entrapment efficiency. Therefore, molecular size plays an important role in the adsorption and retention of S-bearing organics and, in turn, other volatiles in ices.</description>

      <title>A widely applicable Galaxy Group finder Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy groups are essential for studying the distribution of matter on a large scale in redshift surveys and for deciphering the link between galaxy traits and their associated halos. In this work, we propose a widely applicable method for identifying groups through machine learning techniques in real space taking into account the impact of redshift distortion. Our methodology involves two neural networks: one is a classification model for identifying central galaxy groups, and the other is a regression model for predicting the mass of these groups. Both models input observable galaxy traits, allowing future applicability to real survey data. Testing on simulated datasets indicates our method accurately identifies over $92\%$ of groups with $\mathrm{M}_{vir} \geq 10^{11}h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot$, with $80\%$ achieving a membership completeness of at least $80\%$. The predicted group masses vary by less than 0.3 dex across different mass scales, even in the absence of a priori data. Our network adapts seamlessly to expand to sparse samples with a flux limit of $m_{r} &lt; 14$, to high redshift samples at $z=1.08$, and to galaxy samples from the TNG300 hydrodynamical simulation without further training. Furthermore, the framework can easily adjust to real surveys by training on redshift distorted samples without needing parameter changes. Careful consideration of different observational effects in redshift space makes it promising that this method will be applicable to real galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>The Mini-SiTian Array: Imaging Processing Pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a pathfinder of the SiTian project, the Mini-SiTian (MST) array, employed three commercial CMOS cameras, represents a next-generation, cost-effective optical time-domain survey project. This paper focuses primarily on the precise data processing pipeline designed for wide-field, CMOS-based devices, including the removal of instrumental effects, astrometry, photometry, and flux calibration. When applying this pipeline to approximately 3000 observations taken in the Field 02 (f02) region by MST, the results demonstrate a remarkable astrometric precision of approximately 70--80\,mas (about 0.1\,pixel), an impressive calibration accuracy of approximately 1\,mmag in the MST zero points, and a photometric accuracy of about 4\,mmag for bright stars. Our studies demonstrate that MST CMOS can achieve photometric accuracy comparable to that of CCDs, highlighting the feasibility of large-scale CMOS-based optical time-domain surveys and their potential applications for cost optimization in future large-scale time-domain surveys, like the SiTian project.</description>

      <title>A 0.3\% calibration of the W UMa-type contact binary luminosity based on Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: W Ursa Majoris (W UMa)-type contact binary systems (CBs) with period--luminosity (PL) relations are valuable distance indicators. The PL relations of CBs are affected by metallicity. Here, we establish PL relations and period--luminosity--metallicity (PLZ) relations in nine bands from optical to mid-infrared ($BP$, $G$, $RP$, $J$, $H$, $K_S$, $W1$, $W2$, $W3$) and in five Wesenheit bands based on Gaia DR3 parallaxes. The dispersion of PLZ relations gradually decreases from the optical to mid-infrared bands, with the minimum dispersion of 0.138 mag. We fit the best PL relations for three bands ($W1$, $W_{G,BP,RP}$, $W_{W1,BP,RP}$) under different parallax uncertainty criteria and determine a parallax (after correction) zero point of $zp_\varpi=24\pm4$ $\mu$as. After fixing the parallax zero point, we find that the total zero errors of the PL and PLZ relation are smallest when the parallax uncertainty is less than 2\%, resulting in a calibrated CB luminosity with an accuracy of 0.33\%, which is more accurate than the classical Cepheids. Furthermore, by examining the absolute magnitude residuals in different metallicity intervals, we find that the use of a linear metallicity effect is appropriate for CBs with different metallicities. These results indicate that CBs are excellent standard candles.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes and Stability Analysis of the JMN-1 Naked Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the quasinormal modes in the Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan (JMN-1) naked singularity by investigating its response to linear perturbations, including scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations. To analyze the stability of the JMN-1 naked singularity under axial perturbations, we compute the quasinormal mode frequencies using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method. The quasinormal mode frequencies provides information about the stability of spacetime, with the real part of the frequency determining the oscillation rate and the imaginary part governing the decay or growth of perturbations. Our results indicate that by imposing appropriate boundary conditions, we find that the JMN-1 spacetime remains dynamically stable under axial perturbations.</description>

      <title>GOALS-JWST: The Warm Molecular Outflows of the Merging Starburst Galaxy NGC 3256</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Integral Field Spectrograph observations of NGC 3256, a local infrared-luminous late-stage merging system with two nuclei roughly 1$\;\rm{kpc}$ apart, both of which have evidence of cold molecular outflows. Using JWST/NIRSpec and MIRI datasets, we investigate this morphologically complex system on spatial scales of $&lt;$100$\;\rm{pc}$, where we focus on the warm molecular H$_2$ gas surrounding the nuclei. We detect collimated outflowing warm H$_2$ gas originating from the southern nucleus, though we do not find significant outflowing H$_2$ gas surrounding the northern nucleus. We measure maximum intrinsic outflow velocities of $\sim$1,000$\;\rm{km}\;\rm{s}^{-1}$, which extend out to a distance of 0.7$\;\rm{kpc}$. Based on H$_2$ S(7)/S(1) ratios, we find a larger fraction of warmer gas near the S nucleus, which decreases with increasing distance from the nucleus, signifying the southern nucleus as a primary source of H$_2$ heating. The gas mass of the warm H$_2$ outflow component is estimated to be $M\rm{_{warm,out}}=(1.4\pm0.2)\times10^6\;\rm{M}_{\odot}$, as much as 6$\%$ of the cold H$_2$ mass estimated using ALMA CO data. The outflow time scale is about $7\times10^5\;\rm{yr}$, resulting in a mass outflow rate $\dot{M}\rm{_{warm,out}}=2.0\pm0.8\;\rm{M}_{\odot}\;\rm{yr}^{-1}$ and kinetic power $P\rm{_{warm,out}}\;\sim\;4\times10^{41}\;\rm{erg}\;\rm{s}^{-1}$. Lastly, regions within our 3.0"x3.0" NIRSpec data where the outflowing gas reside show high [Fe II]/Pa$\beta$ and H$_2$/Br$\gamma$ line ratios, indicate enhanced mechanical heating caused by the outflows. The fluxes and ratios of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) in these regions are not significantly different compared to those elsewhere in the disk, suggesting the outflows may not significantly alter the PAH ionization state or grain size.</description>

      <title>Disc asymmetry characterisation in JWST-observed galaxies at 1 &lt; z &lt; 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel technique using Fourier series and Laguerre polynomials to represent morphological features of disc galaxies. To demonstrate the utility of this technique, we study the evolution of disc asymmetry in a sample of disc galaxies drawn from the Extended Groth Strip and imaged by the JWST Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey as well as archival HST observations. We measure disc asymmetry as the amplitude of the of the m = 1 Fourier harmonic for galaxies within redshift ranges of 1 &lt; z &lt; 4 relative to the amplitude of m = 0 harmonic. We show that when viewed in shorter rest frame wavelengths, disc galaxies have a higher asymmetry as the flux is dominated by star forming regions. We find generally low asymmetry at rest frame infrared wavelengths, where our metric tracks asymmetry in morphological features such as bars and spiral arms. We show that higher mass galaxies have lower asymmetry and vice versa. Higher asymmetry in lower mass galaxies comes from lower mass galaxies (typically) having higher star formation rates. We measure the relation between disc galaxy asymmetry and redshift and find no conclusive relationship between them. We demonstrate the utility of the Fourier-Laguerre technique for recovering physically informative asymmetry measurements as compared to rotational asymmetry measurements. We also release the software pipeline and quantitative analysis for each galaxy.</description>

      <title>CHANCES, the Chilean Cluster Galaxy Evolution Survey: Selection and initial characterisation of clusters and superclusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CHANCES, the CHileAN Cluster galaxy Evolution Survey, will study the evolution of galaxies in and around 100 massive galaxy clusters from the local Universe out to $z = 0.45$, and two superclusters at $z \sim 0.05$ that contain roughly 25 Abell clusters each. CHANCES will use the new 4MOST Spectroscopic Survey Facility on the VISTA 4m telescope to obtain spectra for $\sim$500,000 galaxies with magnitudes $r_\mathrm{AB} &lt; 20.4$, providing comprehensive spectroscopic coverage of each cluster out to $5r_{200}$. Its wide and deep scope will trace massive and dwarf galaxies from the surrounding filaments and groups to the cores of galaxy clusters. This will enable the study of galaxy preprocessing and of the role of the evolving environment on galaxy evolution. In this paper, we present and characterise the sample of clusters and superclusters to be targeted by CHANCES. We used literature catalogues based on X-ray emission and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect to define the cluster sample in a homogeneous way, with attention to cluster mass and redshift, as well as the availability of ancillary data. We calibrated literature mass estimates from various surveys against each other and provide an initial mass estimate for each cluster, which we used to define the radial extent of the 4MOST coverage. We also present an initial assessment of the structure surrounding these clusters based on the redMaPPer red-sequence algorithm as a preview of some of the science CHANCES will enable.</description>

      <title>Stellar Parameters for over Fifty Million stars from SMSS DR4 and Gaia DR3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an updated catalog of stellar parameters, including effective temperature, luminosity classification, and metallicity, for over fifty million stars from the SkyMapper Southern Survey (SMSS) DR4 and Gaia DR3. The accuracy of the derived parameters remains consistent with those achieved with SMSS DR2 using the same methods. Thanks to the advancements in SMSS DR4, photometric-metallicity estimates are now available for an unprecedented number of metal-poor stars. The catalog includes over 13 million metal-poor (MP; [Fe/H] $\leq -1$) stars, nearly three million very metal-poor (VMP; [Fe/H] $\leq -2.0$) stars, and approximately 120,000 extremely metal-poor (EMP; [Fe/H] $\leq -3.0$) stars - representing an increase by a factor of 4-6 compared to SMSS DR2. This catalog, combined with other stellar parameters obtained through our efforts, will be made available at https://nadc.china-vo.org/data/sports/ and https://zenodo.org/records/15108911.</description>

      <title>On matching galaxy number densities to reconstruct galaxy evolutionary tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cumulative number density matching approach equates number densities between adjacent redshifts to derive empirical galaxy evolution tracks from the observed galaxy stellar mass function. However, it is well known that this approach overlooks scatter in mass assembly histories and merger effects, with previous studies relying on model-based corrections, either from hydrodynamical cosmological simulations or adjustments to the evolution of cumulative number density with redshift. Here, we revisit this approach, showing that dark matter halo assembly histories imply evolving number densities that are far from constant. These exhibit an average slope of $d \log n_\text{vir} /dz \sim 0.2$ dex for progenitors at $z=0$, leading to evolutionary tracks where galaxies are $\sim2-3$ times smaller in mass at $z\sim2$ and an order of magnitude smaller by $z\sim7$ compared to the number density matching approach. We show that evolving halo number densities provide realistic evolutionary tracks without relying on model-based corrections. Accounting for random errors in stellar mass measurements is also crucial for robust track derivation. We also discuss a generalization that incorporates a galaxy's star formation activity. When additionally considering the scatter around the $M_\ast-M_\text{vir}$ relation ($\sim0.15$ dex), our evolving halo cumulative number density approach shows that some observed stellar masses, $M_{\text{obs},\ast}$, can exceed the universal baryon fraction $f_\text{bar}\sim0.16$. For instance, at $z=5$, around $2\%$ of progenitor galaxies of haloes with $M_\text{vir} \sim 3\times 10^{12}\,M_\odot$ have $M_{\text{obs},\ast}&gt;f_\text{bar} \; M_\text{vir}$, suggesting a potential ``early galaxy formation problem''. However, when deconvolving mass from random errors this tension is reduced with significant confidence at the $\sim5-6\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>FUV to FIR SED modelling of NGC 205</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New far ultraviolet imaging of the galaxy NGC 205 is presented, which shows the emission is significantly offset ($\sim5^{\prime\prime}$ NW) from the optical and infrared centers of the galaxy. Spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling is applied to investigate the spatial dependence of the star formation history (SFH) of NGC 205, using data from far ultraviolet to far infrared. The SED model includes young and old stellar populations, gas emission, dust emission and dust absorption. The old stellar population has a total mass of $1.1\times10^8$ M$_{\odot}$ whereas the young population has a much smaller total mass of 3200 M$_{\odot}$. The best forms of SFH for old and young stars are found to be exponentially declining bursts with start times $t_0$ yr ago and e-folding times $\tau$ yr. The old stellar population has uniform $t_0$=9.5 Gyr, with $\tau$ decreasing with radius from 1 Gyr to 500 Myr. The young stellar population has $t_0$=900 Myr and $\tau$=800 Myr, both uniform across NGC 205. The young and old stellar mass surface densities are exponential in radius with scale lengths of 40 and 110 pc, respectively. The dust heating has a $\sim$40\% contribution from young stars and $\sim$60\% from old stars.</description>

      <title>Stellar parameters, extinction, and distances for stars in SMSS DR2 by SPar method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The availability of large datasets containing stellar parameters, distances, and extinctions for stars in the Milky Way, particularly within the Galactic disk, is essential for advancing our understanding of the Galaxy's stellar populations, structure, kinematics, and chemical evolution. In this study, we present a catalog of stellar parameters, including effective temperature (\teff), metallicity (\feh), absolute magnitudes ($M_{G}$), distances ($d$), and reddening values (\ebr), for a sample of 141 million stars from the SkyMapper Southern Survey (SMSS). These parameters are derived using the SPar algorithm, which employs a fitting procedure to match multi-band photometric observations and estimate the stellar properties (\teff, \feh, $M_G$, $d$, and \ebr) on an individual star basis, following the methodology outlined in our previous work. This study successfully determines stellar parameters and extinction values simultaneously for stars located in high and low Galactic latitudes. The resulting stellar parameters and extinction values are in good agreement with results from other studies, demonstrating the robustness of our method. We derive a temperature dispersion of 195\,K and a metallicity dispersion of 0.31\,dex when comparing our results with spectroscopic data. The catalog produced in this work provides a valuable resource for future research on the Galactic metallicity distribution function, the structure of the Galaxy, three-dimensional extinction mapping, and other related astrophysical topics.</description>

      <title>Hercules stream and the outer elliptical ring R1R2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the formation of the Hercules stream in the model Galactic disk which includes the outer resonance ring R1R2 located near the Outer Lindblad Resonance (OLR) of the bar. The Hercules region and the anti-Hercules region introduced for calibration were restricted in space by the solar neighborhood, r&lt;0.5 kpc, and on the (VR, VT) plane by ellipses centered at VR=25 and VT=200 km s-1 (Hercules), and at VR=-25 and VT=200 km s-1 (anti-Hercules). The number of stars in the Hercules region reaches a maximum at the time period of 2--3 Gyr from the start of simulation and the number of stars in the anti-Hercules region oscillates with a period of 1.8 +/-0.1 Gyr. The majority of stars in the model disk located in the Hercules and anti-Hercules regions have orbits elongated perpendicular and parallel to the bar, respectively. There are two types of orbits in the Hercules region. Orbits of the first type always lie inside a figure bounded by two ellipses elongated perpendicular to the bar. Orbits of the second type are elongated at the angles of -60 or 60 degrees to the major axis of the bar most of the time. The distribution of stars in the Hercules region along the period of slow oscillations in the angular momentum has two maxima: P=0.7 and 2.6 Gyr corresponding to orbits of the first and second type. In the anti-Hercules region, most orbits are captured by libration relative to the major axis of the bar with a period of 1.9 Gyr. In general, orbits in the Hercules and anti-Hercules regions support the outer rings R1 and R2 elongated perpendicular and parallel to the bar, respectively. Stars from the Gaia DR3 catalog located in the Hercules region appear to be, on average, brighter, bluer and more luminous than stars in the anti-Hercules region which is probably caused by selection effects due to different distributions of these stellar samples over the Galactic latitude b.</description>

      <title>Coherent Self-Interactions of Dark Matter in the Bullet Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many models of dark matter include self-interactions beyond gravity. A variety of astrophysical observations have previously been used to place limits on the strength of such self-interactions. However, previous works have generally focused either on short-range interactions resulting in individual dark matter particles scattering from one another, or on effectively infinite-range interactions which sum over entire dark matter halos. In this work, we focus on the intermediate regime: forces with range much larger than dark matter particles' inter-particle spacing, but still shorter than the length scales of known halos. We show that gradients in the dark matter density of such halos would still lead to observable effects. We focus primarily on effects in the Bullet Cluster, where finite-range forces would lead either to a modification of the collision velocity of the cluster or to a separation of the dark matter and the galaxies of each cluster after the collision. We also consider constraints from the binding of ultrafaint dwarf galaxy halos, and from gravitational lensing of the Abell 370 cluster. Taken together, these observations allow us to set the strongest constraints on dark matter self-interactions over many orders of magnitude in range below $\sim10$ kpc, surpassing existing limits by orders of magnitude throughout.</description>

      <title>An activity transition in FRB 20201124A: methodological rigor, detection of frequency-dependent cessation, and a geometric magnetar model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report detections of fast radio bursts (FRBs) from the repeating source FRB 20201124A with Apertif/WSRT and GMRT, and measurements of basic burst properties, especially the dispersion measure (DM) and fluence. Based on comparisons of these properties with previously published larger samples, we argue that the excess DM reported earlier for pulses with integrated signal to noise ratio $\lesssim 1000$ is due to incompletely accounting for the so-called sad trombone effect, even when using structure-maximizing DM algorithms. Our investigations of fluence distributions next lead us to advise against formal power-law fitting, especially dissuading the use of the least-square method, and we demonstrate the large biases involved. A maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) provides a much more accurate estimate of the power law and we provide accessible code for direct inclusion in future research. Our GMRT observations were fortuitously scheduled around the end of the activity cycle as recorded by FAST. We detected several bursts (one of them very strong) at 400/600 MHz, a few hours after sensitive FAST non-detections already showed the 1.3 GHz FRB emission to have ceased. After FRB 20180916B, this is a second example of a frequency-dependent activity window identified in a repeating FRB source. Since numerous efforts have so-far failed to determine a spin period for FRB 20201124A, we conjecture it to be an ultra-long period magnetar, with a period on the scale of months, and with a very wide, highly irregular duty cycle. Assuming the emission comes from closed field lines, we use radius-to-frequency mapping and polarization information from other studies to constrain the magnetospheric geometry and location of the emission region. Our initial findings are consistent with a possible connection between FRBs and crustal motion events.</description>

      <title>Modeling parity-violating spectra in Galactic dust polarization with filaments and its applications to cosmic birefringence searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06214v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the dust-filament-based model presented in Herv\'ias-Caimapo &amp; Huffenberger 2022 to produce parity-violating foreground spectra by manipulating the filament orientations relative to the magnetic field. We calibrate our model to observations of the misalignment angle using cross-correlations of Planck and HI 21-cm line data, producing a fiducial model that predicts a $\mathcal{D}_{\ell}^{EB}\sim$few $\mu$K$^2$ dust signal at 353 GHz and where $\sim 56$\% of filaments have a positive misalignment angle. The main purpose of this model is to be used as dust with non-zero parity-violating emission in forecasting a measurement of cosmic birefringence by upcoming experiments. Here, we also use our fiducial model to assess the impact of dust in measurements of the isotropic cosmic birefringence angle $\beta$ with Planck data by measuring the misalignment angle as a function of scale, as well as directly using our model's $\mathcal{D}_{\ell}^{EB}$ prediction as a template. In both cases, we measure $\beta$ to be consistent within $0.83\sigma$ of the analyses that use the 353 GHz channel of Planck to constrain the filamentary misalignment or that use the commander sky model as a template for the dust $\mathcal{D}_{\ell}^{EB}$ spectrum. We attribute this consistency to the extra degrees of freedom introduced by the ad-hoc amplitude parameters for the dust parity-violating spectrum, which are capable of absorbing most of the differences between the model and data as long as a reasonable dust model is provided.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Long-Ranged Interactions Between Dark Matter and the Standard Model</title>

Abstract: Dark matter's existence is known thanks to its gravitational interaction with Standard Model particles, but it remains unknown whether this is the only force present between them. While many searches for such new interactions with dark matter focus on short-range, contact-like interactions, it is also possible that there exist weak, long-ranged forces between dark matter and the Standard Model. In this work, we present two types of constraints on such new interactions. First, we consider constraints arising from the fact that such a force would also induce long range interactions between Standard Model particles themselves, as well as between dark matter particles themselves. Combining the constraints on these individual forces generally sets the strongest constraints available on new Standard Model-dark matter interactions. Second, we consider the possibility of constraining new long-ranged interactions between dark matter and the Standard Model using the effects of dynamical friction in ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, especially Segue I. Such new interactions would accelerate the transfer of kinetic energy from stars to their surrounding dark matter, slowly reducing their orbits; the present-day stellar half-light radius of Segue I therefore allows us to exclude new forces which would have reduced stars' orbital radii below this scale by now.</description>

      <title>Scattering of wave dark matter by supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent simulations of wave dark matter around black hole binaries revealed the formation of a universal density profile that co-rotates with the binary. We derive this profile from first principles, interpreting it as the steady state of a scattering process. We find that the scattering becomes particularly efficient when the ratio of the binary separation to the dark matter's de Broglie wavelength assumes certain discrete values, which can be interpreted as bound state resonances. After estimating the amount of dark matter that undergoes this type of scattering off supermassive black hole binaries at galactic centers, we demonstrate that the process can induce an observable modification of the slope of the Pulsar Timing Array spectrum. This opens up a new possibility to gain insights on the nature of dark matter from observations of low-frequency gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>The Type I Superluminous Supernova Catalogue II: Spectroscopic Evolution in the Photospheric Phase, Velocity Measurements, and Constraints on Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are among the most energetic explosions in the universe, reaching luminosities up to 100 times greater than those of normal supernovae. Detailed spectral analysis hold the potential to reveal their progenitors and underlying energy sources. This paper presents the largest compilation of SLSN photospheric spectra to date, encompassing data from ePESSTO+, the FLEET search and all published spectra up to December 2022. The dataset includes a total of 974 spectra of 234 SLSNe. By constructing average phase binned spectra, we find SLSNe initially exhibit high temperatures (10000 to 11000 K), with blue continua and weak lines. A rapid transformation follows, as temperatures drop to 5000 to 6000 K by 40 days post peak, leading to stronger P-Cygni features. These averages also suggest a fraction of SLSNe may contain some He at explosion. Variance within the dataset is slightly reduced when defining the phase of spectra relative to explosion, rather than peak, and normalising to the population's median e-folding time. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) supports this, requiring fewer components to explain the same level of variation when binning data by scaled days from explosion, suggesting a more homogeneous grouping. Using PCA and K-Means clustering, we identify outlying objects with unusual spectroscopic evolution and evidence for energy input from interaction, but find not support for groupings of two or more statistically significant subpopulations. We find Fe II {\lambda}5169 lines velocities closely track the radius implied from blackbody fits, indicating formation near the photosphere. We also confirm a correlation between velocity and velocity gradient, which can be explained if all SLSNe are in homologous expansion but with different scale velocities. This behaviour aligns with expectations for an internal powering mechanism.</description>
