      <title>Universal Kerr effect in A-type antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) is a powerful probe of broken time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$), typically used to study ferromagnets. While MOKE has been observed in some antiferromagnets (AFMs) with vanishing magnetization, it is often associated with structures whose symmetry is lower than basic collinear, bipartite order. In contrast, theory predicts a mechanism for MOKE intrinsic to all AFMs of A-type, i.e. layered AFMs in which ferromagnetic layers are antiferromagnetically aligned. Here we report the first experimental confirmation of this mechanism. We achieve this by measuring the imaginary component of MOKE as a function of photon energy in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, an A-type AFM where $\mathcal{T}$ is preserved in combination with a translation. By comparing the experimental results with model calculations, we demonstrate that observable MOKE should be expected in all collinear A-type AFMs with out-of-plane spin order, thus enabling optical detection of AFM domains and expanding the scope of MOKE to few-layer AFMs.</description>

      <title>DFT based insights into elastic, thermophysical, electronic and optical properties of topological insulators XTe5 (X = Zr, Hf)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal penta-tellurides, ZrTe5 and HfTe5 have been recently drawn a lot of attention due to their fascinating physical properties and for being prominent materials showing topological phase transitions. In this study, we investigated mechanical, thermophysical and optoelectronic properties of these materials which remained almost unexplored till now. We also studied electronic properties and compared those with previous studies. We used Density Functional Theory (DFT) based calculations to study all of these properties. This study suggests that the materials are mechanically stable, possess high mechanical and bonding anisotropy and are brittle in nature. Our study also suggests that the compounds are soft in nature and they contain a mixture of covalent and metallic bonding. Investigation of thermophysical properties, namely, Gr\"uneisen parameter and Debye temperature indicates weak bonding strength in these compounds. Analysis of melting temperature, thermal expansion coefficient, heat capacity, radiation factor, acoustic impedance, and minimum thermal conductivity suggests their possible application in acoustic and thermoelectric devices. Examination of their optical characteristics reveals that they have a considerable reflectivity from the infrared to the ultraviolet region. The refractive indices of these materials are high at low energy so they are potential candidates for reflective coating of solar radiation. There have been debates over exact topological natures of these compounds, whether they are semi-metals or insulators. Our study of electronic band structure and density of states reveal that spin-orbit interaction is responsible for enhancing energy gaps and promoting insulating characteristics in these compounds.</description>

      <title>High-throughput screening of 2D materials identifies p-type monolayer WS$_2$ as potential ultra-high mobility semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2D semiconductors offer a promising pathway to replace silicon in next-generation electronics. Among their many advantages, 2D materials possess atomically-sharp surfaces and enable scaling the channel thickness down to the monolayer limit. However, these materials exhibit comparatively lower charge carrier mobility and higher contact resistance than 3D semiconductors, making it challenging to realize high-performance devices at scale. In this work, we search for high-mobility 2D materials by combining a high-throughput screening strategy with state-of-the-art calculations based on the ab initio Boltzmann transport equation. Our analysis singles out a known transition metal dichalcogenide, monolayer WS$_2$, as the most promising 2D semiconductor, with the potential to reach ultra-high room-temperature hole mobilities in excess of 1300 cm$^2$/Vs should Ohmic contacts and low defect densities be achieved. Our work also highlights the importance of performing full-blown ab initio transport calculations to achieve predictive accuracy, including spin-orbital couplings, quasiparticle corrections, dipole and quadrupole long-range electron-phonon interactions, as well as scattering by point defects and extended defects.</description>

      <title>Strain-Induced Enhancement of Spin Pumping in Pt/YIG Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing spin-to-charge (S$\rightarrow$C) conversion efficiency remains a key challenge in spintronic materials research. In this work we investigate the effect of substrate-induced strains onto the S$\rightarrow$C efficiency. On one hand, we analyze strains-induced magnetic anisotropies in yttrium iron garnet (Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$, YIG) by comparing the magnetic and structural properties of YIG films grown on Gd$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ (GGG) and (CaGd)$_3$(MgZrGa)$_5$O$_{12}$ (SGGG) substrates. Differences in lattice mismatch - YIG//GGG ($\eta = -0.06 \%$) and YIG//SGGG ($\eta = -0.83 \%$) - lead to out-of-plane tensile strains in the first case and unexpected compressive strain in the latter. On the other hand, we study the spin injection efficiency on Pt/YIG bilayers evaluated by the Inverse Spin Hall Effect (ISHE). We find that the resulting perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in YIG//SGGG, while not dominant over shape anisotropy, correlates with enhanced ISHE signals as observed in Spin Pumping Ferromagnetic Resonance (SP-FMR) and Spin Seebeck effect (SSE) experiments. Strain engineering proves effective in enhancing spin-to-charge conversion, providing insight into the design of efficient spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Accelerated discovery of cost-effective photoabsorber materials for near-infrared ({\lambda}=1600 nm) photodetector applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current infrared sensing devices are based on costly materials with relatively few viable alternatives known. To identify promising candidate materials for infrared photodetection, we have developed a high-throughput screening methodology based on high-accuracy r$^2$SCAN and HSE calculations in density functional theory. Using this method, we identify ten already synthesized materials between the inverse perovskite family, barium silver pnictide family, the alkaline pnictide family, and ZnSnAs$_2$ as top candidates. Among these, ZnSnAs$_2$ emerges as the most promising candidate due to its experimentally verified band gap of 0.74 eV at 0 K, and its cost-effective synthesis through Bridgman growth. BaAgP also shows potential with an HSE-calculated band gap of 0.64 eV, although further experimental validation is required. Lastly, we discover an additional material, Ca$_3$BiP, which has not been previously synthesized, but exhibits a promising optical spectra and a band gap of 0.56 eV. The method applied in this work is sufficiently general to screen wider bandgap materials in high-throughput and now extended to narrow-band gap materials.</description>

      <title>PhaseT3M: 3D Imaging at 1.6 {\AA} Resolution via Electron Cryo-Tomography with Nonlinear Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) enables 3D imaging of complex, radiation-sensitive structures with molecular detail. However, image contrast from the interference of scattered electrons is nonlinear with atomic density and multiple scattering further complicates interpretation. These effects degrade resolution, particularly in conventional reconstruction algorithms, which assume linearity. Particle averaging can reduce such issues but is unsuitable for heterogeneous or dynamic samples ubiquitous in biology, chemistry, and materials sciences. Here, we develop a phase retrieval-based cryo-ET method, PhaseT3M. We experimentally demonstrate its application to a ~7 nm Co3O4 nanoparticle on ~30 nm carbon substrate, achieving a maximum resolution of 1.6 {\AA}, surpassing conventional limits using standard cryo-TEM equipment. PhaseT3M uses a multislice model for multiple scattering and Bayesian optimization for alignment and computational aberration correction, with a positivity constraint to recover 'missing wedge' information. Applied directly to biological particles, it enhances resolution and reduces artifacts, establishing a new standard for routine 3D imaging of complex, radiation-sensitive materials.</description>

      <title>Terahertz field effect in a two-dimensional semiconductor MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered two-dimensional (2D) materials, with their atomic-scale thickness and tunable electronic, optical, and mechanical properties, open many promising pathways to significantly advance modern electronics. The field effect caused by a strong electric field, typically of MV/cm level, applied perpendicular to the material layers, is a highly effective method for controlling these properties. Field effect allows the regulation of the electron flow in transistor channels, improves the photodetector efficiency and spectral range, and facilitates the exploration of novel exotic quantum phenomena in 2D materials. However, existing approaches to induce the field effect in 2D materials utilize circuit-based electrical gating methods fundamentally limited to microwave response rates. Device-compatible ultrafast, sub-picosecond control needed for modern technology and basic science applications still remains a challenge. In this study, we demonstrate such an ultrafast field effect in atomically thin MoS2, an archetypal 2D semiconductor, embedded in a hybrid 3D-2D terahertz nanoantenna structure. This nanoantenna efficiently converts an incident terahertz electric field into the vertical ultrafast gating field in MoS2 while simultaneously enhancing it to the required MV/cm level. We observe the terahertz field effect optically as coherent terahertz-induced Stark shift of characteristic exciton resonances in MoS2. Our results enable novel developments in technology and the fundamental science of 2D materials, where the terahertz field effect is crucial.</description>

      <title>Potentiometric detection of spin polarization expected at the surface of FeTe0.6Se0.4 in the effective p-wave superconducting state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, the quest for non-Abelian anyons is attracting tremendous attention. In particular, a Majorana quasiparticle has attracted great interest since the non-Abelian anyon is a key particle for topological quantum computation. Much effort has been paid for the quest of the Majorana state in solids, and some candidate material platforms are reported. Among various materials that can host the Majorana state, chiral p-wave superconductor is one of the suitable materials and the iron-based layered superconductor FeTeSe is one of the promising material platforms because its surface can host effective p-wave superconducting state that is analogous to chiral p-wave superconducting state thanks to its topological surface state. Given that a chiral p-wave superconductor possesses spin polarization, detecting the spin polarization can be evidence for the chiral p-wave trait, which results in the existence of Majorana excitation. Here, we show successful detection of the spin polarization at the surface of FeTe0.6Se0.4 in its superconducting state, where the spin polarization is detected via a potentiometric method. Amplitudes of the spin signal exhibit characteristic dependence for temperature and bias current, suggesting detection of spin polarization of the Bogoliubov quasiparticles. Our achievement opens a new avenue to explore topological superconductivity for fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>A Molecular Dynamics Study of Size Effects for Critical Resolved Shear Stress in Nickel Superalloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present in this work a molecular dynamics study of a size effect relating to the volume fraction of gamma-prime precipitate of edge dislocation motion in a simple model of Nickel superalloys. We model the superalloy as periodically spaced cubic gamma-prime precipitates inside a uniform gamma matrix. We then analyze the motion of paired edge dislocations in the gamma phase when subject to an external shear stress for various volume fractions of the gamma-prime precipitate for a wide range of temperatures, from 300 K to 700 K. While the variation of dislocation velocity is not significant, the critical resolved shear stress is found to exhibit a power law dependence on the volume fraction of the gamma-prime precipitate with two distinct regimes which have similar exponent but markedly different prefactors; we also observe that this two-regime behavior remains true across a wide range of temperatures. We present a detailed analysis of this behavior and reduce it to a linear dependence of the critical resolved shear stress on the length of the gamma-prime precipitate along the direction of dislocation motion. We further identify the critical length scale underlying the transition between the two observed regimes as the total core width of the paired dislocations in a pure gamma-prime system, which includes in addition to the complex stacking fault separating the partials of the paired dislocations the width of the anti-phase boundary that is formed between the super-dislocations. The results presented in this work provides new details on the strengthening effect of gamma-prime precipitates in nickel superalloys and also has important implications for larger scale dislocation dynamics studies for nickel superalloys.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent Transport Studies of Fe/MoxCr1-xS2/Fe Magnetic Tunnel Junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, spin-dependent electron transport in Fe/MoxCr1-xS2/Fe magnetic tunnel junction is studied. Spin-transport for different thicknesses (1, 3, 5, and 7 layers) of the spacer MoS2 and for two different surface orientations of the Fe electrode, the Fe(001) and Fe(111) surface and the effect of substitutional doping of magnetic impurity Cr on the spin-transport of the junctions is investigated. The electronic structure of the heterostructure shows presence of metal induced states in the semiconducting MoS2 at the Fe/MoS2 interface and the effect of the interface is limited to the first two layers of MoS2 from the interface. The I-V characteristics of the junctions for the monolayer and three-layer MoS2 spacer show linear behaviour due to the metallic nature of the junction. The tunneling nature of the junction is observed for the thicker junctions with five-layer and seven-layer spacers. With the introduction of magnetic impurity, we have shown that spin-polarisation in the spacer is improved, thus increasing the spin-polarised current. The Cr-defect states are observed below the conduction band and the Cr-doped devices are stable up to a bias of 0.5V. The close packed Fe(111) surface is better electrode material for tunneling of electrons through the junction compared to the Fe(001) surface due to lower surface energy and reduced transmission.</description>

      <title>Mumott -- a Python package for the analysis of multi-modal tensor tomography data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small and wide angle x-ray scattering tensor tomography are powerful methods for studying anisotropic nanostructures in a volume-resolved manner, and are becoming increasingly available to users of synchrotron facilities. The analysis of such experiments requires, however, advanced procedures and algorithms, which creates a barrier for the wider adoption of these techniques. Here, in response to this challenge, we introduce the mumott package. It is written in Python with computationally demanding tasks handled via just-in-time compilation using both CPU and GPU resources. The package is being developed with a focus on usability and extensibility, while achieving a high computational efficiency. Following a short introduction to the common workflow, we review key features, outline the underlying object-oriented framework, and demonstrate the computational performance. By developing the mumott package and making it generally available, we hope to lower the threshold for the adoption of tensor tomography and to make these techniques accessible to a larger research community.</description>

      <title>Sum rules for x-ray circular and linear dichroism based on complete magnetic multipole basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and X-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD) are powerful spectroscopic techniques for probing magnetic properties in solids. In this study, we revisit the XMCD and XMLD sum rules within a complete magnetic multipole basis that incorporates both spinless and spinful multipoles. We demonstrate that these multipoles can be clearly distinguished and individually detected through the sum-rule formalism. Within this framework, the anisotropic magnetic dipole term is naturally derived in XMCD, offering a microscopic origin for ferromagnetic-like behavior in antiferromagnets. Furthermore, we derive the sum rules for out-of-plane and in-plane XMLD regarding electric quadrupole contributions defined based on the complete multipole basis. Our theoretical approach provides a unified, symmetry-consistent framework for analyzing dichroic signals in various magnetic materials. These findings deepen the understanding of XMCD and XMLD and open pathways to exploring complex magnetic structures and spin-orbit coupling effects in emergent magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>A strategy for the enhancement of barocaloric performance in plastic crystal solid solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The drive for solid-state heating and cooling technologies is fuelled by their potential for enhanced sustainability and environmental impact compared to traditional vapour compression devices. The recent discovery of colossal barocaloric (BC) effects in the plastic crystal (PC) neopentyl glycol (NPG) has highlighted PCs as promising candidates for future solid-state thermal management. However, achieving optimal operational temperatures, low-pressure requirements, and substantial entropy changes in a single material remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a strategy to address these constraints by forming a ternary solid solution of neopentyl PCs: NPG, pentaglycerine (PG) and pentaerythritol (PE). Notably, by including only a small quantity (2%) of the third component, we observe a seven-fold increase in reversible isothermal entropy change (|{\Delta}Sit,rev| = 13.4 J kg-1 K-1) and twenty-fold increase in operational temperature span ({\Delta}Tspan = 18 K) at pressures of 1 kbar, compared to pure NPG. The origin of these enhancements is revealed by quasielastic neutron scattering and synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction. We find a reduction in the activation energies of the rotational modes associated with the main entropic component of the BC effect, linked to a weakening of the intermolecular hydrogen bond network. This is proposed to improve the phase transition reversibility and operational temperature span by facilitating a broadened first-order phase transition, characterised by a significant phase co-existence region. These findings suggest an effective strategy for practicable molecular BCs, which is to design solid solutions that exploit the large compositional phase space of multi-component molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Breaking scaling relations with inverse catalysts: a machine learning exploration of trends in $\mathrm{CO_2}$ hydrogenation energy barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conversion of $\mathrm{CO_2}$ into useful products such as methanol is a key strategy for abating climate change and our dependence on fossil fuels. Developing new catalysts for this process is costly and time-consuming and can thus benefit from computational exploration of possible active sites. However, this is complicated by the complexity of the materials and reaction networks. Here, we present a workflow for exploring transition states of elementary reaction steps at inverse catalysts, which is based on the training of a neural network-based machine learning interatomic potential. We focus on the crucial formate intermediate and its formation over nanoclusters of indium oxide supported on Cu(111). The speedup compared to an approach purely based on density functional theory allows us to probe a wide variety of active sites found at nanoclusters of different sizes and stoichiometries. Analysis of the obtained set of transition state geometries reveals different structure--activity trends at the edge or interior of the nanoclusters. Furthermore, the identified geometries allow for the breaking of linear scaling relations, which could be a key underlying reason for the excellent catalytic performance of inverse catalysts observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Exciton Basis Description of Ultrafast Triplet Separation in Pentacene-(Tetracene)2-Pentacene Intramolecular Singlet Fission Chromophore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise understanding of the electronic structures of optically dark triplet-triplet multiexcitons that are the intermediate states in singlet fission (SF) continues to be a challenge. This is particularly true for intramolecular singlet fission (iSF) chromophores, that are oligomers of large monomer molecules. We have performed quantum many-body calculations of the complete set of excited states relevant to iSF in Pentacene-(Tetracene)2-Pentacene oligomers, consisting of two terminal pentacene monomers linked by two tetracene monomers. Our computations use an exciton basis that gives physical pictorial descriptions of all eigenstates, and are performed over an active space of twenty-eight monomer molecular orbitals, including configuration interaction with all relevant quadruple excitations within the active space, thereby ensuring very high precision. We discuss the many-electron structures of the optical predominantly intramonomer spin-singlets, intermonomer charge-transfer excitations, and most importantly, the complete set of low energy covalent triplet-triplet multiexcitons. We are able to explain the weak binding energy of the pentacene-tetracene triplet-triplet eigenstate that is generated following photoexcitation. We explain the increase in lifetime with increasing numbers of tetracene monomers of the transient absorption associated with contiguous pentacene-tetracene triplet-triplet in this family of oligomers. We are consequently able to give a pictorial description of the triplet separation following generation of the initial triplet-triplet, leading to a state with individual triplets occupying only the two pentacene monomers. We expect many applications of our theoretical approach to triplet separation.</description>

      <title>Generation of Phonons with Angular Momentum During Ultrafast Demagnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major question in the field of femtosecond laser-induced demagnetization is whereto the angular momentum lost by the electrons is transferred. Recent ultrafast electron diffraction measurements [Tauchert \textit{et al.}, Nature {\bf 602}, 73 (2022)] suggest that this angular momentum is transferred to the rotational motion of atoms on a sub-picosecond timescale, but a theory confirmation of this proposition has yet to be given. Here we investigate the coupled electron-nuclear dynamics during ultrafast demagnetization of L1$_0$ FePt, using Ehrenfest nuclear dynamics simulations combined with the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) framework. We demonstrate that atomic rotations appear, i.e., the generation of phonons carrying finite angular momentum following ultrafast demagnetization. We further show that both ultrafast demagnetization and the generation of phonons with angular momentum arise from symmetry constraints imposed by the spin-orbit coupling, thus providing insight in spin-phonon interaction at ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The link between composition, microstructure and mechanics of NASH and KASH gels is elusive, even in pure metakaolin-based geopolymes. This article exploits molecular mechanics, coarse-grained nanomechanics and micromechanics, to interpret new experimental results from microscopy, porosimetry and nanoindentation. KASH displays a finer nanogranular structure than NASH (3 vs 30 nm particle diameters, 5 vs 50 nm average pore diameters), higher skeletal density (2.3 vs 2.02 g/cm$^3$), nanoindentation moduli (9.21 vs 7.5 GPa) and hardness (0.56 vs 0.37 GPa) despite a higher total porosity (0.48-0.53 vs 0.38). This suggests a stiffer and stronger solid skeleton for KASH, confirmed through predictive molecular dynamics simulations on recent and new models of NASH and KASH. The atomistic simulations inform mechanical interactions for new, coarse-grained, particle-based models of NASH and KASH. The resulting simulations predict the nanoindentation result that KASH is stiffer than equally porous NASH and the impact of formation eigenstresses on elastic moduli.</description>

      <title>Phase stabilization of In2Se3 by disordered Ni intercalation and its enhanced thermoelectrical performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) layered materials have gained significant attention owing to their distinctive structure and unique properties. The weak interlayer bonding in vdW layered materials enables guest atom intercalation, allowing precise tuning of their physical and chemical properties. In this work, a ternary compound, NixIn2Se3 (x = 0-0.3), with Ni randomly occupying the interlayers of In2Se3, was synthesized via an intercalation route driven by electron injection. The intercalated Ni atoms act as anchor points within the interlayer of In2Se3, which effectively suppresses the phase transition of In2Se3 at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the disordered Ni intercalation significantly enhanced the electrical conductivity of In2Se3 through electron injection, while reducing the thermal conductivity due to the interlayer phonon scattering, leading to an improved thermoelectric performance. For instance, the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of Ni0.3In2Se3 increased by 86% (in-plane) and 222% (out-of-plane) compared to In2Se3 at 500 oC. These findings not only provide an effective strategy to enhance the performance of layered thermoelectric materials, but also demonstrate the potential of intercalation chemistry for expanding the application scope of van der Waals (vdW) layered materials.</description>

      <title>Finite-strain constitutive model for shape memory alloys formulated in the logarithmic strain space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a finite-strain version of an established three-dimensional constitutive model for polycrystalline shape memory alloys (SMA) that is able to account for the large deformations and rotations that SMA components may undergo. The model is constructed by applying the logarithmic strain space approach to the original small-strain model, which was formulated within the Generalized Standard Materials framework and features a refined dissipation (rate) function. Additionally, the free energy function is augmented to be more versatile in capturing the transformation kinetics. The model is implemented into finite element software. To demonstrate the model performance and validate the implementation, material parameters are fitted to the experimental data of two SMA, and two computational simulations of SMA components are conducted. The applied approach is highly flexible from the perspective of the future incorporation of other phenomena, e.g., irreversibility associated with plasticity, into the model.</description>

      <title>Effect of pressure on the transport properties and thermoelectric performance of Dirac semimetal ZrTe5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we have investigated and compared the effect of hydrostatic pressure up to ~20 kbar on the transport properties of ZrTe5 single crystals grown by chemical vapor transport (CVT) and flux methods. With the application of pressure, the electrical resistivity Rho(T) and thermopower S(T) of both crystals were found to increase in the whole temperature range unlike the other known thermoelectric materials, such as Bi2Te3, SnSe etc. This observation is supported by the complementary first-principles band structure calculation as the application of pressure widens the direct bandgap at {\Gamma} point. Moreover, the analysis of the pressure dependent magneto-transport and Shubnikov de-Hass oscillation results revealed an increase in carrier concentration and effective mass along with the reduction of mobility as pressure rises. Furthermore, with the application of pressure, the flux-grown ZrTe5 crystals display a transition from unipolar to bipolar charge transport as evidenced by the emergence of resistivity peak at T* under high pressure, unlike the CVT-grown ZrTe5 crystals where the bipolar charge transport near its characteristic resistivity peak (Tp) remains unaffected.</description>

      <title>Electronic Paddlewheels Impact the Dynamics of Superionic Conduction in AgI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state ion conductors hold promise as next generation battery materials. To realize their full potential, an understanding of atomic-scale ion conduction mechanisms is needed, including ionic and electronic degrees of freedom. Molecular simulations can create such an understanding, however, including a description of electronic structure necessitates computationally expensive methods that limit their application to small scales. We examine an alternative approach, in which neural network models are used to efficiently sample ionic configurations and dynamics at ab initio accuracy. Then, these configurations are used to determine electronic properties in a post-processing step. We demonstrate this approach by modeling the superionic phase of AgI, in which cation diffusion is coupled to rotational motion of local electron density on the surrounding iodide ions, termed electronic paddlewheels. The neural network potential can capture the many-body effects of electronic paddlewheels on ionic dynamics, but classical force field models cannot. Through an analysis rooted the generalized Langevin equation framework, we find that electronic paddlewheels have a significant impact on the time-dependent friction experienced by a mobile cation. Our approach will enable investigations of electronic fluctuations in materials on large length and time scales, and ultimately the control of ion dynamics through electronic paddlewheels.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature magnetoelectric coupling in strontium titanate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric (ME) multiferroics enable efficient interconversion of electrical and magnetic signals, offering pathways toward substantial reduction of power consumption in next-generation computing and information technologies. However, despite decades of research, the persistence of ME coupling at room-temperature, an indispensable feature for practical applications, remains exceedingly rare in single-phase materials, due to symmetry constraints imposed by magnetic point groups and competing electronic requirements for ferroelectricity and magnetism. Here we report the coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism at 780 K and a strong ME coupling with a converse ME coupling coefficient up to 498 ps/m at room-temperature in strontium titanate by dedicated vacancy engineering. The asymmetric distribution of oxygen vacancies surrounding titanium vacancies enables atomic displacement of titanium and charge injection, providing joint origin for ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, as confirmed by atomic-scale structural analysis and first-principles calculations. The mechanism of ME coupling is offered as the hopping of oxygen vacancies under electric fields, which leads to the rearrangement of electronic configuration. Our work opens an avenue for designing multiferroics, overcoming the long-standing scarcity of room-temperature single-phase multiferroics.</description>

      <title>Strain Effect on Rashba Splitting and Phonon Scattering to Improve Thermoelectric Performance of 2D Heterobilayer MoTe$_{2}$/PtS$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rashba spin-orbit coupling significantly modifies the electronic band structure in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) heterobilayers, which may enhance their thermoelectric (TE) properties. In this study, we use first-principles calculations and Boltzmann transport theory to explore the strain effect on the TE performance of the 2D vdW heterobilayer MoTe$_{2}$/PtS$_{2}$. A strong Rashba spin-splitting is observed in the valence band, resulting in an increase in the Seebeck coefficient for p-type. The lattice thermal conductivity of MoTe$_{2}$/PtS$_{2}$ is remarkably low about of 0.6 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at $T = 300$ K due to large anharmonic scattering. Furthermore, biaxial strain enhances the power factor (PF) by introducing band convergence. At a strain of 2\%, the optimal PF for the n-type material reaches 170 $\mu$W/cmK$^{2}$, indicating approximately 84.78\% increase compared to the unstrained state (92 $\mu$W/cmK$^{2}$). Given the low lattice thermal conductivity, the optimized figure of merit $ZT$ achieves up to 0.88 at 900 K for n-type. Our findings indicate that MoTe$_{2}$/PtS$_{2}$ is a highly promising candidate for 2D heterobilayer TE materials, owing to its strong Rashba splitting and significant anharmonicity.</description>

      <title>Crack Face Contact Modeling is Essential to Predict Crack-Parallel Stresses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-field fracture models provide a powerful approach to modeling fracture, potentially enabling the unguided prediction of crack growth in complex patterns. To ensure that only tensile stresses and not compressive stresses drive crack growth, several models have been proposed that aim to distinguish between compressive and tensile loads. However, these models have a critical shortcoming: they do not account for the crack direction, and hence they cannot distinguish between crack-normal tensile stresses that drive crack growth and crack-parallel stresses that do not.
  In this study, we apply a phase-field fracture model, developed in our earlier work, that uses the crack direction to distinguish crack-parallel stresses from crack-normal stresses. This provides a transparent energetic formulation that drives cracks to grow in when crack faces open or slide past each other, while the cracks respond like the intact solid when the crack faces contact under normal compressive loads. We compare our approach against two widely used approaches, Spectral splitting and the Volumetric-Deviatoric splitting, and find that these predict unphysical crack growth and unphysical stress concentrations under loading conditions in which these should not occur. Specifically, we show that the splitting models predict spurious crack growth and stress concentration under pure crack-parallel normal stresses. However, our formulation, which resolves the crack-parallel stresses from the crack-normal stresses, predicts these correctly.</description>

      <title>Energetics of the nucleation and glide of disconnection modes in symmetric tilt grain boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GBs evolve by the nucleation and glide of disconnections, which are dislocations with a step character. In this work, motivated by recent success in predicting GB properties such as the shear coupling factor and mobility from the intrinsic properties of disconnections, we develop a systematic method to calculate the energy barriers for the nucleation and glide of individual disconnection modes under arbitrary driving forces. This method combines tools from bicrystallography to enumerate disconnection modes and the NEB method to calculate their energetics, yielding minimum energy paths and atomistic mechanisms for the nucleation and glide of each disconnection mode. We apply the method to accurately predict shear coupling factors of [001] symmetric tilt grain boundaries in Cu. Particular attention is paid to the boundaries where the classical disconnection nucleation model produces incorrect nucleation barriers. We demonstrate that the method can accurately compute the energy barriers and predict the shear coupling factors for low temperature regime.</description>

      <title>Practical approaches for crystal structure predictions with inpainting generation and universal interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Crystal Host-Guided Generation (CHGGen), a diffusion-based framework for crystal structure prediction. Unconditional generation with diffusion models demonstrates limited efficacy in identifying symmetric crystals as the unit cell size increases. CHGGen addresses this limitation through conditional generation with the inpainting method, which optimizes a fraction of atomic positions within a predefined and symmetrized host structure. We demonstrate the method on the ZnS-P$_2$S$_5$ and Li-Si chemical systems, where the inpainting method generates a higher fraction of symmetric structures than unconditional generation. The practical significance of CHGGen extends to enabling the structural modification of crystal structures, particularly for systems with partial occupancy, surface absorption and defects. The inpainting method also allows for seamless integration with other generative models, providing a versatile framework for accelerating materials discovery.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an approach for performing spectrally resolved electron microscopy without the need for an electron spectrometer. The method involves an electron beam prepared as a coherent superposition of multiple paths, one of which passes near a laser-irradiated specimen. These paths are subsequently recombined, and their interference is measured as a function of laser frequency and beam position. Electron--light scattering introduces inelastic components into the interacting path, thereby disturbing the interference pattern. We implement this concept using two masks placed at conjugate image planes. The masks are complementary and act in tandem to fully suppress electron transmission in the absence of a specimen. However, electron interaction with an illuminated specimen perturbs the imaging condition, enabling electron transmission through the system. For a fixed external light intensity, the transmitted electron current is proportional to the strength of the local optical response in the material. The proposed technique does not require monochromatic electron beams, dramatically simplifying the design of spectrally resolved electron microscopes.</description>

      <title>Observation of Double Hysteresis in CoFe$_2$O$_4$/MnFe$_2$O$_4$ Core/Shell Nanoparticles and Its Contribution to AC Heat Induction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic core/shell nanoparticles are promising candidates for magnetic hyperthermia due to its high AC magnetic heat induction (specific loss power (SLP)). It's widely accepted that magnetic exchange-coupling between core and shell plays the crucial role in enhancing SLP of magnetic core/shell nanoparticles. However, the physical contribution of exchange coupling to SLP has not been systematically investigated, and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, magnetic hard/soft CoFe$_2$O$_4$/MnFe$_2$O$_4 and inverted soft/hard MnFe$_2$O$_4$/CoFe$_2$O$_4$ core/shell nanoparticles were synthesized, systematically varying the number of shell layers, to investigate the physical contribution of internal bias coupling at the core/shell interface to AC heat induction (SLP). Our results show that a unique magnetic property, double-hysteresis loop, was present and clearly observed, which was never reported in previous core/shell research literature. According to the experimentally and theoretically analyzed results, the double-hysteresis behavior in core/shell nanoparticles was caused by the difference in magnetic anisotropy between core and shell materials, separated by a non-magnetic interface. The enhanced SLP and maximum temperature rise (TAC,max) of core/shell nanoparticles are attributed to the optimized magnetic anisotropy, AC magnetic softness and double hysteresis behavior due to the internal bias coupling. These results demonstrate that the rational design capabilities to separately control the magnetic anisotropy, AC/DC magnetic properties by varying the volume ration between core and shell and by switching hard or soft phase materials between core and shell are effective modalities to enhance the AC heat induction of core/shell nanoparticles for magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Methodology for Reinstating the Superhydrophilicity of Ambient-Contaminant Compromised Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The degradation of the hemi-wicking property of superhydrophilic high-energy surfaces due to contaminant adsorption from the ambient atmosphere is well documented. This degradation compromises the performance of such surfaces, thus affecting their efficacy in real-world applications where hemi-wicking is critical. In this work, the role of surface micro/nanostructure morphology of laser-textured metallic surfaces on superhydrophilicity degradation is studied. We explore intrinsic contact angle variations of superhydrophilic surfaces via adsorption of organics from the surroundings, which brings about the associated changes in surface chemistry. Furthermore, we explore condensation from humid air as a scalable and environment friendly methodology that can reinstate surface superhydrophilicity to a considerable extent (64% recovery of intrinsic wettability after three hours of condensation) due to the efficient removal of physisorbed contaminants from the surface texture features. The present results strengthen the argument that contact-line movement at fine scales can be used for de-pinning and removal of adsorbed organic molecules from contaminated surfaces.</description>

      <title>Unifying Measurement Schemes in 2-D Terahertz Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two distinct measurement schemes have emerged for the new technique of two-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy (2DTS), complicating the literature. Here, we argue that the 'conventional' measurement scheme derived from nuclear magnetic resonance and its optical-frequency analogues should be favored over the 'alternative' measurement scheme implemented in the majority of 2DTS literature. It is shown that the conventional scheme avoids issues such as overlapping nonlinearities and facilitates physical interpretation of spectra, in contrast to the alternative scheme.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of compressively strained thin film La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in the bulk nickelates under high pressure is a major advance in physics. The recent observation of superconductivity at ambient pressure in compressively strained bilayer nickelate thin films has now enabled direct characterization of the superconducting phase through angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Here we present an in-situ ARPES study of compressively strained La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ films grown by oxide molecular beam epitaxy, and the ozone treated counterparts with an onset T$_c$ of 40 K, supplemented with results from pulsed laser deposition films with similar T$_c$. We resolve a systematic strain-driven electronic band shift with respect to that of bulk crystals, in qualitative agreement with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, the strongly renormalized flat 3$d_{z2}$ band shifts a factor of 5-10 smaller than anticipated by DFT. Furthermore, it stays ~70 meV below the Fermi level, contradicting the expectation that superconductivity results from the high density of states of this band at the Fermi level. We also observed a non-trivial k$_z$ dispersion of the cuprate-like 3$d_{x2-y2}$ band. Combined with results from both X-ray diffraction and DFT, we suggest that the strained films are under ~5 GPa effective pressure, considerably larger than the na\"ive expectation from the DFT relaxed structure. Finally, the ~70 meV energy position is intriguingly close to the collective mode coupling more prominently seen in thin films, in the energy range of both oxygen related phonons and the maximum of the spin excitation spectrum.</description>

      <title>Spatially-Controlled Planar Czochralski Growth of Low-Loss Phase Change Materials for Programmable Photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated devices are progressively evolving beyond passive components into fully programmable systems, notably driven by the progress in chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) for non-volatile reconfigurable nanophotonics. However, the stochastic nature of their crystal grain formation results in strong spatial and temporal crystalline inhomogeneities. Here, we propose the concept of spatially-controlled planar Czochralski growth, a novel method for programming the quasi-monocrystalline growth of low-loss Sb2S3 PCM, leveraging the seeded directional and progressive crystallization within confined channels. This guided crystallization method is experimentally shown to circumvent the current limitations of conventional PCM-based nanophotonic devices, including a multilevel non-volatile optical phase-shifter exploiting a silicon nitride-based Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and a programmable metasurface with spectrally reconfigurable bound state in the continuum. Precisely controlling the growth of PCMs to ensure uniform crystalline properties across large areas is the cornerstone for the industrial development of non-volatile reconfigurable photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Wafer-Scale Characterization of Al/AlxOy/Al Josephson Junctions at Room Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions (JJs) are the key element of many devices operating at cryogenic temperatures. Development of time-efficient wafer-scale JJ characterization for process optimization and control of JJ fabrication is essential. Such statistical characterization has to rely on room temperature techniques since cryogenic measurements typically used for JJs are too time consuming and unsuitable for wafer-scale characterization. In this work, we show that from room temperature capacitance and current-voltage measurements, with proper data analysis, we can independently obtain useful parameters of the JJs on wafer-scale, like oxide thickness, tunnel coefficient, and interfacial defect densities. Moreover, based on detailed analysis of current vs voltage characteristics, different charge transport mechanisms across the junctions can be distinguished. We exemplary demonstrate the worth of these methods by studying junctions fabricated on 200 mm wafers with an industrially scale-able concept based on subtractive processing using only CMOS compatible tools. From these studies, we find that our subtractive fabrication approach yields junctions with quite homogeneous average oxide thickness across the full wafers, with a spread of less then 3$\,$%. The analysis also revealed a variation of the tunnel coefficient with oxide thickness, pointing to a stoichiometry gradient across the junctions' oxide width. Moreover, we estimated relatively low interfacial defect densities in the range of 70 - 5000$\,$defects/cm$^2$ for our junctions and established that the density increased with decreasing oxide thickness, indicating that the wet etching process applied in the JJs fabrication for oxide thickness control leads to formation of interfacial trap state</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin defects in semiconductors are widely investigated for various applications in quantum sensing. Conventional host materials such as diamond and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provide bulk or low-dimensional platforms for optically addressable spin systems, but often lack the structural properties needed for chemical sensing. Here, we introduce a new class of quantum sensors based on naturally occurring spin defects in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), which combine high surface area with omnidirectional spin control, key features for enhanced sensing performance. First, we present strong evidence that these defects are carbon-related, akin to recently identified centers in hBN, and demonstrate coherent spin control over ensembles embedded within dense, microscale BNNTs networks. Using dynamical decoupling, we enhance spin coherence times by a factor exceeding 300x and implement high-resolution detection of radiofrequency signals. By integrating the BNNT mesh sensor into a microfluidic platform we demonstrate chemical sensing of paramagnetic ions in solution, with detectable concentrations reaching levels nearly 1000 times lower than previously demonstrated using comparable hBN-based systems. This highly porous and flexible architecture positions BNNTs as a powerful new host material for quantum sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-body phenomena in quantum materials emerge from the interplay among a broad continuum of electronic states, and controlling these interactions is critical for engineering novel phases. One promising approach exploits fluctuations of the vacuum electromagnetic field confined within optical cavities to tailor electronic properties. Here, we demonstrate that cavity photons can mediate attractive interactions in a tunable van der Waals material and reorganize a continuum of electron-hole transitions into an exciton-like state. We introduce a broadband, sub-wavelength time-domain microscope that integrates exfoliated, dual-gated two-dimensional quantum materials into a terahertz cavity. This approach enables the first-ever measurement of the field-tunable bandgap of bilayer graphene at terahertz frequencies while revealing ultrastrong coupling with a vacuum Rabi frequency exceeding $\Omega_{Rabi}/\omega\approx 40\%$ of the bare photon energy. Crucially, we identify a novel cavity-induced resonance emerging from the interband continuum that resembles Coulomb-bound excitons and remains stable across a broad temperature range. By uniting longstanding theoretical predictions with advanced experimental techniques, our findings open new avenues for designing and probing unique light-matter states and realizing hybrid correlated phases in quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: The rise of non-magnetic topological semimetals, which provide a promising platform for observing and controlling various spin-orbit effects, has led to significant advancements in the field of topological spintronics. RhSi exists in two distinct polymorphs: cubic and orthorhombic crystal structures. The noncentrosymmetric B20 cubic structure has been extensively studied for hosting unconventional multifold fermions. In contrast, the orthorhombic structure, which crystallizes in the Pnma space group (No. 62), remains less explored and belongs to the family of topological Dirac semimetals. In this work, we investigate the structural, magnetic, and electrical properties of RhSi textured-epitaxial films grown on Si(111) substrates, which crystallize in the orthorhombic structure. We investigate the efficiency of pure spin current transport across RhSi/permalloy interfaces and the subsequent spin-to-charge current conversion via inverse spin Hall effect measurements. The xperimentally determined spin Hall conductivity in orthorhombic RhSi reaches a maximum value of 126 ($\hbar$/e)($\Omega$.cm)$^{-1}$ at 10 K, which aligns reasonably well with first-principles calculations that attribute the spin Hall effect in RhSi to the spin Berry curvature mechanism. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to achieve a sizable spin-mixing conductance (34.7 nm$^{-2}$) and an exceptionally high interfacial spin transparency of 88$%$ in this heterostructure, underlining its potential for spin-orbit torque switching applications. Overall, this study broadens the scope of topological spintronics, emphasizing the controlled interfacial spin-transport processes and subsequent spin-to-charge conversion in a previously unexplored topological Dirac semimetal RhSi/ferromagnet heterostructure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the first principles description of coherent phonons in systems subjected to optical excitations and/or doping. We reformulate the first-principles Ehrenfest equation (fpEE) [Phys. Rev. X {\bf 13}, 031026 (2023)] in terms of Born-Oppenheimer phonon frequencies and dynamical Born effective charges. We demonstrate that nonadiabatic effects renormalize the Born-Oppenheimer frequencies and introduce a damping term responsible for the finite lifetime of coherent phonons. Notably, both the frequency renormalization and the lifetime are identical to those of quantum phonons. Furthermore, we show that electrons exert a force driven by an unconventional dynamically screened electron-phonon coupling. This coupling is smaller than the bare one even in the adiabatic limit, highlighting the need to revise current models. The fpEE is also used to develop a first-principles polaron theory that describes lattice distortions induced by doping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the observation of dynamic fringe patterns in the diffuse scattering of extreme ultraviolet light from surfaces following femtosecond optical excitation. At each point on the detector, the diffuse scattering intensity exhibits oscillations at well-defined frequencies that correspond to surface phonons propagating with wave vectors determined by the scattering geometry. This indicates that the optical excitation generates coherent surface phonon wave packets across a broad wave vectors range, spanning from 300 to 60 nm. This phenomenon is observed in a variety of samples, including single-layer and multilayer metal films, as well as bulk semiconductors. The measured surface phonon dispersions show good agreement with theoretical calculations. By comparing signal amplitudes from samples with different surface morphologies, we find that the excitation mechanism is linked to the natural surface roughness of the samples, and the signal is still detectable also on extremely smooth surfaces with sub-nanometer roughness. These findings demonstrate a simple and effective method for optically exciting coherent surface phonons with nanoscale wavelengths across a wide range of solid surfaces. They also establish a foundation for surface phonon spectroscopy in a wave vectors regime that is well beyond the limit of conventional surface Brillouin scattering techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general recipe to describe topological phase transitions in condensed matter systems with interactions. We show that topological invariants in the presence of interactions can be efficiently calculated by means of a non-Hermitian quasiparticle Hamiltonian introduced on the basis of the Green's function. As an example analytically illustrating the application of the quasiparticle concept, we consider a topological phase transition induced by the short-range electrostatic disorder in a two dimensional system described by the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model. The latter allows us to explicitly demonstrate the change in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant and explain the quantized values of the longitudinal conductance in a certain range of the Fermi energy and the disorder strength found previously in numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Electron-Phonon Coupling Mediated by Fr\"ohlich Interaction in Rb2SnBr6 Perovskite</title>

Abstract: Due to their well-suited optoelectronic properties, metal halide perovskites are emerging semiconductor materials with potential applications in solar cells, detectors, and light-emitting diodes. Beyond the traditional 3D perovskites, low-dimensional counterparts have more attractive effects such as excitonic emissions and quantum confinements that are enhanced by the reduced dimensionality, which involve the Electron-Phonon Coupling (EPC). Such phenomenon, which comprehends the interaction between charge carriers and lattice vibrations, usually strongly impacts the photoluminescence (PL) response in low-dimensional frameworks. In this paper, we investigated the intrinsic EPC onto low-temperature PL of the zero-dimensional (0D) Rb2SnBr6 perovskite. Temperature-dependent PL measurements, complemented by various characterization techniques and theoretical calculations, revealed broadband emission with a significant Stokes shift attributed to self-trapped excitons (STEs). The Fr\"ohlich mechanism, mediated by interactions between excitonic charge carriers and longitudinal optical (LO) phonons, primarily accounts for the emission broadening through phonon-assisted radiative recombination. The EPC strength was evaluated through the Huang-Rhys factor S=34, confirming strong correlations between electronic and vibrational properties and supporting the STE emission assumption. The possible mechanism of STE formation was evaluated by the Fr\"ohlich parameter {\alpha} of 1.94 for electrons and 4.73 for holes, which points out a major contribution of the hole-polaron quasi-particle on exciton trapping. Our findings give insights regarding the influence of EPC in 0D perovskites and STE formation, which leads to the assessment of Rb2SnBr6 for light-harvesting applications.</description>

      <title>Best practices in Quantum Monte Carlo for metal catalysis: CO hydrolysis on Pt(111)</title>

Abstract: Hydrogen production as a clean, sustainable replacement for fossil fuels is gathering pace. Research work and prototyping various aspects of hydrogen power is now a priority. Over 90 \% of all chemical manufacture uses a solid catalyst. This work describes catalytic selective hydrogen production optimising reactant structure on a model catalyst. Focus is on O-H bond dissociation in format radicals formed after carbon-monoxide is co-adsorbed with water at Pt(111). Finally, hydrogen gas is given off. Many chemical reactions involve bond-dissociation. This process is often the key to rate-limiting reaction steps at solid surfaces. %This is also true for reactions at solid surfaces, in which the dissociation step is often limiting but facilitated in comparison to gas phase reaction channels. Since bond-breaking is poorly described by Hartree-Fock and DFT methods, our embedded active site approach is used. This work demonstrates Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methodology using a very simple four primitive-cell layer model, oriented to expose Pt (111). QMC is a stochastic approach to solving the Schr{\"o}dinger equation recently came of age for heterogeneous systems involving solids. During hydrolysis of carbon monoxide, initial O-H bond stretch is rate-limiting. This dissociation energy is offset by Pt-H bond formation at the surface. The reactive formate (H-O-C=O) species formed, by initial hydrolysis of CO, also interact with a vicinal Pt. These are subsequently desorbed. They then produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen, with a H-atom dissociated from the formate species and another desorbed at the Pt(111) face.
  Our approach allows a high-level configuration interaction (CI) wave-function to be used, expanded in plane-waves and embedded in the metal lattice exposing its close-packed face. The resulting periodic function is used to guide the QMC calculation.</description>

      <title>Full Crystallographic Imaging of Hexagonal Boron Nitride Monolayers with Phonon-Enhanced Sum-Frequency Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15939</link>

Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an important 2D material for van der Waals heterostructures, single photon emitters, and infrared nanophotonics. The optical characterization of mono- and few-layer samples of hBN however remains a challenge as the material is almost invisible optically. Here we introduce phase-resolved sum-frequency microscopy as a technique for imaging monolayers of hBN grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and visualize their crystal orientation. A combination of femtosecond mid-infrared (IR) and visible laser pulses is used for sum-frequency generation (SFG), which is imaged in a wide-field optical microscope. The IR laser resonantly excites a phonon of hBN that leads to an ~800-fold enhancement of the SFG intensity, making it possible to image large 100x100 {\mu}m2 sample areas in less than 1 s. Implementing heterodyne detection in combination with azimuthal rotation of the sample further provides full crystallographic information. Through combined knowledge of topography and crystal orientation, we find that triangular domains of CVD-grown monolayer hBN have nitrogen-terminated zigzag edges. Overall, SFG microscopy can be used as an ultra-sensitive tool to image crystal structure, strain, stacking sequences, and twist angles, and is applicable to the wide range of van der Waals structures, where location and identification of monolayer regions and interfaces with broken inversion symmetry is of paramount importance.</description>

      <title>Quantum weight: A fundamental property of quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of quantum weight as a ground state property of quantum many-body systems that is encoded in the static structure factor and characterizes density fluctuation at long wavelengths. The quantum weight carries a wealth of information about dielectric responses and optical properties of the system, and is closely related to its quantum geometry. For systems with short-range interactions or low-dimensional Coulomb systems, we show that the many-body quantum metric (which measures the change of the ground state under twisted boundary conditions) can be determined directly from the quantum weight. Notably, the quantum weight is a property of a single ground state and independent of boundary conditions in the thermodynamic limit. Our finding thus enables direct experimental measurement and numerical calculation of many-body quantum metric. On the other hand, for three-dimensional Coulomb systems, we show that the quantum weight is distinct from the many-body quantum metric due to dielectric screening in three dimensions. We further use dielectric sum rules to derive upper and lower bounds on their quantum weight in terms of electron density, static dielectric constant, and plasmon energy. Our work highlights quantum weight as a fundamental material parameter, which can be experimentally determined by x-ray scattering or electron loss spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Physics-based battery model parametrisation from impedance data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10896v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-invasive parametrisation of physics-based battery models can be performed by fitting the model to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data containing features related to the different physical processes. However, this requires an impedance model to be derived, which may be complex to obtain analytically. We have developed the open-source software PyBaMM-EIS that provides a fast method to compute the impedance of any PyBaMM model at any operating point using automatic differentiation. Using PyBaMM-EIS, we investigate the impedance of the single particle model, single particle model with electrolyte (SPMe), and Doyle-Fuller-Newman model, and identify the SPMe as a parsimonious option that shows the typical features of measured lithium-ion cell impedance data. We provide a grouped parameter SPMe and analyse the features in the impedance related to each parameter. Using the open-source software PyBOP, we estimate 18 grouped parameters both from simulated impedance data and from measured impedance data from a LG M50LT lithium-ion battery. The parameters that directly affect the response of the SPMe can be accurately determined and assigned to the correct electrode. Crucially, parameter fitting must be done simultaneously to data across a wide range of states-of-charge. Overall, this work presents a practical way to find the parameters of physics-based models.</description>

      <title>High-field Breakdown and Thermal Characterization of Indium Tin Oxide Transistors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amorphous oxide semiconductors are gaining interest for logic and memory transistors compatible with low-temperature fabrication. However, their low thermal conductivity and heterogeneous interfaces suggest that their performance may be severely limited by self-heating, especially at higher power and device densities. Here, we investigate the high-field breakdown of ultrathin (~4 nm) amorphous indium tin oxide (ITO) transistors with scanning thermal microscopy (SThM) and multiphysics simulations. The ITO devices break irreversibly at channel temperatures of ~180 {\deg}C and ~340 {\deg}C on SiO${_2}$ and HfO${_2}$ substrates, respectively, with failure primarily caused by thermally-induced compressive strain near the device contacts. Combining SThM measurements with simulations allows us to estimate a thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of 35 ${\pm}$ 12 MWm${^-}$${^2}$K${^-}$${^1}$ for ITO on SiO${_2}$, and 51 ${\pm}$ 14 MWm${^-}$${^2}$K${^-}$${^1}$ for ITO on HfO${_2}$. The latter also enables significantly higher breakdown power due to better heat dissipation and closer thermal expansion matching. These findings provide insights into the thermo-mechanical limitations of indium-based amorphous oxide transistors, which are important for more reliable and high-performance logic and memory applications.</description>

      <title>Harnessing natural and mechanical airflows for surface-based atmospheric pollutant removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Removal strategies for atmospheric pollutants are increasingly being considered to mitigate global warming and improve public health. However, surface-based removal techniques, such as sorption, catalysis and filtration, are often limited by pollutant transport and removal rate constraints. We evaluate the atmospheric pollutant transport to surfaces and assess the potential of surface-based removal technologies for applications in airflow through cities, HVAC systems and over vehicles. If these removal technologies are applied to their surfaces, cities, solar farms, HVAC systems and filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal rates that exceed 1 GtCO$_2$e annually (20-year GWP). Cities have the highest atmospheric pollutant removal potential, with estimates averaging 30 GtCO$_2$, 0.06 GtCH$_4$, 0.0001 GtPM$_{2.5}$, 0.007 GtNO$_\text{x}$ annually. HVAC filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal costs as low as \$300 per tCO$_2$e removed when sorption or catalyst technologies are incorporated into their fibre sheets, outperforming the \$2000 per tCO$_2$e removal cost when these technologies are applied to city surfaces. This estimate is based on the literature values for these technologies' costs per square meter. However, our calculations indicate that optimising catalyst properties and surface coverage could lower the cost estimates to below \$100 per tCO$_2$e across these applications. These findings demonstrate that integrating surface-based pollutant removal technologies into infrastructure may offer a scalable pathway to advance climate and health objectives.</description>
