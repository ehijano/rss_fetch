      <title>Spectral boundaries of deterministic matrices deformed by rotationally invariant random non-Hermitian ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the great miracles of random matrix theory is that, in the $N \to \infty$ limit, many otherwise intractable matrix problems with horrendously complicated finite-$N$ expressions admit remarkably simple and elegant asymptotic solutions. In this paper, we illustrate this phenomenon in the context of spectral boundaries (or spectral edges) for deformed random matrices. Specifically, we consider matrices of the form $\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}$, where $\mathbf{A}$ is a deterministic $N\times N$ matrix (not necessarily Hermitian) and $\mathbf{B}$ is a rotationally invariant random matrix. In the large-$N$ limit, we show that the complex eigenvalue distribution of $\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}$ satisfies remarkably simple boundary equations that depend on the $\mathcal{R}_1$ and $\mathcal{R}_2$ transforms of $\mathbf{B}$. We illustrate our results on several explicit random matrix ensembles and support them with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Controlling energy spectra and skin effect via boundary conditions in non-Hermitian lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit unique spectral properties, including the non-Hermitian skin effect and exceptional points, often influenced by boundary conditions. The modulation of these phenomena by generalized boundary conditions remains unexplored and not understood. Here, we analyze the Hatano-Nelson model with generalized boundary conditions induced by complex hopping amplitudes at the boundary. Using similarity transformations, we determine the conditions yielding real energy spectra and skin effect, and identify the emergence of exceptional points where spectra transition from real to complex. We demonstrate that tuning the boundary hopping amplitudes precisely controls the non-Hermitian skin effect, i.e., the localization of eigenmodes at the lattice edges. These findings reveal the sensitivity of spectral and localization properties to boundary conditions, providing a framework for engineering quantum lattice models with tailored spectral and localization features, with potential applications in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Graphs are maximally expressive for higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that graph-based models are fully capable of representing higher-order interactions, and have a long history of being used for precisely this purpose. This stands in contrast to a common claim in the recent literature on "higher-order networks" that graph-based representations are fundamentally limited to "pairwise" interactions, requiring hypergraph formulations to capture richer dependencies. We clarify this issue by emphasizing two frequently overlooked facts. First, graph-based models are not restricted to pairwise interactions, as they naturally accommodate interactions that depend simultaneously on multiple adjacent nodes. Second, hypergraph formulations are strict special cases of more general graph-based representations, as they impose additional constraints on the allowable interactions between adjacent elements rather than expanding the space of possibilities. We show that key phenomenology commonly attributed to hypergraphs -- such as abrupt transitions -- can, in general, be recovered exactly using graph models, even locally tree-like ones, and thus do not constitute a class of phenomena that is inherently contingent on hypergraphs models. Finally, we argue that the broad relevance of hypergraphs for applications that is sometimes claimed in the literature is not supported by evidence. Instead it is likely grounded in misconceptions that network models cannot accommodate multibody interactions or that certain phenomena can only be captured with hypergraphs. We argue that clearly distinguishing between multivariate interactions, parametrized by graphs, and the functions that define them enables a more unified and flexible foundation for modeling interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Engineering correlated disorder for exotic light scattering diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffuse scattering of light from disordered assemblies is traditionally viewed as an uncontrollable broadband scattering background resulting in whitish hues. Here, we demonstrate that correlated disorder enables precise engineering of light scattering from 2D arrays of emitters resulting in strong observable colors. Our analytical framework shows that introducing controlled noise, with tunable probability density functions and correlations, generates three distinct scattering components: diffraction orders, diffuse background, and correlation halos. Correlation halos, often mistaken for broadened diffraction peaks, are independent features whose positions depend on correlation range and can appear between Bragg peaks. Crucially, they persist far beyond the regime where diffraction orders vanish. The noise probability density function provides an additional control: specific diffraction orders can be selectively suppressed while preserving others. This approach reproduces the scattering signatures of natural photonic structures, e.g. found in Morpho butterflies, and reveals multiple pathways from order to disorder, each with distinct optical properties. Our work provides a practical method for inverse design -finding the disorder that produces desired scattering patterns. This establishes diffuse scattering as a designable quantity, expanding the toolkit for metasurfaces and structural color beyond periodic and hyperuniform structures.</description>

      <title>Charge and energy transport in graphene with smooth finite-range disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate charge and energy transport in monolayer graphene with smooth finite-range disorder, modeled by soft impurity potentials. Using a continuum Dirac model, we go beyond the Born approximation by computing the exact scattering matrix for individual impurities. This captures the full nonperturbative physics of smooth disorder. From the exact scattering data, we evaluate transport coefficients by solving the Boltzmann equation with energy-resolved phase shifts. We analyze electrical and electronic thermal conductivities versus carrier density and temperature, including deviations from the Wiedemann-Franz law. Our results reveal that finite-range disorder nontrivially modifies charge and heat currents, especially at low energies where perturbative methods fail. These findings provide a more accurate transport characterization for disordered Dirac materials and clarify how smooth disorder governs energy flow in graphene.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Machine Learning of Nanoparticle Stability through Topological Layer Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of chemically complex nanoparticles is governed by an immense configurational space arising from heterogeneous local atomic environments across surface and interior regions. Efficiently identifying low-energy configurations within this space remains a central challenge for first-principles-based materials discovery, particularly when the available reference data are limited. Here, we introduce a data-efficient and physically interpretable machine-learning framework based on a fragmented, layer-resolved descriptor that explicitly decomposes nanoparticles into surface, intermediate, and core environments using a topology-driven definition. This representation preserves a compact and fixed feature dimensionality while retaining spatial resolution, enabling controlled emphasis on different regions of the nanoparticle through physically motivated weighting schemes. Coupled with gradient-boosted decision tree models and a ranking-based learning strategy, the proposed framework enables accurate identification of the most stable nanoparticle configurations using only a few hundred density functional theory reference calculations. Ranking performance metrics demonstrate near-saturation of correlation, high top-k recall, and rapidly vanishing regret at moderate training-set sizes, highlighting the strong data efficiency of the approach. Beyond predictive performance, layer-weighting and SHAP-based interpretability analyses reveal how surface segregation, coordination topology, and local chemical disorder contribute differently to stability across spatial regions of the nanoparticle. These insights provide a transparent physical interpretation of the learned models and establish a natural pathway toward active learning-driven exploration of complex nanoparticle configurational spaces.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak spontaneous breaking of 1-form symmetry and intrinsically mixed topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17530v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological orders in 2+1d are spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of 1-form symmetries in pure states. The notion of symmetry is further enriched in the context of mixed states, where a symmetry can be either ``strong" or ``weak". In this work, we apply a R\'enyi-2 version of the proposed equivalence relation in [Sang, Lessa, Mong, Grover, Wang, &amp; Hsieh, to appear] on density matrices that is slightly finer than two-way channel connectivity. This equivalence relation distinguishes general 1-form strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) states from phases containing pure states, and therefore labels SW-SSB states as ``intrinsically mixed". According to our equivalence relation, two states are equivalent if and only if they are connected to each other by finite Lindbladian evolution that maintains continuously varying, finite R\'enyi-2 Markov length. We then examine a natural setting for finding such density matrices: disordered ensembles. Specifically, we study the toric code with various types of disorders and show that in each case, the ensemble of ground states corresponding to different disorder realizations form a density matrix with different strong and weak SSB patterns of 1-form symmetries, including SW-SSB. Furthermore we show by perturbative calculations that these disordered ensembles form stable ``phases" in the sense that they exist over a finite parameter range, according to our equivalence relation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced transverse electron transport via disordered composite formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04433v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transverse electron transport in magnetic materials - manifested in effects such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects - holds promise for spintronic and thermoelectric applications. While recent advances have focused on enhancing such transport through topological single crystals via intrinsic mechanisms linked to Berry curvature, practical limitations remain due to their mechanical fragility and narrow material scope. Here, we demonstrate a distinct approach for transverse transport enhancement based on composite formation. Using both theoretical modeling and experiments, we show that disordered mixtures of two ferromagnetic materials can exhibit significantly stronger transverse electron deflection than either constituent alone. This enhancement originates from meandering electron pathways created by the disordered mixture of two materials and does not rely on long-range crystalline order. The identified requirements for this mechanism can be broadly satisfied across different material systems, offering a universal and tunable strategy to engineer large transverse responses in structurally robust platforms.</description>

      <title>Entanglement growth and information capacity in a quasiperiodic system with a single-particle mobility edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of a one-dimensional quasiperiodic system featuring a single-particle mobility edge (SPME), described by the generalized Aubry-Andr\'e (GAA) model. This model offers a unique platform to study the consequences of coexisting localized and extended eigenstates, which contrasts sharply with the abrupt localization transition in the standard Aubry-Andr\'e model. We analyze the system's response to a quantum quench through two complementary probes: entanglement entropy (EE) and subsystem information capacity (SIC). We find that the SPME induces a smooth crossover in all dynamical signatures. The EE saturation value exhibits a persistent volume-law scaling in the mobility-edge phase, with an entropy density that continuously decreases as the number of available extended states decreases. Complementing this, the SIC profile interpolates between the linear ramp characteristic of extended systems and the information trapping behavior of localized ones, directly visualizing the mixed nature of the underlying spectrum. Our results establish unambiguous dynamical fingerprints of a mobility edge, providing a crucial non-interacting benchmark for understanding information and entanglement dynamics in more complex systems with mixed phases.</description>
