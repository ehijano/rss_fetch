      <title>PC-NCLaws: Physics-Embedded Conditional Neural Constitutive Laws for Elastoplastic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While data-driven methods offer significant promise for modeling complex materials, they often face challenges in generalizing across diverse physical scenarios and maintaining physical consistency. To address these limitations, we propose a generalizable framework called Physics-Embedded Conditional Neural Constitutive Laws for Elastoplastic Materials, which combines the partial differential equations with neural networks. Specifically, the model employs two separate neural networks to model elastic and plastic constitutive laws. Simultaneously, the model incorporates physical parameters as conditional inputs and is trained on comprehensive datasets encompassing multiple scenarios with varying physical parameters, thereby enabling generalization across different properties without requiring retraining for each individual case. Furthermore, the differentiable architecture of our model, combined with its explicit parameter inputs, enables the inverse estimation of physical parameters from observed motion sequences. This capability extends our framework to objects with unknown or unmeasured properties. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in motion reconstruction, robust long-term prediction, geometry generalization, and precise parameters estimation for elastoplastic materials, highlighting its versatility as a unified simulator and inverse analysis tool.</description>

      <title>ArtiLatent: Realistic Articulated 3D Object Generation via Structured Latents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and manipulation.</description>

      <title>Group Inertial Poser: Multi-Person Pose and Global Translation from Sparse Inertial Sensors and Ultra-Wideband Ranging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human motion capture in the wild.

      <title>WorldGrow: Generating Infinite 3D World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world -- large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance. Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation. Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset, WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world models.</description>

      <title>Approximating Signed Distance Fields of Implicit Surfaces with Sparse Ellipsoidal Radial Basis Function Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and compact representation of signed distance functions (SDFs) of implicit surfaces is crucial for efficient storage, computation, and downstream processing of 3D geometry. In this work, we propose a general learning method for approximating precomputed SDF fields of implicit surfaces by a relatively small number of ellipsoidal radial basis functions (ERBFs). The SDF values could be computed from various sources, including point clouds, triangle meshes, analytical expressions, pretrained neural networks, etc. Given SDF values on spatial grid points, our method approximates the SDF using as few ERBFs as possible, achieving a compact representation while preserving the geometric shape of the corresponding implicit surface. To balance sparsity and approximation precision, we introduce a dynamic multi-objective optimization strategy, which adaptively incorporates regularization to enforce sparsity and jointly optimizes the weights, centers, shapes, and orientations of the ERBFs. For computational efficiency, a nearest-neighbor-based data structure restricts computations to points near each kernel center, and CUDA-based parallelism further accelerates the optimization. Furthermore, a hierarchical refinement strategy based on SDF spatial grid points progressively incorporates coarse-to-fine samples for parameter initialization and optimization, improving convergence and training efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can represent SDF fields with significantly fewer parameters than existing sparse implicit representation approaches, achieving better accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.
