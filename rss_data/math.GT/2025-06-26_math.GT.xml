      <title>Salem numbers and commensurability classes of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we show that given a Salem number $\lambda$, a totally real number field $k\subseteq\mathbb{Q}(\lambda+\lambda^{-1})$, and a positive integer $n\geq\mathrm{deg}_k(\lambda)-1$, there exist infinitely many commensurability classes of arithmetic hyperbolic $n$-manifolds defined over $k$ which contain a geodesic of length $\log\lambda$.</description>

      <title>On the existence of weakly malnormal quasiconvex subgroups of hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short note, we prove the existence of weakly malnormal, virtually free, quasiconvex subgroups in any nonelementary hyperbolic group. This extends a result of Ilya Kapovich, where he proved the existence of malnormal quasiconvex subgroups in torsion-free hyperbolic groups.</description>

      <title>Taut smoothings of arcs and curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06623v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the geometric and combinatorial effect of smoothing an intersection point in a collection of arcs or curves on a surface. We prove that all taut arcs with fixed endpoints and all taut 1-manifolds with at least two non-disjoint components on an orientable surface with negative Euler characteristic admit a taut smoothing, and also that all taut arcs with free endpoints admit a smoothing that is either taut or becomes taut after removing at most one intersection. We deduce that for every Riemannian metric on a surface, the shortest properly immersed arcs with at least $k$ self-intersections have exactly $k$ self-intersections when the endpoints of the arc are fixed, and at most $k+1$ self-intersections otherwise, and that the arc length spectrum is "coarsely ordered" by self-intersection number. Along the way, we obtain partial analogous results in the case of curves.</description>

      <title>Non-singular extensions of horizontal stable fold maps from surfaces to the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the non-singular extension problem of horizontal stable fold maps. This problem asks what conditions ensure the existence of a submersion whose restriction to the boundary coincides with a given map. By defining a combinatorial object called a pairing map, we prove that the existence of a non-singular extension is equivalent to the existence of a pairing map.</description>

      <title>Acylindrical hyperbolicity and the centers of Artin groups that are not free of infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charney and Morris-Wright showed acylindrical hyperbolicity of Artin groups of infinite type associated with graphs that are not joins, by studying clique-cube complexes and the actions on them. The authors developed their study and clarified when acylindrical hyperbolicity holds for Artin groups of infinite type associated with graphs that are not cones. In this paper, we introduce reduced clique-cube complexes. By using them, we show acylindrical hyperbolicity of irreducible Artin groups associated with graphs that are not cliques, that is, irreducible Artin groups that are not free of infinity. Such Artin groups contain infinite type Artin groups of type FC. As an application, we see that the centers of such Artin groups are finite, and that actually they are trivial in many cases.</description>

      <title>A matrix criterion and algorithmic approach for the Peterson hit problem: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Peterson hit problem in algebraic topology is to explicitly determine the dimension of the quotient space $Q\mathcal P_k = \mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathcal A}\mathcal P_k$ in positive degrees, where $\mathcal{P}_k$ denotes the polynomial algebra in $k$ variables over the field $\mathbb{F}_2$, considered as an unstable module over the Steenrod algebra $\mathcal{A}$. Current approaches to this problem still rely heavily on manual computations, which are highly prone to errors due to the intricate nature of the underlying calculations. To date, no efficient algorithm implemented in any computer algebra system has been made publicly available to tackle this problem in a systematic manner.
  Motivated by the above, in this work, which is considered as Part I of our project, we first establish a criterion based entirely on linear algebra for determining whether a given homogeneous polynomial is "hit". Accordingly, we describe the dimensions of the hit spaces. This leads to a practical and reliable computational method for determining the dimension of $Q\mathcal{P}_k$ for arbitrary $k$ and any positive degrees, with the support of a computer algebra system. We then give a concrete implementation of the obtained results as novel algorithms in \textsc{SageMath}. As an application, our algorithm demonstrates that the manually computed result presented in the recent work of Sum and Tai [15] for the dimension of $Q\mathcal{P}_5$ in degree $2^{6}$ is not correct. Furthermore, our algorithm determines that $\dim(Q\mathcal{P}_5)_{2^{7}} = 1985,$ which falls within the range $1984 \leq \dim(Q\mathcal{P}_5)_{2^{7}} \leq 1990$ as estimated in [15].</description>
