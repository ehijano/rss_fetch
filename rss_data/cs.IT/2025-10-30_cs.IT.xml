      <title>Dual-Domain Deep Learning-Assisted NOMA-CSK Systems for Secure and Efficient Vehicular Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring secure and efficient multi-user (MU) transmission is critical for vehicular communication systems. Chaos-based modulation schemes have garnered considerable interest due to their benefits in physical layer security. However, most existing MU chaotic communication systems, particularly those based on non-coherent detection, suffer from low spectral efficiency due to reference signal transmission, and limited user connectivity under orthogonal multiple access (OMA). While non-orthogonal schemes, such as sparse code multiple access (SCMA)-based DCSK, have been explored, they face high computational complexity and inflexible scalability due to their fixed codebook designs. This paper proposes a deep learning-assisted power domain non-orthogonal multiple access chaos shift keying (DL-NOMA-CSK) system for vehicular communications. A deep neural network (DNN)-based demodulator is designed to learn intrinsic chaotic signal characteristics during offline training, thereby eliminating the need for chaotic synchronization or reference signal transmission. The demodulator employs a dual-domain feature extraction architecture that jointly processes the time-domain and frequency-domain information of chaotic signals, enhancing feature learning under dynamic channels. The DNN is integrated into the successive interference cancellation (SIC) framework to mitigate error propagation issues. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior performance in terms of spectral efficiency (SE), energy efficiency (EE), bit error rate (BER), security, and robustness, while maintaining lower computational complexity compared to traditional MU-DCSK and existing DL-aided schemes. These advantages validate its practical viability for secure vehicular communications.</description>

      <title>Resi-VidTok: An Efficient and Decomposed Progressive Tokenization Framework for Ultra-Low-Rate and Lightweight Video Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time transmission of video over wireless networks remains highly challenging, even with advanced deep models, particularly under severe channel conditions such as limited bandwidth and weak connectivity. In this paper, we propose Resi-VidTok, a Resilient Tokenization-Enabled framework designed for ultra-low-rate and lightweight video transmission that delivers strong robustness while preserving perceptual and semantic fidelity on commodity digital hardware. By reorganizing spatio--temporal content into a discrete, importance-ordered token stream composed of key tokens and refinement tokens, Resi-VidTok enables progressive encoding, prefix-decodable reconstruction, and graceful quality degradation under constrained channels. A key contribution is a resilient 1D tokenization pipeline for video that integrates differential temporal token coding, explicitly supporting reliable recovery from incomplete token sets using a single shared framewise decoder--without auxiliary temporal extractors or heavy generative models. Furthermore, stride-controlled frame sparsification combined with a lightweight decoder-side interpolator reduces transmission load while maintaining motion continuity. Finally, a channel-adaptive source--channel coding and modulation scheme dynamically allocates rate and protection according to token importance and channel condition, yielding stable quality across adverse SNRs. Evaluation results indicate robust visual and semantic consistency at channel bandwidth ratios (CBR) as low as 0.0004 and real-time reconstruction at over 30 fps, demonstrating the practicality of Resi-VidTok for energy-efficient, latency-sensitive, and reliability-critical wireless applications.</description>

      <title>Fed-PELAD: Communication-Efficient Federated Learning for Massive MIMO CSI Feedback with Personalized Encoders and a LoRA-Adapted Shared Decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenges of communication overhead, data heterogeneity, and privacy in deep learning for channel state information (CSI) feedback in massive MIMO systems. To this end, we propose Fed-PELAD, a novel federated learning framework that incorporates personalized encoders and a LoRA-adapted shared decoder. Specifically, personalized encoders are trained locally on each user equipment (UE) to capture device-specific channel characteristics, while a shared decoder is updated globally via the coordination of the base station (BS) by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This design ensures that only compact LoRA adapter parameters instead of full model updates are transmitted for aggregation. To further enhance convergence stability, we introduce an alternating freezing strategy with calibrated learning-rate ratio during LoRA aggregation. Extensive simulations on 3GPP-standard channel models demonstrate that Fed-PELAD requires only 42.97\% of the uplink communication cost compared to conventional methods while achieving a performance gain of 1.2 dB in CSI feedback accuracy under heterogeneous conditions.</description>

      <title>Joint Spatial Registration and Resource Allocation for Transmissive RIS Enabled Cooperative ISCC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surface (TRIS) transceiver-driven cooperative integrated sensing, computing, and communication (ISCC) network to meet the requirement for a diverse network with low energy consumption. The cooperative base stations (BSs) are equipped with TRIS transceivers to accomplish sensing data acquisition, communication offloading, and computation in a time slot. In order to obtain higher cooperation gain, we utilize a signal-level spatial registration algorithm, which is realized by adjusting the beamwidth. Meanwhile, for more efficient offloading of the computational task, multistream communication is considered, and rank-$N$ constraints are introduced, which are handled using an iterative rank minimization (IRM) scheme. We construct an optimization problem with the objective function of minimizing the total energy consumption of the network to jointly optimize the beamforming matrix, time slot allocation, sensing data allocation and sensing beam scheduling variables. Due to the coupling of the variables, the proposed problem is a non-convex optimization problem, which we decouple and solve using a block coordinate descent (BCD) scheme. Finally, numerical simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed scheme in improving the overall network performance and reducing the total energy consumption of the network.</description>

      <title>General Coverage Models: Structure, Monotonicity, and Shotgun Sequencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study coverage processes in which each draw reveals a subset of $[n]$, and the goal is to determine the expected number of draws until all items are seen at least once. A classical example is the Coupon Collector's Problem, where each draw reveals exactly one item. Motivated by shotgun DNA sequencing, we introduce a model where each draw is a contiguous window of fixed length, in both cyclic and non-cyclic variants. We develop a unifying combinatorial tool that shifts the task of finding coverage time from probability, to a counting problem over families of subsets of $[n]$ that together contain all items, enabling exact calculation. Using this result, we obtain exact expressions for the window models. We then leverage past results on a continuous analogue of the cyclic window model to analyze the asymptotic behavior of both models. We further study what we call uniform $\ell$-regular models, where every draw has size $\ell$ and every item appears in the same number of admissible draws. We compare these to the batch sampling model, in which all $\ell$-subsets are drawn uniformly at random and present upper and lower bounds, which were also obtained independently by Berend and Sher. We conjecture, and prove for special cases, that this model maximizes the coverage time among all uniform $\ell$-regular models. Finally, we prove a universal upper bound on the entire class of uniform $\ell$-regular models, which illuminates the fact that many sampling models share the same leading asymptotic order, while potentially differing significantly in lower-order terms.</description>

      <title>Network Oblivious Transfer via Noisy Broadcast Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates information-theoretic oblivious transfer via a discrete memoryless broadcast channel with one sender and two receivers. We analyze both non-colluding and colluding honest-but-curious user models and establish general upper bounds on the achievable oblivious transfer capacity region for each case. Two explicit oblivious transfer protocols are proposed. The first ensures correctness and privacy for independent, non-colluding receivers by leveraging the structure of binary erasure broadcast channels. The second protocol, secure even under receiver collusion, introduces additional entropy-sharing and privacy amplification mechanisms to preserve secrecy despite information leakage between users. Our results show that for the non-colluding case, the upper and lower bounds on oblivious transfer capacity coincide, providing a complete characterization of the achievable region. The work provides a unified theoretical framework bridging network information theory and cryptographic security, highlighting the potential of noisy broadcast channels as powerful primitives for multi-user privacy-preserving communication.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming Design and Resource Allocation for IRS-Assisted Full-Duplex Terahertz Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted full-duplex (FD) terahertz (THz) communication systems have emerged as a promising paradigm to satisfy the escalating demand for ultra-high data rates and spectral efficiency in future wireless networks. However, the practical deployment of such systems presents unique technical challenges, stemming from severe propagation loss, frequency-dependent molecular absorption in the THz band, and the presence of strong residual self-interference (SI) inherent to FD communications. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a joint resource allocation framework that aims to maximize the weighted minimum rate among all users, thereby ensuring fairness in quality of service. Specifically, the proposed design jointly optimizes IRS reflecting phase shifts, uplink/downlink transmit power control, sub-band bandwidth allocation, and sub-band assignment, explicitly capturing the unique propagation characteristics of THz channels and the impact of residual SI. To strike an balance between system performance and computational complexity, two computationally efficient algorithms are developed under distinct spectrum partitioning schemes: one assumes equal sub-band bandwidth allocation to facilliate tractable optimization, while the other introduces adaptive bandwidth allocation to further enhance spectral utilization and system flexibility. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed designs and demonstrate that the adopted scheme achieves significant spectral efficiency improvements over benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>AirCNN via Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Architecture Design and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces AirCNN, a novel paradigm for implementing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) via over-the-air (OTA) analog computation. By leveraging multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and transceiver designs, we engineer the ambient wireless propagation environment to emulate the operations of a CNN layer. To comprehensively evaluate AirCNN, we consider two types of CNNs, namely classic two-dimensional (2D) convolution (Conv2d) and light-weight convolution, i.e., depthwise separable convolution (ConvSD). For Conv2d realization via OTA computation, we propose and analyze two RIS-aided transmission architectures: multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and multiple-input single-output (MISO), balancing transmission overhead and emulation performance. We jointly optimize all parameters, including the transmitter precoder, receiver combiner, and RIS phase shifts, under practical constraints such as transmit power budget and unit-modulus phase shift requirements. We further extend the framework to ConvSD, which requires distinct transmission strategies for depthwise and pointwise convolutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AirCNN architectures can achieve satisfactory classification performance. Notably, Conv2d MISO consistently outperforms Conv2d MIMO across various settings, while for ConvSD, MISO is superior only under poor channel conditions. Moreover, employing multiple RISs significantly enhances performance compared to a single RIS, especially in line-of-sight (LoS)-dominated wireless environments.</description>

      <title>Several classes of $p$-ary linear codes with few-weights derived from Weil sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear codes with few weights have been a significant area of research in coding theory for many years, due to their applications in secret sharing schemes, authentication codes, association schemes, and strongly regular graphs. Inspired by the works of Cheng and Gao \cite{P8} and Wu, Li and Zeng \cite{P12}, in this paper, we propose several new classes of few-weight linear codes over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ through the selection of two specific defining sets. Consequently, we obtain five classes of $4$-weight linear codes and one class of $2$-weight linear codes from our first defining set. Furthermore, by employing weakly regular bent functions in our second defining set, we derive two classes of $6$-weight codes, two classes of $8$-weight codes, and one class of $9$-weight codes. The parameters and weight distributions of all these constructed codes are wholly determined by detailed calculations on certain Weil sums over finite fields. In addition, we identify an optimal class of $2$-weight codes that meet the Griesmer bound.</description>

      <title>On Multidimensional 2-Weight-Limited Burst-Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider multidimensional codes capable of correcting a burst error of weight at most $2$. When two positions are in error, the burst limits their relative position. We study three such limitations: the $L_\infty$ distance between the positions is bounded, the $L_1$ distance between the positions is bounded, or the two positions are on an axis-parallel line with bounded distance between them. In all cases we provide explicit code constructions, and compare their excess redundancy to a lower bound we prove.</description>

      <title>Effect of Full Common Randomness Replication in Symmetric PIR on Graph-Based Replicated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) in settings where the database replication is modeled by a simple graph. Here, each vertex corresponds to a server, and a message is replicated on two servers if and only if there is an edge between them. To satisfy the requirement of database privacy, we let all the servers share some common randomness, independent of the messages. We aim to quantify the improvement in SPIR capacity, i.e., the maximum ratio of the number of desired and downloaded symbols, compared to the setting with graph-replicated common randomness. Towards this, we develop an algorithm to convert a class of PIR schemes into the corresponding SPIR schemes, thereby establishing a capacity lower bound on graphs for which such schemes exist. This includes the class of path and cyclic graphs for which we derive capacity upper bounds that are tighter than the trivial bounds given by the respective PIR capacities. For the special case of path graph with three vertices, we identify the SPIR capacity to be $\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>A mathematical study of the excess growth rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the excess growth rate -- a fundamental logarithmic functional arising in portfolio theory -- from the perspective of information theory. We show that the excess growth rate can be connected to the R\'{e}nyi and cross entropies, the Helmholtz free energy, L. Campbell's measure of average code length and large deviations. Our main results consist of three axiomatic characterization theorems of the excess growth rate, in terms of (i) the relative entropy, (ii) the gap in Jensen's inequality, and (iii) the logarithmic divergence that generalizes the Bregman divergence. Furthermore, we study maximization of the excess growth rate and compare it with the growth optimal portfolio. Our results not only provide theoretical justifications of the significance of the excess growth rate, but also establish new connections between information theory and quantitative finance.</description>

      <title>Distributed learning for automatic modulation recognition in bandwidth-limited networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) is critical in identifying various modulation types in wireless communication systems. Recent advancements in deep learning have facilitated the integration of algorithms into AMR techniques. However, this integration typically follows a centralized approach that necessitates collecting and processing all training data on high-powered computing devices, which may prove impractical for bandwidth-limited wireless networks. In response to this challenge, this study introduces two methods for distributed learning-based AMR on the collaboration of multiple receivers to perform AMR tasks. The TeMuRAMRD 2023 dataset is employed to support this investigation, uniquely suited for multi-receiver AMR tasks. Within this distributed sensing environment, multiple receivers collaborate in identifying modulation types from the same RF signal, each possessing a partial perspective of the overall environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the centralized-based AMR, with six receivers, attains an impressive accuracy rate of 91%, while individual receivers exhibit a notably lower accuracy, at around 41%. Nonetheless, the two proposed decentralized learning-based AMR methods exhibit noteworthy enhancements. Based on consensus voting among six receivers, the initial method achieves a marginally lower accuracy. It achieves this while substantially reducing the bandwidth demands to a 1/256th of the centralized model. With the second distributed method, each receiver shares its feature map, subsequently aggregated by a central node. This approach also accompanies a substantial bandwidth reduction of 1/8 compared to the centralized approach. These findings highlight the capacity of distributed AMR to significantly enhance accuracy while effectively addressing the constraints of bandwidth-limited wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Ambient Backscatter Communication Assisted by Fluid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of a fluid reconfigurable intelligent surface (FRIS) into ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) systems. Unlike conventional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with fixed position elements, FRIS employs fluidic elements that can dynamically adjust their positions, offering enhanced spatial adaptability. We develop a system model where an AmBC tag communicates with a reader through an FRIS, which is particularly beneficial in scenarios where the direct tag-to-reader link is weak or blocked by obstacles. The achievable backscatter rate is analyzed, and the optimization of FRIS element positions is formulated as a non-convex problem. To address this, we employ particle swarm optimization (PSO) to obtain near-optimal configurations of the fluid elements. Simulation results demonstrate that FRIS-aided AmBC significantly outperforms conventional RIS-based AmBC systems in terms of achievable throughput.</description>

      <title>Aerial RIS-Enhanced Communications: Joint UAV Trajectory, Altitude Control, and Phase Shift Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a pivotal technology for enhancing wireless networks. Compared to terrestrial RIS deployed on building facades, aerial RIS (ARIS) mounted on quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) offers superior flexibility and extended coverage. However, the inevitable tilt and altitude variations of a quadrotor UAV during flight may lead to severe beam misalignment, significantly degrading ARIS's performance. To address this challenge, we propose a Euler angles-based ARIS control scheme that jointly optimizes the altitude and trajectory of the ARIS by leveraging the UAV's dynamic model. Considering the constraints on ARIS flight energy consumption, flight safety, and the transmission power of a base station (BS), we jointly design the ARIS's altitude, trajectory, phase shifts, and BS beamforming to maximize the system sum-rate. Due to the continuous control nature of ARIS flight and the strong coupling among variables, we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and adopt a soft actor-critic algorithm with prioritized experience replay to learn efficient ARIS control policies. Based on the optimized ARIS configuration, we further employ the water-filling and bisection method to efficiently determine the optimal BS beamforming. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms benchmarks in both convergence and communication performance, achieving approximately 14.4\% improvement in sum-rate. Moreover, in comparison to the fixed-horizontal ARIS scheme, the proposed scheme yields more adaptive trajectories and significantly mitigates performance degradation caused by ARIS tilting, demonstrating strong potential for practical ARIS deployment.</description>

      <title>Human- vs. AI-generated tests: dimensionality and information accuracy in latent trait evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in social and psychological research. Among potential applications, LLMs can be used to generate, customise, or adapt measurement instruments. This study presents a preliminary investigation of AI-generated questionnaires by comparing two ChatGPT-based adaptations of the Body Awareness Questionnaire (BAQ) with the validated human-developed version. The AI instruments were designed with different levels of explicitness in content and instructions on construct facets, and their psychometric properties were assessed using a Bayesian Graded Response Model. Results show that although surface wording between AI and original items was similar, differences emerged in dimensionality and in the distribution of item and test information across latent traits. These findings illustrate the importance of applying statistical measures of accuracy to ensure the validity and interpretability of AI-driven tools.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communications with World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication is a promising technique for emerging wireless applications, which reduces transmission overhead by transmitting only task-relevant features instead of raw data. However, existing methods struggle under extremely low bandwidth and varying channel conditions, where corrupted or missing semantics lead to severe reconstruction errors. To resolve this difficulty, we propose a world foundation model (WFM)-aided semantic video transmission framework that leverages the predictive capability of WFMs to generate future frames based on the current frame and textual guidance. This design allows transmissions to be omitted when predictions remain reliable, thereby saving bandwidth. Through WFM's prediction, the key semantics are preserved, yet minor prediction errors tend to amplify over time. To mitigate issue, a lightweight depth-based feedback module is introduced to determine whether transmission of the current frame is needed. Apart from transmitting the entire frame, a segmentation-assisted partial transmission method is proposed to repair degraded frames, which can further balance performance and bandwidth cost. Furthermore, an active transmission strategy is developed for mobile scenarios by exploiting camera trajectory information and proactively scheduling transmissions before channel quality deteriorates. Simulation results show that the proposed framework significantly reduces transmission overhead while maintaining task performances across varying scenarios and channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Error Bounds and Optimal Schedules for Masked Diffusions with Factorized Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently proposed generative models for discrete data, such as Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs), exploit conditional independence approximations to reduce the computational cost of popular Auto-Regressive Models (ARMs), at the price of some bias in the sampling distribution. We study the resulting computation-vs-accuracy trade-off, providing general error bounds (in relative entropy) that depend only on the average number of tokens generated per iteration and are independent of the data dimensionality (i.e. sequence length), thus supporting the empirical success of MDMs. We then investigate the gain obtained by using non-constant schedule sizes (i.e. varying the number of unmasked tokens during the generation process) and identify the optimal schedule as a function of a so-called information profile of the data distribution, thus allowing for a principled optimization of schedule sizes. We define methods directly as sampling algorithms and do not use classical derivations as time-reversed diffusion processes, leading us to simple and transparent proofs.</description>

      <title>Systematic Non-Binary Extension of LDPC-CSS Codes Preserving Orthogonality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study finite-field extensions that preserve the same support as the parity-check matrices defining a given binary CSS code. Here, an LDPC-CSS code refers to a CSS code whose parity-check matrices are orthogonal in the sense that each pair of corresponding rows overlaps in an even (possibly zero) number of positions, typically at most twice in sparse constructions. Beyond the low-density setting, we further propose a systematic construction method that extends to arbitrary CSS codes, providing feasible finite-field generalizations that maintain both the binary support and the orthogonality condition.</description>

      <title>Subgraph Federated Learning via Spectral Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of federated learning (FL) with graph-structured data distributed across multiple clients. In particular, we address the prevalent scenario of interconnected subgraphs, where interconnections between clients significantly influence the learning process. Existing approaches suffer from critical limitations, either requiring the exchange of sensitive node embeddings, thereby posing privacy risks, or relying on computationally-intensive steps, which hinders scalability. To tackle these challenges, we propose FedLap, a novel framework that leverages global structure information via Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to effectively capture inter-node dependencies while ensuring privacy and scalability. We provide a formal analysis of the privacy of FedLap, demonstrating that it preserves privacy. Notably, FedLap is the first subgraph FL scheme with strong privacy guarantees. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedLap achieves competitive or superior utility compared to existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Inverse-free quantum state estimation with Heisenberg scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an inverse-free pure quantum state estimation protocol that achieves Heisenberg scaling. Specifically, let $\mathcal{H}\cong \mathbb{C}^d$ be a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space with an orthonormal basis $\{|1\rangle,\ldots,|d\rangle\}$ and $U$ be an unknown unitary on $\mathcal{H}$. Our protocol estimates $U|d\rangle$ to within trace distance error $\varepsilon$ using $O(\min\{d^{3/2}/\varepsilon,d/\varepsilon^2\})$ forward queries to $U$. This complements the previous result $O(d\log(d)/\varepsilon)$ by van Apeldoorn, Cornelissen, Gily\'en, and Nannicini (SODA 2023), which requires both forward and inverse queries. Moreover, our result implies a query upper bound $O(\min\{d^{3/2}/\varepsilon,1/\varepsilon^2\})$ for inverse-free amplitude estimation, improving the previous best upper bound $O(\min\{d^{2}/\varepsilon,1/\varepsilon^2\})$ based on optimal unitary estimation by Haah, Kothari, O'Donnell, and Tang (FOCS 2023), and disproving a conjecture posed in Tang and Wright (2025).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To increase the information capacity of DNA storage, composite DNA letters were introduced. We propose a novel channel model for composite DNA in which composite sequences are decomposed into ordered standard non-composite sequences. The model is designed to handle any alphabet size and composite resolution parameter. We study the problem of reconstructing composite sequences of arbitrary resolution over the binary alphabet under substitution errors. We define two families of error-correcting codes and provide lower and upper bounds on their cardinality. In addition, we analyze the case in which a single deletion error occurs in the channel and present a systematic code construction for this setting. Finally, we briefly discuss the channel's capacity, which remains an open problem.</description>

      <title>Linear Operator Approximate Message Passing (OpAMP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for approximate message passing (AMP) in dynamic settings where the data at each iteration is passed through a linear operator. This framework is motivated in part by applications in large-scale, distributed computing where only a subset of the data is available at each iteration. An autoregressive memory term is used to mitigate information loss across iterations and a specialized algorithm, called projection AMP, is designed for the case where each linear operator is an orthogonal projection. Precise theoretical guarantees are provided for a class of Gaussian matrices and non-separable denoising functions. Specifically, it is shown that the iterates can be well-approximated in the high-dimensional limit by a Gaussian process whose second-order statistics are defined recursively via state evolution. These results are applied to the problem of estimating a rank-one spike corrupted by additive Gaussian noise using partial row updates, and the theory is validated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Learning to Equalize: Data-Driven Frequency-Domain Signal Recovery in Molecular Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In molecular communications (MC), inter-symbol interference (ISI) and noise are key factors that degrade communication reliability. Although time-domain equalization can effectively mitigate these effects, it often entails high computational complexity concerning the channel memory. In contrast, frequency-domain equalization (FDE) offers greater computational efficiency but typically requires prior knowledge of the channel model. To address this limitation, this letter proposes FDE techniques based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, enabling temporal correlation modeling in MC channels to improve ISI and noise suppression. To eliminate the reliance on prior channel information in conventional FDE methods, a supervised training strategy is employed for channel-adaptive equalization. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LSTM-FDE significantly reduces the bit error rate compared to traditional FDE and feedforward neural network-based equalizers. This performance gain is attributed to the LSTM's temporal modeling capabilities, which enhance noise suppression and accelerate model convergence, while maintaining comparable computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>NGGAN: Noise Generation GAN Based on the Practical Measurement Dataset for Narrowband Powerline Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To effectively process impulse noise for narrowband powerline communications (NB-PLCs) transceivers, capturing comprehensive statistics of nonperiodic asynchronous impulsive noise (APIN) is a critical task. However, existing mathematical noise generative models only capture part of the characteristics of noise. In this study, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) called noise generation GAN (NGGAN) that learns the complicated characteristics of practically measured noise samples for data synthesis. To closely match the statistics of complicated noise over the NB-PLC systems, we measured the NB-PLC noise via the analog coupling and bandpass filtering circuits of a commercial NB-PLC modem to build a realistic dataset. To train NGGAN, we adhere to the following principles: 1) we design the length of input signals that the NGGAN model can fit to facilitate cyclostationary noise generation; 2) the Wasserstein distance is used as a loss function to enhance the similarity between the generated noise and training data; and 3) to measure the similarity performances of GAN-based models based on the mathematical and practically measured datasets, we conduct both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The training datasets include: 1) a piecewise spectral cyclostationary Gaussian model (PSCGM); 2) a frequency-shift (FRESH) filter; and 3) practical measurements from NB-PLC systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the generated noise samples from the proposed NGGAN are highly close to the real noise samples. The principal component analysis (PCA) scatter plots and Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) analysis have shown that NGGAN outperforms other GAN-based models by generating noise samples with superior fidelity and higher diversity.</description>

      <title>Statistical physics of deep learning: Optimal learning of a multi-layer perceptron near interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For three decades statistical physics has been providing a framework to analyse neural networks. A long-standing question remained on its capacity to tackle deep learning models capturing rich feature learning effects, thus going beyond the narrow networks or kernel methods analysed until now. We positively answer through the study of the supervised learning of a multi-layer perceptron. Importantly, (i) its width scales as the input dimension, making it more prone to feature learning than ultra wide networks, and more expressive than narrow ones or with fixed embedding layers; and (ii) we focus on the challenging interpolation regime where the number of trainable parameters and data are comparable, which forces the model to adapt to the task. We consider the matched teacher-student setting. It provides the fundamental limits of learning random deep neural network targets and helps in identifying the sufficient statistics describing what is learnt by an optimally trained network as the data budget increases. A rich phenomenology emerges with various learning transitions. With enough data optimal performance is attained through model's "specialisation" towards the target, but it can be hard to reach for training algorithms which get attracted by sub-optimal solutions predicted by the theory. Specialisation occurs inhomogeneously across layers, propagating from shallow towards deep ones, but also across neurons in each layer. Furthermore, deeper targets are harder to learn. Despite its simplicity, the Bayesian-optimal setting provides insights on how the depth, non-linearity and finite (proportional) width influence neural networks in the feature learning regime that are potentially relevant way beyond it.</description>
