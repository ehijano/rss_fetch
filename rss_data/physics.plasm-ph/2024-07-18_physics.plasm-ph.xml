      <title>Impact of spatially varying transport coefficients in EMC3-Eirene simulations of W7-X and assessment of drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling the scrape-off layer of a stellarator is challenging due to the complex magnetic 3D geometry. The here presented study analyses simulations of the scrape-off layer (SOL) of the stellarator Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) using spatially varying diffusion coefficients for the magnetic standard configuration, extending our previous study. Comparing the EMC3-Eirene simulations with experimental observations, an inconsistency between the strike-line width (SLW) and the upstream parameters was observed. While to match the experimental SLW a particle diffusion coefficient $D \approx 0.2$ is needed, $D \approx 1$ is needed to get experimental separatrix temperatures of 50\,eV at the given experimental heating power. We asses the impact of physically motivated spatially varying transport coeffients. Agreement with experimental data can be improved, but various differences remain. We show that drifts are expected to help overcome the discrepancies and, thus, the development of SOL transport models including drifts is a necessary next step to study the SOL transport of the W7-X stellarator.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the Radiative Thermal Instability in a Confined Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermally bistable fluid tends to self-organize into clouds of hot and cold material, which are internally uniform and separated by thin conduction fronts. The evolution of these clouds has been studied for isobaric systems, but when pressure is instead treated as a dynamical quantity and allowed to evolve self-consistently, fundamentally different dynamics appear. Such a treatment is necessary in some laboratory plasmas, whose volume is constrained but whose pressure can vary. Solutions are derived for the evolution of clouds, accounting for pressure variation and interactions between conduction fronts. Additional stable configurations and secondary instabilities are derived, which may be relevant to fusion plasmas and to the study of photoionized plasma in the laboratory.</description>

      <title>Validation of the static forward Grad-Shafranov equilibrium solvers in FreeGSNKE and Fiesta using EFIT++ reconstructions from MAST-U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key aspect in the modelling of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria in tokamak devices is having access to fast, accurate, and stable numerical simulation methods. There is an increasing demand for reliable methods that can be used to develop traditional or machine learning-based shape control feedback systems, optimise scenario designs, and integrate with other plasma edge or transport modelling codes. To handle such applications, these codes need to be flexible and, more importantly, they need to have been validated against both analytically known and real-world tokamak equilibria to ensure they are consistent and credible. In this paper, we are interested in solving the static forward Grad-Shafranov (GS) problem for free-boundary MHD equilibria. Our focus is on the validation of the static forward solver in the Python-based equilibrium code FreeGSNKE by solving equilibria from magnetics-only EFIT++ reconstructions of MAST-U shots. In addition, we also validate FreeGSNKE against equilibria simulated using the well-established MATLAB-based equilibrium code Fiesta. To do this, we develop a computational pipeline that allows one to load the same (a)symmetric MAST-U machine description into each solver, specify the required inputs (active/passive conductor currents, plasma profiles and coefficients, etc.) from EFIT++, and solve the GS equation for all available time slices across a shot. For a number of different MAST-U shots, we demonstrate that both FreeGSNKE and Fiesta can successfully reproduce various poloidal flux quantities and shape targets (e.g. midplane radii, magnetic axes, separatrices, X-points, and strikepoints) in agreement with EFIT++ calculations to a very high degree of accuracy. We also provide public access to the code/data required to load the MAST-U machine description in FreeGSNKE/Fiesta and reproduce the equilibria in the shots shown.</description>

      <title>Suppression and excitation condition of collision on instabilities of electrostatic plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-stream (TS) and Bump-On-Tail (BOT) electron distributions can induce instabilities in collisionless plasmas, which is closely related to phenomena in space and fusion plasmas. Collisions can lead to unexpected plasma behavior, especially in dense and/or low temperature plasmas. In this work, the Vlasov-Poisson system with Krook collisions are used to study the effect of collisions. Normally, the collision can dissipate the system energy which causes the suppression of the instabilities. Against the traditional suppression effect of collision on the instability, it is found in our simulation that the collision can also excite the instability even in the forbidden beam velocity range predicted by the cold-beam theory. With collision, the beam velocity range can be divided into suppression area [vth/2, vc + vth], transition area [vc - vth, vc + vth], excitation area [vc + vth, 2vc] and forbidden area [2vc, +infinity] for TS instability. where vc is the critical velocity from cold-beam theory and vth is thermal velocity or the beam width in our simulation. The collision dissipation effect and the excitation of beam instability can compete with each other, which evoked the excitation of collision on TS instability. The collision can change the suppression and excitation condition from beam theory. However, for BOT instability, there is only suppression effect of collision on the instability. These results can expand the view of collision effect on instability of electrostatic plasmas.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of a helium Plasma-Material Interaction experiment in GyM linear device through SOLPS-ITER and ERO2.0 codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning how to safely handle Plasma-Material Interaction (PMI) is a key challenge towards the commercialisation of energy from nuclear fusion. In this respect, linear plasma devices are ideal experimental testbeds, and numerical codes play a crucial complementary role. In this paper, a numerical investigation of PMI-relevant helium plasma experimental discharges in GyM linear device is presented, in which SOLPS-ITER and ERO2.0 codes are coupled for plasma background generation and material erosion investigation respectively, with the aim to support the interpretation and complement the available experimental dataset. On the plasma side, simulated profiles are validated against experimental data to provide a realistic plasma background, and the role of He metastable states is assessed for the first time in SOLPS simulations. On the material side, the erosion and deposition effects due to the introduction of the sample-holder in the simulation volume are investigated, now considering also the real stainless steel composition as wall material.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum effects on radiation reaction in strong fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation reaction describes the effective force experienced by an accelerated charge due to radiation emission. Quantum effects dominate charge dynamics and radiation production[1][2] for charges accelerated by fields with strengths approaching the Schwinger field, $\mathbf{E_{sch}=}$\textbf{\SI[detect-weight]{1.3e18}{\volt\per\metre}[3]. Such fields exist in extreme astrophysical environments such as pulsar magnetospheres[4], may be accessed by high-power laser systems[5-7], dense particle beams interacting with plasma[8], crystals[9], and at the interaction point of next generation particle colliders[10]. Classical radiation reaction theories do not limit the frequency of radiation emitted by accelerating charges and omit stochastic effects inherent in photon emission[11], thus demanding a quantum treatment. Two quantum radiation reaction models, the quantum-continuous[12] and quantum-stochastic[13] models, correct the former issue, while only the quantum-stochastic model incorporates stochasticity[12]. Such models are of fundamental importance, providing insight into the effect of the electron self-force on its dynamics in electromagnetic fields. The difficulty of accessing conditions where quantum effects dominate inhibited previous efforts to observe quantum radiation reaction in charged particle dynamics with high significance. We report the first direct, high significance $(&gt;5{\sigma})$ observation of strong-field radiation reaction on charged particles. Furthermore, we obtain strong evidence favouring the quantum radiation reaction models, which perform equivalently, over the classical model. Robust model comparison was facilitated by a novel Bayesian framework which inferred collision parameters. This framework has widespread utility for experiments where parameters governing lepton-laser collisions cannot be directly measured, including those using conventional accelerators.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of self-steepening optical solitons in a periodic PT-symmetric potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the existence and stability dynamics of self-steepening optical solitons in a periodic PT-symmetric potential.
  We show that self-steepening solitons of the modified nonlinear Schr\"odinger (MNLS) equation undergo a position shift and amplitude increase during their evolution in the MNLS equation. The stabilization of solitons by an external potential is a challenging issue. This study demonstrates that the suppression of both the amplitude increase and the position shift of self-steepening solitons can be achieved by adding a periodic PT-symmetric potential to the MNLS equation.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic cold plasma modes in chiral vector Maxwell-Carroll-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the propagation and absorption of plasma waves in the context of the Maxwell-Carroll-Field-Jackiw (MCFJ) electrodynamics with a purely spacelike background playing the role of the anomalous Hall conductivity, concerning the anomalous Hall current. Such a current is also found in an axion field which increases linearly with a space coordinate. The Maxwell equations are rewritten for a cold, uniform, and collisionless fluid plasma model, allowing us to determine the new refractive indices and propagating modes. The analysis begins for propagation along the magnetic axis, examined in the cases of chiral vectors parallel and orthogonal to the magnetic field. Two distinct refractive indices (associated with right-handed circularly polarized [RCP] and left-handed circularly polarized [LCP] waves) are obtained and the associated propagation and absorption zones are determined. The low-frequency regime is discussed and we obtain RCP and LCP helicons. We scrutinize optical effects, such as birefringence and dichroism, and observe rotatory power sign reversion, a property of chiral MCFJ plasmas. We also examine the case of transversal propagation in the direction orthogonal to the magnetic field, providing much more involved results.</description>
