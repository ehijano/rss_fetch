      <title>Threefold Nature of Graded Vector Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graded vector bundles over a given $\mathbb{Z}$-graded manifold can be defined in three different ways: certain sheaves of graded modules over the structure sheaf of the base graded manifold, finitely generated projective graded modules over the algebra of global functions on the base graded manifold, or locally trivial graded manifolds with a suitable linear structure. We argue that all three approaches are the same. More precisely, the respective categories are proved to be equivalent.</description>

      <title>Flat Generalized Connections on Courant Algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a family of metric generalized connections on transitive Courant algebroids, which includes the canonical Levi-Civita connection, and study the flatness condition. We find that the building blocks for such flat transitive Courant algebroids are compact simple Lie groups. Further, we give a description of left-invariant flat Levi-Civita generalized connections on such Lie groups, which, in particular, shows the existence of non-flat ones.</description>

      <title>Deformations of Nijenhuis Lie algebras and Nijenhuis Lie algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a series dedicated to the operadic study of Nijenhuis structures, focusing on Nijenhuis Lie algebras and Nijenhuis geometry. We introduce the concept of homotopy Nijenhuis Lie algebras and establish that the differential graded (=dg) operad $\mathfrak{NjL}_{\infty}$ governing these structures serves as the minimal model of the operad $\mathfrak{NjL}$ for Nijenhuis Lie algebras. We construct an $L_\infty$-algebra that encodes the simultaneous deformations of Lie brackets and Nijenhuis operators, leading to the deformation cochain complex and an associated cohomology theory for Nijenhuis Lie algebras. Extending these ideas to geometry, we investigate the deformations of geometric Nijenhuis structures. We introduce the notion of a Nijenhuis Lie algebroid-a Lie algebroid equipped with a Nijenhuis structure, which generalizes the classical Nijenhuis structure on vector fields of manifolds. Using the framework of dg manifolds, we construct an $L_\infty$-algebra that governs the simultaneous deformations of Lie algebroid structures and Nijenhuis operators. As a computational application, we prove that a certain class of Nijenhuis operators satisfies the Poincar\'e Lemma, meaning its cohomology vanishes, which confirms a conjecture by Bolsinov and Konyaev.</description>

      <title>Weighted cscK metric (II): the continuity method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the existence of metrics with weighted constant scalar curvature (wcscK for short) on a compact K\"ahler manifold $X$: this notion include constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics, weighted solitons, Calabi's extremal K\"ahler metrics and extremal metric on semisimple principal fibrations. We prove that the coercivity of the weighted Mabuchi functional implies the existence of a wcscK metric, thereby achieving the equivalence. \\ We then give several applications in K\"ahler and toric geometry, such as a weighted version of the toric Yau-Tian-Donaldson correspondence, and the characterization of the existence of wcscK metric on total space of semisimple principal fibration $Y$ in term of existence of wcscK metric on its fiber $X$.</description>

      <title>Convexity on Manifolds without Focal points and Spectrum of the Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convexity on complete Riemannian manifolds has typically been studied under constraints on the sign of sectional curvatures. This is especially so in the study of the effect of convexity on the spectrum of the Laplacian. In this article, we use the language of Jacobi tensors to construct a strictly convex function with bounded gradient on complete simply connected manifolds without focal points having negative Ricci curvature. From this we obtain a lower bound for the growth of the volume of geodesic balls, if the manifold is also assumed to be K\"ahler. Our primary applications concern the spectrum of the Laplacian. We use the strictly convex function which we construct to show that the spectrum of the Laplacian is absolutely continuous on a class of asymptotically harmonic manifolds. In fact, we completely determine the spectrum of the Laplacian on simply connected noncompact nonflat harmonic manifolds without focal points. For asymptotically harmonic manifolds we also show that equality holds in Cheeger's inequality for the bottom of the spectrum, where Cheeger's constant is equal to the constant mean curvature of the horospheres. We show that the well known description of the spectrum of the Laplacian on Riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type and arbitrary rank can also be recovered using these geometric methods.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue estimates of the Kohn-Dirac operator on CR manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a new eigenvalue estimate for the Kohn-Dirac operator on a compact CR manifold. The equality case of this estimate is characterized by the existence of a CR twistor spinor. We then classify CR manifolds carrying such spinors by showing that the Webster Ricci tensor has at most two eigenvalues. In this context, we construct several examples.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Nonlinear Model Reduction to Spectral Submanifolds via Oblique Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics in a primary Spectral Submanifold (SSM) constructed over the slowest modes of a dynamical system provide an ideal reduced-order model for nearby trajectories. Modeling the dynamics of trajectories further away from the primary SSM, however, is difficult if the linear part of the system exhibits strong non-normal behavior. Such non-normality implies that simply projecting trajectories onto SSMs along directions normal to the slow linear modes will not pair those trajectories correctly with their reduced counterparts on the SSMs. In principle, a well-defined nonlinear projection along a stable invariant foliation exists and would exactly match the full dynamics to the SSM-reduced dynamics. This foliation, however, cannot realistically be constructed from practically feasible amounts and distributions of experimental data. Here we develop an oblique projection technique that is able to approximate this foliation efficiently, even from a single experimental trajectory of a significantly non-normal and nonlinear beam.</description>

      <title>Geometric aspects of non-homogeneous 1+0 operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Led by the key example of the Korteweg-de Vries equation, we study pairs of Hamiltonian operators which are non-homogeneous and are given by the sum of a first-order operator and an ultralocal structure. We present a complete classification of the Casimir functions associated with the degenerate operators in two and three components. We define tensorial criteria to establish the compatibility of two non-homogeneous operators and show a classification of pairs for systems in two components, with some preliminary results for three components as well. Lastly, we study pairs composed of non-degenerateop erators only, introducing the definition of bi-pencils. First results show that the considered operators can be related to Nijenhuis geometry, proving a compatibility result in this direction in the framework of Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>A universal characteristic class for vector bundles with a connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the paper I introduce a new characteristic class $c(E)$ for a finite rank vector bundle $E$ on an affine scheme $S:=Spec(A)$ - the fundamental class of $E$. The class $c(E)$ is not a characteristic class in the classical sense in the sense that it lives in a ponted cohomology torsor $\operatorname{Ext}^1(L, \operatorname{End}_A(E))$. Most characteristic classes lives in a cohomology group. The pointed cohomology torsor $\operatorname{Ext}^1(L, \operatorname{End}_A(E))$ is a torsor on the abelian group $\operatorname{H}^2(L, Z(\operatorname{End}_A(E)))$ where $Z(\operatorname{End}_A(E))$ is the center of the ring of endomorphisms of $E$ and where the cohomology is the Lie-Rinehart cohomology of the center. The class $c(E)$ is trivial if and only if $E$ has a flat algebraic connection. Hence the class $c(T_S)$ where $T_S$ is the tangent bundle, is an an obstruction for $S$ to be algebraically parallelizable. I use a connection $\nabla$ to define $c(E)$ and I also prove the class $c(E)$ is independent of choice of connection, hence $c(E)$ is an invariant of the vector bundle $E$. The class generalize the Chern class, the Pontryagin class, the Euler class and the Teleman characteristic class. I prove using an explicit example that the class $c(E)$ is stronger than the Chern class and the Euler class. I also give a new proof of a formula for the curvature of a connection $\nabla$ in terms of an idempotent endomorphism $\phi$ defining $E$. This formula was claimed and proved in a paper put out on the arXiv in 2011, and in this paper I give a new proof that is easier to read. The class may be interesting in the study of the "cancellation problem" in affine algebraic geometry and the problem of giving algebraic formulas for the topological Euler characteristic. I also calculate the algebraic deRham cohomology of the complex two sphere and prove it is infinite dimensional.</description>

      <title>On the intertwining differential operators between vector bundles over the real projective space of dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22323v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is twofold. One is to classify and construct $SL(3,\mathbb{R})$-intertwining differential operators between vector bundles over the real projective space $\mathbb{RP}^2$. It turns out that two kinds of operators appear. We call them Cartan operators and PRV operators. The second objective is then to study the representations realized on the kernel of those operators both in the smooth and holomorphic setting. A key machinery is the BGG resolution. In particular, by exploiting some results of Davidson-Enright-Stanke and Enright-Joseph, the irreducible unitary highest weight modules of $SU(1,2)$ at the (first) reduction points are classified by the image of Cartan operators and kernel of PRV operators.</description>

      <title>Non-Archimedean Hilbert geometry and degenerations of real Hilbert geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of Hilbert geometry over general ordered valued fields, associating with an open convex subset of the projective space a quotient Hilbert metric space. Under natural non-degeneracy assumptions, we prove that the ultralimit of a sequence of rescaled real Hilbert geometries is isometric to the Hilbert metric space of an open convex projective subset over a Robinson field. This result allows us to prove that ideal points of the space of convex real projective structures on a closed manifold arise from actions on non-Archimedean Hilbert geometries without global fixed point. We explicitly describe the Hilbert metric space of a non-Archimedean bounded polytope $P$ defined over a subfield of the valuation ring as the geometric realization of the flag complex of $P$ modeled on a Weyl chamber. As an application, we obtain a complete description of Gromov-Hausdorff limits of a real polytope with rescaled Hilbert metric.</description>

Abstract: Transport twistor spaces are degenerate complex $2$-dimensional manifolds $Z$ that complexify transport problems on Riemannian surfaces, appearing e.g.~in geometric inverse problems. This article considers maps $\beta\colon Z\to \mathbb{C}^2$ with a holomorphic blow-down structure that resolve the degeneracy of the complex structure and allow to gain insight into the complex geometry of $Z$. The main theorems provide global $\beta$-maps for constant curvature metrics and their perturbations and local $\beta$-maps for arbitrary metrics, thereby proving a version of the classical Newlander--Nirenberg theorem for degenerate complex structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove localised weighted curvature integral estimates for solutions to the Ricci flow in the setting of a smooth four dimensional Ricci flow or a closed $n$-dimensional K\"ahler Ricci flow. These integral estimates improve and extend the integral curvature estimates shown by the second author in an earlier paper. If the scalar curvature is uniformly bounded in the spatial $L^p$ sense for some $p&gt;2,$ then the estimates imply a uniform bound on the spatial $L^2$ norm of the Riemannian curvature tensor. Stronger integral estimates are shown to hold if one further assumes a weak non-inflating condition, or we restrict to closed manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The heterotic $SU(3)$ system, also known as the Hull--Strominger system, arises from compactifications of heterotic string theory to six dimensions. This paper investigates the local structure of the moduli space of solutions to this system on a compact 6-manifold $X$, using a vector bundle $Q=(T^{1,0}X)^* \oplus {End}(E) \oplus T^{1,0}X$, where $E\to X$ is the classical gauge bundle arising in the system. We establish that the moduli space has an expected dimension of zero. We achieve this by studying the deformation complex associated to a differential operator $\bar{D}$, which emulates a holomorphic structure on $Q$, and demonstrating an isomorphism between the two cohomology groups which govern the infinitesimal deformations and obstructions in the deformation theory for the system. We also provide a Dolbeault-type theorem linking these cohomology groups to \v{C}ech cohomology, a result which might be of independent interest, as well as potentially valuable for future research.</description>

      <title>Volume estimates and convergence results for solutions to Ricci flow with $L^{p}$ bounded scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study $n$-dimensional Ricci flows $(M^n,g(t))_{t\in [0,T)},$ where $T&lt; \infty$ is a potentially singular time, and for which the spatial $L^p$ norm, $p&gt;\frac n 2$, of the scalar curvature is uniformly bounded on $[0,T).$
  In the case that $M$ is closed and four dimensional, we explain why non-collapsing estimates hold and how they can be combined with integral bounds on the Ricci and full curvature tensor of the prequel paper of the authors, as well as non-inflating estimates (already known due to works of Bamler), to obtain an improved space time integral bound of the Ricci curvature.
  As an application of these estimates, we show that if we further restrict to $n=4$, then the solution convergences to an orbifold as $t \to T$ and that the flow can be extended using the Orbifold Ricci flow to the time interval $ [0,T+\sigma)$ for some $\sigma&gt;0.$
  We also prove local versions of many of the results mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Additional first order equation for infinitesimal bendings of smooth surfaces in the isothermal coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The article contributes to the theory of infinitesimal bendings of smooth surfaces in Euclidean 3-space. We derive a linear differential equation of the first order, which previously did not appear in the literature and which is satisfied by any Darboux rotation field of a smooth surface. We show that, for some surfaces, this additional equation is functionally independent of the three standard equations that the Darboux rotation field satisfies (and by which it is determined). As a consequence of this additional equation, we prove the maximum principle for the components of the Darboux rotation field for a class of disk-homeomorphic surfaces containing not only surfaces of positive Gaussian curvature.</description>

      <title>Manifold learning in Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims at building the theoretical foundations for manifold learning algorithms in the space of absolutely continuous probability measures $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{a.c.}}(\Omega)$ with $\Omega$ a compact and convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$, metrized with the Wasserstein-2 distance $\mathbb{W}$. We begin by introducing a construction of submanifolds $\Lambda$ in $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{a.c.}}(\Omega)$ equipped with metric $\mathbb{W}_\Lambda$, the geodesic restriction of $\mathbb{W}$ to $\Lambda$. In contrast to other constructions, these submanifolds are not necessarily flat, but still allow for local linearizations in a similar fashion to Riemannian submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^d$. We then show how the latent manifold structure of $(\Lambda,\mathbb{W}_{\Lambda})$ can be learned from samples $\{\lambda_i\}_{i=1}^N$ of $\Lambda$ and pairwise extrinsic Wasserstein distances $\mathbb{W}$ on $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{a.c.}}(\Omega)$ only. In particular, we show that the metric space $(\Lambda,\mathbb{W}_{\Lambda})$ can be asymptotically recovered in the sense of Gromov--Wasserstein from a graph with nodes $\{\lambda_i\}_{i=1}^N$ and edge weights $W(\lambda_i,\lambda_j)$. In addition, we demonstrate how the tangent space at a sample $\lambda$ can be asymptotically recovered via spectral analysis of a suitable ``covariance operator'' using optimal transport maps from $\lambda$ to sufficiently close and diverse samples $\{\lambda_i\}_{i=1}^N$. The paper closes with some explicit constructions of submanifolds $\Lambda$ and numerical examples on the recovery of tangent spaces through spectral analysis.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness and minimality of Euler's elastica with monotone curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an old problem of Euler's elastica we prove the novel global property that every planar elastica with non-constant monotone curvature is uniquely minimal subject to the clamped boundary condition. We also partly extend this unique minimality to the length-penalised case; this result is new even in view of local minimality. As an application we prove uniqueness of global minimisers in the straightening problem for generic boundary angles.</description>

      <title>Existence of Solutions to the Seiberg-Witten Vortex Equations with Exponential Decay on the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clifford Taubes showed that the moduli space of the variational equation of the Yang-Mills-Higgs functional on the plane is non-empty, and its elements correspond to "vortices". Inspired by this result, in this paper, we show that the moduli space of the Hitchin-type dimensional reduction of the Seiberg-Witten equations on the plane contains both exponentially decayed solutions and polynomial growth solutions. Furthermore, we show that there is correspondence from the moduli space of exponentially decayed and polynomial growth solutions to the symmetric products of complex numbers. The correspondence restricted to the latter is a surjective map.</description>
