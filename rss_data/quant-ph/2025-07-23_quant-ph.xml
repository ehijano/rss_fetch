      <title>Shot-Efficient ADAPT-VQE via Reused Pauli Measurements and Variance-Based Shot Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Adaptive Variational Quantum Eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) is a promising approach for quantum algorithms in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, offering advantages over traditional VQE methods by reducing circuit depth and mitigating challenges in classical optimization. However, a major challenge in ADAPT-VQE is the high quantum measurement (shot) overhead required for circuit parameter optimization and operator selection. In this work, we propose two integrated strategies to reduce the shot requirements in ADAPT-VQE. First, we reuse Pauli measurement outcomes obtained during VQE parameter optimization in the subsequent operator selection step of the next ADAPT-VQE iteration, which involves operator gradient measurements. Second, we apply variance-based shot allocation to both Hamiltonian and operator gradient measurements. Our numerical results demonstrate that each method, individually and in combination, significantly reduces the number of shots needed to achieve chemical accuracy while maintaining result fidelity across the studied molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Many-body delocalization with a two-dimensional 70-qubit superconducting quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems with sufficiently strong disorder can exhibit a non-equilibrium phenomenon, known as the many-body localization (MBL), which is distinct from conventional thermalization. While the MBL regime has been extensively studied in one dimension, its existence in higher dimensions remains elusive, challenged by the avalanche instability. Here, using a 70-qubit two-dimensional (2D) superconducting quantum simulator, we experimentally explore the robustness of the MBL regime in controlled finite-size 2D systems. We observe that the decay of imbalance becomes more pronounced with increasing system sizes, scaling up from 21, 42 to 70 qubits, with a relatively large disorder strength, and for the first time, provide an evidence for the many-body delocalization in 2D disordered systems. Our experimental results are consistent with the avalanche theory that predicts the instability of MBL regime beyond one spatial dimension. This work establishes a scalable platform for probing high-dimensional non-equilibrium phases of matter and their finite-size effects using superconducting quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computational-Sensing Advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to deliver large advantages on computational tasks, but advantages for practical tasks are not yet achievable with current hardware. Quantum sensing is an entirely separate quantum technology that can provide its own kind of a quantum advantage. In this Perspective, we explain how the merger of quantum sensing with quantum computing has recently given rise to the notion of quantum computational sensing, and a new kind of quantum advantage: a quantum computational-sensing advantage. This advantage can be realized with far lower hardware requirements than purely computational quantum advantage. We explain how several recent proposals and experiments can be understood as quantum computational sensing, and discuss categorizations of the general architectures that quantum-computational-sensing protocols can have. We conclude with an outlook on open questions and the prospects for quantum computational sensors and quantum computational-sensing advantage.</description>

      <title>The spatiotemporal Born rule is quasiprobabilistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrary to the joint probabilities associated with measurements performed on spacelike separated quantum systems -- which are defined in terms of the Born rule -- the joint probabilities associated with the outcomes of \emph{sequential} measurements on a quantum system may not in general be consistently computed in terms of the trace of a fixed operator multiplied by a tensor product of projectors. However, in this work we show that if one modifies the probabilities associated with two-point sequential measurements by a correction term which accounts for state disturbance due to the initial measurement, then one obtains a quasiprobability distribution which is uniquely encoded by a bipartite operator which may be viewed as a spatiotemporal quantum state, thus yielding a spatiotemporal extension of the Born rule. Moreover, we prove that such a correction term may be viewed as an obstruction to the existence of a Born rule for the joint probabilities associated with sequential measurements, as we show that such a Born rule exists only when the probabilities and the aforementioned quasiprobabilities in fact coincide. We also show that when the notion of Bayesian inversion for quantum channels is applied in conjunction with the spatiotemporal Born rule, one naturally arrives at a quasiprobabilistic Bayes' rule for sequential measurements.</description>

      <title>On small perturbations of coherent information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum capacity quantifies the amount of quantum information that can be transmitted by a quantum channel with an arbitrary small probability of error. Mathematically, the quantum capacity is given by an asymptotic formula involving the one-shot quantum capacity of the associated channel, which, due to purely quantum effects such as superadditivity of one-shot quantum capacity, is rarely computable. The one-shot quantum capacity is mathematically characterized in terms of optimizing an entropic quantity referred to as coherent information over all possible input states of a channel, the computation of which also tends to be intractable due to the difficulty of optimizing the coherent information. In this work, we develop perturbative methods for analyzing the behavior of coherent information of a quantum channel with respect to small perturbations of the input state. By doing so, we are able to derive three general criteria for determining whether an input state yields suboptimal coherent information. We then show how our criteria yield sufficient conditions for superadditivity of one-shot quantum capacity, and also for detecting a positive gap between one-shot private capacity and one-shot quantum capacity. The utility of our criteria is illustrated through examples, which yield new results regarding the one-shot quantum capacity of qubit depolarizing channels, Pauli channels and dephrasure channels.</description>

      <title>Exact distinguishability between real-valued and complex-valued Haar random quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Haar random states are fundamental objects in quantum information theory and quantum computing. We study the density matrix resulting from sampling $t$ copies of a $d$-dimensional quantum state according to the Haar measure on the orthogonal group. In particular, we analytically compute its spectral decomposition. This allows us to compute exactly the trace distance between $t$-copies of a real Haar random state and $t$-copies of a complex Haar random state. Using this we show a lower-bound on the approximation parameter of real-valued state $t$-designs and improve the lower-bound on the number of copies required for imaginarity testing.</description>

      <title>Simulation of quantum contextuality with invasive-measurement maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextuality is a defining feature that separates the quantum from the classical descriptions of physical systems. Building upon the marginal-scenario framework, we introduce a general method to characterize contextuality through stochastic linear maps. These maps effectively model invasive measurements on an otherwise classical statistics, relating probabilities within the noncontextuality polytope that includes all classical probabilities to probabilities outside the polytope. Our approach provides a systematic way to simulate contextuality from classical resources, enabling the identification of the structural properties of such maps. Moreover, it offers a quantification of contextuality based on the invasiveness cost, i.e., a property intrinsic to the maps themselves, rather than to the probabilities they act upon.</description>

      <title>A resource theoretical unification of Mpemba effects: classical and quantum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect originally referred to the observation that, under certain thermalizing dynamics, initially hotter samples can cool faster than colder ones. This effect has since been generalized to other anomalous relaxation behaviors even beyond classical domains, such as symmetry restoration in quantum systems. This work demonstrates that resource theories, widely employed in information theory, provide a unified organizing principle to frame Mpemba physics. We show how the conventional thermal Mpemba effect arises naturally from the resource theory of athermality, while its symmetry-restoring counterpart is fully captured by the resource theories of asymmetry. Leveraging the framework of modes of asymmetry, we demonstrate that the Mpemba effect due to symmetry restoration is governed by the initial overlap with the slowest symmetry-restoring mode -- mirroring the role of the slowest Liouvillian eigenmode in thermal Mpemba dynamics. Through this resource-theoretical formalism, we uncover the connection between these seemingly disparate effects and show that the dynamics of thermalization naturally splits into a symmetry-respecting and a symmetry-breaking term.</description>

      <title>Qubit-Efficient Quantum Algorithm for Linear Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum hardware rapidly advances toward the early fault-tolerant era, a key challenge is to develop quantum algorithms that are not only theoretically sound but also hardware-friendly on near-term devices. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm for solving linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a provable runtime guarantee. Our algorithm uses only a single ancilla qubit, and is locality preserving, i.e., when the coefficient matrix of the ODE is $k$-local, the algorithm only needs to implement the time evolution of $(k+1)$-local Hamiltonians. We also discuss the connection between our proposed algorithm and Lindbladian simulation as well as its application to the interacting Hatano-Nelson model, a widely studied non-Hermitian model with rich phenomenology.</description>

      <title>On-chip stencil lithography for superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improvements in circuit design and more recently in materials and surface cleaning have contributed to a rapid development of coherent superconducting qubits. However, organic resists commonly used for shadow evaporation of Josephson junctions (JJs) pose limitations due to residual contamination, poor thermal stability and compatibility under typical surface-cleaning conditions. To provide an alternative, we developed an inorganic SiO$_2$/Si$_3$N$_4$ on-chip stencil lithography mask for JJ fabrication. The stencil mask is resilient to aggressive cleaning agents and it withstands high temperatures up to 1200\textdegree{}C, thereby opening new avenues for JJ material exploration and interface optimization. To validate the concept, we performed shadow evaporation of Al-based transmon qubits followed by stencil mask lift-off using vapor hydrofluoric acid, which selectively etches SiO$_2$. We demonstrate average $T_1 \approx 75 \pm 11~\SI{}{\micro\second}$ over a 200 MHz frequency range in multiple cool-downs for one device, and $T_1 \approx 44\pm 8~\SI{}{\micro\second}$ for a second device. These results confirm the compatibility of stencil lithography with state-of-the-art superconducting quantum devices and motivate further investigations into materials engineering, film deposition and surface cleaning techniques.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Quantum Soundness for Bipartite Compiled Bell Games via the Sequential NPA Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compiling Bell games under cryptographic assumptions replaces the need for physical separation, allowing nonlocality to be probed with a single untrusted device. While Kalai et al. (STOC'23) showed that this compilation preserves quantum advantages, its quantitative quantum soundness has remained an open problem. We address this gap with two primary contributions. First, we establish the first quantitative quantum soundness bounds for every bipartite compiled Bell game whose optimal quantum strategy is finite-dimensional: any polynomial-time prover's score in the compiled game is negligibly close to the game's ideal quantum value. More generally, for all bipartite games we show that the compiled score cannot significantly exceed the bounds given by a newly formalized sequential Navascu\'es-Pironio-Ac\'in (NPA) hierarchy. Second, we provide a full characterization of this sequential NPA hierarchy, establishing it as a robust numerical tool that is of independent interest. Finally, for games without finite-dimensional optimal strategies, we explore the necessity of NPA approximation error for quantitatively bounding their compiled scores, linking these considerations to the complexity conjecture $\mathrm{MIP}^{\mathrm{co}}=\mathrm{coRE}$ and open challenges such as quantum homomorphic encryption correctness for "weakly commuting" quantum registers.</description>

      <title>Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier with Inverse Kerr Phase Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPA) have emerged as highly versatile devices, offering broadband amplification with quantum-limited noise performance. They hold significant potential for addressing the readout bottleneck in prototype quantum computers, enabling scalability. Key challenges with this technology include achieving sufficient gain with minimal gain ripple while maintaining low noise performance. Efficient phase matching between a weak signal and a strong pump over the entire length of the TWPA is critical to overcoming these challenges. We present an experimental demonstration of the inverse Kerr phase matching technique in a TWPA, first proposed in Ref. Phys. Rev. Appl. 4, 024014. This method addresses several limitations of conventional dispersion engineering approaches of phase matching in the four-wave mixing parametric process in TWPAs. Most notably the existence of an unusable region of gain near the pump frequency which typically corresponds to the region of most optimal phase matching and maximum gain. The inverse Kerr phase matching approach, allows for greater frequency separation between the region of optimal gain and pump, \textit{in situ} tunability of the pump, minimal gain ripple, and a compact footprint which reduces losses. A TWPA employing the inverse Kerr phase matching technique experimentally demonstrated 20 dB of gain over a 3 GHz instantaneous bandwidth, with a tunable bandwidth of 8 GHz, minimal gain ripple, and near quantum-limited noise performance, with 1.5 photons of added noise.</description>

      <title>Quantum synchronization between two strongly driven YIG spheres mediated via a microwave cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of synchronization between two strongly driven magnon modes indirectly coupled via a single-mode microwave cavity. Each magnon mode, hosted in separate Yttrium Iron Garnet spheres, interacts coherently with the cavity field, leading to cavity-mediated nonlinear coupling. We show, by using input-output formalism, that both classical and quantum synchronization emerge for appropriate choices of coupling, detuning, and driving. We find that thermal noise reduces quantum synchronization, highlighting the importance of low-temperature conditions. This study provides useful insights into tunable magnonic interactions in cavity systems, with possible applications in quantum information processing and hybrid quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Computational Performance Bounds Prediction in Quantum Computing with Unstable Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has significantly advanced in recent years, boasting devices with hundreds of quantum bits (qubits), hinting at its potential quantum advantage over classical computing. Yet, noise in quantum devices poses significant barriers to realizing this supremacy. Understanding noise's impact is crucial for reproducibility and application reuse; moreover, the next-generation quantum-centric supercomputing essentially requires efficient and accurate noise characterization to support system management (e.g., job scheduling), where ensuring correct functional performance (i.e., fidelity) of jobs on available quantum devices can even be higher-priority than traditional objectives. However, noise fluctuates over time, even on the same quantum device, which makes predicting the computational bounds for on-the-fly noise is vital. Noisy quantum simulation can offer insights but faces efficiency and scalability issues. In this work, we propose a data-driven workflow, namely QuBound, to predict computational performance bounds. It decomposes historical performance traces to isolate noise sources and devises a novel encoder to embed circuit and noise information processed by a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. For evaluation, we compare QuBound with a state-of-the-art learning-based predictor, which only generates a single performance value instead of a bound. Experimental results show that the result of the existing approach falls outside of performance bounds, while all predictions from our QuBound with the assistance of performance decomposition better fit the bounds. Moreover, QuBound can efficiently produce practical bounds for various circuits with over 106 speedup over simulation; in addition, the range from QuBound is over 10x narrower than the state-of-the-art analytical approach.</description>

Abstract: The development of high-performance quantum technologies relies on the ability to prepare the quantum states of solid-state emitters with high fidelity while cleanly separating the emitted photons from the driving field. Here, we present a comprehensive theoretical comparison of three single-pulse coherent control protocols: resonant Rabi oscillations, adiabatic rapid passage (ARP), and notch-filtered ARP (NARP). To establish an ideal performance baseline, we first map the parameter spaces for each protocol in a closed system, identifying the regions of robust population inversion. We then use a Lindblad master equation to compute the time-resolved emission spectra in the presence of decoherence. Our results show that while all three schemes can generate identical, transform-limited Lorentzian photons, NARP uniquely combines the high-fidelity robustness of adiabatic passage with intrinsic spectral separability. Our findings, which align with the work on NARP by Wilbur et al., establish a clear design framework for engineering the next generation of quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Explicit Formulas for Estimating Trace of Reduced Density Matrix Powers via Single-Circuit Measurement Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the fields of quantum mechanics and quantum information science, the traces of reduced density matrix powers play a crucial role in the study of quantum systems and have numerous important applications. In this paper, we propose a universal framework to simultaneously estimate the traces of the $2$nd to the $n$th powers of a reduced density matrix using a single quantum circuit with $n$ copies of the quantum state. Specifically, our approach leverages the controlled SWAP test and establishes explicit formulas connecting measurement probabilities to these traces. We further develop two algorithms: a purely quantum method and a hybrid quantum-classical approach combining Newton-Girard iteration. Rigorous analysis via Hoeffding inequality demonstrates the method's efficiency, requiring only $M=O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}\log(\frac{n}{\delta})\right)$ measurements to achieve precision $\epsilon$ with confidence $1-\delta$. Additionally, we explore various applications including the estimation of nonlinear functions and the representation of entanglement measures. Numerical simulations are conducted for two maximally entangled states, the GHZ state and the W state, to validate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Quantum metrology in a nonlinear-interferometer with feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a nonlinear interferometer with feedback loops and explore its efficiency for phase estimation. We analyse two feedback schemes, one where both modes of the interferometer are fed-back into the device and another where only one mode is fed-back. The quantum Fisher information (QFI) for phase estimation in each feedback scheme increases with each feedback loop, and similar to the standard SU(1,1) nonlinear interferometer, phase estimation in this scheme is sensitive to photon loss when the inputs are vacuum state. In terms of resources, we show that, in the low-loss regime, our scheme performs better than standard nonlinear interferometer. The feedback scheme provides the minimum phase variance when the unknown phase is small. We have also provided a special case where feedback scheme provided enhanced QFI even for large phase values. This is achieved by switching between squeezing and anti-squeezing operators after every few loops.</description>

      <title>A Cost-Effective Quantum Boolean-Phase SWAP Gate with Only Two CNOT Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new Boolean-Phase swapping gate is presented with improved quantum generality and cost-effectiveness. Our swapping gate is termed the "p-SWAP gate", where p is the phase difference selected for a set of swapped qubits. The phase p is expressed in radians and $-{\pi}~{\leq}$ p ${\leq}~+{\pi}$. The generality of p-SWAP gate is demonstrated for Phase applications for selected values of p and for Boolean applications when the value of p is ignored. The cost-effectiveness of p-SWAP gate follows from the lower quantum cost and depth of its final realized (transpiled) quantum circuit, when compared to the standard SWAP gate composed of three Feynman (CNOT) gates. Specifically, our presented p-SWAP gate utilizes only two CNOT gates. The quantum circuit of the p-SWAP gate is visually designed using our previously developed Bloch sphere approach. Experimentally, after transpilation for an IBM quantum computer, the transpiled p-SWAP gate shows an approximate 23% quantum cost reduction and an approximate 26% depth minimization compared to the transpiled standard SWAP gate.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial local observables and impermeable and permeable boundary conditions for 1D KFGM particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real solutions of the 1D Klein-Fock-Gordon (KFG) equation automatically cancel out the usual two-vector current density; consequently, the respective continuity equation is trivially satisfied, and a globally conserved quantity cannot be obtained. The latter is a well-known result in relativistic quantum mechanics. Additionally, distinguishing between impermeable and permeable boundary conditions (BCs) at a point is not possible; for the latter type of BC, the pertinent current density cannot be zero at that point. We solve these first-quantized conflicts in detail by using a particular nontrivial local observable -- an energy current density -- that allows us to characterize a strictly neutral 1D KFG particle, i.e., a 1D KFG-Majorana (KFGM) particle, when it is confined to an interval and when it is, say, in an interval with transparent walls. All the BCs for this system are extracted from the pseudo self-adjointness of the Feshbach-Villars (FV) Hamiltonian plus two Majorana conditions. We also show that this energy current density and a nontrivial energy density satisfy a continuity equation when the Lorentz scalar interaction present in the 1D KFG equations is time independent; in addition, they always lead to a conserved quantity. Moreover, this energy current density can characterize all available confining and nonconfining BCs. In contrast, the commonly used energy current density -- a component of the energy-momentum tensor of the system -- cannot do so for all the BCs. Additionally, this latter quantity and its respective energy density -- another component of the energy-momentum tensor -- do not necessarily lead to a conserved quantity. Our results dramatically highlight the important role played by the BCs when they are imposed on a system in which particles occupy a finite region.</description>

      <title>Quantum walks reveal topological flat bands, robust edge states and topological phase transitions in cyclic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases, edge states, and flat bands in synthetic quantum systems are a key resource for topological quantum computing and noise-resilient information processing. We introduce a scheme based on step-dependent quantum walks on cyclic graphs, termed cyclic quantum walks (CQWs), to simulate exotic topological phenomena using discrete Fourier transforms and an effective Hamiltonian. Our approach enables the generation of both gapped and gapless topological phases, including Dirac cone-like energy dispersions, topologically nontrivial flat bands, and protected edge states, all without resorting to split-step or split-coin protocols. Odd and even-site cyclic graphs exhibit markedly different spectral characteristics, with rotationally symmetric flat bands emerging exclusively $4n$-site graphs ($n\in \mathbf{N}$). We analytically establish the conditions for the emergence of topological, gapped flat bands and show that gap closings in rotation space imply the formation of Dirac cones in momentum space. Further, we engineer protected edge states at the interface between distinct topological phases in both odd and even cycle graphs. We numerically demonstrate that the edge states are robust against moderate static and dynamic gate disorder and remain stable against phase-preserving perturbations. This scheme serves as a resource-efficient and versatile platform for engineering topological phases, transitions, edge states, and flat bands in quantum systems, opening new avenues for fault-tolerant quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>On the query complexity of unitary channel certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certifying the correct functioning of a unitary channel is a critical step toward reliable quantum information processing. In this work, we investigate the query complexity of the unitary channel certification task: testing whether a given $d$-dimensional unitary channel is identical to or $\varepsilon$-far in diamond distance from a target unitary operation. We show that incoherent algorithms-those without quantum memory-require $\Omega(d/\varepsilon^2)$ queries, matching the known upper bound. In addition, for general quantum algorithms, we prove a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$ and present a matching quantum algorithm based on quantum singular value transformation, establishing a tight query complexity of $\Theta(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$. On the other hand, notably, we prove that for almost all unitary channels drawn from a natural average-case ensemble, certification can be accomplished with only $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$ queries. This demonstrates an exponential query complexity gap between worst- and average-case scenarios in certification, implying that certification is significantly easier for most unitary channels encountered in practice. Together, our results offer both theoretical insights and practical tools for verifying quantum processes.</description>

      <title>Virtual Cloning of Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherent limitations of physical processes prevent the copying of arbitrary quantum states. Furthermore, even if we only aim to clone two distinct quantum states, it remains impossible unless they are mutually orthogonal. To overcome this limitation, we propose a virtual-cloning protocol that bypasses the restrictions imposed by the quantum no-cloning theorem. Specifically, we begin by outlining the general framework for virtual cloning and deriving a necessary and sufficient criterion for the existence of a virtual operation capable of simultaneously cloning a set of states. Subsequently, through an analysis of the simulation cost of the virtual-cloning process, we demonstrate that the problem of identifying an optimal virtual-cloning protocol can be cast as a semidefinite programming problem. Finally, we establish a connection between virtual cloning and state discrimination, from which universal bounds on the optimal cloning cost are derived.</description>

      <title>Quantum Beatings in Optical Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity polaritons, quasiparticles formed by coherent light-matter coupling, are at the heart of fundamental concepts of quantum optics. The quintessential signature of this coherent coupling is the Rabi oscillation, which results from the neglect of the counter-rotating-wave (CRW) effect in the weak-coupling regime. The goal of this letter is to predict resonant beatings that envelop the Rabi oscillation on the second or higher excitation manifold. These polariton beatings arise from the CRW term in the Dicke or Pauli-Fierz model and are directly correlated with the asymmetry in polariton eigenenergies. Our findings highlight the relevance of the CRW effect even in the weak-coupling regime, offer novel perspectives about coherent polariton dynamics, and shed new light on experiments of coupled quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Magnini \emph{et al.} [\emph{Mach. Learn.: Sci. Technol. 1 (2020) 045008}] recently introduced a qubit-based model of an artificial neuron, along with its applications. The design of its quantum circuit is pivotal for effective implementation. In this context, we present two quantum circuit synthesis algorithms tailored for the realisation of the quantum neuron. Comprehensive circuit simulations are conducted, and the resulting performance is assessed using the circuit cost metric. Additionally, we propose a quantum optical variant of the qubit-based quantum neuron, which offers a reduction in quantum resource requirements. To substantiate this, we introduce a quantum optical circuit synthesis algorithm and validate its efficacy through numerical simulations of prototype models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Secret Sharing with Classical and Quantum Shares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum secret sharing, a quantum secret state is mapped to multiple shares such that shares from qualified sets can recover the secret state and shares from other forbidden sets reveal nothing about the secret state; we study the setting where there are both classical shares and quantum shares. We show that the quantum secret sharing problem with both classical and quantum shares is feasible if and only if any two qualified sets have some quantum share in common. Next, for threshold quantum secret sharing where there are $N_1$ classical shares, $N_2$ quantum shares and qualified sets consist of any $K_1$ (or more) classical shares and any $K_2 &gt; N_2/2$ (or more) quantum shares, we show that to share $1$ qubit secret, each classical share needs to be at least $2$ bits and each quantum share needs to be at least $1$ qubit. Finally, we characterize the minimum share sizes for quantum secret sharing with at most $2$ classical shares and at most $2$ quantum shares. The converse proofs rely on quantum information inequalities and the achievable schemes use classical secret sharing, (encrypted) quantum secret sharing with only quantum shares, superdense coding, treating quantum digits as classical digits, and their various combinations.</description>

      <title>Instability of explicit time integration for strongly quenched dynamics with neural quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural quantum states have recently demonstrated significant potential for simulating quantum dynamics beyond the capabilities of existing variational ans\"atze. However, studying strongly driven quantum dynamics with neural networks has proven challenging so far. Here, we focus on assessing several sources of numerical instabilities that can appear in the simulation of quantum dynamics based on the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) with the computationally efficient explicit time integration scheme. Using the restricted Boltzmann machine architecture, we compare solutions obtained by TDVP with analytical solutions and implicit methods as a function of the quench strength. Interestingly, we uncover a quenching strength that leads to a numerical breakdown in the absence of Monte Carlo noise, despite the fact that physical observables don't exhibit irregularities. This breakdown phenomenon appears consistently across several different TDVP formulations, even those that eliminate small eigenvalues of the Fisher matrix or use geometric properties to recast the equation of motion. We conclude that alternative methods need to be developed to leverage the computational efficiency of explicit time integration of the TDVP equations for simulating strongly nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with neural-network quantum states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the universal properties of the Lanczos algorithm applied to finite-size many-body quantum systems. Focusing on autocorrelation functions of local operators and on their infinite-time behaviour at finite size, we conjecture that in the large $n$ limit, the ratios between consecutive Lanczos coefficients should have specific scalings with the size of the lattice that we make precise and that depend on the hydrodynamic tail of the autocorrelation function. The scaling associated with strong or approximate zero-modes is also discussed. We support our conjecture with a numerical study of different models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for multipartite entanglement characterization based on the conditional gradient (CG) method, incorporating both fast heuristic detection and rigorous witness construction with numerical error control. Our method enables entanglement certification in quantum systems of up to ten qubits and applies to arbitrary entanglement structures. We demonstrate its power by closing the gap between entanglement and separability bounds in white noise robustness benchmarks for a class of bound entangled states. Furthermore, the framework extends to entanglement robustness under general quantum noise channels, providing accurate thresholds in cases beyond the reach of previous algorithmic methods. These results position CG methods as a powerful tool for practical and scalable entanglement analysis in realistic experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Intrinsic Noise and Quantum Entanglement on the Geometric and Dynamical Properties of the XXZ Heisenberg Interacting Spin Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how intrinsic decoherence affects the interplay between geometry, dynamics, and entanglement in quantum systems is a central challenge in quantum information science. In this work, we develop a unified framework that explores this interplay for a pair of interacting spins governed by an XXZ-type Heisenberg model under an external magnetic field and intrinsic decoherence. We quantify entanglement using the concurrence measure and examine its evolution under decoherence, revealing that intrinsic noise rapidly suppresses entanglement as it increases. We then analyze the Hilbert-Schmidt and Bures distances between quantum states and show how both the degree of entanglement and the noise rate modulate these distances and their associated quantum speeds. Importantly, we demonstrate that the Hilbert Schmidt speed is more responsive to entanglement and coherence loss than the Bures speed, making it a powerful tool for probing the geometry of quantum dynamics. Moreover, we solve the quantum brachistochrone problem in the presence of intrinsic decoherence, identifying the minimal evolution time and the corresponding optimal entangled states. Finally, we explore the geometric phase accumulated during the system's evolution. Our results show that decoherence hinders geometric phase accumulation, while entanglement counteracts this effect, enhancing phase stability.</description>

      <title>Optimizing quantum sensing networks via genetic algorithms and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the optimization of graph topologies for quantum sensing networks designed to estimate weak magnetic fields. The sensors are modeled as spin systems governed by a transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian in thermal equilibrium at low temperatures. Using a genetic algorithm (GA), we evolve network topologies to maximize a perturbative spectral sensitivity measure, which serves as the fitness function for the GA. For the best-performing graphs, we compute the corresponding quantum Fisher information (QFI) to assess the ultimate bounds on estimation precision. To enable efficient scaling, we use the GA-generated data to train a deep neural network, allowing extrapolation to larger graph sizes where direct computation becomes prohibitive. Our results show that while both the fitness function and QFI initially increase with system size, the QFI exhibits a clear non-monotonic behavior - saturating and eventually declining beyond a critical graph size. This reflects the loss of superlinear scaling of the QFI, as the narrowing of the energy gap signals a crossover to classical scaling of the QFI with system size. The effect is reminiscent of the microeconomic law of diminishing returns: beyond an optimal graph size, further increases yield reduced sensing performance. This saturation and decline in precision are particularly pronounced under Kac scaling, where both the QFI and spin squeezing plateau or degrade with increasing system size. We also attribute observed even-odd oscillations in the spectral sensitivity and QFI to quantum interference effects in spin phase space, as confirmed by our phase-space analysis. These findings highlight the critical role of optimizing interaction topology - rather than simply increasing network size - and demonstrate the potential of hybrid evolutionary and learning-based approaches for designing high-performance quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Efficient Predictive Surrogates for Large-scale Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing development of quantum processors is driving breakthroughs in scientific discovery. Despite this progress, the formidable cost of fabricating large-scale quantum processors means they will remain rare for the foreseeable future, limiting their widespread application. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the concept of predictive surrogates, which are classical learning models designed to emulate the mean-value behavior of a given quantum processor with provably computational efficiency. In particular, we propose two predictive surrogates that can substantially reduce the need for quantum processor access in diverse practical scenarios. To demonstrate their potential in advancing digital quantum simulation, we use these surrogates to emulate a quantum processor with up to 20 programmable superconducting qubits, enabling efficient pre-training of variational quantum eigensolvers for families of transverse-field Ising models and identification of non-equilibrium Floquet symmetry-protected topological phases. Experimental results reveal that the predictive surrogates not only reduce measurement overhead by orders of magnitude, but can also surpass the performance of conventional, quantum-resource-intensive approaches. Collectively, these findings establish predictive surrogates as a practical pathway to broadening the impact of advanced quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Development of a Standardized Testing Environment for QRNGs based on Semiconductor Laser Phase Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) based on semiconductor laser phase noise are an inexpensive and efficient resource for true random numbers. Commercially available technology allows for designing QRNG setups tailored to specific use cases. However, it is important to constantly monitor whether the QRNG is performing according to the desired security standards in terms of independence and uniform distribution of the generated numbers. This is especially important in cryptographic applications. This paper presents a standardized test scheme that helps to assess the acceptable operating conditions of a semiconductor laser for QRNG operation, using commonly accessible methods. This can be used for system monitoring, but crucially also to help the user choose the laser diode which better suits their needs. Two specific quality measurements, ensuring proper operation of the device, are explained and discussed. Setup-specific approaches for setting an acceptance boundary for these measures are presented and exemplary measurement data showing their effectiveness is given. By following the comprehensible procedure described here, a QRNG test environment tailored to specific security requirements can be reproduced.</description>

      <title>How to share Multipartite Entanglement in a Real-World Linear Network Connecting Two Metropoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of large-scale quantum communication networks necessitates the efficient distribution of quantum states to enable advanced cryptographic applications and distributed tasks. Multipartite entanglement is a key resource in many of these proposals, yet its generation is experimentally challenging, especially in noisy and lossy networks. While a substantial body of work focuses on the distribution of multi-partite entanglement in star-like topologies, practical implementations often rely on linear network structures constrained by existing infrastructure. In this work, we investigate the generation of high-fidelity multipartite entangled states in a realistic quantum network, leveraging the existing infrastructure of the Q-net-Q project - a real-world long-distance link connecting Berlin and Frankfurt via seven trusted relay nodes. Given that only bipartite entanglement sources are available in our setting and that the network is highly lossy, we explore the role of quantum memories in enhancing multi-partite entanglement distribution and identify key performance requirements. Furthermore, we analyze the feasibility and performance of cryptographic primitives - including (Anonymous) Conference Key Agreement and Quantum Secret Sharing - highlighting the scenarios where the use of multipartite entanglement yields clear advantages.</description>

      <title>Fragmented quantum phases in anti-blockade regime of Rydberg atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we report a parameter-dependent Hilbert space fragmentation in a one-dimensional Rydberg atom array under anti-blockade conditions. We identify distinct non-equilibrium dynamical phases and show that their quasi-periodic behavior arises from the interplay of multi-path interference and multi-photon cascaded excitations, reflecting fundamental differences in state connectivity and effective dimensionality. By constructing a complete phase diagram, we reveal the transition from thermalization to fragmentation, and further demonstrate a secondary fragmentation process enabled by local constraints. Our results highlight the potential of anti-blockade mechanisms for programmable non-thermal dynamics in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>A Virtual Quantum Network Prototype for Open Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of quantum networks has revolutionized domains such as communication, sensing, and cybersecurity. Despite this progress, current quantum network systems remain limited in scale, are highly application-specific (e.g., for quantum key distribution), and lack a clear road map for global expansion. These limitations are largely driven by a shortage of skilled professionals, limited accessibility to quantum infrastructure, and the high complexity and cost associated with building and operating quantum hardware. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an open-access software-based quantum network virtualization platform designed to facilitate scalable and remote interaction with quantum hardware. The system is built around a cloud application that virtualizes the core hardware components of a lab-scale quantum network testbed, including the time tagger and optical switch, enabling users to perform coincidence counts of the photon entanglements while ensuring fair resource allocation. The fairness is ensured by employing the Hungarian Algorithm to allocate nearly equal effective entanglement rates among users. We provide implementation details and performance analysis from the perspectives of hardware, software, and cloud platform, which demonstrates the functionality and efficiency of the developed prototype.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous variable entanglement in a system of two interacting charged scalar mesons is studied. The mesons mutual interaction is mediated by a central symmetric Coulomb potential. We work out the difference between relativistic and non-relativistic limits on the basis of
  the continuous variable separability criteria and prove rigorously the following theorem for our system: While a bipartite charged scalar mesonic quantum system with centrally symmetric interaction is entangled in the relativistic regime, its non-relativistic counterpart can be separable with non entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an efficient, scalable Gaussian boson sampler based on a classical description of squeezed quantum light and a deterministic model of single-photon detectors that click when the incident amplitude falls above a given threshold. Using this model, we map several NP-Complete graph theoretic problems to equivalent Gaussian boson sampling problems and numerically explore the practical efficacy of our approach. Specifically, for a given weighted, undirected graph we examined finding the densest k-subgraph and the maximum weighted clique. We also examined the graph classification problem. Compared to traditional classical solvers, we found that our method provides better solutions in a comparable amount of samples for graphs with up to 2000 nodes.</description>

      <title>A convergent sum-of-squares hierarchy for compiled nonlocal games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the line of work initiated by Kalai et al. (STOC '23), studying "compiled" nonlocal games played between a classical verifier and a single quantum prover, with cryptography simulating the spatial separation between the players. The central open question in this area is to understand the soundness of this compiler against quantum strategies, and apart from results for specific games, all that is known is the recent "qualitative" result of Kulpe et al. (STOC '25) showing that the success probability of a quantum prover in the compiled game is bounded by the game's quantum commuting-operator value in the limit as the cryptographic security parameter goes to infinity. In this work, we make progress towards a quantitative understanding of quantum soundness for general games, by giving a concrete framework to bound the quantum value of compiled nonlocal games. Building on the result of Kulpe et al. together with the notion of "nice" sum-of-squares certificates, introduced by Natarajan and Zhang (FOCS '23) to bound the value of the compiled CHSH game, we extend the niceness framework and construct a hierarchy of semidefinite programs that searches exclusively over nice certificates. We show that this hierarchy converges to the optimal quantum value of the game. Additionally, we present a transformation to make any degree-1 sum-of-squares certificate nice. This approach provides a systematic method to reproduce all known bounds for special classes of games together with Kulpe et al.'s bound for general games from the same framework.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics in minimal Kitaev chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimal Kitaev chains host Majorana quasiparticles, which, although not topologically protected, exhibit spatial nonlocality and hence expected to be useful for quantum information tasks. In this work, we consider two- and three-site Kitaev chains and investigate the dynamics of bipartite and multipartite entanglement by means of concurrence and geometric measure of entanglement. In two-site Kitaev chains, we find that maximally entangled states can robustly emerge, with their stability and periodicity highly controllable by the interplay between the superconducting pair potential and the onsite energies. At the finely tuned sweet spot, where Majorana quasiparticles appear, the system exhibits oscillations between separable and entangled states, whereas detuning introduces tunable valleys in the entanglement dynamics. Extending to the three-site Kitaev chain, we uncover rich bipartite and multipartite entanglement by generalizing the concepts of concurrence and geometric measure of entanglement. At the sweet spot, the Majorana quasiparticles emerging at the edges suppress concurrence between the edges, while a finite detuning is able to restore it. Depending on the initial state, the three-site Kitaev chain can dynamically generate either a maximally entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state or an imperfect W-type state exhibiting multipartite entanglement, although a (maximally entangled) pure W state cannot be realised due to parity constraints. Our results provide a resource for generating and characterising highly entangled states in minimal Kitaev chains, with potential relevance for quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Encrypted-State Quantum Compilation Scheme Based on Quantum Circuit Obfuscation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of quantum computing, quantum compilation has become a crucial layer connecting high-level algorithms with physical hardware. In quantum cloud computing, compilation is performed on the cloud side, which exposes user circuits to potential risks such as structural leakage and output predictability. To address these issues, we propose the encrypted-state quantum compilation scheme based on quantum circuit obfuscation (ECQCO), the first secure compilation framework tailored for the co-location of compilers and quantum hardware. It applies quantum homomorphic encryption to conceal output states and instantiates a structure obfuscation mechanism based on quantum indistinguishability obfuscation, effectively protecting both functionality and topology of the circuit. Additionally, an adaptive decoupling obfuscation algorithm is designed to suppress potential idle errors while inserting pulse operations. The proposed scheme achieves information-theoretic security and guarantees computational indistinguishability under the quantum random oracle model. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that ECQCO achieves a TVD of up to 0.7 and a normalized GED of 0.88, enhancing compilation-stage security. Moreover, it introduces only a slight increase in circuit depth, while keeping the average fidelity change within 1%, thus achieving a practical balance between security and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Extended Kalman Smoothing of Free Spin Precession Signals for Precise Magnetic Field Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel application of the Extended Kalman Smoother (EKS) for high-precision frequency estimation from free spin precession signals of polarized $^3$He. Traditional approaches often rely on nonlinear least-squares fitting, which can suffer from limited robustness to signal decay and time-dependent frequency shifts. By contrast, our EKS-based method captures both amplitude and frequency variations with minimal tuning, adapting automatically to fluctuations via an expectation-maximization algorithm.
  We benchmark the technique in extensive simulations that emulate realistic spin precession signals with exponentially decaying amplitudes and noisy frequency drifts. Compared to least-squares fits with fixed block lengths, EKS systematically reduces estimation errors, particularly when frequencies evolve or signal-to-noise ratios are moderate to high. We further validate these findings with experimental data from a free-precession decay $^3$He magnetometer.
  Our results indicate that EKS-based analysis can substantially improve precision in nuclear magnetic resonance-based magnetometry, where accurate frequency estimation underpins absolute field determinations. This versatile approach promises to enhance the stability and accuracy of future high-precision measurements.</description>

      <title>Comparing performance of variational quantum algorithm simulations on HPC systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are of special importance in the research on quantum computing applications because of their applicability to current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. The main building blocks of these algorithms (among them, the definition of the Hamiltonian and of the ansatz, the optimizer) define a relatively large parameter space, making the comparison of results and performance between different approaches and software simulators cumbersome and prone to errors. In this paper, we employ a generic description of the problem, in terms of both Hamiltonian and ansatz, to port a problem definition consistently among different simulators. Three use cases of relevance for current quantum hardware (ground state calculation for the Hydrogen molecule, MaxCut, Travelling Salesman Problem) have been run on a set of HPC systems and software simulators to study the dependence of performance on the runtime environment, the scalability of the simulation codes and the mutual agreement of the physical results, respectively. The results show that our toolchain can successfully translate a problem definition between different simulators. On the other hand, variational algorithms are limited in their scaling by the long runtimes with respect to their memory footprint, so they expose limited parallelism to computation. This shortcoming is partially mitigated by using techniques like job arrays. The potential of the parser tool for exploring HPC performance and comparisons of results of variational algorithm simulations is highlighted.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the unitary part of a noisy quantum channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstructing the unitary describing the evolution of a quantum system, or quantum channel, from a set of input and output states. For ideal, fully coherent evolution, we show that the unitary can be reconstructed from two mixed states or $d+1$ pure states, where $d$ is the size of Hilbert space. The reconstruction method can be extended to approximate the unitary part of a dynamical map, provided the decoherence is not too strong to render this question meaningless. We exemplify the method for the example of the cross-resonance gate as well as a random set of unitaries, comparing the reconstruction from pure, respectively mixed, states to an approach based on the Choi matrix. We find that the pure state reconstruction requires the least amount of resources when the dynamics is close to unitary, whereas the mixed state approach outperforms the pure state reconstruction in terms of channel uses for appreciable decoherence.</description>

      <title>Resource-efficient Variational Block-Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Block-encoding operators are one of the essential components in quantum algorithms based on Quantum Signal Processing. Their gate complexity largely determines the overall gate complexity of the full algorithm. Using variational methods, we aim to compile block-encoding unitaries with near-optimal resource requirements for a large range of input matrices. We find that the number of variational parameters in the parameterized quantum circuit approaches the number of free parameters in the input matrices, depending on whether they are real, complex and/or hermitian. Additionally, symmetries present in the input matrix can be incorporated into the ansatz circuit, reducing the parameter count further and making optimization possible for up to n=8 qubits. While determining variational block-encodings ceases to be computationally feasible for large system sizes, the constructed operators can be used as components of larger block-encodings via a linear combination of block-encodings.</description>

      <title>Impedance-tuned microwave loop for fast, homogeneous Rabi oscillations of a dense ensemble of NV-diamond electronic spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining a high Rabi oscillation frequency homogeneously across a spatially-extended population of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center electronic spins in diamond is useful for efficient spin-state manipulation of the NV ensemble and in using NVs to detect ensembles of other spin species. Here, we achieve a high, homogeneous Rabi frequency for a dense NV ensemble by enhancing the microwave magnetic fields in the center region of a diamond-coupled planar metallic loop via systematic engineering that increases the microwave current driving of the loop, while avoiding off-center proximity to the loop that gives strong but inhomogeneous microwave fields. With such enhanced microwave fields at 2.55 GHz, we achieve a 136.3 MHz NV Rabi frequency with 1.5% inhomogeneity over a 40 $\times$ 40 $\mu m^{2}$ diamond area; and use the NV ensemble to detect a ~30-MHz magnetic signal, similar to a nuclear magnetic resonance signal at a tesla-scale bias magnetic field, with Hz-scale spectral resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of qubits in quantum computers keeps growing, but most quantum programs remain relatively small because of the noisy nature of the underlying quantum hardware. This might lead quantum cloud providers to explore increased hardware utilization, and thus profitability through means such as multi-programming, which would allow the execution of multiple programs in parallel. The adoption of such technology would bring entirely new challenges to the field of quantum software security. This article explores and reports the key challenges identified in quantum software security within shared quantum computing environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum stroboscopy for time measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mielnik's cannonball argument uses the Zeno effect to argue that projective measurements for time of arrival are impossible. If one repeatedly measures the position of a particle (or a cannonball!) that has yet to arrive at a detector, the Zeno effect will repeatedly collapse its wavefunction away from it: the particle never arrives. Here we introduce quantum stroboscopic measurements where we accumulate statistics of projective position measurements, performed on different copies of the system at different times, to obtain a time-of-arrival distribution. We show that, under appropriate limits, this gives the same statistics as time measurements of conventional ``always on'' particle detectors, that bypass Mielnik's argument using non-projective, weak continuous measurements. In addition to time of arrival, quantum stroboscopy can describe distributions of general time measurements.</description>

      <title>Thermal modifications of mesons and energy-energy correlators from real-time simulations of a $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate thermal properties of a $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory in $1+1$-dimensions through real-time simulations. We extract the spectral functions directly coupling to the pseudoscalar and scalar mesons, demonstrating the thermal modifications of these states with increasing temperatures. Introducing the notion of energy-flow operators, we quantify the temporal build-up of correlations in the energy flows across the lattice. We demonstrate that energy-energy correlators fail to factorize to products of energy flows, both in the vacuum and at nonzero-temperature, indicating the presence of non-trivial correlations in the quantum states. Our results constitute a first real-time \textit{ab-initio} study of bound state thermal broadening and finite temperature energy-flow correlations in a gauge theory, providing a benchmark for future studies of hadronic matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Effects of quantum geometry on the decoherence induced by black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that a quantum system held in spatial superposition and then eventually recombined does experience decoherence from black hole horizons, at a level increasing linearly with the time the superposition has been kept open. In this, the effects of the horizon have been derived using a classical spacetime picture for the latter. In the present note we point out that quantum aspects of the geometry itself of the quantum black hole could significantly affect the results. In a specific effective implementation of the quantum geometry in terms of a minimal length and ensuing minimal area, it appears in particular that, for selected values of the quantum of area proposed on various grounds in the literature, the decoherence induced by the horizon turns out to be limited to negligibly small values.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Superposition of Black Hole Evaporation Histories: Recovering Unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole evaporation is one of the most striking phenomena at the interface between gravity and quantum physics. In Hawking's semi-classical treatment, where matter is quantum mechanical and the spacetime is definite and classical, evaporation leads to an apparent loss of unitarity of the overall evolution, and to the so-called black hole information paradox. Here, we go beyond this semi-classical treatment and formulate a toy quantum model of black hole evaporation that allows the black hole to evolve into a superposition of being fully evaporated and not fully evaporated, consistent with the Hawking particles being in a coherent superposition of different energy levels. We model Hawking particle production by the repeated action of quantum-controlled unitaries, generating emission from the quantum black hole and accounting for a quantum coherent back-reaction on the black hole matter state. We show that the probability of full annihilation of the black hole matter increases with time until the black hole is, asymptotically, fully evaporated in every branch of the quantum superposition. We prove that under natural assumptions, this evaporation model is unitary, such that the initial state can in principle be recovered from the final asymptotic state of the radiation.</description>

      <title>Advancing Quantum State Preparation using LimTDD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation (QSP) is a fundamental task in quantum computing and quantum information processing. It is critical to the execution of many quantum algorithms, including those in quantum machine learning. In this paper, we propose a family of efficient QSP algorithms tailored to different numbers of available ancilla qubits - ranging from no ancilla qubits, to a single ancilla qubit, to a sufficiently large number of ancilla qubits. Our algorithms are based on a novel decision diagram that is fundamentally different from the approaches used in previous QSP algorithms. Specifically, our approach exploits the power of Local Invertible Map Tensor Decision Diagrams (LimTDDs) - a highly compact representation of quantum states that combines tensor networks and decision diagrams to reduce quantum circuit complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform existing approaches and exhibit better scalability for large-scale quantum states, both in terms of runtime and gate complexity. Furthermore, our method shows exponential improvement in best-case scenarios. This paper is an extended version of [1], with three more algorithms proposed.</description>

      <title>On the Feasibility of Quantum Unit Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of quantum software presents significant challenges for software verification and validation, particularly in the context of unit testing. This work presents a comprehensive study on quantum-centric unit tests, comparing traditional statistical approaches with tests specifically designed for quantum circuits. These include tests that run only on a classical computer, such as the Statevector test, as well as those executable on quantum hardware, such as the Swap test and the novel Inverse test. Through an empirical study and detailed analysis on 1,796,880 mutated quantum circuits, we investigate (a) each test's ability to detect subtle discrepancies between the expected and actual states of a quantum circuit, and (b) the number of measurements required to achieve high reliability. The results demonstrate that quantum-centric tests, particularly the Statevector test and the Inverse test, provide clear advantages in terms of precision and efficiency, reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to statistical tests. This work contributes to the development of more robust and scalable strategies for testing quantum software, supporting the future adoption of fault-tolerant quantum computers and promoting more reliable practices in quantum software engineering.</description>

      <title>Beyond symmetry protection: Robust feedback-enforced edge states in non-Hermitian stacked quantum spin Hall systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that strongly coupling two QSH layers yields a trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ phase and no protected topological edge states. We demonstrate that, in a regime with intermediate inter-layer coupling (neither in the strong or weak coupling regimes) and competitive non-Hermitian directed amplification, bulk modes are suppressed while arbitrary bulk excitations inevitably accumulate into robust helical edge transport modes - without relying on any symmetry protection. Our feedback-enforced mechanism persists over broad parameter ranges and remains robust even on fractal or irregular boundaries. These findings challenge the traditional view of stacked QSH insulators as inevitably trivial, and open up new avenues for designing helical topological devices that exploit feedback-enforced non-Hermitian engineering, instead of symmetry-enforced robustness.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Contact Forces with Resonant Range Control in Rydberg Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method to engineer sharply peaked, distance-selective interactions between neutral atoms by exploiting interaction-induced resonances within a resonantly driven Rydberg ladder system. By tuning laser parameters, a subsystem eigenstate twist rapidly and brought into degeneracy with the atomic ground state at precisely defined interatomic separations, resulting in an effective potential sharply localized around this resonance distance. Unlike previous off-resonant macrodimer-based schemes, our approach significantly enhances interaction sharpness and strength, reaching MHz scales, and provides straightforward experimental tunability without requiring sub-wavelength positional control. Analytic expressions, validated through comprehensive master-equation simulations, detail the interaction profile's amplitude, width, and resonant distance. This precise control facilitates parallel entangling gates crucial for measurement-based quantum computing and enables simulation of complex lattice Hamiltonians with customizable connectivity. Additionally, our scheme opens possibilities for novel studies in molecular physics through micrometer-scale bond-length diatomic molecules.</description>

      <title>Symmetry re-breaking in an effective theory of quantum coarsening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple theory accounting for two central observations in a recent experiment on quantum coarsening and collective dynamics on a programmable quantum simulator [T. Manovitz et al., Nature 638, 86 (2025)]: an apparent speeding up of the coarsening process as the phase transition is approached; and persistent oscillations of the order parameter after quenches within the ordered phase. Our theory, based on the Hamiltonian structure of the equations of motion in the classical limit of the quantum model, finds a speeding up already deep within the ordered phase, with subsequent slowing down as the domain wall tension vanishes upon approaching the critical line. Further, the oscillations are captured within a mean-field treatment of the order parameter field. For quenches within the ordered phase, small spatially-varying fluctuations in the initial mean-field lead to a remarkable long-time effect, wherein the system dynamically destroys its long-range order and has to coarsen to re-establish it. We term this phenomenon symmetry re-breaking, as the resulting late-time magnetization can have a sign opposite to the initial magnetization.</description>

      <title>Multifold degeneracy points of quantum systems and singularities of matrix varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-dependent quantum systems often exhibit energy degeneracy points, whose comprehensive description naturally lead to the application of methods from singularity theory. A prime example is an electronic band structure where two energy levels coincide in a point of momentum space. It may happen, and this case is the focus of our work, that three or more levels coincide at a parameter point, called multifold degeneracy. Upon a generic perturbation, such a multifold degeneracy point is dissolved into a set of Weyl points, that is, generic two-fold degeneracy points. In this work, we provide an upper bound to the number of Weyl points born from the multifold degeneracy point. To compute this upper bound, we describe the geometric degeneracy variety in the space of complex matrices. We compute its multiplicity at certain singular points corresponding to a multifold degeneracy, and the multiplicity of holomorphic map germs with respect to this variety. Our work covers physics and mathematics aspects in detail, and attempts to bridge the two disciplines and communities. For self-containedness, we survey examples of multi-fold degeneracies in quantum systems and condensed-matter physics, as well as the established tools of local algebraic geometry that we use to identify the upper bound.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Federated Learning with Fisher Information-Based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become increasingly popular across different sectors, offering a way for clients to work together to train a global model without sharing sensitive data. It involves multiple rounds of communication between the global model and participating clients, which introduces several challenges like high communication costs, heterogeneous client data, prolonged processing times, and increased vulnerability to privacy threats. In recent years, the convergence of federated learning and parameterized quantum circuits has sparked significant research interest, with promising implications for fields such as healthcare and finance. By enabling decentralized training of quantum models, it allows clients or institutions to collaboratively enhance model performance and outcomes while preserving data privacy. Recognizing that Fisher information can quantify the amount of information that a quantum state carries under parameter changes, thereby providing insight into its geometric and statistical properties. We intend to leverage this property to address the aforementioned challenges. In this work, we propose a Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) algorithm that makes use of the Fisher information computed on local client models, with data distributed across heterogeneous partitions. This approach identifies the critical parameters that significantly influence the quantum model's performance, ensuring they are preserved during the aggregation process. Our research assessed the effectiveness and feasibility of QFL by comparing its performance against other variants, and exploring the benefits of incorporating Fisher information in QFL settings. Experimental results on ADNI and MNIST datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving better performance and robustness against the quantum federated averaging method.</description>

      <title>Scattering Angle Dependence of Fano Resonance Profiles in Cold Atomic Collisions Analyzed with the Complex Valued $w$ Parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scattering angle dependence of Fano resonance profiles in cold atomic collisions has been theoretically studied. A complex-valued parameter $ w $ with an analytical formula describing the asymmetry of the resonance profile is proposed as a new development from previous work on electron resonance scattering from atoms [F. Koike, J. Phys. $\mathbf{B10}$, 2883 (1977)]. It serves as the general formulation which leads to the angle-dependence of Fano's $ q $ parameter. Calculations for the case of cold elastic collisions of hydrogen atoms with krypton atoms have been accomplished. The strong angle dependence of the resonance profile asymmetry in the differential scattering cross section due to the interference with non-resonant partial waves is demonstrated. The scattering angle dependence of the resonance profile and thus the newly proposed asymmetry parameter is highly sensitive to the inter-atomic interaction potentials. This is likely to prove useful for the study of interaction potentials themselves.</description>

Abstract: The limited distinctness of physical systems is roughly expressed by uncertainty relations. Here we show distinctness is a finite resource we can exactly count to define basic physical quantities, limits to the resolution of space and time, and informational foundations for classical mechanics. Our analysis generalizes quantum speed limits: we count the distinct (orthogonal) states that can occur in a finite length of unitary change. As in Nyquist's bound on distinct signal values in classical waves, widths of superpositions bound the distinct states per unit length -- and basic conserved quantities are widths. Maximally distinct unitary evolution is effectively discrete -- and this characterizes classical systems.

      <title>Spectral signature of high-order photon processes enhanced by Cooper-pair pairing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inducing interactions between individual photons is key for photonic quantum information and studying many-body photon states. Superconducting circuits are well suited to combine strong interactions with low losses. Typically, microwave photons are stored in an $LC$ oscillator shunted by a Josephson junction, where the zero-point phase fluctuations across the junction determine the strength and order of photon interactions. Most superconducting nonlinear oscillators operate with small phase fluctuations, where two-photon Kerr interactions dominate. In our experiment, we shunt a high-impedance $LC$ oscillator with a dipole element favoring the tunneling of paired Cooper pairs. This leads to large phase fluctuations of 3.4, accessing a regime where transition frequencies shift non-monotonically with excitation number. From spectroscopy, we extract two-, three-, and four-photon interaction energies, all of similar strength and exceeding the photon loss rate. Our results open a new regime of high-order photon interactions in microwave quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Constructing Optimal Noise Channels for Enhanced Robustness in Quantum Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), the critical need to enhance security measures against adversarial attacks and protect QML models becomes increasingly evident. In this work, we outline the connection between quantum noise channels and differential privacy (DP), by constructing a family of noise channels which are inherently $\epsilon$-DP: $(\alpha, \gamma)$-channels. Through this approach, we successfully replicate the $\epsilon$-DP bounds observed for depolarizing and random rotation channels, thereby affirming the broad generality of our framework. Additionally, we use a semi-definite program to construct an optimally robust channel. In a small-scale experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the benefits of using our optimal noise channel over depolarizing noise, particularly in enhancing adversarial accuracy. Moreover, we assess how the variables $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ affect the certifiable robustness and investigate how different encoding methods impact the classifier's robustness.</description>

      <title>Capacities of a two-parameter family of noisy Werner-Holevo channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11216v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $d=2j+1$ dimensions, the Landau-Streater quantum channel is defined on the basis of spin $j$ representation of the $su(2)$ algebra. Only for $j=1$, this channel is equivalent to the Werner-Holevo channel and enjoys covariance properties with respect to the group $SU(3)$. We extend this class of channels to higher dimensions in a way which is based on the Lie algebra $so(d)$ and $su(d)$. As a result it retains its equivalence to the Werner-Holevo channel in arbitrary dimensions. The resulting channel is covariant with respect to the unitary group $SU(d)$. We then modify this channel in a way which can act as a noisy channel on qudits. The resulting modified channel now interpolates between the identity channel and the Werner-Holevo channel and its covariance is reduced to the subgroup of orthogonal matrices $SO(d)$. We then investigate some of the propeties of the resulting two-parameter family of channels, including their spectrum, their regions of lack of indivisibility, their Holevo quantity, entanglement-assisted capacity and the closed form of their complement channel and a possible lower bound for their quantum capacity.</description>

      <title>Quantitative phase gradient microscopy with spatially entangled photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an entanglement-based quantitative phase gradient microscopy technique that employs principles from quantum ghost imaging and ghost diffraction. In this method, a transparent sample is illuminated by both photons of an entangled pair - one detected in the near-field (position) and the other in the far-field (momentum). Due to the strong correlations offered by position-momentum entanglement, both conjugate observables can be inferred nonlocally, effectively enabling simultaneous access to the sample's transmission and phase gradient information. This dual-domain measurement allows for the quantitative recovery of the full amplitude and phase profile of the sample. Unlike conventional classical and quantum phase imaging methods, our approach requires no interferometry, spatial scanning, microlens arrays, or iterative phase-retrieval algorithms, thereby circumventing many of their associated limitations. Furthermore, intrinsic temporal correlations between entangled photons provide robustness against dynamic and structured background light. We demonstrate quantitative phase and amplitude imaging with a spatial resolution of 2.76 $\mu$m and a phase sensitivity of $\lambda/100$ using femtowatts of illuminating power, representing the highest performance reported to date in quantum phase imaging. This technique opens new possibilities for non-invasive imaging of photosensitive samples, wavefront sensing in adaptive optics, and imaging under complex lighting environments.</description>

      <title>Generating quantum non-local entanglement with mechanical rotations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments have searched for evidence of the impact of non-inertial motion on the entanglement of particles. The success of these endeavours has been hindered by the fact that such tests were performed within spatial scales that were only "local" when compared to the spatial scales over which the non-inertial motion was taking place. We propose a Sagnac-like interferometer that, by challenging such bottlenecks, is able to achieve entangled states through a mechanism induced by the mechanical rotation of a photonic interferometer. The resulting states violate the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (Bell-CHSH) inequality all the way up to the Tsirelson bound, thus signalling strong quantum nonlocality. Furthermore, we show that the Bell-CHSH inequality remains violated even without using any form of post-selection up to the value $1+\sqrt{2}$. Our results demonstrate that mechanical rotation can be thought of as resource for controlling quantum non-locality with implications also for recent proposals for experiments that can probe the quantum nature of curved spacetimes and non-inertial motion.</description>

      <title>Rabi oscillations and entanglement between two atoms interacting by the Rydberg blockade studied by the Jaynes-Cummings Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction between atoms and a quantized radiation field is fundamentally important in quantum optics and quantum information science. Due to their unusual properties, Rydberg atoms are promising building blocks for two-qubit gates and atom-light quantum interfaces, exploiting the Rydberg blockade interaction, which prevents two atoms at close distance from being simultaneously excited to Rydberg states. Recently, this effect was used to engineer quantum processors based on arrays of interacting Rydberg atoms illuminated by Raman lasers. Motivated by these experiments, we extend the Jaynes-Cummings model to study the interaction between two Rydberg atoms interacting by the Rydberg blockade and a quantized radiation field. We consider both number (Fock) states of the field and single-mode quantum coherent states. In particular, we discuss different types of entanglements between various components of the total system consisting of the two Rydberg-interacting atoms and coherent states of the field, and show that the behavior is significantly different compared to a system with non-interacting atoms corresponding to the two-atom Tavis-Cummings model. Our results are relevant in view of atom-light quantum interfaces as components for future long-distance quantum communication.</description>

Abstract: Precision measurements of molecules offer an unparalleled paradigm to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. The rich internal structure within these molecules makes them exquisite sensors for detecting fundamental symmetry violations, local position invariance, and dark matter. While trapping and control of diatomic and a few very simple polyatomic molecules have been experimentally demonstrated, leveraging the complex rovibrational structure of more general polyatomics demands the development of robust and efficient quantum control schemes. In this study, we present reinforcement-learning quantum-logic spectroscopy (RL-QLS), a general, reinforcement-learning-designed, quantum logic approach to prepare molecular ions in single, pure quantum states. The reinforcement learning agent optimizes the pulse sequence, each followed by a projective measurement, and probabilistically manipulates the collapse of the quantum system to a single state. The performance of the control algorithm is numerically demonstrated for the polyatomic molecule H$_3$O$^+$ with 130 thermally populated eigenstates and degenerate transitions within inversion doublets, where quantum Markov decision process modeling and a physics-informed reward function play a key role, as well as for CaH$^+$ under the disturbance of environmental thermal radiation. The developed theoretical framework cohesively integrates techniques from quantum chemistry, AMO physics, and artificial intelligence, and we expect that the results can be readily implemented for quantum control of polyatomic molecular ions with densely populated structures, thereby enabling new experimental tests of fundamental theories.</description>

      <title>Many-body enhancement of energy storage in a waveguide-QED quantum battery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum batteries have demonstrated remarkable charging properties, showing that a quantum advantage is possible in the realm of quantum thermodynamics. However, finding an effective strategy to store energy for long periods remains crucial in these systems. Here, we investigate different configurations of a waveguide-QED system acting as a quantum battery and show that, in this context, collective effects can slow down the self-discharging time of the battery, thus improving the storage time. Specifically, when the artificial atoms of the array are arranged randomly, the energy and ergotropy of the optical system are shown to decay at a subexponential rate over long periods, in contrast to the energy decay of a single atom in a waveguide. In the case of atoms arranged in an ordered lattice, collective effects slow down dissipative discharging only for a specific lattice spacing. Thus, in both configurations, collective effects can be used to boost the energy-protection properties of optical systems.</description>

      <title>Pseudochaotic Many-Body Dynamics as a Pseudorandom State Generator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum chaos is central to understanding quantum dynamics and is crucial for generating random quantum states, a key resource for quantum information tasks. In this work, we introduce a new class of quantum many-body dynamics, termed pseudochaotic dynamics. Although distinct from chaotic dynamics, out-of-time-ordered correlators, the key indicators of quantum chaos, fail to distinguish them. Moreover, pseudochaotic dynamics generates pseudorandom states that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random states. We construct pseudochaotic dynamics by embedding a smaller $k$-qubit subsystem into a larger $n$-qubit system. We demonstrate that a subsystem of size $k=\omega(\log n)$ is sufficient to induce pseudochaotic behavior in the entire $n$-qubit system. Furthermore, we construct a quantum circuit exhibiting pseudochaotic dynamics and demonstrate that it generates pseudorandom states within $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ depth. In summary, our results constitute the discovery of new quantum dynamics that are computationally indistinguishable from genuine quantum chaos, which provides efficient routes to generate useful pseudorandom states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09549v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to apply a quantum computing technique to compose artworks. The main idea is to revisit three paintings of different styles and historical periods: ''Narciso'', painted circa 1597-1599 by Michelangelo Merisi (Caravaggio), ''Les fils de l'homme'', painted in 1964 by Rene Magritte and ''192 Farben'', painted in 1966 by Gerard Richter. We utilize the output of a quantum computation to change the composition in the paintings, leading to a paintings series titled ''Quantum Transformation I, II, III''. In particular, the figures are discretized into square lattices and the order of the pieces is changed according to the result of the quantum simulation. We consider an Ising Hamiltonian as the observable in the quantum computation and its time evolution as the final outcome. From a classical subject to abstract forms, we seek to combine classical and quantum aesthetics through these three art pieces. Besides experimenting with hardware runs and circuit noise, our goal is to reproduce these works as physical oil paintings on wooden panels. With this process, we complete a full circle between classical and quantum techniques and contribute to rethinking Art practice in the era of quantum computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a particle in the double-slit experiment with measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous collapse models use non-linear stochastic modifications of the Schroedinger equation to suppress superpositions of eigenstates of the measured observable and drive the state to an eigenstate. It was recently demonstrated that the Born rule for transition probabilities can be modeled using the linear Schroedinger equation with a Hamiltonian represented by a random matrix from the Gaussian unitary ensemble. The matrices representing the Hamiltonian at different time points throughout the observation period are assumed to be independent. Instead of suppressing superpositions, such Schroedinger evolution makes the state perform an isotropic random walk on the projective space of states. The relative frequency of reaching different eigenstates of an arbitrary observable in the random walk is shown to satisfy the Born rule. Here, we apply this methodology to investigate the behavior of a particle in the context of the double-slit experiment with measurement. Our analysis shows that, in this basic case, the evolution of the particle's state can be effectively captured through a random walk on a two-dimensional submanifold of the state space. This random walk reproduces the Born rule for the probability of finding the particle near the slits, conditioned on its arrival at one of them. To ensure that this condition is satisfied, we introduce a drift term representing a change in the variance of the position observable for the state. A drift-free model, based on equivalence classes of states indistinguishable by the detector, is also considered. The resulting random walk, with or without drift, serves as a suitable model for describing the transition from the initial state to an eigenstate of the measured observable in the experiment, offering new insights into its potential underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ordered atomic arrays feature an enhanced collective optical response compared to random atomic ensembles due to constructive interference in resonant dipole-dipole interactions. One consequence is the existence of a large shift of the transition with respect to the bare atomic frequency. In the linear optics regime (low light intensity), one observes a spectroscopic shift of the Lorentzian atomic line often called the collective Lamb shift. For stronger driving, many excitations are present in the system rendering the calculation of this shift theoretically challenging, but its understanding is important for instance when performing Ramsey spectroscopy in optical clocks. Here we report on the study of the collective optical response of a one-dimensional array of 30 dysprosium atoms. We drive the atoms on the narrow intercombination transition isolating a 2-level system, and measure the atomic state with single-shot state readout using a broad transition. In the linear optics regime, we measure the shift of the resonance in steady state due to dipole interactions, and measure how this shift depends on the interatomic distance. We further resolve at the single atom level how the excitation is distributed over the array. Then, on the same transition we perform Ramsey spectroscopy \emph{i.\,e.}~away from the linear regime. We observe a time-dependent shift, that allows us to draw the connection between the collective Lamb shift observed in the linear optics regime and in the large-excitation case.</description>

Abstract: We consider finite-dimensional many-body quantum systems described by time-independent Hamiltonians and Markovian master equations, and present a systematic method for constructing smaller-dimensional, reduced models that exactly reproduce the time evolution of a set of initial conditions or observables of interest. Our approach exploits Krylov operator spaces and their extension to operator algebras, and may be used to obtain reduced linear models of minimal dimension, well-suited for simulation on classical computers, or reduced quantum models that preserve the structural constraints of physically admissible quantum dynamics, as required for simulation on quantum computers. Notably, we prove that the reduced quantum-dynamical generator is still in Lindblad form. By introducing a new type of observable-dependent symmetries, we show that our method provides a non-trivial generalization of techniques that leverage symmetries, unlocking new reduction opportunities. We quantitatively benchmark our method on paradigmatic open many-body systems of relevance to condensed-matter and quantum-information physics. In particular, we demonstrate how our reduced models can quantitatively describe decoherence dynamics in central-spin systems coupled to structured environments, magnetization transport in boundary-driven dissipative spin chains, and unwanted error dynamics on information encoded in a noiseless quantum code.</description>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning has gained attention for its potential to address computational challenges. However, whether those algorithms can effectively solve practical problems and outperform their classical counterparts, especially on current quantum hardware, remains a critical question. In this work, we propose a novel quantum machine learning method, called Parameter-Efficient Quantum Anomaly Detection (PEQAD), for practical image anomaly detection, which aims to achieve both parameter efficiency and superior accuracy compared to classical models. Emulation results indicate that PEQAD demonstrates favourable recognition capabilities compared to classical baselines, achieving an average accuracy of over 90% on benchmarks with significantly fewer trainable parameters. Theoretical analysis confirms that PEQAD has a comparable expressivity to classical counterparts while requiring only a fraction of the parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate the first implementation of a quantum anomaly detection method for general image datasets on a superconducting quantum processor. Specifically, we achieve an accuracy of over 80% with only 16 parameters on the device, providing initial evidence of PEQAD's practical viability in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era and highlighting its significant reduction in parameter requirements.</description>

      <title>Distributed quantum error correction based on hyperbolic Floquet codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers significant speedups, but the large number of physical qubits required for quantum error correction introduces engineering challenges for a monolithic architecture. One solution is to distribute the logical quantum computation across multiple small quantum computers, with non-local operations enabled via distributed Bell states. Previous investigations of distributed quantum error correction have largely focused on the surface code, which offers good error suppression but poor encoding rates, with each surface code instance only able to encode a single logical qubit. In this work, we argue that hyperbolic Floquet codes are particularly well-suited to distributed quantum error correction for two reasons. Firstly, their hyperbolic structure enables a high number of logical qubits to be stored efficiently. Secondly, the fact that all measurements are between pairs of qubits means that each measurement only requires a single Bell state. Under the circuit-level noise model, we demonstrate through simulations that distributed hyperbolic Floquet codes offer good performance with achievable local and non-local fidelities of approximately $99.97\%$ and $99\%$, respectively. This shows that distributed quantum error correction is not only possible but also efficiently realisable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the macroscopic dynamics of Josephson charge pumps in the light of Alicki et al.'s theoretical description of the Josephson junction as an open quantum system described by a Markovian master equation. Once the electrostatic interaction between the terminals is taken into account via nonlinear capacitive terms in the Hamiltonian, we find that the resulting description of pumping is physically reasonable and in good qualitative agreement with experimental observations. We comment on how this approach relates to other theoretical treatments of quantum pumps based on time-dependent potentials or scattering amplitudes. We also highlight the significance of our results in the broader context of the dynamics of charge pumping by active systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement corner dependence in two-dimensional systems: A tensor network perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In continuous quantum field theories, the entanglement entropy of a subsystem with sharp corners in its boundary exhibits a universal corner-dependent contribution. We study this contribution via the lens of discretized systems, and demonstrate that this corner dependence emerges naturally from the geometric structure of infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) on discrete lattices. Using a rigorous counting argument, we show that the bond dimension of an iPEPS representation exhibits a corner-dependent term that matches the predicted term in gapped continuous systems.
  Crucially, we find that this correspondence only emerges when averaging over all possible lattice orientations, revealing a fundamental requirement for properly discretizing continuous systems. Our results provide a geometric understanding of entanglement corner laws and establish a direct connection between analytical field theory predictions and the structure of tensor network representations. We extend our analysis to gauge-invariant systems, where lattice corners crossed by the bipartition boundary contribute an additional corner-dependent term. These findings offer new insights into the relationship between entanglement in continuous and discrete quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate the non-Abelian exchange of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) on a quantum computer. Rather than utilizing MZMs at the boundaries of quantum Ising chains, which are typically represented as nonlocal operators on a quantum computer, using a Kitaev lattice allows us to exploit a local representation of MZMs. We detail the protocol for braiding two and four MZMs in terms of a spin Hamiltonian, i.e. physical qubit Hamiltonian. Projecting this onto a subspace of states, we extract an effective Hamiltonian which drives a non-Abelian Berry's phase. Using several approximations, we construct a set of gates which mimics this accumulation of non-Abelian phase and process this construction on a quantum computer. For two and four MZMs, we realize braiding fidelities of approximately 85% and 47%, respectively</description>

      <title>Exploring Non-Multiplicativity in the Geometric Measure of Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometric measure of entanglement (GME) quantifies how close a multi-partite quantum state is to the set of separable states under the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product. The GME can be non-multiplicative, meaning that the closest product state to two states is entangled across subsystems. In this work, we explore the GME in two families of states: those that are invariant under bilateral orthogonal $(O \otimes O)$ transformations, and mixtures of singlet states. In both cases, a region of GME non-multiplicativity is identified around the anti-symmetric projector state. We employ state-of-the-art numerical optimization methods and models to quantitatively analyze non-multiplicativity in these states for d = 3. We also investigate a constrained form of GME that measures closeness to the set of real product states and show that this measure can be non-multiplicative even for real separable states.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid development of quantum information over the last decade, there is a growing need to identify physical systems that can effectively implement quantum computing. One such system is the diamond spin cluster, which appears in various chemical compounds, including the natural mineral azurite, where copper ions are arranged in this structure. Here, we study the time evolution of a diamond spin cluster with Ising-Heisenberg interaction under the influence of a thermal bosonic bath, which simulates the environment. Using negativity as a measure, we analyze the entanglement behavior between the central spins of the system. We demonstrate how the environment influences the presence of entanglement in the system. Specifically, we show that for certain values of the environment parameters, entanglement increases significantly. Furthermore, we identify the conditions under which entanglement reaches its maximum possible values.</description>

      <title>Field energy and angular momentum in spontaneous emission: A Schr\"odinger-picture approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Schr\"odinger-picture approach is used to calculate the field energy and angular momentum radiated by an atom undergoing spontaneous emission. The calculation is carried out using both the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) and Weisskopf-Wigner approximation (WWA). It is shown that a consistent application of the WWA leads to expressions for both the energy and angular momentum in the field that are finite for all times, in contrast to the results for a classical point dipole oscillator. Moreover, it is shown that the total angular momentum in the field is a sum of its spin and orbital components, again in contrast to the analogous results for a classical point dipole oscillator. Analytic expressions for the energy, spin angular momentum, and orbital angular momentum in the field are obtained for an atom undergoing spontaneous emission from a state having angular momentum H to a state having angular momentum G via an electric dipole transition. It is shown that the spin and orbital angular momenta in the field are equal, independent of the values of H and G. With a slight modification of the WWA, it can also be shown that the energy density in the field, the Poynting vector of the field, and the angular momentum flux of the field do not diverge at the origin.</description>

      <title>Inequivalent ways to apply semi-classical smoothing to a quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we correct a mistake we made in [Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{122}$, 190402 (2019)] and [Phys. Rev. A $\textbf{103}$, 012213 (2021)] regarding the Wigner function of the so-called smoothed Weak-Valued state (SWV state). Here smoothing refers to estimation of properties at time $t$ using information obtained in measurements both before and after $t$. The SWV state is a pseudo-state (Hermitian but not necessarily positive) that gives, by the usual trace formula, the correct value for a weak measurement preformed at time $t$, $\textit{i.e.}$, its weak value. The Wigner function is a pseudo-probability-distribution (real but not necessarily positive) over phase-space. A smoothed (in this estimation sense) Wigner distribution at time $t$ can also be defined by applying classical smoothing for probability-distributions to the Wigner functions. The smoothed Wigner distribution (SWD) gives identical means for the canonical phase-space variables as does the SWV state. However, contrary to the assumption in the above references, the Wigner function of the SWV state is not the smoothed Wigner distribution.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Quantum Device Benchmarking via LXEB with Particle-Number-Conserving Random Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear cross-entropy benchmarking (LXEB) with random quantum circuits is a standard method for evaluating quantum computers. However, LXEB requires classically simulating the ideal output distribution of a given quantum circuit with high numerical precision, which becomes infeasible beyond approximately 50 qubits, even on state-of-the-art supercomputers. As a result, LXEB cannot be directly applied to evaluate large-scale quantum devices, which now exceed 100 qubits and continue to grow rapidly in size. To address this limitation, we introduce a constraint known as particle-number conservation into the random quantum circuits used for benchmarking. This restriction significantly reduces the size of the Hilbert space for a fixed particle number, enabling classical simulations of circuits with over 100 qubits when the particle number is $O(1)$. Furthermore, we propose a modified version of LXEB, called MLXEB, which enables fidelity estimation under particle-number-conserving dynamics. Through numerical simulations, we investigate the conditions under which MLXEB provides accurate fidelity estimates.</description>

      <title>Distance-based measures and Epsilon-measures for measurement-based quantum resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum resource theories provide a structured and elegant framework for quantifying quantum resources. While state-based resource theories have been extensively studied, their measurement-based resource theories remain relatively underexplored. In practical scenarios where a quantum state or a set of measurements is only partially known, conventional resource measures often fall short in capturing the resource content. In such cases, \epsilon-measures offer a robust alternative, making them particularly valuable. In this work, we investigate the quantification of measurement-based resources using distance-based measures, followed by a detailed analysis of the mathematical properties of \epsilon-measures. We also extend our analysis by exploring the connections between \epsilon-measures and some key quantities relevant to resource manipulation tasks. Importantly, the analysis of resources based on sets of measurements are tedious compared to that of single measurements as the former allows more general transformations such as controlled implementation. Yet our framework applies not only to resources associated with individual measurements but also to those arising from sets of measurements. In short, our analysis is applicable to existing resource theories of measurements and has the potential to be useful for all resource theories of measurements that are yet to be developed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and tamper-resistant timestamps are essential for applications demanding verifiable chronological ordering, such as legal documentation and digital intellectual property protection. Classical timestamp protocols rely on computational assumptions for security, rendering them vulnerable to quantum attacks, which is a critical limitation given the rapid progress in quantum computing. To address this, we propose an information-theoretically secure quantum timestamping protocol based on one-time universal hashing with quantum keys. Our protocol simultaneously achieves information-theoretic security and high efficiency, enabling secure timestamping for arbitrarily long documents. Simulations demonstrate a generation rate exceeding 100 timestamps per second over intercity distances. In addition, our protocol only requires weak coherent states, making it practical for large-scale deployment. This work advances the field of quantum timestamping and contributes to the broader development of quantum cryptography and the future quantum internet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds immense potential, yet its practical success depends on multiple factors, including advances in quantum circuit design. In this paper, we introduce a generative approach based on denoising diffusion models (DMs) to synthesize parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). Extending the recent diffusion model pipeline of F\"urrutter et al. [1], our model effectively conditions the synthesis process, enabling the simultaneous generation of circuit architectures and their continuous gate parameters. We demonstrate our approach in synthesizing PQCs optimized for generating high-fidelity Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and achieving high accuracy in quantum machine learning (QML) classification tasks. Our results indicate a strong generalization across varying gate sets and scaling qubit counts, highlighting the versatility and computational efficiency of diffusion-based methods. This work illustrates the potential of generative models as a powerful tool for accelerating and optimizing the design of PQCs, supporting the development of more practical and scalable quantum applications.</description>

Abstract: We consider several definitions of the quantum Wasserstein distance based on an optimization over general bipartite quantum states with given marginals. Then, we examine the quantities obtained after the optimization is carried out over bipartite separable states instead. We prove that several of these quantities are equal to each other. Thus, we connect several approaches in the literature. We prove the triangle inequality for some of these quantities for the case of one of the three states being pure. As a byproduct, we show that the Uhlmann-Jozsa quantum fidelity can also be written as an optimization over separable states with given marginals. We use this to prove that some of these quantities equal the Uhlmann-Jozsa quantum fidelity for qubits.</description>

Abstract: We propose a teleportation protocol that enables perfect transmission of a qubit using a partially entangled two-qutrit quantum channel. Within our scheme, we analyze the relationship among the three key ingredients of teleportation: (i) the quantum channel, (ii) the sender's (Alice's) measurement operations, and (iii) the classical information transmitted to the receiver (Bob). Compared to Gour's protocol \cite{PRA2004}, our scheme requires less entanglement of Alice's measurement and fewer classical bits sent to Bob.Our results also show a trade-off between these two resources and derive a lower bound for their sum, quantifying their interplay in the teleportation process.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate coherent, measurement-free optical feedback control of a levitated nanoparticle, achieving phonon occupations down to a few hundred phonons. Unlike measurement-based feedback, this all-optical scheme preserves the correlations between mechanical motion and the feedback signal. Adjustment of the feedback phase and delay provides precise and tunable control over the system dynamics. The ultimate cooling performance is currently limited by phase noise, which we analyze within a theoretical framework that outlines the constraints and prospects for reaching the motional ground state. Our results establish coherent feedback as a powerful tool for quantum control of levitated systems, extending beyond center-of-mass cooling.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy principle for quantum processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The maximum entropy principle, as applied to quantum systems, is a fundamental prescript positing that for a quantum system for which we only have partial knowledge, the maximum entropy state consistent with the partial knowledge is a valuable choice as the system's state. An intriguing result is that in case the only prior knowledge is of a fixed mean energy, the maximum entropy state turns out to be the thermal state, a ubiquitous state in several arenas, especially in statistical mechanics. We extend the consequences of this principle from static quantum states to dynamic quantum processes. We establish that a quantum channel attains maximal entropy under a fixed mean energy constraint if and only if it is an absolutely thermalizing channel whose fixed output is the thermal state of the same mean energy. This provides an alternative approach for understanding the emergence of absolute thermalization processes within the observable part of the universe under physically natural energy constraints. Our results have potential implications for understanding the informational and thermodynamic utility of quantum channels under physical constraints. As an application, we examine the consequences for private randomness distillation from energy-constrained quantum processes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Calibration of Qubit Detuning and Crosstalk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing and calibrating physical qubits is essential for maintaining the performance of quantum processors. A key challenge in this process is the presence of crosstalk that complicates the estimation of individual qubit detunings. In this work, we derive optimal strategies for estimating detuning and crosstalk parameters by optimizing Ramsey interference experiments using Fisher information and the Cramer-Rao bound. We compare several calibration protocols, including measurements of a single quadrature at multiple times and of two quadratures at a single time, for a fixed number of total measurements. Our results predict that the latter approach yields the highest precision and robustness in both cases of isolated and coupled qubits. We validate experimentally our approach using a single NV center as well as superconducting transmons. Our approach enables accurate parameter extraction with significantly fewer measurements, resulting in up to a 50% reduction in calibration time while maintaining estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum lattice model: Polaritons, photons, and spin waves propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling the propagation of quantum excitations in low-dimensional systems is pivotal for quantum technologies, including communication networks and quantum simulators. We propose a one-dimensional hybrid quantum lattice model, where each lattice unit integrates a single-mode resonator that interacts with a two-level system (TLS), featuring direct coupling between adjacent TLSs. This configuration enables the coherent propagation of polaritons, spin waves, and photons, depending on the interplay between light-matter coupling and qubit-qubit interactions. Employing the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, we simulate the dynamics of various excitation configurations and analyze their transport characteristics using local observables. Our analysis reveals the importance of matching impedance and resonance conditions via system parameters for the propagation of different types of excitations or swapping the nature of excitations along the hybrid lattice. These findings offer insights into designing controllable quantum links and single-excitation swaps in low-dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-Efficient Distribution of Quantum Circuits over Large-Scale Quantum Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers face inherent scaling challenges, a fact that necessitates investigation of distributed quantum computing systems, whereby scaling is achieved through interconnection of smaller quantum processing units. However, connecting large numbers of QPUs will eventually result in connectivity constraints at the network level, where the difficulty of entanglement sharing increases with network path lengths. This increases the complexity of the quantum circuit partitioning problem, since the cost of generating entanglement between end nodes varies with network topologies and existing links. We address this challenge using a simple modification to existing partitioning schemes designed for all-to-all connected networks, that efficiently accounts for both of these factors. We investigate the performance in terms of entanglement requirements and optimisation time of various quantum circuits over different network topologies, achieving lower entanglement costs in the majority of cases than state-of-the-art methods. We provide techniques for scaling to large-scale quantum networks employing both network and problem coarsening. We show that coarsened methods can achieve improved solution quality in most cases with significantly lower run-times than direct partitioning methods.</description>

      <title>Sequential Adiabatic Generation of Chiral Topological States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work, it was shown that non-trivial gapped states can be generated from a product state using a sequential quantum circuit. Explicit circuit constructions were given for a variety of gapped states at exactly solvable fixed points. In this paper, we show that a similar generation procedure can be established for chiral topological states as well, despite the fact that they lack a zero-correlation-length exactly solvable form. Instead of sequentially applying local unitary gates, we sequentially evolve the Hamiltonian by changing local terms in one subregion and then the next. The Hamiltonian remains gapped throughout the process, giving rise to an adiabatic evolution mapping the ground state from a product state to a chiral topological state. We demonstrate such a sequential adiabatic generation process for free fermion chiral states like the Chern Insulator and the $p+ip$ superconductor. Moreover, we show that coupling a quantum state to a discrete gauge group can be achieved through a sequential quantum circuit, thereby generating interacting chiral topological states from the free fermion ones.</description>

      <title>Interaction of Magnetic Fields with Spinons in a Fractionalized State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13665v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 4d-electron trimer lattice exhibits either a quantum spin liquid (QSL) or a heavy-fermion strange metal (HFSM) phase, depending on Nb content. In the QSL state, itinerant spinons act as effective heat carriers, enhancing thermal conductivity. Strikingly, applying a magnetic field up to 14 T causes an abrupt increase in heat capacity by as much as 5000% below 150 mK, disrupting the linear temperature dependence characteristic of both phases. Meanwhile, AC magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity remain nearly unchanged, while thermal conductivity is suppressed by up to 40% below 4 K. These observations suggest that spinons, though charge-neutral, are highly sensitive to magnetic fields at low temperatures. We propose that the field induces Anderson localization of spinons, leading to emergent non-magnetic two-level systems that account for the rapid rise in heat capacity. These findings uncover a previously unexplored regime of spinon dynamics, governed by field-induced localization and distinct from conventional magnetic or transport signatures.

      <title>Quantum-Safe Hybrid Key Exchanges with KEM-Based Authentication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) between any two entities is one of the most important security protocols available for securing our digital networks and infrastructures. In PQCrypto 2023, Bruckner, Ramacher and Striecks proposed a novel hybrid AKE (HAKE) protocol, dubbed Muckle+, that is particularly useful in large quantum-safe networks consisting of a large number of nodes. Their protocol is hybrid in the sense that it allows key material from conventional and post-quantum primitives, as well as from quantum key distribution, to be incorporated into a single end-to-end shared key.
  To achieve the desired authentication properties, Muckle+ utilizes post-quantum digital signatures. However, available instantiations of such signatures schemes are not yet efficient enough compared to their post-quantum key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) counterparts, particularly in large networks with potentially several connections in a short period of time.
  To mitigate this gap, we propose Muckle# that pushes the efficiency boundaries of currently known HAKE constructions. Muckle# uses post-quantum key-encapsulating mechanisms for implicit authentication inspired by recent works done in the area of Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, particularly, in KEMTLS (CCS'20).
  We port those ideas to the HAKE framework and develop novel proof techniques on the way. Due to our novel KEM-based approach, the resulting protocol has a slightly different message flow compared to prior work that we carefully align with the HAKE framework and which makes our changes to the Muckle+ non-trivial.</description>

      <title>Trapped-ion laser cooling in structured light fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laser cooling is fundamental to quantum computation and metrology with trapped ions, and can occupy a majority of runtime in current systems. A key limitation to cooling arises from unwanted carrier excitation, which in typically used running wave (RW) fields invariably accompanies the sideband transitions effecting cooling. We consider laser cooling in structured light profiles enabling selective sideband excitation with nulled carrier drive; motivated by integrated photonic approaches' passive phase and amplitude stability, we propose simple configurations realizable with waveguide addressing using either standing wave (SW) or first-order Hermite-Gauss (HG) modes. We quantify performance of Doppler cooling from beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime (LDR), and ground-state (GS) cooling using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) leveraging these field profiles. Carrier-free EIT offers significant benefits simultaneously in cooling rate, motional frequency bandwidth, and final phonon number. Carrier-free Doppler cooling's advantage is significantly compromised beyond the LDR but continues to hold, indicating such configurations are applicable for highly excited ions. Our simulations focus on level structure relevant to $^{40}$Ca$^+$, though the carrier-free configurations can be generally applied to other species. We also quantify performance limitations due to polarization and modal impurities relevant to experimental implementation. Our results indicate potential for simple structured light profiles to alleviate bottlenecks in laser cooling, and for scalable photonic devices to improve basic operation quality in trapped-ion systems.</description>

      <title>Random Circuits in the Black Hole Interior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08693v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a quantitative holographic relation between a microscopic measure of randomness and the geometric length of the wormhole in the black hole interior. To this end, we perturb an AdS black hole with Brownian semiclassical sources, implementing the continuous version of a random quantum circuit for the black hole. We use the random circuit to prepare ensembles of states of the black hole whose semiclassical duals contain Einstein-Rosen (ER) caterpillars: long cylindrical wormholes with large numbers of matter inhomogeneities, of linearly growing length with the circuit time. In this setup, we show semiclassically that the ensemble of ER caterpillars of average length $k\ell_{\Delta}$ and matter correlation scale $\ell_{\Delta}$ forms an approximate quantum state $k$-design of the black hole. At exponentially long circuit times, the ensemble of ER caterpillars becomes polynomial-copy indistinguishable from a collection of random states of the black hole. We comment on the implications of these results for holographic circuit complexity and for the holographic description of the black hole interior.</description>

      <title>Momentum-Resolved Probing of Lorentz-Violating Dispersion Relations via Unruh-DeWitt Detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by quantum gravity frameworks predicting Planck-scale deviations from Lorentz invariance, we probe Lorentz symmetry violation via modified dispersion relations $\omega_{|\textbf{k}|}$. Departing from conventional approaches, we employ an Unruh-DeWitt detector to probe energy-dependent modifications to the dispersion relations. Two key methodological advances are introduced: (i) a generalized formulation for detector acceleration without assuming specific dispersion relations, and (ii) a momentum-resolved detection paradigm enabling spectral decomposition of $\omega_{|\textbf{k}|}$ through localized momentum-shell integration. Analysis of deviations reveals disruption of the thermal spectrum under significant departures from the Lorentz invariance, while small perturbative regimes manifest as phase-modulated thermal distributions. By restricting detector-field interactions to narrow spectral windows and performing iterative Taylor expansions around reference momenta $|\textbf{k}_0|$, we derive coefficients encoding derivatives of $\omega_{|\textbf{k}|}$, reconstructing its global profile via momentum-space tomography. Our approach offers a scalable method to test Lorentz symmetry violation across energy scales, and establishes a foundation for experimental verification of Planck-scale relics through high-precision spectral measurements.</description>

      <title>Correct Estimation of Higher-Order Spectra: From Theoretical Challenges to Practical Multi-Channel Implementation in SignalSnap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order spectra (Brillinger's polyspectra) offer powerful methods for solving critical problems in signal processing and data analysis. Despite their significant potential, their practical use has remained limited due to unresolved mathematical issues in spectral estimation, including the absence of unbiased and consistent estimators and the high computational cost associated with evaluating multidimensional spectra. Consequently, existing tools frequently produce artifacts, no existing software library correctly implements Brillinger's cumulant-based trispectrum, or fail to scale effectively to real-world data volumes, leaving crucial applications like multi-detector spectral analysis largely unexplored. In this paper, we revisit higher-order spectra from a modern perspective, addressing the root causes of their historical underuse. We reformulate higher-order spectral estimation using recently derived multivariate k-statistics, yielding unbiased and consistent estimators that eliminate spurious artifacts and precisely align with Brillinger's theoretical definitions. Our methodology covers single- and multi-channel spectral analysis up to the bispectrum (third order) and trispectrum (fourth order), enabling robust investigations of inter-frequency coupling, non-Gaussian behavior, and time-reversal symmetry breaking. Additionally, we introduce quasi-polyspectra to uncover non-stationary, time-dependent higher-order features. We implement these new estimators in SignalSnap, an open-source GPU-accelerated library capable of efficiently analyzing datasets exceeding hundreds of gigabytes within minutes. In applications such as continuous quantum measurements, SignalSnap's rigorous estimators enable precise quantitative matching between experimental data and theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Impact of the honeycomb spin-lattice on topological magnons and edge states in ferromagnetic 2D skyrmion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnons have been intensively studied in two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic (FM) skyrmion crystals (SkXs) stabilized on Bravais lattices, particularly triangular and square lattices, where the first two magnon gaps are topologically trivial and do not support topological edge states (TESs). Meanwhile, the third gap can host TESs, which may be trivialized through field-induced topological phase transitions (TPTs), enabling controlled magnonic edge transport. However, the magnon topology in non-Bravais spin lattices remains largely unexplored. In this work, we theoretically investigate the influence of the honeycomb lattice structure on magnon band topology and associated TESs in FM SkXs, employing realistic parameters for monolayer CrI$_3$ and CrBr$_3$. We reveal unique magnonic topological features arising specifically from the honeycomb lattice. Characteristic magnon modes, such as elliptical and triangular distortion modes, acquire nontrivial Chern numbers, contrasting their trivial counterparts in triangular-based SkXs. Moreover, the second magnon gap in honeycomb-based SkXs consistently hosts TESs at low magnetic fields, unlike triangular SkXs. These TESs can be trivialized above a critical magnetic field. Conversely, the third gap is generally trivial at higher magnetic fields but becomes topological at low fields only when the SkX periodicity falls below a critical threshold dependent on Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) strength and magnetic anisotropy. Our study further demonstrates a rich magnonic topological phase diagram accessible by magnetic fields, potentially enabling selective control of low-energy chiral edge modes. These findings underscore the pivotal role of lattice geometry in shaping the topology of magnons in noncollinear spin textures.</description>

      <title>Unification of Exceptional Points and Transmission Peak Degeneracies in a Highly Tunable Magnon-Photon Dimer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), spectral singularities arising in non-Hermitian dynamical systems, have drawn widespread attention for their potential to enhance sensor capability by leveraging characteristic square-root frequency splitting. However, the advantages of EP sensors have remained highly contested, primarily due to their inherent hypersensitivity to model errors and loss of precision arising from eigenbasis collapse, quantified by the Petermann noise factor. Recently, it has been suggested that practical sensor implementations should instead utilize transmission peak degeneracies (TPDs), which exhibit square-root transmission splitting while maintaining a complete eigenbasis, potentially mitigating the Petermann noise around EPs. This work presents a microwave magnon-photon dimer with near-universal tunability across all relevant parameters, which we use to investigate various TPDs experimentally. We demonstrate that two-dimensional EP and TPD configurations based on coupled oscillators can be unified into a general theory and experimental framework utilizing synthetic gauge fields, which we present and validate through careful experiments on two representative TPDs. We also introduce practical metrics to quantify the performance and robustness of TPDs beyond just the Petermann noise factor. Our formalism and experimental methods unify previous EP and TPD configurations and may lead to the realization of robust TPD-enhanced sensors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Quasinormal Mode Theory for Dissipative Nano-Optics and Magnetodielectric Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unprecedented pace of evolution in nanoscale architectures for cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) has posed crucial challenges for theory, where the quantum dynamics arising from the non-perturbative dressing of matter by cavity electric and magnetic fields, as well as the fundamentally non-hermitian character of the system are to be treated without significant approximation. The lossy electromagnetic resonances of photonic, plasmonic or magnonic nanostructures are described as quasinormal modes (QNMs), whose properties and interactions with quantum emitters and spin qubits are central to the understanding of dissipative nano-optics and magnetodielectric cQED. Despite recent advancements toward a fully quantum framework for QNMs, a general and universally accepted approach to QNM quantization for arbitrary linear media remains elusive. In this work, we introduce a unified theoretical framework, based on macroscopic QED and complex coordinate transformations, that achieves QNM quantization for a wide class of spatially inhomogeneous, dissipative (with possible gain components) and dispersive, linear, magnetodielectric resonators. The complex coordinate transformations equivalently convert the radiative losses into non-radiative material dissipation, and via a suitable transformation that reflects all the losses of the resonator, we define creation and annihilation operators that allow the construction of modal Fock states for the joint excitations of field-dressed matter. By directly addressing the intricacies of modal loss in a fully quantum theory of magnetodielectric cQED, our approach enables the exploration of modern, quantum nano-optical experiments utilizing dielectric, plasmonic, magnetic or hybrid cQED architectures, and paves the way towards a rigorous assessment of room-temperature quantum nanophotonic technologies without recourse to ad hoc quantization schemes.</description>

Abstract: The formation of toponium, a bound state of top and anti-top quarks, provides an unprecedented system for investigating quantum state dynamics at ultrashort timescales. We explore two distinct phenomenological descriptions of this process: a 'wavelike' scenario emphasizing the role of quantum superposition at creation, and a 'particlelike' scenario where a finite formation time is governed by relativistic causality. Both descriptions are compatible with the principles of relativistic quantum field theory. We propose to distinguish these scenarios by exploiting the top quark's intrinsic lifetime ($\tau_t \sim 5.02 \times 10^{-25}$\,s) as a quantum chronometer. We simulate the cross-section ratio $R_b = \sigma(e^+e^- \to b\bar{b})/\sum_q \sigma(e^+e^- \to q\bar{q})$ ($q = u,d,s,c,b$) near $\sqrt{s} = 343$\,GeV at future lepton colliders (CEPC/FCC-ee). These distinct scenarios yield observable $R_b$ profiles, enabling $&gt;5\sigma$ discrimination with 1500\,fb$^{-1}$ of data. Preliminary LHC data provide independent $2$--$3\sigma$ support. This framework establishes a collider-based method to explore time-dependent quantum phenomena in particle production with yoctosecond ($10^{-24}$\,s) resolution.</description>

      <title>False signatures of non-ergodic behavior in disordered quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16567</link>

Abstract: Ergodic isolated quantum many-body systems satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., the expectation values of local observables in the system's eigenstates approach the predictions of the microcanonical ensemble. However, the ETH does not specify what happens to expectation values of local observables within an energy window when the average over disorder realizations is taken. As a result, the expectation values of local observables can be distributed over a relatively wide interval and may exhibit nontrivial structure, as shown in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, 214201 (2021)] for a quasiperiodic disordered system for site-resolved magnetization. We argue that the non-Gaussian form of this distribution may \textit{falsely} suggest non-ergodicity and a breakdown of ETH. By considering various types of disorder, we find that the functional forms of the distributions of matrix elements of the site-resolved magnetization operator mirror the distribution of the onsite disorder. We argue that this distribution is a direct consequence of the local observable having a finite overlap with moments of the Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate how to adjust the energy window when analyzing expectation values of local observables in disordered quantum many-body systems to correctly assess the system's adherence to ETH, and provide a link between the distribution of expectation values in eigenstates and the outcomes of quench experiments.</description>
