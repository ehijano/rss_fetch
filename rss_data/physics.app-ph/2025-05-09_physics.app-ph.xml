      <title>$\mu$TRec: A Muon Trajectory Reconstruction Algorithm for Enhanced Scattering Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic ray muons enable non-invasive imaging of dense structures through multipleCoulomb scattering (MCS), with scattering angles dependent on atomic number (Z). Traditional algorithms like Point of Closest Approach (PoCA) assume single scattering, limiting accuracy. This work presents the $\mu$TRec algorithm, which models muon paths using a Bayesian approach with Gaussian approximations, accounting for MCS and energy loss. $\mu$TRec is applied to simulate muon imaging of dry storage casks (DSCs) used for spent nuclear fuel, with four loading configurations: fully loaded, one row missing, one assembly missing, and half assembly missing. The results demonstrate improved accuracy and resolution in identifying missing assemblies compared to conventional methods. It is observed that the $\mu$TRec algorithm exhibits markedly superior performance over the classical PoCA method achieving respective improvements of 122% in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), 35% in contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and 201% in detection power (DP) for the case of one missing fuel assembly with a muon flux of $10^6$ and a voxel size of 5 cm. Furthermore, {\mu}TRec supports high-resolution reconstruction with voxel sizes as small as 1 cm which enables the accurate localization of structural components such as the 2.5 cm thick steel canister. Notably, $\mu$TRec is also capable of reliably detecting a single missing fuel assembly at a muon flux as low as $10^5$, a task that remains infeasible using PoCA under the same conditions.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization of viscoelastic microstructures with acoustic impedance manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitigating low-frequency noise is particularly challenging due to its limited natural attenuation. This study aims to design viscoelastic composite microstructures that achieve both low acoustic reflection and high internal damping by simultaneously optimizing their effective acoustic impedance and attenuation characteristics. Using homogenization theory and density-based topology optimization, viscoelastic and impedance-matching materials are distributed within a unit cell to manipulate these properties. Numerical results show that optimized microstructures with viscoelastic lattice embedded in impedance-matching material outperform pure viscoelastic materials in attenuation while maintaining low reflection. This demonstrates the potential of microstructural engineering for effective low-frequency noise mitigation.</description>

      <title>Size dependence of the properties of synthetic-antiferromagnet-based stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions for probabilistic computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions (s-MTJs) are core components for spintronics-based probabilistic computing (p-computing), a promising candidate for energy-efficient unconventional computing. To achieve reliable performance under practical conditions, the use of a synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) free-layer configuration was proposed due to its enhanced tolerance to magnetic field perturbations. For engineering the SAF s-MTJs, we systematically investigate the properties of the SAF s-MTJs as a function of the junction size. We observe that decreasing junction size leads to shorter relaxation times, enhanced magnetic field robustness, and enhanced insensitivity to bias voltage. These findings provide key insights toward high-performance p-computers with reliable operation.</description>

      <title>An elastodynamic Willis meta-slab with strong directional-dependent absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic bi-anisotropy finds an analogy in acoustic metamaterial science as Willis coupling. Its impact and emergence in the field of elastodynamic metamaterials is not as well understood however, given the coupling between compressional and shear waves. Here we discuss the emergence of Willis coupling in heterogeneous elastic slabs embedded in an acoustic fluid. The microstructure of the slab comprises circular cylindrical voids and asymmetry is present via two neighbouring line arrays, each with a repeating void of differing radius. The slab matrix is soft, with Poisson ratio close to $1/2$ so that the voids act as Giant Monopole Resonators, and induce a strong dynamic response at low frequency. The incorporation of Willis constitutive coupling ensures that a unique set of effective material properties can be assigned to the slab up to a maximum frequency defined by the periodic spacing of the voids and the elastic properties of the substrate. Including loss in the elastic medium via its shear modulus induces strong directional-dependent absorption at low frequency, whilst of course maintaining reciprocity.</description>

      <title>Depth profiling the elemental composition with negative muons: Monte Carlo based tools for improved data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gildings, patinas and alteration crusts are common features of many heritage artefacts, especially for metals. Their size depends on many factors, like the manufacturing method for gildings or the conservation state for alteration crusts: in some cases, it can be in the scale of the tens of microns. Such thickness would be difficult to investigate with classical non-destructive methods and would prevent getting information from the bulk of the sample. This work proposes an innovative approach for the study of multi-layered materials with the Muonic atom X-ray Emission Spectroscopy technique ({\mu}-XES). Based on the detection of the high-energy X-rays emitted after the muon capture by the atom, this method is characterised by a remarkable penetration depth (from microns to cm). From the surface to the bulk, this technique can evaluate the variation of the elemental composition as a function of depth. The paper focuses on providing an improved interpretation of {\mu}-XES data by coupling the analysis with the use of two Monte Carlo simulation software, GEANT4/ARBY and SRIM/TRIM. With these two software, it is possible to replicate the negative muon experiments and compare the experimental and simulated outputs to address the size of a given layer. To validate this approach, a set of standard gilded bronze and brass foils were measured at the ISIS Neutron and Muon source. From simulations, it was possible to evaluate the thickness of the superficial gold layer, with results in agreement with the preliminary SEM characterisation of the samples.</description>

      <title>Assessing Suburban Air Quality Constraints on Free Cooling in an Irish City</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temperate climates are expected to have an expansion of the number of hours where ventilative cooling is needed and where potential is available even under climate change scenarios. Further to this, the use of free cooling in the form of untreated outdoor air has the potential to be a renewable energy source that adds flexibility to national electricity grids if used appropriately and is critical in decarbonising cooling more generally, particularly where coupled with significant thermal mass in buildings. The following study utilises external air quality measurements from the PASSESPARTOUT project and were collected from unique external air quality systems located in Cork in Ireland. The study characterises this data according to constraints based on control limits for cooling systems and for individual external air quality parameters. While the work aims to demonstrate the barriers to cooling potential that may exist due to poor external air quality, it also offers insights into where good urban air quality supports diurnal ventilative cooling strategies that are best suited given these limitations. The findings show that out of seven outdoor pollutants investigated, NO2 and PM2.5 were consistently above recommended threshold limits in suburban areas and present a barrier to the use of indoor-outdoor direct airflow coupling using natural ventilation strsategies for ventilative cooling purposes. Indoor concentration levels within the surrounding areas to those investigated should be evaluated to develop Indoor-Outdoor ratios for designers for barrier pollutants.</description>

      <title>Copper Damascene Process-Based High-Performance Thin Film Lithium Tantalate Modulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfacing electrical and optical systems is a ubiquitous requirement for modern networks. Competitive footprint, efficiency, and bandwidth figures have propelled interest in deploying integrated electro-optic modulators based on Pockels materials for such tasks. Due to its wide usage in legacy bulk electro-optic modulators, and triggered by the availability of 'on insulator' wafers, lithium niobate based devices have seen major advances. Recently, even more favorable properties have been demonstrated in lithium tantalate based devices, featuring similar Pockels effect, but exhibiting lower bias drift and lower birefringence, while equally benefiting from existing volume usage in wireless RF filters. Despite major progress in integrated modulators, these newly emerged ferro-electrical modulators cannot be integrated tightly with electronics yet using standardized processes, such as flip-chip bonding. Here, we overcome this bottleneck by incorporating the copper Damascene process in the fabrication of integrated lithium tantalate modulators. We demonstrate modulators featuring microwave losses that are ~10% lower than in designs relying on conventional gold electrodes. Our results allow us to reach data transmission figures on par with those of electro-optic modulators fabricated with other low-resistivity, yet less common, metals. Specifically, our fabricated modulators are able to achieve data transmission rates of 416 and 540 Gbit/s while preserving bit error ratios below the 25% SD-FEC threshold in a PAM4 and PAM8 transmission schemes, respectively. Together with the commercial availability of lithium tantalate as a Pockels material, our results open a path towards scalable and direct chip-on-wafer embedding of EO modulators with micro-electronic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Clot Treatment via Compression- and Shear-Induced Densification of Fibrin Network Microstructure: A Combined in Vitro and In Silico Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blood clots, consisting of red blood cells (RBCs) entrapped within a fibrin network, can cause life-threatening conditions such as stroke and heart attack. The recently developed milli-spinner thrombectomy device presents a promising mechanical approach to removing clots by substantially modifying the microstructure of the blood clot, resulting in up to 95% volume reduction through combined compressive and shear forces. To better understand the mechanism and optimize this approach, it is important to quantitatively understand of how compression and shear loadings alter the clot structure. In this study, we combine in vitro experiments with dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations to investigate the effectiveness of clot debulking under integrated compression and shear. Controlled experiments quantify clot volume changes, while simulations offer microscopic insight into fibrin network densification and RBC release. This integrated approach enables a systematic evaluation of mechanical response and microstructure change of different clot types, providing fundamental knowledge to guide the rational design of next-generation mechanical thrombectomy technologies.</description>

      <title>Improvement of spontaneous orientation polarization by multiple introductions of fluoroalkyl groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous orientation polarization (SOP) of polar molecules is formed in vacuum-deposited films. SOP is driven by asymmetric intermolecular interactions; however, the design of polar molecules for the improvement of dipole orientation is limited. In this study, we developed SOP molecules with high structural asymmetry by introducing multiple fluoroalkyl groups into a polar molecule. The developed polar molecules exhibited high dipole orientation degrees in vacuum-deposited films and achieved a high surface potential growth rate relative to the film thickness, over -350 mV nm-1, which is a record high for the reported compounds. The developed dipolar films can be used to generate rectification properties for the charge transport of organic films. The findings of this study provide methodologies for the formation of highly anisotropic glassy films, leading to improved performance of organic devices.</description>

      <title>Giant Tunneling Magnetoresistance in Graphene/$h$-BN Based van der Waals Magnetic Tunnel Junctions via 3$d$ Transition Metal Intercalation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic intercalation offers a powerful route for engineering two-dimensional (2D) materials by precisely tuning interlayer electronic coupling and spin configurations. Here, we propose a generic strategy for the construction of fully 2D magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) based on transition metal-intercalated graphene electrodes with $h$-BN barrier layer. First-principles calculations reveal that intercalation not only stabilizes uniform atomic dispersion via steric hindrance but also induces robust ferromagnetism in graphene. Manganese- and vanadium-intercalated systems (Mn-Gr and V-Gr) exhibit exceptional spintronic performance, with tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) showing a pronounced odd-even oscillation as a function of barrier thickness. A giant TMR of $4.35 \times 10^8\,\%$ is achieved in the Mn-Gr system with a monolayer barrier $h$ -BN ($n=1$), while V-Gr reaches a maximum TMR of $1.86 \times 10^5\,\%$ for a trilayer barrier ($n=3$). Moreover, biaxial strain further enhances the TMR to $10^9\,\%$ and $10^7\,\%$ in Mn-Gr and V-Gr systems, respectively. The devices also exhibit perfect spin filtering and pronounced negative differential resistance, offering new opportunities for high-performance spintronic and memory applications based on 2D van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Reality-infused Deep Learning Framework via Angle-resolved Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces and optical Fourier surfaces (OFSs), featuring patterned nanostructures and profiled diffractive elements, offer versatile platforms for light field manipulation. Compared to tuning structural parameters, adjusting incident light angles provides greater design flexibility. However, angle-resolved light behaviors are often complex due to diverse mode excitations and couplings, posing challenges for simulations and nanofabrication. Here, we present a reality-infused deep learning framework augmented by angle-resolved measuring technology, enabling precise and real-time predictions of angular dispersion characteristics for metasurfaces and OFSs. This approach captures critical fabrication and measurement imperfections typically missed by conventional simulations. We demonstrate a 900-fold acceleration in the design process and accomplish near-perfect prediction consistency to experimental results, with an impressive accuracy up to 99.8%. Our study not only supports valuable insights into the development of meta-devices but also represents a paradigm shift from simulation-driven to reality-infused methods, paving the way for advancements in extensive optical design applications.</description>

      <title>Ablation of black-Si by (Gauss-)Bessel femtosecond laser beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser machining and modification of black-Si (b-Si) by femtosecond laser Gaussian (G-) and Gauss-Bessel (GB-) beams are compared at a wavelength of 1030 nm. The GB-beam was generated using a diffractive axicon lens and 10x demagnification optics. It was found that modification of b-Si well below (a factor 50x) the single pulse ablation fluence of 0.2 J/cm2 was possible, corresponding to ablation/melting of nano-needles. The width of modification was almost independent of pulse energy/fluence and had a width of 1/e2-intensity profile at the melting regime. For the GB-beam, the smallest width of laser modification at 0.2 J/cm2 threshold (at the center core) was close to the FWHM of the core of the GB-beam. The aspect ratio of the ablated groove on the surface of b-Si made by GB-beam was twice as large - up to 8 - compared to that achievable with G-beam, and it was at a lower fluence of 4 J/cm2 (50x reduction). Reflectivity of two-side nanotextured b-Si on plasma-thinned 70-micrometers thick Si was strongly reduced in the near-IR range, reaching transmittance &gt;95% at 1.7-2.1 micrometres wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Open quantum systems with particle and bath driven by time-dependent fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a generalized quantum Langevin equation and its fluctuation-dissipation relation describing the quantum dynamics of a tagged particle interacting with a medium (environment), where both the particle and the environment are driven by an external time-dependent (e.g. oscillating) field. We specialize on the case of a charged tagged particle interacting with a bath of charged oscillators, under an external AC electric field, although the results are much more general and can be applied to any type of external time-dependent fields. We derive the corresponding quantum Langevin equation, which obeys a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation where the external field plays an explicit role. Using these results, we provide an illustration of their usefulness and derive a new form of the quantum Nyquist noise for the voltage fluctuations in electrical circuits under AC conditions (finite frequency), which is the most general since it also accounts for the response of the heat bath (e.g. lattice ions) to the applied AC electric field in the GHz-THz region, of relevance for 5G/6G wireless technologies. This generalized quantum fluctuation-dissipation relation for driven systems can also find other applications ranging from quantum noise in quantum optics to quantum computing with trapped ions.</description>

      <title>Photonic Structures to Achieve High-Performance Dew-Harvesting in a 24-h Day-Night Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although most prior research on the dew-harvesting technology has focused on nocturnal operations, achieving round-the-clock freshwater harvesting remains crucial. However, daytime dew-harvesting faces two key challenges as compared to its nighttime counterpart: the high solar irradiance and the large contrast between the ambient temperature and the dewpoint. To address these challenges and guide the photonic design, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze dew-harvesting in a 24-h day-night cycle. Using Nanjing as an example, our analyses reveal that, in the solar regime, a minimum average solar reflectivity of 0.92 is required; in the infrared regime, a 10% reduction in absorptivity outside the 8-13 um transparency window is equivalent to a 5.9% enhancement in emissivity within the window. Guided by these findings, we propose a photonic design, which, in a synthetic experiment with measured meteorological datasets, achieves a water production rate of 313 g/m2-day, in which nearly 40% is contributed by daytime. This performance reaches approximately 70% of the theoretical maximum predicted using the ideal spectrum. We end by optimizing the layout of condensers in practical applications.</description>

Abstract: This study optimizes 28 nm planar MOSFET technology to reduce device leakage current and enhance switching speed. The specific aims are to decrease subthreshold swing (S.S.) and mitigate drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL) effect. Silvaco TCAD software is used for process (Athena) and device (Atlas) simulations. For the further development of MOSFET technology, we implemented our device (planar 28 nm n-MOSFET) with high-k metal-gate (HK/MG), lightly doped drain (LDD), multiple spacers (mult-spacers), and silicide. Simulation validation shows improvements over other 28 nm devices, with lower static power consumption and notable optimizations in both S.S. (69.8 mV/dec) and DIBL effect (30.5 mV/V).</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Electrochemical Limits Preceding Dendrite Penetration in Ceramic Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solid-state electrolytes have the potential to stabilize lithium metal anodes, which hold the promise to increase the energy density of lithium-ion batteries. However, lithium metal dendrites that occur locally at the solid-solid interface plague the solid-state lithium metal cells during charging, limiting the cycle life, and rendering high safety risks in practical applications. While multiple explanations have been proposed, understandings of the dynamics preceding and causing the metal penetration in solid electrolytes are still not conclusive. Here, by testing many highly consistent Ta-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZTO) samples and utilizing an improved operando technique on symmetrical cells, we observed a consistent and statistically significant trend of current-dependent dendrite initiation time, which coincides with the Sand's time scaling in liquid electrolytes. This new understanding offers an electrochemical origin of dendritic initiation but also provides future insight into optimal all-solid-state battery design.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Nano-Imaging of Excitons in a Monolayer Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitons, Coulomb bound electron-hole pairs, dominate the optical response of two-dimensional semiconductors across near-infrared and visible frequencies due to their large binding energy and prominent oscillator strength. Previous measurements of excitons in 2D semiconductors have primarily relied on far-field optical spectroscopy techniques which are diffraction limited to several hundred nanometers. To precisely image nanoscale spatial disorder requires an order of magnitude increase in resolution capabilities. Here, we present a study of the exciton spectra of monolayer MoSe2 in the visible range using a cryogenic scattering-type scanning near field optical microscope (s-SNOM) operating down to 11 K. By mapping the spatial variation in the exciton resonance across an hBN encapsulated MoSe2 monolayer, we achieve sub-50 nm spatial resolution and energy resolution below 1 meV. We further investigate the material's near-field spectra and dielectric function, demonstrating the ability of cryogenic visible s-SNOM to reveal nanoscale disorder. Comparison to room temperature measurements illustrate the enhanced capabilities of cryogenic s-SNOM to reveal fine-scale material heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field dependent VB- spin decoherence in hexagonal boron nitrides: A first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) in h-BN operates as an optically addressable spin qubit in two-dimensional materials. To further advance the spin into a versatile qubit platform, it is imperative to understand its spin decoherence precisely, which is currently one of the major limiting factors for the VB- spin. In this study, we employ a first-principles quantum many-body simulation to investigate the decoherence of the VB- spin in dense nuclear spin baths as a function of magnetic field from 100 G to 3 T, revealing several unique phenomena and their origin. We found that decoherence mechanism changes at a specific magnetic field, which we refer to as the transition boundary (TB). Below the TB, the decoherence occurs within submicrosecond and it is primarily governed by independent nuclear spin dynamics. Above the TB, pair-wise flip-flop transitions become the dominant decoherence source, leading to the decoherence time of tens of microseconds. Building upon this understanding, we developed a method to predict the TB depending on the isotopic composition of h-BN, leading to TBs at 5020 G for h-10B14N and 2050 G for h-11B14N, which is in excellent agreement with our numerical results. We show that the larger TB in h-10BN derives from the larger nuclear spin of 10B than that of 11B, giving rise to strong nuclear modulation effects over a wider range of magnetic field in 10BN than in 11BN. We also explain the microscopic origin of several unique features in the decoherence, such as magnetic-field insensitive fast modulation found below the TB. Our results provide essential insight on the role of the 100% dense nuclear spin environment with large nuclear spins in the VB- decoherence, opening a new avenue for advancing the spin qubit in h-BN as robust platform in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Complete suppression of flux instabilities in ramped superconducting magnets with synchronous temperature-modulated Jc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear multi-field coupling as an intrinsic property of complex physical systems often leads to abrupt and undesired instabilities. For current-ramped high-field Nb3Sn magnets, frequent flux jumps are observed, which easily causes premature quenches and requires prolonged and resource-intensive magnet training process. In this study, we propose a paradigm-shifting methodology framework that achieves complete suppression of thermomagnetic instabilities through synchronized temperature-modulated critical current density (Jc). Through numerical simulations of flux jumps in multifilamentary Nb3Sn wires exposed to a time-varying magnetic field at various temperatures, we construct thermomagnetic stability diagram in the Ha-T plane. The simulated results are in good agreement with experimental measurements, which demonstrates the synchronized ramped-down temperature can indeed fully eliminate flux jumps. We reveal the underlying physical mechanism of enhancing the thermomagnetic stability arises from that synchronized ramped-down temperature can continuously tune both Jc and its slope. Furthermore, we carry out numerical simulations for the thermomagnetic instabilities of current-ramped superconducting magnets through large-scale GPU-optimized algorithm with home-made codes. The flux jump and quench diagram in the Ia-T plane are obtained. It indicates that the ramped-down temperature can completely suppress flux jumps without compromising Jc at high magnetic fields. Importantly, this method does not require modifications to the superconducting microstructures or fabrication process, offering a practical and broadly applicable solution.The findings offer a robust method to stabilize diverse superconducting magnet systems (including 2nd-gen coated tape HTS magnets), and propose a generalizable strategy for controlling instability in nonlinear non-equilibrium physical systems.</description>
