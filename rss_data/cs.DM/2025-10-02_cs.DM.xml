      <title>Computing Phylogenetic Diversity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic Diversity(PD)is a well-regarded measure of the overall biodiversity of a set of present-day species(taxa)that indicates its ecological significance.In the Maximize Phylogenetic Diversity(Max-PD)problem one is asked to find a small set of taxa in a phylogenetic tree for which this measure is maximized.Max-PD is particularly relevant in conservation planning,where limited resources necessitate prioritizing certain taxa to minimize biodiversity loss.Although Max-PD can be solved in polynomial time [Steel,SB,2005;Pardi&amp;Goldman,PLoS,2005],its generalizations-which aim to model biological processes and other aspects in conservation planning with greater accuracy-often exhibit NP-hardness,making them computationally challenging.This thesis explores a selection of these generalized problems within the framework of parameterized complexity. In Generalized Noah's Ark Problem(GNAP),each taxon only survives at a certain survival probability,which can be increased by investing more money in the taxon.We show that GNAP is W[1]-hard with respect to the number of taxa but is XP with respect to the number of different costs and different survival probabilities. Additionally,we show that unit-cost-NAP,a special case of GNAP,is NP-hard. In Time Sensitive Maximization of Phylogenetic Diversity(Time-PD),different extinction times of taxa are considered after which they can no longer be saved.For Time-PD,we present color-coding algorithms that prove that Time-PD is fixed-parameter tractable(FPT)with respect to the threshold of diversity and the acceptable loss of diversity. In Optimizing PD with Dependencies(PDD),each saved taxon must be a source in the ecological system or a predator of another saved species.These dependencies are given in a food-web.We show that PDD is FPT when parameterized with the size of the solution plus the height of the phylogenetic tree. Further,we consider pa...</description>

      <title>On cuts of small chromatic number in sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a given integer $k$, let $\ell_k$ denote the supremum $\ell$ such that every sufficiently large graph $G$ with average degree less than $2\ell$ admits a separator $X \subseteq V(G)$ for which $\chi(G[X]) &lt; k$. Motivated by the values of $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$ and $\ell_3$, a natural conjecture suggests that $\ell_k = k$ for all $k$. We prove that this conjecture fails dramatically: asymptotically, the trivial lower bound $\ell_k \geq \tfrac{k}{2}$ is tight. More precisely, we prove that for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and all sufficiently large $k$, we have $\ell_k \leq (1+\varepsilon)\tfrac{k}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis and efficient random sampling of directed ordered acyclic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14710v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are directed graphs in which there is no path from a vertex to itself. DAGs are an omnipresent data structure in computer science and the problem of counting the DAGs of given number of vertices and to sample them uniformly at random has been solved respectively in the 70's and the 00's. In this paper, we propose to explore a new variation of this model where DAGs are endowed with an independent ordering of the out-edges of each vertex, thus allowing to model a wide range of existing data structures. We provide efficient algorithms for sampling objects of this new class, both with or without control on the number of edges, and obtain an asymptotic equivalent of their number. We also show the applicability of our method by providing an effective algorithm for the random generation of classical labelled DAGs with a prescribed number of vertices and edges, based on a similar approach. This is the first known algorithm for sampling labelled DAGs with full control on the number of edges, and it meets a need in terms of applications, that had already been acknowledged in the literature.</description>

      <title>Counting Answers to Unions of Conjunctive Queries: Natural Tractability Criteria and Meta-Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of counting answers to unions of conjunctive queries (UCQs) under structural restrictions on the input query. Concretely, given a class C of UCQs, the problem #UCQ(C) provides as input a UCQ Q in C and a database D and the problem is to compute the number of answers of Q in D.
  Chen and Mengel [PODS'16] have shown that for any recursively enumerable class C, the problem #UCQ(C) is either fixed-parameter tractable or hard for one of the parameterised complexity classes W[1] or #W[1]. However, their tractability criterion is unwieldy in the sense that, given any concrete class C of UCQs, it is not easy to determine how hard it is to count answers to queries in C. Moreover, given a single specific UCQ Q, it is not easy to determine how hard it is to count answers to Q.
  In this work, we address the question of finding a natural tractability criterion: The combined conjunctive query of a UCQ $\varphi_1 \vee \dots \vee \varphi_\ell$ is the conjunctive query $\varphi_1 \wedge \dots \wedge \varphi_\ell$. We show that under natural closure properties of C, the problem #UCQ(C) is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if the combined conjunctive queries of UCQs in C, and their contracts, have bounded treewidth. A contract of a conjunctive query is an augmented structure, taking into account how the quantified variables are connected to the free variables. If all variables are free, then a conjunctive query is equal to its contract; in this special case the criterion for fixed-parameter tractability of #UCQ(C) thus simplifies to the combined queries having bounded treewidth.
  Finally, we give evidence that a closure property on C is necessary for obtaining a natural tractability criterion: We show that even for a single UCQ Q, the meta problem of deciding whether #UCQ({Q}) can be solved in time $O(|D|^d)$ is NP-hard for any fixed $d\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Theoretic Model for a Generic Three-Jug Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13868v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A classic three-jug puzzle asks, given three jugs $A$, $B$, and $C$ with fixed maximum capacities, with jug $A$ filled with wine to its maximum capacity, whether is it possible to divide the wine into two halves by pouring it from one jug to another without using any other measuring devices. However, we consider a generic version of the three-jug puzzle and present an independent graph-theoretic model to determine whether the puzzle has a solution at all. If it has a solution, then the same can be determined using this model. We also present the sketch of an algorithm to determine the solution of the puzzle.</description>

      <title>A Simplified Proof for the Edge-Density of 4-Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph on $n \ge 3$ vertices drawn in the plane such that each edge is crossed at most four times has at most $6(n-2)$ edges -- this result proven by Ackerman is outstanding in the literature of beyond-planar graphs with regard to its tightness and the structural complexity of the graph class. We provide a much shorter proof while at the same time relaxing the conditions on the graph and its embedding, i.e., allowing multi-edges and non-simple drawings.</description>

      <title>Tree-based formulation for the multi-commodity flow problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a tree-based formulation for the minimum-cost multi-commodity flow problem that addresses large-scale instances. The method decomposes the source-based model by representing flows as convex combinations of trees rooted at source nodes, and solves the resulting formulation with column generation. The number of demand constraints now depends on the number of sources $|S|$, not commodities $|K|$, yielding a compact master problem when $|S| \ll |K|$. We conduct a computational study comparing tree-based decomposition against path-based column generation and direct LP solving. The results show speed-ups of up to one order of magnitude over direct LP solving, and improved scalability compared to path-based formulations. Tree-based decomposition enables solving instances with millions of commodities and hundreds of thousands of nodes. This makes it well-suited for applications in transportation and logistics networks where multiple demands often share common origins.</description>
