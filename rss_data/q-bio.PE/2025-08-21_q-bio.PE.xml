      <title>Extending a Phylogeny-based Method for Detecting Signatures of Multi-level Selection for Applications in Artificial Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilevel selection occurs when short-term individual-level reproductive interests conflict with longer-term group-level fitness effects. Detecting and quantifying this phenomenon is key to understanding evolution of traits ranging from multicellularity to pathogen virulence. Multilevel selection is particularly important in artificial life research due to its connection to major evolutionary transitions, a hallmark of open-ended evolution. Bonetti Franceschi &amp; Volz (2024) proposed to detect multilevel selection dynamics by screening for mutations that appear more often in a population than expected by chance (due to individual-level fitness benefits) but are ultimately associated with negative longer-term fitness outcomes (i.e., smaller, shorter-lived descendant clades). Here, we use agent-based modeling with known ground truth to assess the efficacy of this approach. To test these methods under challenging conditions broadly comparable to the original dataset explored by Bonetti Franceschi &amp; Volz (2024), we use an epidemiological framework to model multilevel selection in trade-offs between within-host growth rate and between-host transmissibility. To achieve success on our in silico data, we develop an alternate normalization procedure for identifying clade-level fitness effects. We find the method to be sensitive in detecting genome sites under multilevel selection with 30% effect sizes on fitness, but do not see sensitivity to smaller 10% mutation effect sizes. To test the robustness of this methodology, we conduct additional experiments incorporating extrinsic, time-varying environmental changes and adaptive turnover in population compositions, and find that screen performance remains generally consistent with baseline conditions. This work represents a promising step towards rigorous generalizable quantification of multilevel selection effects.</description>

      <title>Finding Inter-species Associations on Large Citizen Science Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining associations among different species from citizen science databases is challenging due to observer behavior and intrinsic density variations that give rise to correlations that do not imply species associations. This paper introduces a method that can efficiently analyze large datasets to extract likely species associations. It tiles space into small blocks chosen to be of the accuracy of the data coordinates, and reduces observations to presence/absence per tile, in order to compute pairwise overlaps. It compares these overlaps with a spatial Poisson process that serves as a null model. For each species $i$, an expected overlap $\mu_i$ is estimated by averaging normalized overlaps over other species in the same vicinity. This gives a $z$-score for significance of a species-species association and a correlation index for the strength of this association. This was tested on $874,263$ iNaturalist observations spanning $15,975$ non-avian taxa in the Santa Cruz, California region ($\approx 4.68\times10^{6}$ tiles). The method recovers well-known insect host-plant obligate relationships, particularly many host-gall relationships, as well as the relationship between Yerba Santa Beetles and California Yerba Santa. This approach efficiently finds associations on $\sim10^{8}$ species pairs on modest hardware, filtering correlations arising from heterogeneous spatial prevalence and user artifacts. It produces a ranked shortlist of ecological interactions that can be further pursued. Extensions to this method are possible, such as investigating the effects of time and elevation. It could also be useful in the determination of microhabitats and biomes.</description>

      <title>Modeling the impact of temperature and bird migration on the spread of West Nile virus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: West Nile virus (WNV) is a climate-sensitive mosquito-borne arbovirus circulating between mosquitoes of the genus Culex and birds, with a potential spillover to humans and other mammals. Recent trends in climatic change, characterized by early and/or prolonged summer seasons, increased temperatures, and above-average rainfall, probably facilitated the spread of WNV in Europe, including Germany. In this work, we formulate a spatial WNV model consisting of a system of parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), using the concept of diffusion and advection in combination with temperature-dependent parameters, i.e., mosquito biting rate, extrinsic incubation, and mortality rate. Diffusion represents the random movement of both mosquitoes and hosts across space, while advection captures the directed movement of migratory birds. The model is first studied mathematically, and we show that it has non-negative, unique, and bounded solutions in time and space. Numerical simulations of the PDE model are performed using temperature data for Germany (2019 - 2024). Results obtained from the simulation showed a high agreement with the reported WNV cases among birds and equids in Germany. The observed spreading patterns from the year 2018 to 2022 and the year 2024 were mainly driven by temperature in combination with diffusion processes of hosts and vectors. Only during the year 2023, the additional inclusion of advection for migratory birds was important to correctly predict new hotspots in new locations in Germany.</description>

      <title>Size-structured populations with growth fluctuations: Feynman--Kac formula and decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a size--structured population model of proliferating cells in which biomass accumulation and binary division occur at rates modulated by fluctuating internal phenotypes. We quantify how fluctuations in internal variables that influence both growth and division shape the distribution of population phenotypes. We derive conditions under which the distributions of size and internal state decouple. Under this decoupling, population--level expectations are obtained from lineage-level expectations by an exponential tilting given by the Feynman--Kac formula. We further characterize weaker (ensemble-specific) versions of decoupling that hold in the lineage or the population ensemble but not both. Finally, we provide a more general interpretation of the tilted expectations in terms of the mass-weighted phenotype distribution.</description>

      <title>Counting rankings of tree-child networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rooted phylogenetic networks allow biologists to represent evolutionary relationships between present-day species by revealing ancestral speciation and hybridization events. A convenient and well-studied class of such networks are `tree-child networks' and a `ranking' of such a network is a temporal ordering of the ancestral speciation and hybridization events. In this short note, we investigate the question of counting such rankings on any given binary (or semi-binary) tree-child network. We also consider a class of binary tree-child networks that have exactly one ranking, and investigate further the relationship between ranked-tree child networks and the class of `normal' networks. Finally, we provide an explicit asymptotic expression for the expected number of rankings of a tree-child network chosen uniformly at random.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale species richness estimation with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biodiversity assessments are critically affected by the spatial scale at which species richness is measured. How species richness accumulates with sampling area depends on natural and anthropogenic processes whose effects can change depending on the spatial scale considered. These accumulation dynamics, described by the species-area relationship (SAR), are challenging to assess because most biodiversity surveys are restricted to sampling areas much smaller than the scales at which these processes operate. Here, we combine sampling theory and deep learning to predict local species richness within arbitrarily large sampling areas, enabling for the first time to estimate spatial differences in SARs. We demonstrate our approach by predicting vascular plant species richness across Europe and evaluate predictions against an independent dataset of plant community inventories. The resulting model, named deep SAR, delivers multi-scale species richness maps, improving coarse grain richness estimates by 32% compared to conventional methods, while delivering finer grain estimates. Additional to its predictive capabilities, we show how our deep SAR model can provide fundamental insights on the multi-scale effects of key biodiversity processes. The capacity of our approach to deliver comprehensive species richness estimates across the full spectrum of ecologically relevant scales is essential for robust biodiversity assessments and forecasts under global change.</description>
