      <title>Defunding Sexual Healthcare: A Topological Investigation of Resource Accessibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Government actions, such as the Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic Supreme Court ruling and the passage of the Big Beautiful Bill Act, have aimed to restrict or prohibit Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood Healthcare Centers (PPHCs) at both the state and national levels. These funding cuts are particularly harmful in states like California, which has a large population of Medicaid users. This analysis focuses on the distribution of Planned Parenthood clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), which offer essential reproductive healthcare services including, but not limited to, abortions, birth control, HIV services, pregnancy testing and planning, STD testing and treatment, and cancer screenings. While expanded funding for FQHCs has been proposed as a solution, it fails to address the locational accessibility of Medicaid-funded health centers that provide sexual and reproductive care. To assess this issue, we analyze the proximity of data points representing California's PPHC and FQHC locations. Topological Data Analysis (TDA)-an approach that examines the shape and structure of data -- is used to detect disparities in reproductive and sexual healthcare coverage. To conduct data collection and visualization, we utilize R and Python. We apply an n-closest neighbor algorithm to examine distances between facilities and assess changes in travel time required to reach healthcare sites. We apply persistent homology to analyze current gaps across multiple scales in healthcare coverage and compare them to potential future gaps. Our findings aim to identify areas where access to care is most vulnerable and demonstrate how TDA can be used to analyze spatial inequalities in public health.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Homophily with Imperfect Recall: Modeling Resilience in Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to investigate how homophily, memory constraints, and adversarial disruptions collectively shape the resilience and adaptability of complex networks. To achieve this, we develop a new framework that integrates explicit memory decay mechanisms into homophily-based models and systematically evaluate their performance across diverse graph structures and adversarial settings. Our methods involve extensive experimentation on synthetic datasets, where we vary decay functions, reconnection probabilities, and similarity measures, primarily comparing cosine similarity with traditional metrics such as Jaccard similarity and baseline edge weights. The results show that cosine similarity achieves up to a 30\% improvement in stability metrics in sparse, convex, and modular networks. Moreover, the refined value-of-recall metric demonstrates that strategic forgetting can bolster resilience by balancing network robustness and adaptability. The findings underscore the critical importance of aligning memory and similarity parameters with the structural and adversarial dynamics of the network. By quantifying the tangible benefits of incorporating memory constraints into homophily-based analyses, this study offers actionable insights for optimizing real-world applications, including social systems, collaborative platforms, and cybersecurity contexts.</description>

      <title>Leader-driven or Leaderless: How Participation Structure Sustains Engagement and Shapes Narratives in Online Hate Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremist communities increasingly rely on social media to sustain and amplify divisive discourse. However, the relationship between their internal participation structures, audience engagement, and narrative expression remains underexplored. This study analyzes ten years of Facebook activity by hate groups related to the Israel-Palestine conflict, focusing on anti-Semitic and Islamophobic ideologies. Consistent with prior work, we find that higher participation centralization in online hate groups is associated with greater user engagement across hate ideologies, suggesting the role of key actors in sustaining group activity over time. Conversely, our narrative frame detection models - based on an eight-frame extremist taxonomy (e.g., dehumanization, violence justification) - reveal a clear contrast across hate ideologies, offering new insight into how discursive strategies vary despite similar structural dynamics. Analysis of the inter-group network indicates that, although centralization and homophily are not clearly linked, ideological distinctions emerge: Islamophobic groups cluster tightly, whereas anti-Semitic groups remain more evenly connected. Overall, these findings clarify how participation structure may shape the dissemination pattern and resonance of extremist narratives online and provide a foundation for tailored strategies to disrupt or mitigate online extremist discourse.</description>

      <title>Shared Nodes of Overlapping Communities in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overlapping communities are key characteristics of the structure and function analysis of complex networks. Shared or overlapping nodes within overlapping communities can form either subcommunities or act as intersections between larger communities. Nodes at the intersections that do not form subcommunities can be identified as overlapping nodes or as part of an internal structure of nested communities. To identify overlapping nodes, we apply a threshold rule based on the number of nodes in the nested structure. As the threshold value increases, the number of selected overlapping nodes decreases. This approach allows us to analyse the roles of nodes considered overlapping according to selection criteria, for example to reduce the effect of noise. We illustrate our method by using three small and two larger real-world network structures. In larger networks, minor disturbances can produce a multitude of slightly different solutions, but the core communities remain robust, allowing other variations to be treated as noise. While this study employs our own method for community detection, other approaches can also be applied. Exploring the properties of shared nodes in overlapping communities of complex networks is a novel area of research with diverse applications in social network analysis, cybersecurity, and other fields in network science.</description>

      <title>Follow Nudges without Budges: A Field Experiment on Misinformation Followers Didn't Change Follow Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can digital ads encourage users exposed to inaccurate information sources to follow accurate ones? We conduct a large-scale field experiment (N=28,582) on X, formerly Twitter, with users who follow accounts that spread health misinformation. Participants were exposed to four ad treatments varied on two dimensions: a neutral message versus a persuasive message appealing to values of independence, and a request to follow a health institution versus a request to follow a health influencer. We term this ad-based, social network intervention a follow nudge. The ad with a persuasive message to follow a well-known health institution generated significantly higher click-through rates than all other conditions (Bonferroni-corrected pairwise tests, all p&lt;0.001). Given the overall low click-through rate across treatments and the high cost of digital advertising infrastructure on X, however, we conclude that our proposed intervention -- at least in its current ad-based format -- is not a cost-effective means to improve information environments online. We discuss challenges faced when conducting large-scale experiments on X following the platform's ownership change and subsequent restrictions on data access for research purposes.</description>

      <title>Congestion Reduction in EV Charger Placement Using Traffic Equilibrium Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing EV adoption can worsen traffic conditions if chargers are sited without regard to their impact on congestion. We study how to strategically place EV chargers to reduce congestion using two equilibrium models: one based on congestion games and one based on an atomic queueing simulation. We apply both models within a scalable greedy station-placement algorithm. Experiments show that this greedy scheme yields optimal or near-optimal congestion outcomes in realistic networks, even though global optimality is not guaranteed as we show with a counterexample. We also show that the queueing-based approach yields more realistic results than the congestion-game model, and we present a unified methodology that calibrates congestion delays from queue simulation and solves equilibrium in link-space.</description>

      <title>Understanding Main Path Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Main path analysis has long been used to trace knowledge trajectories in citation networks, yet it lacks solid theoretical foundations. To understand when and why this approach succeeds, we analyse directed acyclic graphs created from two types of artificial models and by looking at over twenty networks derived from real data.
  We show that entropy-based variants of main path analysis optimise geometric distance measures, providing its first information-theoretic and geometric basis. Numerical results demonstrate that existing algorithms converge on near-geodesic solutions. We also show that an approach based on longest paths produces similar results, is equally well motivated yet is much simpler to implement.
  However, the traditional single-path focus is unnecessarily restrictive, as many near-optimal paths highlight different key nodes. We introduce an approach using ``baskets'' of nodes where we select a fraction of nodes with the smallest values of a measure we call ``generalised criticality''. Analysis of large vaccine citation networks shows that these baskets achieve comprehensive algorithmic coverage, offering a robust, simple, and computationally efficient way to identify core knowledge structures. In practice, we find that those nodes with zero unit criticality capture the information in main paths in almost all cases and capture a wider range of key nodes without unnecessarily increasing the number of nodes considered. We find no advantage in using the traditional main path methods.</description>

      <title>Modeling Authorial Style in Urdu Novels Using Character Interaction Graphs and Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Authorship analysis has traditionally focused on lexical and stylistic cues within text, while higher-level narrative structure remains underexplored, particularly for low-resource languages such as Urdu. This work proposes a graph-based framework that models Urdu novels as character interaction networks to examine whether authorial style can be inferred from narrative structure alone. Each novel is represented as a graph where nodes correspond to characters and edges denote their co-occurrence within narrative proximity. We systematically compare multiple graph representations, including global structural features, node-level semantic summaries, unsupervised graph embeddings, and supervised graph neural networks. Experiments on a dataset of 52 Urdu novels written by seven authors show that learned graph representations substantially outperform hand-crafted and unsupervised baselines, achieving up to 0.857 accuracy under a strict author-aware evaluation protocol.</description>

      <title>Journal Publications in Medicine: Ranking vs. Interdisciplinarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interdisciplinary research is critical for innovation and addressing complex societal issues. We characterise the interdisciplinary knowledge structure of PubMed research articles in medicine as correlation networks of medical concepts and compare the interdisciplinarity of articles between high-ranking (impactful) and less high-ranking (less impactful) medical journals. We found that impactful medical journals tend to publish research that are less interdisciplinary than less impactful journals. Observing that they bridge distant knowledge clusters in the networks, we find that cancer-related research can be seen as one of the main drivers of interdisciplinarity in medical science. Using signed difference networks, we also investigate the clustering of deviations between high and low impact journal correlation networks. We generally find a mild tendency for strong link differences to be adjacent. Furthermore, we find topic clusters of deviations that shift over time. In contrast, topic clusters in the original networks are static over time and can be seen as the core knowledge structure in medicine. Overall, journals and policymakers should encourage initiatives to accommodate interdisciplinarity within the existing infrastructures to maximise the potential patient benefits from IDR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the age of digital music streaming, playlists on platforms like Spotify have become an integral part of individuals' musical experiences. People create and publicly share their own playlists to express their musical tastes, promote the discovery of their favorite artists, and foster social connections. In this work, we aim to address the question: can we infer users' private attributes from their public Spotify playlists? To this end, we conducted an online survey involving 739 Spotify users, resulting in a dataset of 10,286 publicly shared playlists comprising over 200,000 unique songs and 55,000 artists. Then, we utilize statistical analyses and machine learning algorithms to build accurate predictive models for users' attributes.</description>

Abstract: We present a simple model of protesters scattered throughout a city who want to gather into large and mobile groups. This model relies on random walkers on a street network that follow tactics built from a set of basic rules. Our goal is to identify the most important rules for fast and robust flocking of walkers. We explore a wide set of tactics and show the central importance of a specific rule based on alignment. Other rules alone perform poorly, but our experiments show that combining alignment with them enhances flocking, and that obtained groups are then remarkably robust.</description>

      <title>Efficient Neural Common Neighbor for Temporal Graph Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal graphs are widespread in real-world applications such as social networks, as well as trade and transportation networks. Predicting dynamic links within these evolving graphs is a key problem. Many memory-based methods use temporal interaction histories to generate node embeddings, which are then combined to predict links. However, these approaches primarily focus on individual node representations, often overlooking the inherently pairwise nature of link prediction. While some recent methods attempt to capture pairwise features, they tend to be limited by high computational complexity arising from repeated embedding calculations, making them unsuitable for large-scale datasets like the Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB). To address the critical need for models that combine strong expressive power with high computational efficiency for link prediction on large temporal graphs, we propose Temporal Neural Common Neighbor (TNCN). Our model achieves this balance by adapting the powerful pairwise modeling principles of Neural Common Neighbor (NCN) to an efficient temporal architecture. TNCN improves upon NCN by efficiently preserving and updating temporal neighbor dictionaries for each node and by using multi-hop common neighbors to learn more expressive pairwise representations. TNCN achieves new state-of-the-art performance on Review from five large-scale real-world TGB datasets, 6 out of 7 datasets in the transductive setting and 3 out of 7 in the inductive setting on small- to medium-scale datasets. Additionally, TNCN demonstrates excellent scalability, outperforming prominent GNN baselines by up to 30.3 times in speed on large datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/GraphPKU/TNCN.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Fraud Detection: Integrating Reinforcement Learning into Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial fraud refers to the act of obtaining financial benefits through dishonest means. Such behavior not only disrupts the order of the financial market but also harms economic and social development and breeds other illegal and criminal activities. With the popularization of the internet and online payment methods, many fraudulent activities and money laundering behaviors in life have shifted from offline to online, posing a great challenge to regulatory authorities. How to efficiently detect these financial fraud activities has become an urgent issue that needs to be resolved. Graph neural networks are a type of deep learning model that can utilize the interactive relationships within graph structures, and they have been widely applied in the field of fraud detection. However, there are still some issues. First, fraudulent activities only account for a very small part of transaction transfers, leading to an inevitable problem of label imbalance in fraud detection. At the same time, fraudsters often disguise their behavior, which can have a negative impact on the final prediction results. In addition, existing research has overlooked the importance of balancing neighbor information and central node information. For example, when the central node has too many neighbors, the features of the central node itself are often neglected. Finally, fraud activities and patterns are constantly changing over time, so considering the dynamic evolution of graph edge relationships is also very important.</description>

      <title>Generative Graph Pattern Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been predominantly driven by message-passing, where node representations are iteratively updated via local neighborhood aggregation. Despite their success, message-passing suffers from fundamental limitations -- including constrained expressiveness, over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited capacity to model long-range dependencies. These issues hinder scalability: increasing data size or model size often fails to yield improved performance. To this end, we explore pathways beyond message-passing and introduce Generative Graph Pattern Machine (G$^2$PM), a generative Transformer pre-training framework for graphs. G$^2$PM represents graph instances (nodes, edges, or entire graphs) as sequences of substructures, and employs generative pre-training over the sequences to learn generalizable and transferable representations. Empirically, G$^2$PM demonstrates strong scalability: on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark, it continues to improve with model sizes up to 60M parameters, outperforming prior generative approaches that plateau at significantly smaller scales (e.g., 3M). In addition, we systematically analyze the model design space, highlighting key architectural choices that contribute to its scalability and generalization. Across diverse tasks -- including node/link/graph classification, transfer learning, and cross-graph pretraining -- G$^2$PM consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing a compelling foundation for scalable graph learning. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/G2PM.</description>

Abstract: We study distributed optimization of finite-degree polynomial Laplacian spectral objectives under fixed topology and a global weight budget, targeting the collective behavior of the entire spectrum rather than a few extremal eigenvalues. By re-formulating the global cost in a bilinear form, we derive local subgraph problems whose gradients approximately align with the global descent direction via an SVD-based test on the \(ZC\) matrix. This leads to an iterate-and-embed scheme over disjoint 1-hop neighborhoods that preserves feasibility by construction (positivity and budget) and scales to large geometric graphs. For objectives that depend on pairwise eigenvalue differences \(h(\lambda_i-\lambda_j)\), we obtain a quadratic upper bound in the degree vector, which motivates a ``warm-start'' by degree-regularization. The warm start uses randomized gossip to estimate global average degree, accelerating subsequent local descent while maintaining decentralization, and realizing $\sim95\%{}$ of the performance with respect to centralized optimization. We further introduce a learning-based proposer that predicts one-shot edge updates on maximal 1-hop embeddings, yielding immediate objective reductions. Together, these components form a practical, modular pipeline for spectrum-aware weight tuning that preserves constraints and applies across a broader class of whole-spectrum costs.</description>
