      <title>On the illumination of 1-symmetric convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ["Illumination of convex bodies with many symmetries", Mathematika 63 (2017)], Tikhomirov verified the Hadwiger-Boltyanski Illumination Conjecture for the class of 1-symmetric convex bodies of sufficiently large dimension. We propose an alternative approach which allows us to settle the conjecture for this class in all dimensions in a uniform way. We also demonstrate that an alternative approach was indeed needed for the low dimensions. Finally, with this alternative method it is possible to solely use illuminating sets which consist of pairs of opposite directions; we thus also answer a question by Lassak, who has suggested this may be possible for any origin-symmetric convex body. As a consequence of this, we can also confirm the X-ray conjecture by Bezdek and Zamfirescu for all 1-symmetric convex bodies.</description>

      <title>Stiefel manifolds and upper bounds for spherical codes and packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We improve upper bounds on sphere packing densities and sizes of spherical codes in high dimensions. In particular, we prove that the maximal sphere packing densities $\delta_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfy \[\delta_n\leq \frac{1+o(1)}{e}\cdot \delta^{\text{KL}}_{n}\] for large $n$, where $\delta^{\text{KL}}_{n}$ is the best bound on $\delta_n$ obtained essentially by Kabatyanskii and Levenshtein from the 1970s with improvements over the years. We also obtain the same improvement factor for the maximal size $M(n,\theta)$ of $\theta$-spherical codes in $S^{n-1}$: for angles $0&lt;\theta&lt;\theta'\leq\frac{\pi}{2}$, \[M(n,\theta)\leq \frac{1+o(1)}{e}\cdot \frac{M_{\text{Lev}}(n-1,\theta')}{\mu_n(\theta,\theta')}\] for large $n$, where $\mu_n(\theta,\theta')$ is the mass of the spherical cap in the unit sphere $S^{n-1}$ of radius $\frac{\sin(\theta/2)}{\sin(\theta'/2)}$, and $M_{\text{Lev}}(n-1,\theta')$ is Levenshtein's upper bound on $M(n-1,\theta')$ when applying the Delsarte linear programming method to Levenshtein's optimal polynomials. In fact, we prove that there are no analytic losses in our arguments and that the constant $\frac{1}{e}=0.367...$ is optimal for the class of functions considered. Our results also show that the improvement factor does not depend on the special angle $\theta^*=62.997...^{\circ}$, explaining the numerics in arXiv:2001.00185. In the spherical codes case, the above inequality improves the Kabatyanskii--Levenshtein bound by a factor of $0.2304...$ on geometric average. Along the way, we construct a general class of functions using Stiefel manifolds for which we prove general results and study the improvement factors obtained from them in various settings.and study the improvement factors obtained from them in various settings.</description>

      <title>Lattice points inside a random shifted integer polygon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a convex body $C \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. Let $X$ be a random point with uniform distribution in $[0,1]^d$. Consider the value $X_C$ equal to the number of lattice points $\mathbb Z^d$ inside the body $C$ shifted by $X$. It is well known that $\mathbb E X_C = \mathrm{vol}(C)$. The question arises: what can be said about the variance of this random variable? This paper answers this question in the case when $C$ is a polygon with vertices at integer points. Moreover, an explicit distribution of $X_T$ is given for the integer triangle $T$.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of strongly I-regular hyperbolic elements on affine buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first goal of this article is to investigate a refinement of previously-introduced strongly regular hyperbolic automorphisms of locally finite thick Euclidean buildings $\Delta$ of finite Coxeter system $(W,S)$. The new ones are defined for each proper subset $I \subsetneq S$ and called strongly $I$-regular hyperbolic automorphisms of $\Delta$. Generalizing previous results, we show that such elements exist in any group $G$ acting cocompactly and by automorphisms on $\Delta$. Although the dynamics of strongly $I$-regular hyperbolic elements $\gamma$ on the spherical building $\partial_\infty \Delta$ of $\Delta$ is much more complicated than for the strongly regular ones, the $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty} \gamma^{n}(\xi)$ still exists in $\partial_\infty \Delta$ for ideal points $\xi \in \partial_\infty \Delta$ that satisfy certain assumptions. An important role in this business is played by the cone topology on $\Delta \cup \partial_\infty \Delta$ and the projection of specific residues of $\partial_\infty \Delta$ on the ideal boundary of $Min(\gamma)$.
  All the above research is performed in order to achieve the second, and main, goal of the article. Namely, we prove that for closed groups $G$ with a type-preserving and strongly transitive action by automorphisms on $\Delta$, the Chabauty limits of certain closed subgroups of $G$ contain as a normal subgroup the entire unipotent radical of concrete parabolic subgroups of $G$.</description>

      <title>Single-cell 3D genome reconstruction in the haploid setting using rigidity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article considers the problem of 3-dimensional genome reconstruction for single-cell data, and the uniqueness of such reconstructions in the setting of haploid organisms. We consider multiple graph models as representations of this problem, and use techniques from graph rigidity theory to determine identifiability. Biologically, our models come from Hi-C data, microscopy data, and combinations thereof. Mathematically, we use unit ball and sphere packing models, as well as models consisting of distance and inequality constraints. In each setting, we describe and/or derive new results on realisability and uniqueness. We then propose a 3D reconstruction method based on semidefinite programming and apply it to synthetic and real data sets using our models.</description>

      <title>Mixed random beta-polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the result on the average volume of random polytopes with vertices following beta distributionsto the case of non-identically distributed vectors. Specifically,we consider the convex hull of independent random vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where each vector follows a beta distribution with potentially different parameters. We derive an expression for the expected volume of these generalized beta--polytopes. Additionally, we compute the expected value of a functional introduced by Wieacker, which involves the distance of facets from the origin and their volumes.Our results extend the findings of Kabluchko, Temesvari,and Th\"ale. Key techniques used in the proofs include the Blaschke--Petkantschin formula, Kubota's formula, and projections of beta distributed random vectors.</description>

      <title>Sharp stability of the Brunn-Minkowski inequality via optimal mass transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Brunn-Minkowski inequality, applicable to bounded measurable sets $A$ and $B$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, states that $|A+B|^{1/d} \geq |A|^{1/d}+|B|^{1/d}$. Equality is achieved if and only if $A$ and $B$ are convex and homothetic sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The concept of stability in this context concerns how, when approaching equality, sets $A$ and $B$ are close to homothetic convex sets. In a recent breakthrough [FvHT23], the authors of this paper proved the following folklore conjectures on the sharp stability for the Brunn-Minkowski inequality:
  (1) A linear stability result concerning the distance from $A$ and $B$ to their respective convex hulls.
  (2) A quadratic stability result concerning the distance from $A$ and $B$ to their common convex hull.
  As announced in [FvHT23], in the present paper, we leverage (1) in conjunction with a novel optimal transportation approach to offer an alternative proof for (2).</description>

      <title>Non-intersective Dragon Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let us fold a strip of paper many times in the same direction, and then unfold it so that all dents make a fixed angle $\theta$. The resulting shape is called the Dragon curve with the unfolding angle $\theta$. When $0\le\theta&lt;90^{\circ}$, the corresponding Dragon curve has a self-intersection. When $\theta=180^{\circ}$, the corresponding Dragon curve is a straight line, which has no self-intersection. In this paper, we will show that any Dragon curve whose unfolding angle is greater than $99.3438^{\circ}$ and less than $180^{\circ}$ has no self-intersection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a version of Lagrangian Floer homology whose chain complex is generated by the inscriptions of a rectangle into a real analytic Jordan curve. By using its associated spectral invariants, we establish that a rectifiable Jordan curve admits inscriptions of a whole interval of rectangles. In particular, it inscribes a square if the area it encloses is more than half that of a circle of equal diameter.</description>

      <title>Bounds on some geometric functionals of high dimensional Brownian convex hulls and their inverse processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove two-sided bounds on the expected values of several geometric functionals of the convex hull of Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and their inverse processes. This extends some recent results of McRedmond and Xu (2017), Jovaleki\'{c} (2021), and Cygan, \v{S}ebek, and the first author (2023) from the plane to higher dimensions. Our main result shows that the average time required for the convex hull in $\mathbb{R}^n$ to attain unit volume is at most $n\sqrt[n]{n!}$. Moreover, all of our bounds capture the correct order of asymptotic growth or decay in the dimension $n$.</description>
