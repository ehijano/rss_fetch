      <title>Des croquis comme support de raisonnement et de changement de registres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are convinced of the usefulness of sketches and diagrams during mathematical work but the observation is made in our practices that they are not spontaneously used by students. In order to study the understanding and use of sketches by mathematics students, we designed and then proposed a test at different university levels. The test consists of five exercises.The first concerns different representation registers of a set of numbers, the second on a graphic proof of an implicative algebraic proposition and the last three on the graphic approch to the notions of injectivity, surjectivity, bijectivity in the context of the analysis. The sketches, proposed or requested in each exercise, are intended to be aids to changes of register and reasoning. We present what motivated the choices and developments of the exercises then we analyze the results of these tests. In each case, we see difficulties in understanding and the sketches proposed, which leads to think that the sketch must be the subject of specific work at the university level.</description>

      <title>Chain Bounding and the leanest proof of Zorn's lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exposition of the *Chain Bounding Lemma*, which is a common generalization of both Zorn's Lemma and the Bourbaki-Witt fixed point theorem. The proofs of these results through the use of Chain Bounding are amongst the simplest ones that we are aware of. As a by-product, we show that for every poset $P$ and a function $f$ from the powerset of $P$ into $P$, there exists a maximal well-ordered chain whose family of initial segments is appropriately closed under $f$.
  We also provide a "computer formalization" of our main results using the Lean proof assistant.</description>
