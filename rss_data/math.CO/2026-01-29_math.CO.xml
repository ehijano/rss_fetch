      <title>Total Positivity of Analytic Bases through Symmetric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the bidiagonal factorization of the collocation matrices of analytic bases using symmetric functions. Explicit formulas for their initial minors are derived in terms of Schur functions. The structure of these formulas permits establishing sufficient conditions for the total positivity of generic systems of analytic functions. In addition, they have been found to lead to generalizations of the Cauchy identity for certain families of functions.</description>

      <title>The Interplay Between Domination and Separation in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the literature, several identification problems in graphs have been studied, of which, the most widely studied are the ones based on dominating sets as a tool of identification. Hereby, the objective is to separate any two vertices of a graph by their unique neighborhoods in a suitably chosen dominating or total-dominating set. Such a (total-)dominating set endowed with a separation property is often referred to as a code of the graph. In this paper, we study the four separation properties location, closed-separation, open-separation and full-separation. We address the complexity of finding minimum separating sets in a graph and study the interplay of these separation properties with several codes (establishing a particularly close relation between separation and codes based on domination) as well as the interplay of separation and complementation (showing that location and full-separation are the same on a graph and its complement, whereas closed-separation in a graph corresponds to open-separation in its complement).</description>

      <title>Further refinements of Euler-Mahonian statistics for multipermutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permutation statistics constitute a classical subject of enumerative combinatorics. In her study of the genus zeta function, Denert discovered a new Mahonian statistic for permutations, which is called the Denert's statistic ({\bf $\den$}) by Foata and Zeilberger. As natural extensions of the $r$-descent number ({\bf $r\des$}) and the $r$-major index ({\bf $r\maj$}) introduced by Rawlings, Liu introduced the $g$-gap $\ell$-level descent number ({\bf $g\des_{\ell}$}) and the $g$-gap $\ell$-level major index ({\bf $g\maj_{\ell}$}) for permutations. In this paper, we introduce the $g$-gap $\ell$-level Denert's statistic ({\bf $g\den_{\ell}$}) and the $g$-gap $\ell$-level excedance number ({\bf $g\exc_{\ell}$}) for multipermutations, which serve as natural generalizations of the Denert's statistic ({\bf $\den$}) and the excedance number ({\bf $\exc$}) for multipermutations first introduced by Han. By constructing two explicit bijections, we establish the equidistribution of the pairs $(g\exc_{\ell}, g\den_{h} )$ and $(g\des_{\ell}, g\maj_{\ell})$ over multipermutations for all $1\leq h\leq g+\ell$. Our result provides a new proof of the equidistribution of the pairs ($\des$, $\maj$) and ($\exc$, $\den$) over multipermutations originally derived by Han and enables us to confirm a recent conjecture posed by Huang-Lin-Yan. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for all $1\leq h\leq g+\ell$, the pair $(g\exc_\ell, g\den_{h})$ is $r$-Euler-Mahonian over multipermutations of $M=\{1^k, 2^k, \ldots, n^k\}$ where $r=g+\ell-1$ and $k\geq 1$, which extends a recent novel result derived by Liu from permutations to multipermutations.</description>

      <title>Almost all standard double covers of abelian Cayley graphs have smallest possible automorphism groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard double cover of a graph $\Gamma$ is the direct product $\Gamma\times K_2$. A graph $\Gamma$ is said to be stable if all the automorphisms of $\Gamma\times K_2$ come from its factors. Although the study of stability has attracted significant attention, particularly regarding Cayley graphs of abelian groups, a complete classification remains elusive even for Cayley graphs of cyclic groups. In this paper, we study the asymptotic enumeration of both labeled and unlabeled Cayley graphs of abelian groups whose standard double cover has the smallest possible automorphism group. As a corollary, in both the labeled and unlabeled settings, we conclude that the proportion of stable Cayley graphs of an abelian group of order $r$ approaches $1$ as $r\rightarrow\infty$, proving that almost all Cayley graphs of finite abelian groups are stable.</description>

      <title>On Patterns and Languages in 1-11-Representations of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 1-11-representation of a graph $G(V,E)$ is a word over the alphabet $V$ such that two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if and only if the restricted word $w{x,y}$ (obtained from $w$ by deleting all letters except $x$ and $y$) contains at most one occurrence of $xx$ or $yy$. Although every graph admits a 1-11-representation, the repetition patterns that may or must appear in such representations have not been fully studied.
  In this paper, we study cube-free and square-free 1-11-representations of graphs. We first show that cubes cannot always be avoided in 1-11-representations of minimum length by providing a graph for which every minimum-length 1-11-representation necessarily contains a cube. We then focus on permutational 1-11-representations, where the representing word is a concatenation of permutations of the vertex set. In this setting, we prove that any cube appearing in a permutational 1-11-representation can be removed without changing the represented graph. As a consequence, every permutational 1-11-representation attaining the permutational 1-11-representation number is cube-free. We further show that this behaviour does not extend to squares by providing a graph for which every permutational 1-11-representation with the minimum number of permutations necessarily contains a square.
  Finally, we prove that the language of all 1-11-representations of a given graph is regular. Moreover, we show that the language of all permutational 1-11-representations of a graph is also regular.</description>

      <title>New Results on Difference Distance Magic Labelings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph labeling assigns values to the components of a graph (vertices, edges, etc.). In particular, distance magic labelings have been widely studied in undirected graphs. In such a labeling, the vertices are labeled with unique values from one up to the number of vertices so that the sum of labels on the neighbors of any vertex is the same across all vertices. For oriented graphs, a related concept of distance difference magic has been studied. In a distance difference magic labeling, each vertex is given a unique value from one up to the number of vertices such that for each vertex the sums of the labels of vertices in the in-neighborhood minus the sums of the labels of vertices in the out-neighborhood equals zero. In this paper, we expand on this concept by showing a connected difference distance magic oriented graph on $n$ vertices exists for each integer $n \geq 5$. We also construct arbitrarily large difference distance magic oriented graphs from smaller ones using a new graph sum and exhibit a connection between linear algebra and this type of labeling.</description>

      <title>On a weaker notion of cross $t$-intersecting families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if two families $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \binom{[n]}{k}$ and $\mathcal{F}' \subseteq \binom{[n]}{k'}$ satisfy $\sum_{1 \leq i, j \leq \ell} \lvert F_i \cap F_j' \rvert \geq \ell^2t - \ell +1$ for every choice of distinct $F_1, \ldots, F_\ell \in \mathcal{F}$ and $F_1', \ldots, F_\ell' \in \mathcal{F}'$, then $\lvert \mathcal{F} \rvert \cdot \lvert \mathcal{F}' \rvert \leq \binom{n-t}{k-t} \binom{n-t}{k'-t}$, provided that $n$ is sufficiently large. This extends a celebrated theorem of Pyber for large $n$, which determines the tight upper bound for the product of the sizes of cross $1$-intersecting families.</description>

      <title>On Triangles in Colored Pseudoline Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the faces in pseudoline arrangements in which the pseudolines are colored with two colors. Bj\"orner, Las Vergnas, Sturmfels, White, and Ziegler conjecture the existence of a two-colored triangle in such arrangements. We consider variants of this problem. We show that in any non-trivial two-coloring of a pseudoline arrangement there exists a two-colored triangle or quadrangle. We also investigate the existence of a bichromatic triangle assuming certain structures on the coloring.
  Previously, several authors investigated the chromatic number and independence number of hypergraphs whose vertices correspond to the pseudolines of an arrangement and the hyperedges correspond to the faces of the arrangement. We show that the maximum of the independence numbers of such hypergraphs is $\lceil \frac{2}{3}n-1\rceil$. We also prove that if we only consider the triangular faces then this maximum becomes $n-\Theta(\log n)$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we build a bijection between the meet-irreducible elements of the lattice of the compositions of $n$ with parts in $[1,p]$ equipped with the dominance order, and the edges of the $(n,p)$-Tur\'an graph. Using this bijection, we then compute asymptotically the average value of some statistics on those meet-irreducible compositions.</description>

      <title>Eulerian-type polynomials over matchings and matching permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Claesson and Linusson [Proc. Am. Math. Soc., 139 (2011), 435-449] observed that there are n! matchings on [2n] with no left-nestings. Inspired by this result, this paper is devoted to exploring a deeper connection between matchings and permutations. We first discover that a quadruple statistic over matchings corresponds to the well known quadruple statistic (exc,drop,fix,cyc) over permutations, where exc, drop, fix and cyc are the excedance, drop, fixed point and cycle statistics, respectively. By introducing matching permutations, we provide a symmetric expansion of a five-variable neighbor polynomial of matchings, which encodes a great deal of neighbor information. As an application, we discover the e-positivity of NCA-polynomials, which implies that the left-nesting number, the left-crossing number and the neighbor alignment number are distributed symmetrically over all matchings on [2n]. We also establish the relationship between the five-variable neighbor polynomials and the trivariate second-order Eulerian polynomials, which generalizes the related results of Claesson and Linusson, Cameron and Killpatrick as well as Chen and Fu.</description>

      <title>On statistics of prime parking functions, {\L}ukasiewicz paths, and quasisymmetric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recall that a parking function of length $n+1$ is said to be prime if removing any instance of 1 yields a parking function of length $n$. In this article, we study prime parking functions from multiple lenses. We derive an explicit formula for the average value of the total displacement of prime parking functions. We present a formula for the displacement-enumerator of prime parking functions that involves a sum over {\L}ukasiewicz paths. We describe the one-to-one correspondence between parking functions and labeled{\L}ukasiewicz paths via Dyck paths. We introduce the concept of $\ell$-forward differences and use this as a vehicle for examining ties, ascents, and descents in prime parking functions. We establish a link between Schur functions corresponding to the partition $(i,1^{n-i})$ and fundamental quasisymmetric functions indexed by prime parking function tie sets of size $n-i.$</description>

      <title>How many times can two minimum spanning trees cross?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a generic set of $n$ points in the plane, and let $P=R\cup B$ be a coloring of $P$ in two colors. We are interested in the number of crossings between the minimum spanning trees (MSTs) of $R$ and $B$, denoted by $\crossAB(R,B)$. We define the \emph{bicolored MST crossing number} of $P$, denoted by $\cross(P)$, as $\cross(P) = \max_{P= R\cup B}(\crossAB(R,B))$. We prove a linear upper bound for $\cross(P)$ when $P$ is generic. If $P$ is dense or in convex position, we provide linear lower bounds. Lastly, if $P$ is chosen uniformly at random from the unit square and is colored uniformly at random, we prove that the expected value of $\crossAB(R,B)$ is linear.</description>

Abstract: Past studies on the local limit of maximal weight matchings in edge-weighted large random graphs rely fundamentally on the assumption that the weights are atomless, which ensures that the maximal weight matching is unique. This excludes de facto maximal size matchings that correspond to equal edge-weights. In this work, we overcome this difficulty by assigning i.i.d.~atomless weights to edges and choosing the maximal size matching that maximises the weight. We call these doubly constrained matchings \emph{optimal matchings}. The natural generalisation of optimal matchings for infinite unimodular random graphs are unimodular matchings of maximal density at the root that maximise the expected weight at the root when it is matched.
  For unimodular Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson (UBGW) trees and for a broad class of weight distributions, we show existence and uniqueness in law of such matchings. We also prove that if a sequence of finite random weighted graphs converges locally to an UBGW tree with i.i.d.~weights, then there exists a sequence of matchings on the finite graphs that converges locally to the optimal matching on the limiting tree. Finally, we identify a regime, depending only on the offspring distribution of the limiting tree, in which correlations between edge states in the optimal matching decay exponentially with their graph distance. In this regime, we strengthen the previous convergence to the convergence of optimal matchings of the finite graphs. As a by-product, we can explicitly compute the asymptotic densities of edges that belong to all maximal-density matchings, and of edges that belong to none.</description>

      <title>On the orbital diameter of classical groups in standard action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a primitive permutation group acting on a finite set $X$. The orbital diameter $\mathrm{diam}(X,G)$ is defined to be the supremum of the diameters of the (connected) orbital graphs of $G$ after disregarding the directions of all edges in the graphs. This invariant is studied in the case when $G$ is an almost simple group in a standard action. A lower bound is given for $\mathrm{diam}(X,G)$ and we provide a partial classification of pairs $(X,G)$ for which the orbital diameter is at most $2$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate Tukey morphisms between binary relations, establishing several fundamental lemmas. We then specialize to finite binary relations, using computational methods to classify all binary relations with at most $6$ points in the domain and codomain up to bimorphism. Finally we give a construction of finite binary relations with arbitrary dominating number and dual dominating number.</description>

Abstract: We give a necessary condition of generic 3 -rigidity of graphs relying on partitioning the edges into 3 subsets; such that each subset-pair gives a generically 2-rigid graph, either by themselves or after an appropriate edge-deletion.

      <description>arXiv:2410.08076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the poset topology of lattices arising from orientations of 1-skeleta of directionally simple polytopes, with Bruhat interval polytopes $Q_{e,w}$ as our main example. We show that the order complex $\Delta ((u,v)_w)$ of an interval therein is homotopy equivalent to a sphere if $Q_{u,v}$ is a face of $Q_{e,w}$ and is otherwise contractible. This significantly generalizes the known case of the permutahedron. We also show that saturated chains from $u$ to $v$ in such lattices are connected, and in fact highly connected, under moves corresponding to flipping across a 2-face. When $w$ is a Grassmannian permutation, this implies a strengthening of the restriction of Postnikov's move-equivalence theorem to the class of BCFW bridge decomposable plabic graphs.</description>

Abstract: Let $W$ be a finite group generated by reflections of a lattice $M$. If a lattice polytope $P \subset M \otimes_{\mathbb Z}\mathbb R$ is preserved by $W$, then we show that the quotient of the projective toric variety $X_P$ by $W$ is isomorphic to the toric variety $X_{P \cap D}$, where $D$ is a fundamental domain for the action of $W$. This answers a question of Horiguchi-Masuda-Shareshian-Song, and recovers results of Blume, of Song, of the second author, and of Gui-Hu-Liu. We also study quotients of real toric varieties, proving that $X_P^{\mathbb R} / W$ is contractible when $P$ is a permutohedron.</description>

Abstract: An overpartition is a partition such that the first occurrence (equivalently, the last occurrence) of a number may be overlined. In this article, we investigate three contents of overpartitions. We first consider the $r$-chain minimal and maximal excludant sizes of an overpartition. Then, we study the second minimal excludant and mex sequence of an overpartition. Finally, we introduce $L_k$-overpartitions and $F_k$-overpartitions, which are separable overpartition classes.</description>

Abstract: We study highest weight vectors for symmetric and alternating spaces of tensors, whose dimensions are given by generalized Kronecker coefficients. We describe the algebraic relations for classical constructions of corresponding spanning sets of highest weight vectors. The proof is based on important duality that we discover for these highest weight spaces and vectors. As applications of duality, we also give conceptual interpretations to power expansions of Cayley's first hyperdeterminant and its dual exterior form.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds on the zeros of the chromatic polynomial of graphs and claw-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for any graph $G$ the (complex) zeros of its chromatic polynomial, $\chi_G(x)$, lie inside the disk centered at $0$ of radius $4.25 \Delta(G)$, where $\Delta(G)$ denotes the maximum degree of $G$. This improves on a recent result of Jenssen, Patel and Regts, who proved a bound of $5.94\Delta(G)$. Moreover, we show that for graphs of sufficiently large girth we can replace $4.25$ by $3.60$ and for claw-free graphs we can replace $4.25$ by $3.81$.
  Our proofs add some substantially novel ideas to those developed by Jenssen, Patel, and Regts, while building on them. A key novel ingredient for claw-free graphs is to use a representation of the coefficients of the chromatic polynomial in terms of the number of certain partial acyclic orientations.</description>

      <title>Upho lattices II: ways of realizing a core</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A poset is called upper homogeneous, or "upho," if all of its principal order filters are isomorphic to the whole poset. In previous work of the first author, it was shown that each (finite-type N-graded) upho lattice has associated to it a finite graded lattice, called its core, which determines the rank generating function of the upho lattice. In that prior work the question of which finite graded lattices arise as cores was explored. Here, we study the question of in how many different ways a given finite graded lattice can be realized as the core of an upho lattice. We show that if the finite lattice has no nontrivial automorphisms, then it is the core of finitely many upho lattices. We also show that the number of ways a finite lattice can be realized as a core is unbounded, even when restricting to rank-two lattices. We end with a discussion of a potential algorithm for listing all the ways to realize a given finite lattice as a core.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11661v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider maximum rooted tree extension counts in random graphs, i.e., we consider M_n = \max_v X_v where X_v counts the number of copies of a given tree in G_{n,p} rooted at vertex v. We determine the asymptotics of M_n when the random graph is not too sparse, specifically when the edge probability p=p(n) satisfies p(1-p)n \gg \log n. The problem is more difficult in the sparser regime 1 \ll pn \ll \log n, where we determine the asymptotics of M_n for specific classes of trees. Interestingly, here our large deviation type optimization arguments reveal that the behavior of M_n changes as we vary p=p(n), due to different mechanisms that can make the maximum large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent paper by Bhatia, Chin, Mani, and Mossel (2026) defined stochastic processes aimed at modeling the game of War for {\em two players} with $n$ cards. That paper showed that these models, assuming uniform random decks, are equivalent to the Gambler's Ruin problem and therefore have an expected termination time of $\Theta(n^2)$. In this paper, we generalize these models to {\em any number of players} $m$. We prove that the game with $m$ players is equivalent to a sticky random walk on an $m$-simplex; therefore, the termination time is the same as the absorption time of the sticky random walk. Interestingly, it seems that this absorption time has not been analyzed before. We show that the absorption time of the walk and the termination time of the game are both $\Theta(n^2)$ for any number of players.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses what the dimension data of irreducible representations of a finite group looks like in some specific cases, including unipotent and reductive groups over finite fields.
  The essence of our investigation is whether the dimension data of irreducible representations of a finite group can be ``geometerized'', to become equal to the cardinality of certain orbit spaces.
  The first part of this paper deals with nilpotent and reductive groups over finite fields, whereas the second part deals with the symmetric group $S_n$. The main conclusion that we want to bring out to contrast these two cases is that for reductive groups over finite fields, the dimension data is concentrated (in a statistical sense) in a neighborhood of the maximal dimension, whereas for the symmetric group, it is spread out.</description>

      <title>Finite Groups of Random Walks in the Quarter Plane and Periodic $4$-bar Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve two long standing open problems, one from probability theory formulated by Malyshev in 1970 and another one from a crossroad of geometry and dynamics, of Darboux from 1879. The Malyshev problem is of finding effective, explicit necessary and sufficient conditions in the closed form to characterize all random walks in the quarter plane with the finite group of random walk of order $2n$, for all $n\ge 2$, where the underlining biquadratic is an elliptic curve. Until now, the results were known only for $n=2, 3, 4$, obtained using ad-hoc methods developed separately for each of the three cases. We provide a method that solves the problem for all $n$ and in a unified way. Explicit examples of random walks with the groups of orders higher than 10 are presented here for the first time, including orders 12, 14, 16. The same method applies to any higher order. We consider cases with singular biquadratics in a systematic manner. We establish a new two-way relationship between diagonal random walks and $4$-bar links. We describe all $n$-periodic Darboux transformations for $4$-bar links for all $n\ge 2$, thus completely solving the Darboux problem: after $n$ iterations, a polygonal configuration maps to a congruent one of the same orientation, that he solved for $n=2$, which was recently extended to $n=3$. We also study $k$-semi-periodicity as a natural type of periodicity of the Darboux transformations, where after $k$ iterations of the Darboux transformation, a polygonal configuration maps to a congruent one, but of opposite orientation. By introducing a new object, the secondary $(2,2)$ correspondence, and the related secondary cubic of the centrally-symmetric biquadratics, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for $k$-semi-periodicity for $4$-bar links for all $k\ge 2$ in an explicit closed form, while the case $k=2$ was solved recently.</description>
