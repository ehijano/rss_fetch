      <title>ArchesClimate: Probabilistic Decadal Ensemble Generation With Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate projections have uncertainties related to components of the climate system and their interactions. A typical approach to quantifying these uncertainties is to use climate models to create ensembles of repeated simulations under different initial conditions. Due to the complexity of these simulations, generating such ensembles of projections is computationally expensive. In this work, we present ArchesClimate, a deep learning-based climate model emulator that aims to reduce this cost. ArchesClimate is trained on decadal hindcasts of the IPSL-CM6A-LR climate model at a spatial resolution of approximately 2.5x1.25 degrees. We train a flow matching model following ArchesWeatherGen, which we adapt to predict near-term climate. Once trained, the model generates states at a one-month lead time and can be used to auto-regressively emulate climate model simulations of any length. We show that for up to 10 years, these generations are stable and physically consistent. We also show that for several important climate variables, ArchesClimate generates simulations that are interchangeable with the IPSL model. This work suggests that climate model emulators could significantly reduce the cost of climate model simulations.</description>

      <title>SGMAGNet: A Baseline Model for 3D Cloud Phase Structure Reconstruction on a New Passive Active Satellite Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloud phase profiles are critical for numerical weather prediction (NWP), as they directly affect radiative transfer and precipitation processes. In this study, we present a benchmark dataset and a baseline framework for transforming multimodal satellite observations into detailed 3D cloud phase structures, aiming toward operational cloud phase profile retrieval and future integration with NWP systems to improve cloud microphysics parameterization. The multimodal observations consist of (1) high--spatiotemporal--resolution, multi-band visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery from geostationary satellites, and (2) accurate vertical cloud phase profiles from spaceborne lidar (CALIOP\slash CALIPSO) and radar (CPR\slash CloudSat). The dataset consists of synchronized image--profile pairs across diverse cloud regimes, defining a supervised learning task: given VIS/TIR patches, predict the corresponding 3D cloud phase structure. We adopt SGMAGNet as the main model and compare it with several baseline architectures, including UNet variants and SegNet, all designed to capture multi-scale spatial patterns. Model performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-score, and IoU. The results demonstrate that SGMAGNet achieves superior performance in cloud phase reconstruction, particularly in complex multi-layer and boundary transition regions. Quantitatively, SGMAGNet attains a Precision of 0.922, Recall of 0.858, F1-score of 0.763, and an IoU of 0.617, significantly outperforming all baselines across these key metrics.</description>

      <title>kh2d-solver: A Python Library for Idealized Two-Dimensional Incompressible Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an open-source Python library for simulating two-dimensional incompressible Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in stratified shear flows. The solver employs a fractional-step projection method with spectral Poisson solution via Fast Sine Transform, achieving second-order spatial accuracy. Implementation leverages NumPy, SciPy, and Numba JIT compilation for efficient computation. Four canonical test cases explore Reynolds numbers 1000--5000 and Richardson numbers 0.1--0.3: classical shear layer, double shear configuration, rotating flow, and forced turbulence. Statistical analysis using Shannon entropy and complexity indices reveals that double shear layers achieve 2.8$\times$ higher mixing rates than forced turbulence despite lower Reynolds numbers. The solver runs efficiently on standard desktop hardware, with 384$\times$192 grid simulations completing in approximately 31 minutes. Results demonstrate that mixing efficiency depends on instability generation pathways rather than intensity measures alone, challenging Richardson number-based parameterizations and suggesting refinements for subgrid-scale representation in climate models.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal Dynamical Indices for Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex systems span multiple spatial and temporal scales, making their dynamics challenging to understand and predict. This challenge is especially daunting when one wants to study localized and/or rare events. Advances in dynamical systems theory, including the development of state-dependent dynamical indices, namely local dimension and persistence, have provided powerful tools for studying these phenomena. However, existing applications of such indices rely on a predefined and fixed spatial domain, that provides a single scalar quantity for the entire region of interest. This aspect prevents understanding the spatially localized dynamical behavior of the system. In this work, we introduce Spatio-temporal Dynamical Indices (SDIs), that leverage the existing framework of state-dependent local dimension and persistence. SDIs are obtained via a sliding window approach, enabling the exploration of space-dependent properties in spatio-temporal data. As an example, we show that, through this framework, we are able to reconcile previously different perspectives on European summertime heatwaves. This result showcases the importance of accounting for spatial scales when performing scale-dependent dynamical analyses.</description>
