      <title>Observation of diamagnetic strange-metal phase in sulfur-copper codoped lead apatite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By codoping sulfur and copper into lead apatite, the crystal grains are directionally stacked and the room-temperature resistivity is reduced from insulating to $2\times10^{-5}~\Omega\cdot$m. The resistance-temperature curve exhibits a nearly linear relationship suggesting the presence of strange-metal phase. A possible Meissner effect is observed in dc magnetic measurements. An even-in-field transverse voltage is found indicating the possible contribution of individual vortex dynamics. A clear pathway towards superconductivity in this material is subsequently benchmarked.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic Ground State, Charge Density Waves and Oxygen Vacancies Induced Metal-Insulator Transition in Pressurized La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ has garnered widespread interest recently due to its high-temperature superconductivity under pressure, accompanied by charge density wave (CDW) ordering and metal-insulator (MI) transitions in the phase diagram. Here, we reveal with comprehensive calculations that La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ possesses an antiferromagnetic ground state under both low and high pressures, with the strong Fermi surface nesting contributed by the flat band that leads to phonon softening and electronic instabilities. Several stable CDW orders with oxygen octahedral distortions are identified, which can trigger the MI transitions. The estimated CDW transition temperature ($\approx$120 K) at ambient pressure agrees nicely with experimental results. In the presence of apical oxygen vacancies, we identify two different phases, say, half distortion and full distortion phases, respectively, and their competition can lead to a pressure-induced MI transition, in good agreement with experimental observations. In addition, we find that the electron-phonon coupling is too small to contribute to superconductivity. These results appear to indicate an unconventional superconducting pairing mechanism mediated by antiferromagnetic fluctuations. A phase diagram that is consistent with the experimental results is given. The present results not only explain the origins of experimentally observed CDW and MI transitions, but also provide insight for deeply understanding the properties like superconductivity, CDW and the role of oxygen vacancies in pressurized La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$.</description>

      <title>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless to BCS-like superconducting transition crossover driven by weak magnetic fields in ultra-thin NbN films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in ultra-thin NbN films is investigated in the presence of weak perpendicular magnetic fields. A jump in the phase stiffness at the BKT transition is detected up to 5 G, while the BKT features are smeared between 5 G and 50 G, disappearing altogether at 100 G, where conventional current-voltage behaviour is observed. Our findings demonstrate that weak magnetic fields, insignificant in bulk systems, deeply affect our ultra-thin system, promoting a crossover from Halperin-Nelson fluctuations to a BCS-like state with Ginzburg-Landau fluctuations, as the field increases. This behavior is related to field-induced free vortices that screen the vortex-antivortex interaction and smear the BKT transition.</description>

      <title>Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_2$$Ae$Ni$_2$O$_6$F ($Ae$ = Sr, Ba): Benchmark Materials for Bilayer Nickelate Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, La$_2$BaNi$_2$O$_6$F, and La$_2$SrNi$_2$O$_6$F compounds to be benchmark materials for bilayer nickelate superconductivity. The stable phase of Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_2$BaNi$_2$O$_6$F are found to be $I4/mmm$ without the lattice distortion caused by octahedra rotation at ambient pressure, where as the lattice distortion in La$_2$SrNi$_2$O$_6$F can be suppressed with relatively small external pressure of 4 GPa. The magnetism, electronic structure and spin susceptibilities of Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ are extremely close to those of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at 30 GPa. The ground state of La$_2$BaNi$_2$O$_6$F and La$_2$SrNi$_2$O$_6$F are antiferromagnetically coupled checkerboard bilayer with sizable magnetic moment on Ni. In addition, the inter-layer coupling $J_{\perp}$ between Ni-bilayers in La$_2$BaNi$_2$O$_6$F or La$_2$SrNi$_2$O$_6$F is only $\sim$ 1/10 of that in Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ or La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at 30 GPa. We argue that these compounds may serve as superconducting candidates at ambient pressure and can be employed to testify theoretical proposals for bilayer nickelate superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Metamaterial Renormalization of Superconducting Josephson Plasmons in La$_{1.85}$Sr$_{0.15}$CuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate light-matter coupling in the cuprate superconductor La$_{1.85}$Sr$_{0.15}$Cu0$_4$ (LSCO), accomplished by adhering metamaterial resonator arrays (MRAs) to a c-axis oriented single crystal. The resonators couple to the Josephson Plasma Mode (JPM) which manifests as a plasma edge in the terahertz reflectivity in the superconducting state. Terahertz reflectivity measurements at 10K reveal a renormalization of the JPM frequency, $\omega_{jpm}$, from 1.7 THz for the bare crystal to $\sim$1 THz with the MRAs. With increasing temperature, the modified $\omega_{jpm}$ redshifts as expected for decreasing superfluid density, vanishing above T$_{c}$. The modification of the electrodynamic response arises from resonator induced screening of the longitudinal polariton response, reminiscent of plasmon-phonon coupling in doped semiconductors. Modeling reveals that the electrodynamic response is fully interpretable using classical electromagnetism. Future studies will have to contend with the large effects we observe which could obscure subtle changes that may indicate cavity-based manipulation of superconductivity. Finally, we note that our MRA/LSCO structure is a tunable epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) metamaterial that exhibits a nonlinear response arising from the c-axis Josephson tunneling coupled with the local fields of the resonators.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi liquid behavior of scattering rate in three-orbital Emery model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent findings on the $T$-linear electronic scattering rate in the two-dimensional Hubbard model, we have investigated the three-orbital Emery model and its temperature-dependent electronic and quasiparticle scattering rates by adopting dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulations. By focusing on two characteristic site energies $\epsilon_p$ of O-2$p$ orbital relevant to cuprates and nickelates separately, our exploration discovered that, for $\epsilon_p=3.24$ relevant to cuprates, the scattering rate can exhibit a linear-$T$ dependence at low temperature for a range of intermediate densities. In contrast, for larger $\epsilon_p=6.0$ presumably relevant to nickelates, a wide range of densities support a downturn of the scattering rate below the temperature scale $T\sim0.1$ with possibly two consecutive nearly linear-$T$ regimes connected via a smooth crossover around $T\sim0.1$. Furthermore, the temperature dependent quasiparticle scattering rate generically departs from the unity slope as predicted by the Planckian dissipation theory. Our presented work provides valuable insights on the extensively studied three-orbital Emery model, particularly on the quantitative examination of non-Fermi liquid features of scattering rates.</description>

      <title>An exact formula for the optical conductivity of the two dimensional Hubbard model and its application to the cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the origin of electron incoherence is believed to be the first step toward the resolution of the mysteries of the high-T$_{c}$ cuprate superconductors. Such electron incoherence manifests itself most evidently in the non-Drude form of the optical absorption spectrum of the system. The spectral weight transfer related to such dissipative response, which is absent in conventional Fermi liquid metal, has direct consequence on the dc transport property of the system. However, a theoretical study of the optical conductivity of a strongly correlated model is a formidable task. Here we present an exact formula for the optical conductivity of the 2D Hubbard model from the low energy effective theory perspective. We show that the optical conductivity in Matsubara frequency of the 2D Hubbard model can be represented as the ensemble average of the optical conductivity of non-interacting systems in the background of fluctuating local moment. We find that such an ensemble average can be done exactly with a sign-problem-free Monte Carlo simulation if we assume the widely adopted Millis-Monien-Pines spin susceptibility for the fluctuating local moment. For thermal fluctuation of the local moment, our formula can be used to calculate directly the optical conductivity in real frequency which can be compared with the result of optical measurements in the cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Kinetic inductance traveling wave amplifier designs for practical microwave readout applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Kinetic Inductance Traveling Wave amplifier (KIT) utilizes the nonlinear kinetic inductance of superconducting films, particularly Niobium Titanium Nitride (NbTiN), for parametric amplification. These amplifiers achieve remarkable performance in terms of gain, bandwidth, compression power, and frequently approach the quantum limit for noise. However, most KIT demonstrations have been isolated from practical device readout systems. Using a KIT as the first amplifier in the readout chain of an unoptimized microwave SQUID multiplexer coupled to a transition-edge sensor microcalorimeter we see an initial improvement in the flux noise. One challenge in KIT integration is the considerable microwave pump power required to drive the non-linearity. To address this, we have initiated efforts to reduce the pump power by using thinner NbTiN films and an inverted microstrip transmission line design. In this article, we present the new transmission line design, fabrication procedure, and initial device characterization -- including gain and added noise. These devices exhibit over 10 dB of gain with a 3 dB bandwidth of approximately 5.5-7.25 GHz, a maximum practical gain of 12 dB and typical gain ripple under 4 dB peak-to-peak. We observe an appreciable impedance mismatch in the NbTiN transmission line, which is likely the source of the majority of the gain ripple. Finally we perform an initial noise characterization and demonstrate system-added noise of three quanta or less over nearly the entire 3 dB bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Test for BCS-BEC Crossover in the Cuprate Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we address the question of whether high-temperature superconductors have anything in common with BCS-BEC crossover theory. Towards this goal, we present a proposal and related predictions which provide a concrete test for the applicability of this theoretical framework. These predictions characterize the behavior of the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length, $\xi_0^{\text{coh}}$, near the transition temperature $T_{\text{c}}$, and across the entire superconducting $T_{\text{c}}$ dome in the phase diagram. That we are lacking a systematic characterization of $\xi_0^{\text{coh}}$ in the entire class of cuprate superconductors is perhaps surprising, as it is one of the most fundamental properties of any superconductor. This paper is written to motivate further experiments and, thus, address this shortcoming. Here we show how measurements of $\xi_0^{\text{coh}}$ contain direct indications for whether or not the cuprates are associated with BCS-BEC crossover and, if so, where within the crossover spectrum a particular superconductor lies.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity emerging from density-wave-like order in a correlated kagome metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity (USC) in a highly correlated kagome system has been theoretically proposed for years, yet the experimental realization is hard to achieve. The recently discovered vanadium-based kagome materials, which exhibit both superconductivity and charge density wave (CDW) orders, are nonmagnetic and weakly correlated, thus unlikely host USC as theories proposed. Here we report the discovery of a chromium-based kagome metal, CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$, which is contrastingly characterised by strong electron correlations, frustrated magnetism, and characteristic flat bands close to the Fermi level. Under ambient pressure, it undergoes a concurrent structural and magnetic phase transition at 55 K, accompanying with a stripe-like $4a_0$ structural modulation. At high pressure, the phase transition evolves into two transitions, probably associated with CDW and antiferromagnetic spin-density-wave orderings, respectively. These density-wave (DW)-like orders are gradually suppressed with pressure and, remarkably, a superconducting dome emerges at 3.65-8.0 GPa. The maximum of the superconducting transition temperature, $T_\mathrm{c}^{\mathrm{max}}=$ 6.4 K, appears when the DW-like orders are completely suppressed at 4.2 GPa, and the normal state exhibits a non-Fermi-liquid behaviour, reminiscent of USC and quantum criticality in iron-based superconductors. Our work offers an unprecedented platform for investigating possible USC in a correlated kagome system.</description>

      <title>Controllable magnetic states in chains of coupled phi-0 Josephson junctions with ferromagnetic weak links</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junction with anomalous phase shift (phi_0-S/F/S JJ) is a system, where the anomalous ground state shift phi_0 provides a direct magnetoelectric coupling between a magnetic moment and a phase of the superconducting condensate. If a chain of such phi_0-S/F/S JJs are coupled via superconducting leads, the condensate phase, being a macroscopic quantity, mediates a long-range interaction between the magnetic moments of the weak links. We study static and dynamic magnetic properties of such a system. It is shown that it manifests properties of n-level system, where the energies of the levels are only determined by projections of the total magnetic moment onto the easy magnetic axis. It is similar to a magnetic atom in a Zeeman field, but the role of the field is played by the magnetoelectric coupling. However, unlike an atom in a magnetic field, the relative order of energies of different states is controlled by electrical means. It is also demonstrated that the total magnetic moment can be fully controlled by a supercurrent and the response of the magnetic system to local external perturbations is highly nonlocal.</description>

Abstract: A coupled chain of superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor (S/F/S) with anomalous ground phase shift phi_0 represents a system realizing long-range interaction between magnetic moments of the weak links. The interaction is of magnetoelectric origin and is mediated by the condensate phase of superconductors. The system is a paradigmic platform for investigation of collective magnetic states governed by the superconducting phase. Here we study the magnetic eigenmodes of such a system and demonstrate that the eigenfrequencies are determined by the magnetic configuration of the whole system and are controlled by the superconducting phase. Depending on the orientation of the magnetic easy axis the eigenmodes can be very different ranging from individual oscillations of different magnets to highly-cooperative behavior.</description>

Abstract: We explore the pairing state and gap structure of UTe$_2$ using a six-orbital model which we call the $f$-$d$-$p$ model. Our model accurately reproduces the quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surfaces consistent with recent de Haas-van Alphen oscillation measurements and the $(0, \pm \pi, 0)$ antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations observed by neutron scattering. We incorporate on-site Coulomb repulsion for $f$ electrons and solve the linearized Eliashberg equation within the third-order perturbation theory to investigate the superconducting symmetry in UTe$_2$. The most likely state is found to be an $s$-wave state with a highly anisotropic superconducting gap structure that exhibits a point-node-like behavior of the specific heat at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Topologically protected emergent Fermi surface in an Abrikosov vortex lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a three-dimensional (3D) fully gapped type-II superconductor can feature emergent in-gap Fermi surfaces of Caroli-de Gennes Matricon (CdGM) quasiparticles in the presence of an Abrikosov vortex lattice. In particular, these CdGM Fermi surfaces manifest in the emergent 3D band structure enabled by the intervortex tunneling physics, and their stability is guaranteed by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological index. By developing an effective analytical theory, we find that each vortex line carrying a 1D nodal dispersion is a sufficient condition for the vortex lattice to form CdGM Fermi surfaces. Following this prediction, in-gap CdGM Fermi surfaces are numerically confirmed in a microscopic vortex-lattice simulation of a superconducting Dirac semimetal with an $s$-wave spin-singlet pairing, which is directly applicable to a large class of type-II superconductors such as LiFeAs. Remarkably, the CdGM Fermi surfaces persist even when the normal state is deformed to a doped insulator of trivial band topology. Our work establishes the vortex lattice as a new experimentally feasible control knob for emergent topological phenomena in conventional superconductors.</description>

Abstract: Based on first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that 1H/2H-phase transition metal dichalcogenides MX2 (M=Nb,Ta; X=S,Se,Te) are unconventional metals, which have an empty-site band of $A_1'@1e$ elementary band representation at the Fermi level. The computed phonon dispersions indicate the stability of the system at high temperatures, while the presence of the soft phonon mode suggests a phase transition to the charge density wave state at low temperatures. Based on the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory and computed electron-phonon coupling, our calculations show that the superconductivity (SC) in NbSe2 is mainly attributed to the soft phonon mode due to the half filling of the empty-site band. Accordingly, the SC has been predicted in unconventional metals TaNS monolayer and 2H-TaN2 bulk with computed $T_C=$ 10 K and 26 K respectively. These results demonstrate that the unconventional metals with partial filling of the empty-site band offer an attractive platform to search for superconductors.</description>
