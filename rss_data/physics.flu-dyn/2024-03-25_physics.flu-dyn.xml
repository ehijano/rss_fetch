      <title>A high-performance lattice Boltzmann model for multicomponent turbulent jet simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work an optimized multicomponent lattice Boltzmann (LB) model is deployed to simulate axisymmetric turbulent jets of a fluid evolving in a quiescent, immiscible environment over a wide range of dynamic regimes. The implementation of the multicomponent lattice Boltzmann code achieves peak performances on graphic processing units with a significant reduction of the memory footprint, retains the algorithmic simplicity inherent to standard LB computing and being based on a high-order extension of the thread-safe lattice Boltzmann algorithm, it allows to perform stable simulations at vanishingly low viscosities. The proposed approach opens attractive prospects for high-performance computing simulations of realistic turbulent flows with interfaces on GPU-based architectures.</description>

      <title>Droplet shape representation using Fourier series and autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shape of liquid droplets in air plays an important role in aerodynamic behavior and combustion dynamics of miniaturized propulsion systems such as microsatellites and small drones. Their precise manipulation can yield optimal efficiency in such systems. It is desired to have a minimal representation of droplet shapes using as few parameters to automate shape manipulation using self-learning algorithms, such as reinforcement learning. In this paper, we use a neural compression algorithm to represent, with only two parameters, elliptical and bullet-shaped droplets initially represented with 200 points (400 real numbers) at the droplet boundary. The mapping of many to two points is achieved in two stages. Initially, a Fourier series is formulated to approximate the contour of the droplet. Subsequently, the coefficients of this Fourier series are condensed to lower dimensions utilizing a neural network with a bottleneck architecture. Finally, 5000 synthetically generated droplet shapes were used to train the neural network. With a two real numbers representation, the recovered droplet shapes had excellent overlap with the original ones, with a mean square error 10^-3. Hence, this method compresses the droplet contour to merely two numerical parameters via a fully reversible process, a crucial feature for rendering learning algorithms computationally tractable.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional clustering characteristics of large-stokes number sprays interacting with turbulent swirling co-flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) clustering characteristics of large-stokes number sprays interacting with turbulent swirling co-flows are investigated experimentally. The Astigmatic Interferometric Particle Imaging (AIPI) technique is utilized for simultaneous measurement of the spray droplets position in 3D space and their corresponding diameter. The Stokes number estimated based on the Kolmogorov time scale varies from 34 to 142. The results show that the degree of droplet clustering plateaus at about 0.4 and at large Stokes numbers. It is obtained that the mean length scale of the clusters normalized by the Kolmogorov length scale follows a power-law relation with the Stokes number, and the mean void length scale normalized by the integral length scale plateaus at about 1.5. It is shown that the ratio of the number density of the droplets residing within the clusters to the global number density increases with increasing the Stokes number and is about 8 for the largest stokes number examined in this study. The joint characteristics of cluster's normalized volume and the mean diameter of droplets residing within the clusters show that small-volume clusters accommodate droplets with a relatively broad range of diameter. However, large clusters carry droplets with the most probable diameter. The developed AIPI technique in the present study and the corresponding spray characteristics are of importance for engineering applications that aim to understand the 3D clustering characteristics of large-stokes number droplets sprayed into turbulent swirling co-flows.</description>

      <title>A unified kinematic wave theory for melt infiltration into firn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the refreezing of melt water in firn we revisit the one-dimensional percolation of liquid water and non-reactive gas in porous ice. We analyze the dynamics of infiltration in the absence of capillary forces and heat conduction to understand the coupling between advective heat and mass transport in firn. In this limit, we formulate a kinematic wave theory that results in a 2X2-system of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) corresponding to the conservation of composition and enthalpy. For simple initial conditions (Riemann problems) this system admits self-similar solutions that illuminate the structure of melting/refreezing fronts and analytical solutions are provided for 12 basic cases of physical relevance encountered in the literature. Further we develop an extended kinematic theory that encompasses the cases when the firn saturates completely to form a perched water table governed by elliptic PDE so that the model is no longer fully hyperbolic (local). These solutions provide benchmarks for numerical models of melt infiltration into firn. They also provide insight into important physical processes such as the formation of frozen fringes, the perching of meltwater on pre-existing low porosity layers and the conditions required for impermeable ice lens formation. Lastly, these analytic solutions can be utilized to improve and compare the performance of the firn hydrology, ice-sheet and Earth system models. Our analysis provides a theoretical framework to understand these important processes in firn which affect the partitioning between meltwater infiltration and surface runoff and therefore determine the surface mass loss from ice sheets and its contribution to sea level rise.</description>

      <title>Explicit form of simplified Grad's 13 moments distribution function-based moment gas kinetic solver with unstructured meshes for the multiscale rarefied flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is essential to efficiently solve multiscale flows covering the continuum regime to the rarefied regime. The explicit form of Grad's 13 moments distribution function-based moment gas kinetic solver (G13-MGKS) has been proposed in our previous work [Comput. Math. Appl., 137 (2023), pp. 112-125], which demonstrates the potential for efficiently simulating continuum flows accurately and presenting reasonable predictions for rarefied flows at moderate Knudsen numbers on structured meshes. To further extend the solver's applicability to unstructured meshes, we propose the simplified version of the Grad's 13 moments distribution function-based moment gas kinetic solver (SG13-MGKS) with an explicit form of the numerical flux in the present paper. The Shakhov collision model has been adopted and validated within the framework of SG13-MGKS to ensure the correct Prandtl number in the simulation. Additionally, a simplified treatment for the numerical fluxes has been adopted to minimize the need for complex calculations of the gradient of integral coefficients. The performance of SG13-MGKS has been evaluated in numerical cases of Couette flow with temperature differences, flow passing through a NACA0012 airfoil, and pressure-driven flow in a variable-diameter circular pipe. Our results demonstrate that SG13-MGKS can achieve reasonably accurate computational results at Knudsen numbers below 0.2. Benefiting from the avoidance of discretization in velocity space, G13-MGKS is able to be two orders of magnitude faster compared to the conventional discrete velocity method. Furthermore, the simplified form of numerical fluxes and the fewer gradients of integration coefficients enable the performance of SG13-MGKS on unstructured grids with a saving of about 4 times the computation time and 3 times the memory cost compared to the previous version of G13-MGKS.</description>

      <title>Shaping a Surface Microdroplet by Marangoni Forces along a Moving Contact Line of Four Immiscible Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to transfer microdroplets between fluid phases offers numerous advantages in various fields, enabling better control, manipulation, and utilization of small volumes of fluids in pharmaceutical formulations, microfluidics, and lab-on-a-chip devices, single-cell analysis or droplet-based techniques for nanomaterial synthesis. This study focuses on the stability and morphology of a sessile oil microdroplet at the four-phase contact line of solid-water-oil-air during the droplet transfer from underwater to air. We observed a distinct transition in microdroplet dynamics, characterized by a shift from a scenario dominated by Marangoni forces to one dominated by capillary forces. In the regime dominated by Marangoni forces, the oil microdroplets spread in response to the contact between the water-air interface and the water-oil interface and the emergence of an oil concentration gradient along the water-air interface. The spreading distance along the four-phase contact line follows a power law relationship of $t^{3/4}$, reflecting the balance between Marangoni forces and viscous forces. On the other hand, in the capillarity-dominated regime, the oil microdroplets remain stable at the contact line and after being transferred into the air. We identify the crossover between these two regimes in the parameter space defined by three factors: the approaching velocity of the solid-water-air contact line ($v_{cl}$), the radius of the oil microdroplet ($r_o$), and the radius of the water drop ($r_w$). Furthermore, we demonstrate how to use the four-phase contact line for shaping oil microdroplets using a full liquid process by the contact line lithography. The findings in this study may be also applied to materials synthesis where nanoparticles, microspheres, or nanocapsules are produced by microdroplet-based techniques.</description>

      <title>A transformer-based neural operator for large-eddy simulation of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the large-scale dynamics of three-dimensional (3D) turbulence is challenging for machine learning approaches. This paper introduces a transformer-based neural operator (TNO) to achieve precise and efficient predictions in the large-eddy simulation (LES) of 3D turbulence. The performance of the proposed TNO model is systematically tested and compared with classical sub-grid scale (SGS) models, including the dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM) and the dynamic mixed model(DMM), as well as the original Fourier neural operator (FNO) model, in homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) and free-shear turbulent mixing layer. The numerical simulations comprehensively evaluate the performance of these models on a variety of flow statistics, including the velocity spectrum, the probability density functions (PDFs) of vorticity, the PDFs of velocity increments, the evolution of turbulent kinetic energy, and the iso-surface of the Q-criterion. The results demonstrate that the TNO model exhibits better accuracy than the DSM, DMM, and FNO models in both HIT and the turbulent mixing layer. Moreover, the TNO model has fewer parameters than the FNO model and enables long-term stable predictions, which the FNO model cannot achieve. Besides, the proposed TNO model is much faster than traditional LES with DSM and DMM models, showing great potential in tackling 3D nonlinear engineering problems.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties in Measurements of Bubbly Flows Using Phase-Detection Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of bubbly two-phase flows is challenging due to their turbulent nature and the need for intrusive phase-detection probes. However, accurately characterizing these flows is crucial for safely designing critical infrastructure such as dams and their appurtenant structures. The combination of dual-tip intrusive phase-detection probes with advanced signal processing algorithms enables the assessment of pseudo-instantaneous 1-D velocity time series; for which the limitations are not fully fathomed. In this investigation, we theoretically define four major sources of error, which we quantify using synthetically generated turbulent time series, coupled with the simulated response of a phase detection probe. Our findings show that typical high-velocity flows in hydraulic structures hold up to 15% error in the mean velocity estimations and up to 35% error in the turbulence intensity estimations for the most critical conditions, typically occurring in the proximity of the wall. Based on thousands of simulations, our study provides a novel data-driven tool for the estimation of these baseline errors (bias and uncertainties) in real-word phase-detection probe measurements.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann model for containerless freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a lattice Boltzmann model is proposed to simulate solid-liquid phase change phenomena in multiphase systems. The model couples the thermal properties of the solidification front with the dynamics of the liquid droplet interface, which enables the description of the complex interfacial changes during solid-liquid phase change process. The model treats the interfaces of gas, liquid, and solid phases using the phase field order parameter and the solid fraction. The volume expansion or contraction caused by the change of properties such as density during phase change is represented by adding a mass source term to the continuum equation. The proposed model is first validated by the three-phase Stefan problem and the droplet solidification on a cold surface, and the numerical results are in good agreement with the analytical and experimental results. Then it is used to model the solidification problem with bubbles. The results show that the model is able to accurately capture the effect of bubbles on the solidification process, which is in good agreement with previous work. In addition, a parametric study is carried out to examine the dependence of the sessile droplet solidification on different physical and numerical parameters. The results show that the droplet solidification time increases with increasing droplet volume and contact angle.</description>

      <title>Predicting Energy Budgets in Droplet Dynamics: A Recurrent Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks in fluid mechanics offer an efficient approach for exploring complex flows, including multiphase and free surface flows. The recurrent neural network, particularly the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, proves attractive for learning mappings from transient inputs to dynamic outputs. This study applies LSTM to predict transient and static outputs for fluid flows under surface tension effects. Specifically, we explore two distinct droplet dynamic scenarios: droplets with diverse initial shapes impacting with solid surfaces, as well as the coalescence of two droplets following collision. Using only dimensionless numbers and geometric time series data from numerical simulations, LSTM predicts the energy budget. The marker-and-cell front-tracking methodology combined with a marker-and-cell finite-difference strategy is adopted for simulating the droplet dynamics. Using a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture fed with time series data derived from geometrical parameters, as for example droplet diameter variation, our study shows the accuracy of our approach in predicting energy budgets, as for instance the kinetic, dissipation, and surface energy trends, across a range of Reynolds and Weber numbers in droplet dynamic problems. Finally, a two-phase sequential neural network using only geometric data, which is readily available in experimental settings, is employed to predict the energies and then use them to estimate static parameters, such as the Reynolds and Weber numbers. While our methodology has been primarily validated with simulation data, its adaptability to experimental datasets is a promising avenue for future exploration. We hope that our strategy can be useful for diverse applications, spanning from inkjet printing to combustion engines, where the prediction of energy budgets or dissipation energies is crucial.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Visual Analysis of Blood Flow in Stenoses Using Morphological Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) enabled the simulation of intricate transport processes, including flow in physiological structures, such as blood vessels. While these so-called hemodynamic simulations offer groundbreaking opportunities to solve problems at the clinical forefront, a successful translation of CFD to clinical decision-making is challenging. Hemodynamic simulations are intrinsically complex, time-consuming, and resource-intensive, which conflicts with the time-sensitive nature of clinical workflows and the fact that hospitals usually do not have the necessary resources or infrastructure to support CFD simulations. To address these transfer challenges, we propose a novel visualization system which enables instant flow exploration without performing on-site simulation. To gain insights into the viability of the approach, we focus on hemodynamic simulations of the carotid bifurcation, which is a highly relevant arterial subtree in stroke diagnostics and prevention. We created an initial database of 120 high-resolution carotid bifurcation flow models and developed a set of similarity metrics used to place a new carotid surface model into a neighborhood of simulated cases with the highest geometric similarity. The neighborhood can be immediately explored and the flow fields analyzed. We found that if the artery models are similar enough in the regions of interest, a new simulation leads to coinciding results, allowing the user to circumvent individual flow simulations. We conclude that similarity-based visual analysis is a promising approach toward the usability of CFD in medical practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A framework for numerical evaluation of entropy-conservative volume fluxes in gas flows with internal energies is developed, for use with high-order discretization methods. The novelty of the approach lies in the ability to use arbitrary expressions for the internal degrees of freedom of the constituent gas species. The developed approach is implemented in an open-source discontinuous Galerkin code for solving hyperbolic equations. Numerical simulations are carried out for several model 2-D flows and the results are compared to those obtained with the finite volume-based solver DLR TAU.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Description of the Quasi-Periodically Developed Heat Transfer Regime in Channels with Arrays of Periodic Solid Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present the governing equations for the temperature field upstream and downstream of the periodically developed flow region in channels with arrays of periodic solid structures. From the ansatz that the temperature field in this region is determined by exponentially decaying modes, just like the quasi-developed flow field, we arrive at an eigenvalue problem which governs the allowed temperature modes. This eigenvalue problem is virtually identical to the one for periodically developed heat transfer in isothermal solids, except that the conjugate heat transfer in the solid is effectively taken into account.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional integral representations for solutions of the motion equations for wall-bounded incompressible viscous flows, expressed (implicitly) in terms of distributions of solutions to stochastic differential equations of McKean-Vlasov type, are established by using a perturbation technique. These representations are used to obtain exact random vortex dynamics for wall-bounded viscous flows. Numerical schemes therefore are proposed and the convergence of the numerical schemes for random vortex dynamics with an additional force term is established. Several numerical experiments are carried out for demonstrating the motion of a viscous flow within a thin layer next to the fluid boundary.</description>

      <title>Chemical homogenization for non-mixing reactive interfaces in porous media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Porous media, while ubiquitous across many engineering disciplines, is inherently difficult to characterize due to their innate stochasticity and heterogeneity. The key for predicting porous material behavior comes down to the structuring of its microstructure, where the linkages of microstructural properties to mesoscale effects remain as one of the key questions in unlocking understanding of this class of materials. One proposed method of linking scales comes down to using Minkowski functionals -- geometric morphometers that describe the spatial and topological features of a convex space -- to draw connections from microstructural form to mesoscale features. In this work, chemical equilibrium and kinetics on a microstructure surface were explored, with Minkowski functionals used as the basis for relating microstructural geometry to chemical performance. Using surface CRNs to model chemical behavior -- a novel asynchronous cellular automaton -- linkages were found between the Minkowski functionals and equilibrium equilibrium constant, as well as properties related to the dynamics of the system's reaction quotient.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity analysis of wall-modeled large-eddy simulation for separated turbulent flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we conduct a parametric analysis to evaluate the sensitivities of wall-modeled large-eddy simulation (LES) with respect to subgrid-scale (SGS) models, mesh resolution, wall boundary conditions and mesh anisotropy. While such investigations have been conducted for attached/flat-plate flow configurations, systematic studies specifically targeting turbulent flows with separation are notably sparse. To bridge this gap, our study focuses on the flow over a two-dimensional Gaussian-shaped bump at a moderately high Reynolds number, which involves smooth-body separation of a turbulent boundary layer under pressure-gradient and surface-curvature effects. In the simulations, the no-slip condition at the wall is replaced by three different forms of boundary condition based on the thin boundary layer equations and the mean wall-shear stress from high-fidelity numerical simulation to avoid the additional complexity of modeling the wall-shear stress. Various statistics, including the mean separation bubble size, mean velocity profile, and dissipation from SGS model, are compared and analyzed. The results reveal that capturing the separation bubble strongly depends on the choice of SGS model. While simulations approach grid convergence with resolutions nearing those of wall-resolved LES meshes, above this limit, the LES predictions exhibit intricate sensitivities to mesh resolution. Furthermore, both wall boundary conditions and the anisotropy of mesh cells exert discernible impacts on the turbulent flow predictions, yet the magnitudes of these impacts vary based on the specific SGS model chosen for the simulation.</description>

      <title>Optimum control strategies for maximum thrust production in underwater undulatory swimming</title>

Abstract: Fishes, cetaceans, and many other aquatic vertebrates undulate their bodies to propel themselves through water. Swimming requires an intricate interplay between sensing the environment, making decisions, controlling internal dynamics, and moving the body in interaction with the external medium. Within this sequence of actions initiating locomotion, biological and physical laws manifest complex and nonlinear effects, which does not prevent natural swimmers to demonstrate efficient movement. This raises two complementary questions: how to model this intricacy and how to abstract it for practical swimming. In the context of robotics, the second question is of paramount importance to build efficient artificial swimmers driven by digital signals and mechanics. In this study, we tackle these two questions by leveraging a biomimetic robotic swimmer as a platform for investigating optimal control strategies for thrust generation. Through a combination of machine learning techniques and intuitive models, we identify a control signal that maximizes thrust production. Optimum tail-beat frequency and amplitude result from the subtle interplay between the swimmer's internal dynamics and its interaction with the surrounding fluid. We then propose a practical implementation for autonomous robotic swimmers that requires no prior knowledge of systems or equations. Direct fluid-structure simulations confirms the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed approach. Hence, our findings bridge fluid dynamics, robotics, and biology, providing valuable insights into the physics of aquatic locomotion</description>

      <title>Dual theory of decaying turbulence</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the recently found \cite{migdal2023exact} reduction of decaying turbulence in the Navier-Stokes equation in $3 + 1$ dimensions to a Number Theory problem of finding the statistical limit of the Euler ensemble. We reformulate the Euler ensemble as a Markov chain and show the equivalence of this formulation to the quantum statistical theory of free fermions on a ring, with an external field related to the random fractions of $\pi$. We find the solution of this system in the statistical limit $N\to \infty$ in terms of a complex trajectory (instanton) providing a saddle point to the path integral over the charge density of these fermions. This results in an analytic formula for the observable correlation function of vorticity in wavevector space. This is a full solution of decaying turbulence from the first principle without assumptions, approximations, or fitted parameters. We compute resulting integrals in \Mathematica{} and present effective indexes for the energy decay as a function of time Fig.\ref{fig::NPlot} and the energy spectrum as a function of the wavevector at fixed time Fig.\ref{fig::SPIndex}. In particular, the asymptotic value of the effective index in energy decay $n(\infty) = \frac{7}{4}$, but the universal function $n(t)$ is neither constant nor linear.</description>

      <title>Linearity of the co-moving velocity</title>

Abstract: The co-moving velocity is a new variable in the description of immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. It is the saturation-weighted average over the derivatives of the seepage velocities of the two immiscible fluids with respect to saturation. Based on analysis of relative permeability data and computational modeling, it has been proposed that the co-moving velocity is linear when plotted against the derivative of the average seepage velocity with respect to the saturation, the flow derivative. I show here that it is enough to demand that the co-moving velocity is characterized by an additive parameter in addition to the flow derivative to be linear. This has profound consequences for relative permeability theory as it leads to a differential equation relating the two relative permeabilities describing the flow. I present this equation together with two solutions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Estimation of the Convective Cooling Rate of Photovoltaic Arrays with Various Geometric Configurations: a Physics-Informed Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convective heat transfer is crucial for photovoltaic (PV) systems, as the power generation of PV is sensitive to temperature. The configuration of PV arrays have a significant impact on convective heat transfer by influencing turbulent characteristics. Conventional methods of quantifying the configuration effects are either through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations or empirical methods, which face the challenge of either high computational demand or low accuracy, especially when complex array configurations are considered. This work introduces a novel methodology to quantify the impact of geometric configurations of PV arrays on their convective heat transfer rate in wind field. The methodology combines Physics Informed Machine Learning (PIML) and Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN) to construct a robust PIML-DCNN model to predict convective heat transfer rates. In addition, an innovative loss function, termed Pocket Loss is proposed to enhance the interpretability of the PIML-DCNN model. The model exhibits promising performance, with a relative error of 1.9\% and overall $R^2$ of 0.99 over all CFD cases in estimating the coefficient of convective heat transfer, when compared with full CFD simulations. Therefore, the proposed model has the potential to efficiently guide the configuration design of PV arrays for power generation enhancement in real-world operations.</description>

      <title>Tuning upstream swimming of micro-robots by shape and cargo size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.05694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The navigation of micro-robots in complex flow environments is controlled by rheotaxis, the reorientation with respect to flow gradients. Here we demonstrate how payloads can be exploited to enhance the motion against flows. Using fully resolved hydrodynamic simulations, the mechanisms are described that allow micro-robots of different shapes to reorient upstream. We find that cargo pullers are the fastest at most flow strengths, but pushers feature a non-trivial optimum as a function of the counter flow strength. Moreover, the rheotactic performance can be maximised by tuning the micro-robot shape or cargo size. These results may be used to control micro-swimmer navigation, but they also apply to rheotaxis in microbial ecology and the prevention of bacterial contamination dynamics.</description>

Abstract: It has long been known that weakly nonlinear field theories can have a late-time stationary state that is not the thermal state, but a wave turbulent state with a far-from-equilibrium cascade of energy. We go beyond the existence of the wave turbulent state, studying fluctuations about the wave turbulent state. Specifically, we take a classical field theory with an arbitrary quartic interaction and add dissipation and Gaussian-random forcing. Employing the path integral relation between stochastic classical field theories and quantum field theories, we give a prescription, in terms of Feynman diagrams, for computing correlation functions in this system. We explicitly compute the two-point and four-point functions of the field to next-to-leading order in the coupling. Through an appropriate choice of forcing and dissipation, these correspond to correlation functions in the wave turbulent state. In particular, we derive the kinetic equation to next-to-leading order.</description>

      <title>Wave turbulence and the kinetic equation beyond leading order</title>

Abstract: We derive a scheme by which to solve the Liouville equation perturbatively in the nonlinearity, which we apply to weakly nonlinear classical field theories. Our solution is a variant of the Prigogine diagrammatic method, and is based on an analogy between the Liouville equation in infinite volume and scattering in quantum mechanics, described by the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. The motivation for our work is wave turbulence: a broad class of nonlinear classical field theories are believed to have a stationary turbulent state -- a far-from-equilibrium state, even at weak coupling. Our method provides an efficient way to derive properties of the weak wave turbulent state. A central object in these studies, which is a reduction of the Liouville equation, is the kinetic equation, which governs the occupation numbers of the modes. All properties of wave turbulence to date are based on the kinetic equation found at leading order in the weak nonlinearity. We explicitly obtain the kinetic equation to next-to-leading order.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear wave damping by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability induced turbulence</title>

Abstract: Magnetohydrodynamic kink waves naturally form as a consequence of perturbations to a structured medium, for example transverse oscillations of coronal loops. Linear theory has provided many insights in the evolution of linear oscillations, and results from these models are often applied to infer information about the solar corona from observed wave periods and damping times. However, simulations show that nonlinear kink waves can host the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHi) which subsequently creates turbulence in the loop, dynamics which are beyond linear models. In this paper we investigate the evolution of KHi-induced turbulence on the surface of a flux tube where a non-linear fundamental kink-mode has been excited. We control our numerical experiment so that we induce the KHi without exciting resonant absorption. We find two stages in the KHi turbulence dynamics. In the first stage, we show that the classic model of a KHi turbulent layer growing $\propto t$is applicable. We adapt this model to make accurate predictions for damping of the oscillation and turbulent heating as a consequence of the KHi dynamics. In the second stage, the now dominant turbulent motions are undergoing decay. We find that the classic model of energy decay proportional to $t^{-2}$ approximately holds and provides an accurate prediction of the heating in this phase. Our results show that we can develop simple models for the turbulent evolution of a non-linear kink wave, but the damping profiles produced are distinct from those of linear theory that are commonly used to confront theory and observations.</description>
