      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for microflows: Rarefied Gas Dynamics in Cylinder Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of rarefied gas dynamics is crucial for optimizing flows through microelectromechanical systems, air filtration devices, and shale gas extraction. Traditional methods, such as discrete velocity and direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), demand intensive memory and computation, especially for microflows in non-convex domains. Recently, physics-informed neural networks emerged as a meshless and adaptable alternative for solving non-linear partial differential equations. We trained a PINN using a limited number of DSMC-generated rarefied gas microflows in the transition regime with Knudsen number from 0.1 to 3, incorporating continuity and Cauchy momentum exchange equations in the loss function. The PINN achieved under 2 percent error on these residuals and effectively filtered DSMC intrinsic statistical noise. Predictions remained strong for a tested flow field with Kn equal to 0.7, and showed limited extrapolation performance on a flow field with Kn equal to 5 with a local overshoot of about 20 percent, while maintaining physical consistency. Notably, each DSMC field required about 20 hours on 4 graphics processing units (GPU), while the PINN training took less than 2 hours on one GPU, with evaluations under 2 seconds.</description>

      <title>Solving continuum and rarefied flows using differentiable programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of multi-scale flows remains a formidable challenge. Constructing theoretical models and numerical methods often involves the design and optimization of parameters. While gradient descent methods have been mainly manifested to shine in the wave of deep learning, composable automatic differentiation can advance scientific computing where the application of classical adjoint methods alone is infeasible or cumbersome. Differentiable programming provides a novel paradigm that unifies data structures and control flows and facilitates gradient-based optimization of parameters in a computer program. This paper addresses the notion and implementation of the first solution algorithm for multi-scale flow physics across continuum and rarefied regimes based on differentiable programming. The fully differentiable simulator provides a unified framework for the convergence of computational fluid dynamics and machine learning, i.e., scientific machine learning. Specifically, parameterized mechanical-neural flow models and numerical methods can be constructed for forward physical processes, while the parameters can be trained on the fly with the help of the gradients that are taken through the backward passes of the whole simulation program, a.k.a., end-to-end optimization. As a result, versatile data-driven modeling and simulation can be achieved for physics discovery, surrogate modeling, and simulation acceleration. The fundamentals and implementation of the solution algorithm are demonstrated in detail. Numerical experiments, including forward and inverse problems for hydrodynamic and kinetic equations, are presented to demonstrate the performance of the numerical method. The open-source codes to reproduce the numerical results are available under the MIT license.</description>

      <title>A Parallel Block Preconditioner-Based VIE-FFT Algorithm for Modeling the Electromagnetic Response From Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superior ability of nanostructures to manipulate light has propelled extensive applications in nano-electromagnetic components and devices. Computational electromagnetics plays a critical role in characterizing and optimizing the nanostructures. In this work, a parallel block preconditioner based volume integral equation (VIE)-fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm is proposed to model the electromagnetic response from representative nanostructures. The VIE using uniform Cartesian grids is first built, and then the entire volumetric domain is partitioned into geometric subdomains based on the regularity and topology of the nanostructure. The block diagonal matrix is thus established, whose inverse matrix serves as a preconditioner for the original matrix equation. The resulting linear system is solved by the bi-conjugate gradient stabilized (BiCGSTAB) method with different residual error tolerances in the inner and outer iteration processes; and the FFT algorithm is used to accelerate the matrix-vector product (MVM) operations throughout. Furthermore, because of the independence between the inner processes of solving block matrix equations, the OpenMP framework is empolyed to execute the parallel operations. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed method is effective and reduces both the iteration number and the computational time significantly for the representative nano-electromagnetic problems like the dielectric focusing metasurfaces and the plasmonic solar cells.</description>

      <title>E3C for Computational Homogenization in Nonlinear Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computational homogenization, a fast solution of the microscopic problem can be achieved by model order reduction in combination with hyper-reduction. Such a technique, which has recently been proposed in the context of magnetostatics, is applied to nonlinear mechanics in this work. The method is called 'Empirically Corrected Cluster Cubature' (E3C), as it combines clustering techniques with an empirical correction step to compute a novel type of integration points, which does not form a subset of the finite element integration points. The method is adopted to the challenges arising in nonlinear mechanics and is tested in plane strain for different microstructures (porous and reinforced) in dependence of the material nonlinearity. The results show that hyper-reduction errors &lt; 1% can be achieved with a comparably small number of integration points, which is in the order of the number of modes. A two-scale example is provided and the research code can be downloaded.</description>

      <title>Deciphering boundary layer dynamics in high-Rayleigh-number convection using 3360 GPUs and a high-scaling in-situ workflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent heat and momentum transfer processes due to thermal convection cover many scales and are of great importance for several natural and technical flows. One consequence is that a fully resolved three-dimensional analysis of these turbulent transfers at high Rayleigh numbers, which includes the boundary layers, is possible only using supercomputers. The visualization of these dynamics poses an additional hurdle since the thermal and viscous boundary layers in thermal convection fluctuate strongly. In order to track these fluctuations continuously, data must be tapped at high frequency for visualization, which is difficult to achieve using conventional methods. This paper makes two main contributions in this context. First, it discusses the simulations of turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection up to Rayleigh numbers of $Ra=10^{12}$ computed with NekRS on GPUs. The largest simulation was run on 840 nodes with 3360 GPU on the JUWELS Booster supercomputer. Secondly, an in-situ workflow using ASCENT is presented, which was successfully used to visualize the high-frequency turbulent fluctuations.</description>

      <title>DoMINO: A Decomposable Multi-scale Iterative Neural Operator for Modeling Large Scale Engineering Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations play a critical role in design and development of engineering products and processes. Traditional computational methods, such as CFD, can provide accurate predictions but are computationally expensive, particularly for complex geometries. Several machine learning (ML) models have been proposed in the literature to significantly reduce computation time while maintaining acceptable accuracy. However, ML models often face limitations in terms of accuracy and scalability and depend on significant mesh downsampling, which can negatively affect prediction accuracy and generalization. In this work, we propose a novel ML model architecture, DoMINO (Decomposable Multi-scale Iterative Neural Operator) developed in NVIDIA Modulus to address the various challenges of machine learning based surrogate modeling of engineering simulations. DoMINO is a point cloudbased ML model that uses local geometric information to predict flow fields on discrete points. The DoMINO model is validated for the automotive aerodynamics use case using the DrivAerML dataset. Through our experiments we demonstrate the scalability, performance, accuracy and generalization of our model to both in-distribution and out-of-distribution testing samples. Moreover, the results are analyzed using a range of engineering specific metrics important for validating numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional multiferroic NbPc COF with strong magnetoelectric coupling and room-temperature ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization of two-dimensional multiferroics offers significant potential for nanoscale device functionality. However, type-I two-dimensional multiferroics with strong magnetoelectric coupling, enabling electric field control of spin, remain scarce. In this study, using density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations, we predict that the niobium phthalocyanine covalent organic framework (NbPc COF) monolayer exhibits type-I multiferroic behavior, with a ferroelectric transition occurring above room temperature. Remarkably, the strong magnetoelectric coupling in NbPc COF monolayer arises from the same origin of magnetism and ferroelectricity. Our findings offer flexible pathways for the design and development of organic nanoscale multiferroic devices with broad applications.</description>

      <title>A projection method for particle resampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle discretizations of partial differential equations are advantageous for high-dimensional kinetic models in phase space due to their better scalability than continuum approaches with respect to dimension. Complex processes collectively referred to as \textit{particle noise} hamper long-time simulations with particle methods. One approach to address this problem is particle mesh adaptivity or remapping, known as \textit{particle resampling}. This paper introduces a resampling method that projects particles to and from a (finite element) function space. The method is simple; using standard sparse linear algebra and finite element techniques, it can adapt to almost any set of new particle locations and preserves all moments up to the order of polynomial represented exactly by the continuum function space.
  This work is motivated by the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau model of magnetized plasmas with up to six dimensions, $3X$ in physical space and $3V$ in velocity space, and is developed in the context of a $1X$ + $1V$ Vlasov-Poisson model of Landau damping with logically regular particle and continuum phase space grids. The evaluation codes are publicly available, along with the data and reproducibility artifacts, and developed in the PETSc numerical library.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Eccentric Coaxial Waveguides Filled with Lossy Anisotropic Media via Finite Difference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a finite difference method (FDM) to model the electromagnetic field propagation in eccentric coaxial waveguides filled with lossy uniaxially anisotropic media. The formulation utilizes conformal transformation to map the eccentric circular waveguide into an equivalent concentric one. In the concentric problem, we introduce a novel normalized Helmholtz equation to decouple TM and TE modes, and we solve this non-homogeneous partial differential equation using the finite difference in cylindrical coordinates. The proposed approach was validated against perturbation-based, spectral element-based, and finite-integration-based numerical solutions. The preliminary results show that our solution is superior in computational time. Furthermore, our FDM formulation can be extended with minimal adaptations to model complex media problems, such as metamaterial devices, optical fibers, and geophysical exploration sensors.</description>

Abstract: The growing demand for new microelectronic devices and pharmaceutical advancements has heightened interest in inkjet printing as a means of high-precision manufacturing technique. This study leverages data-driven analyses to optimize droplet generation processes in a drop-on-demand dispensing system. A three-voltage pulse scheme was employed to produce droplets, with high-resolution images captured and processed to extract geometric features of the principal droplet. This resulted in a comprehensive, openly published dataset, along with a detailed, reproducible image processing pipeline. By analyzing this data, we identified key operational parameters and established correlations between inputs and outputs, providing insights into consistent single-droplet generation. These findings offer practical guidelines for controlling droplet morphology and advancing applications in inkjet printing.</description>

      <title>Numerical Modeling of Oxygen Diffusion in Tissue Spheroids Undergoing Fusion Using Functional Representation and Finite Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A three-dimensional cell culture called a spheroid serves as a foundational entity in a wide variety of modern tissue engineering applications, including 3D-bioprinting and preclinical drug testing. Lack of oxygen within tissue spheroids hinders metabolism of cells and eventually leads to cell death. Prevention of necrosis is crucial to success of tissue engineering methods and such prevention requires estimation of cell viability in the spheroid. We propose a novel approach for numerical modeling of diffusion in tissue spheroids during their fusion. The approach is based on numerical solutions of partial differential equations and the application of Functional Representations (FRep) framework for geometric modeling. We present modeling of oxygen diffusion based on meshes derived from the geometry of fusing spheroids, a method for selecting optimal spheroid size, and several statistics for estimating cellular viability. Our findings provide insights into oxygen diffusion in three-dimensional cell cultures thus improving the robustness of biotechnological methods that employ tissue spheroids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) is a state-of-the-art, near-optimal quantum algorithm that can be used for matrix inversion. The QSVT circuit is parameterized by a sequence of angles that must be pre-calculated classically, with the number of angles increasing as the matrix condition number grows. Computing QSVT angles for ill-conditioned problems is a numerically challenging task. We propose a numerical technique for estimating QSVT angles for large condition numbers. This technique allows one to avoid expensive numerical computations of QSVT angles and to emulate QSVT circuits for solving ill-conditioned problems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Point Hermite Methods for the N-Body Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical integration methods are central to the study of self-gravitating systems, particularly those comprised of many bodies or otherwise beyond the reach of analytical methods. Predictor-corrector schemes, both multi-step methods and those based on 2-point Hermite interpolation, have found great success in the simulation of star clusters and other collisional systems. Higher-order methods, such as those based on Gaussian quadratures and Richardson extrapolation, have also proven popular for high-accuracy integrations of few-body systems, particularly those that may undergo close encounters. This work presents a family of high-order schemes based on multi-point Hermite interpolation. When applied as a multi-step multi-derivative schemes, these can be seen as generalizing both Adams-Bashforth-Moulton methods and 2-point Hermite methods; I present results for the 6th-, 9th-, and 12th-order 3-point schemes applied in this manner using variable time steps. In a cluster-like test problem, the 3-point 6th-order predictor-corrector scheme matches or outperforms the standard 2-point 4th-order Hermite scheme at negligible O(N) cost. I also present a number of high-order time-symmetric schemes up to 18th order, which have the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of long-duration simulations.</description>
