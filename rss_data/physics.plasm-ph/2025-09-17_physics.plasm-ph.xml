      <title>Shock wave bending around a dusty plasma void</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on experimental observations of the bending of a dust acoustic shock wave around a dust void region. This phenomenon occurs as a planar shock wavefront encounters a compressible obstacle in the form of a void whose size is larger than the wavelength of the wave. As they collide, the central portion of the wavefront, that is the first to touch the void, is blocked while the rest of the front continues to propagate, resulting in an inward bending of the shock wave. The bent shock wave eventually collapses, leading to the transient trapping of dust particles in the void. Subsequently, a Coulomb explosion of the trapped particles generates a bow shock. The experiments have been carried out in a DC glow discharge plasma, where the shock wave and the void are simultaneously created as self-excited modes of a three-dimensional dust cloud. The salient features of this phenomenon are reproduced in molecular dynamics simulations, which provide valuable insights into the underlying dynamics of this interaction.</description>

      <title>Validation of the GFS model for Gyrokinetic Stability of NSTX Pedestal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a large database validation of the Gyro Fluid System (GFS) model for linear gyrokinetic stability for high-mode (H-mode) edge transport barrier conditions in the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) tokamak. The database of linear stability calculations with the CGYRO gyrokinetic code was produced using plasma profile measurements from NSTX discharges to identify kinetic ballooning modes (KBM), trapped electron modes (TEM), and micro-tearing modes (MTM) that limit the pressure profile gradient in the H-mode barrier. A novel Bayesian optimization approach determines optimal resolution parameters for GFS specifically for spherical tokamak pedestal conditions. Our results demonstrate that GFS, with optimized resolution, can achieve accurate linear stability analysis in NSTX pedestal conditions for reduced resolution compared to CGYRO. GFS can accurately find the KBM, TEM, and MTM instability branches. Parametric analysis reveals that GFS accuracy in this extreme pedestal parameter range is degraded for low magnetic shear and near the separatrix conditions. These findings establish GFS as a fast linear eigenmode solver for spherical tokamak pedestal gyrokinetic stability and demonstrate a systematic methodology for determining the optimum resolution settings.</description>

      <title>FusionMAE: large-scale pretrained model to optimize and simplify diagnostic and control of fusion plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In magnetically confined fusion device, the complex, multiscale, and nonlinear dynamics of plasmas necessitate the integration of extensive diagnostic systems to effectively monitor and control plasma behaviour. The complexity and uncertainty arising from these extensive systems and their tangled interrelations has long posed a significant obstacle to the acceleration of fusion energy development. In this work, a large-scale model, fusion masked auto-encoder (FusionMAE) is pre-trained to compress the information from 88 diagnostic signals into a concrete embedding, to provide a unified interface between diagnostic systems and control actuators. Two mechanisms are proposed to ensure a meaningful embedding: compression-reduction and missing-signal reconstruction. Upon completion of pre-training, the model acquires the capability for 'virtual backup diagnosis', enabling the inference of missing diagnostic data with 96.7% reliability. Furthermore, the model demonstrates three emergent capabilities: automatic data analysis, universal control-diagnosis interface, and enhancement of control performance on multiple tasks. This work pioneers large-scale AI model integration in fusion energy, demonstrating how pre-trained embeddings can simplify the system interface, reducing necessary diagnostic systems and optimize operation performance for future fusion reactors.</description>

      <title>Runaway electron interactions with whistler waves in tokamak plasmas: energy-dependent transport scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant interactions between high energy runaway electrons (REs) and whistler waves are a promising mechanism for RE mitigation in tokamak plasmas. While prior studies have largely relied on quasi-linear diffusion models in simplified geometries, we present a first-principles-informed framework that models RE-whistler interactions in a 3D tokamak equilibrium. This is achieved by coupling AORSA, which computes whistler eigenmodes for a given tokamak plasma equilibrium, and KORC, a kinetic orbit code that tracks full orbit RE trajectories in prescribed wave fields. Our results demonstrate that REs undergo scattering to large pitch angles and exhibit anomalous diffusion in both pitch-angle and kinetic energy space. Crucially, we observe a transition between diffusive, sub-diffusive, and super-diffusive transport regimes as a function of initial RE energy - an effect not captured by existing quasi-linear models. This anomalous transport behavior represents a significant advancement in understanding RE dynamics in the presence of wave - particle interactions. By identifying the conditions under which anomalous diffusion arises, this work lays the theoretical foundation for designing targeted, wave-based mitigation strategies in future tokamak experiments.</description>

      <title>The impact of Alfvenic shear flow on magnetic reconnection and turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental and omnipresent energy conversion process in plasma physics. Novel observations of fields and particles from Parker Solar Probe (PSP) have shown the absence of reconnection in a large number of current sheets in the near-Sun solar wind. Using near-Sun observations from PSP Encounters 4 to 11 (Jan 2020 to March 2022), we investigate whether reconnection onset might be suppressed by velocity shear. We compare estimates of the tearing mode growth rate in the presence of shear flow for time periods identified as containing reconnecting current sheets versus non-reconnecting times, finding systematically larger growth rates for reconnection periods. Upon examination of the parameters associated with reconnection onset, we find that 85% of the reconnection events are embedded in slow, non-Alfvenic wind streams. We compare with fast, slow non-Alfvenic, and slow Alfvenic streams, finding that the growth rate is suppressed in highly Alfvenic fast and slow wind and reconnection is not seen in these wind types, as would be expected from our theoretical expressions. These wind streams have strong Alfvenic} flow shear, consistent with the idea of reconnection suppression by such flows. This could help explain the frequent absence of reconnection events in the highly Alfvenic, near-Sun solar wind observed by PSP. Finally, we find a steepening of both the trace and magnitude magnetic field spectra within reconnection periods in comparison to ambient wind. We tie this to the dynamics of relatively balanced turbulence within these reconnection periods and the potential generation of compressible fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Virtual states and exponential decay in small-scale dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the Kazantsev theory of small-scale dynamo generation at small Prandtl numbers near the generation threshold and restore the concordance between the theory and numerical simulations: the theory predicted a power-law decay below the threshold, while simulations demonstrate exponential decay. We show that the exponential decay is temporary and owes its existence to the flattening of the velocity correlator at large scales. This effect corresponds to the existence of a long-living virtual level in the corresponding Schrodinger type equation. We also find the critical Reynolds number and the increment of growth/decay above and under the threshold; we express them in terms of the quantitative characteristic properties of the velocity correlator, which makes it possible to compare the results with the data of different simulations.</description>

      <title>Ionization and temperature measurements in warm dense copper using x-ray absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We detail experimental results inferring ionization and temperature for warm dense copper plasmas at several times solid density (15 to 25 g/cm$^3$) and temperatures of 10 to 21 eV. Experiments performed at the OMEGA Laser Facility generate uniform warm dense matter conditions via symmetric shock compression of a buried copper layer. The plasma is probed with a laser-generated x-ray source to collect the K-shell x-ray absorption spectrum. Fitting bound-bound absorption contributions from constituent charge states of copper provides an estimated $\overline{Z}$ of approximately 4 to 7 for these warm dense copper plasmas. We find that these partially ionized plasmas have K-edge shifts of 12 to 30 eV and bound-bound resonance 1s$\rightarrow$3p absorption shifts of 4 to 26 eV with respect to the cold K-edge. This study provides necessary experimental data to improve ionization and opacity models in the warm dense matter regime.</description>

      <title>Driven Collisionless Reconnection of Force-free Flux Tubes: From Onset to Coalescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the onset of driven collisionless reconnection and plasmoid formation in a magnetically dominated pair plasma, using 2D Particle-in-Cell simulations. Two force-free flux tubes of radius $R$ are initially pushed together with a prescribed velocity, forming a current sheet whose width shrinks until reconnection sets in. % Even in our largest simulation with $R\approx 1600$ plasma skin depths, the sheet thickness at reconnection onset is comparable to the skin depth. Plasmoid chains develop when the sheet length-to-width aspect ratio $A\gtrsim30$. In the strongly magnetized limit, the onset of reconnection occurs in roughly 2--6 light-crossing times, depending on the imposed driving timescale, which controls the duration of the thinning phase. In the subsequent nonlinear merging phase, the evolution becomes effectively independent of the initially imposed velocity, leading to magnetic-energy dissipation consistent with a normalized reconnection rate $\sim 0.1$. Our results have important implications for explosive release of magnetic energy in magnetospheres of astrophysical compact objects and their surroundings.</description>

      <title>Propagation and collisionless damping of topologically-protected surface plasma waves in non-uniformly magnetized plasma columns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent theoretical studies revealed the existence of topologically-protected surface plasma waves (TSPWs) in cold magnetized plasmas assumed uniform along the direction of a uniaxial magnetic field. Reflections-free propagation of the TSPWs along arbitrarily-shaped plasma boundaries oriented perpendicularly to the magnetic field was shown to be preserved even when their collisionless damping by localized upper-hybrid resonances was accounted for. Here we extend this theory to the realistic case of three-dimensional magnetic field produced by finite-sized magnetic coils. We demonstrate that when TSPWs are launched in the direction of the decreasing magnetic field, they are collisionlessly absorbed within a highly localized (evanescent) region as they propagate away from the magnetic coil. We show that the resulting wave reflection can be negligible -- in clear contrast with conventional wave reflection from the corresponding evanescence regions.</description>

      <title>Gyrotropy-Induced Symmetry Breaking of Erosion Hot Spots on Antenna Limiters during High-Power Tokamak RF Operation: Mechanisms and Mitigation Strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies (ICRF) heating is essential for creating plasma in next-generation fusion devices. ICRF antennas often produce hot spots, reducing reliability, material survivability, and overall plasma performance. We show that toroidal and poloidal asymmetries in these hot spots arise intrinsically from the wave physics' gyrotropy, and that they can be compensated for either by controlling the poloidal phasing or by modifying the limiter shapes, reducing total erosion by a factor $\sim$2 compared to state-of-the-art designs.</description>

      <title>The impact of kinetic and global effects on ballooning 2nd stable pedestals of conventional and high aspect ratio tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The EPED model [P.B. Snyder et al 2011 Nucl. Fusion 51 103016] had success in describing type-I ELM and QH-mode pedestals in conventional tokamaks, by combining kinetic ballooning mode (KBM) and peeling-ballooning (PB) constraints. Within EPED, the KBM constraint is usually approximated by the ideal ballooning mode (IBM) stability threshold. It has been noted that quantitative differences between local ideal MHD and gyro-kinetic (GK) ballooning stability can be larger at low aspect ratio. KBM critical pedestals are consistent with observation in initial studies on conventional and spherical tokamaks. In this work, the application of a reduced model for the calculation of the kinetic ballooning stability boundary is presented based on a novel and newly developed Gyro-Fluid System (GFS) code [G.M. Staebler et al 2023 Phys. Plasmas 30 102501]. GFS is observed to capture KBMs in DIII-D as well as the NSTX(-U) pedestals, opening the route for the integration of this model into EPED. Finally, high-n global ballooning modes are observed to limit local 2nd stability access and thus provide a transport mechanism that constrains the width evolution with beta_p,ped. The high-n global ballooning stability is approximated by its ideal MHD analogue using ELITE. It is shown that nearly local high-n with k_y*rho_s~1/2 modes can provide a proxy for the critical beta_p,ped when 2nd stable access exists on DIII-D plasmas. The use of GFS and ELITE scaling in EPED provided improved agreement in comparison to EPED1 with DIII-D pedestal data.</description>

      <title>On the use of the Axelrod formula for thermal electron collisions in Astrophysical Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Axelrod approximation is widely used in astrophysical modelling codes to evaluate electron-impact excitation effective collision strengths for forbidden transitions. Approximate methods such as this are a necessity for many heavy elements with open shells where collisional data is either non existent or sparse as the use of more robust methods prove prohibitively expensive. Atomic data for such forbidden transitions are essential for producing full collisional radiative models that do not assume Local-Thermodynamic-Equilibrium (LTE). In this short work we repeat the optimization of the simple Axelrod formula for a large number of $R$-matrix data sets, ranging from Fe and Ni to the first r-process peak elements of Sr, Y and Zr, to higher Z systems Te, W, Pt and Au. We show that the approximate treatment of forbidden transitions can be a significant source of inaccuracy in such collisional radiative models. We find a large variance of the optimized coefficients for differing systems and charge states, although some general trends can be seen based on the orbital structure of the ground-state-configurations. These trends could potentially inform better estimates for future calculations for elements where $R$-matrix data is not available.</description>
