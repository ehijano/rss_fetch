      <title>Combination of operational modal analysis algorithms to identify modal parameters of an actual centrifugal compressor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The novelty of the current work is precisely to propose a statistical procedure to combine estimates of the modal parameters provided by any set of Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) algorithms so as to avoid preference for a particular one and also to derive an approximate joint probability distribution of the modal parameters, from which engineering statistics of interest such as mean value and variance are readily provided. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is assessed considering measured data from an actual centrifugal compressor. The statistics obtained for both forward and backward modal parameters are finally compared against modal parameters identified during standard stability verification testing (SVT) of centrifugal compressors prior to shipment, using classical Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA) algorithms. The current work demonstrates that combination of OMA algorithms can provide quite accurate estimates for both the modal parameters and the associated uncertainties with low computational costs.</description>

      <title>Deformation-Recovery Diffusion Model (DRDM): Instance Deformation for Image Manipulation and Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In medical imaging, the diffusion models have shown great potential in synthetic image generation tasks. However, these models often struggle with the interpretable connections between the generated and existing images and could create illusions. To address these challenges, our research proposes a novel diffusion-based generative model based on deformation diffusion and recovery. This model, named Deformation-Recovery Diffusion Model (DRDM), diverges from traditional score/intensity and latent feature-based approaches, emphasizing morphological changes through deformation fields rather than direct image synthesis. This is achieved by introducing a topological-preserving deformation field generation method, which randomly samples and integrates a set of multi-scale Deformation Vector Fields (DVF). DRDM is trained to learn to recover unreasonable deformation components, thereby restoring each randomly deformed image to a realistic distribution. These innovations facilitate the generation of diverse and anatomically plausible deformations, enhancing data augmentation and synthesis for further analysis in downstream tasks, such as few-shot learning and image registration. Experimental results in cardiac MRI and pulmonary CT show DRDM is capable of creating diverse, large (over 10% image size deformation scale), and high-quality (negative ratio of folding rate is lower than 1%) deformation fields. The further experimental results in downstream tasks, 2D image segmentation and 3D image registration, indicate significant improvements resulting from DRDM, showcasing the potential of our model to advance image manipulation and synthesis in medical imaging and beyond.

      <title>INSIGHT: Universal Neural Simulator for Analog Circuits Harnessing Autoregressive Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog front-end design heavily relies on specialized human expertise and costly trial-and-error simulations, which motivated many prior works on analog design automation. However, efficient and effective exploration of the vast and complex design space remains constrained by the time-consuming nature of CPU-based SPICE simulations, making effective design automation a challenging endeavor. In this paper, we introduce INSIGHT, a GPU-powered, technology-independent, effective universal neural simulator in the analog front-end design automation loop. INSIGHT accurately predicts the performance metrics of analog circuits across various technology nodes, significantly reducing inference time. Notably, its autoregressive capabilities enable INSIGHT to accurately predict simulation-costly critical transient specifications leveraging less expensive performance metric information. The low cost and high fidelity feature make INSIGHT a good substitute for standard simulators in analog front-end optimization frameworks. INSIGHT is compatible with any optimization framework, facilitating enhanced design space exploration for sample efficiency through sophisticated offline learning and adaptation techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that INSIGHT-M, a model-based batch reinforcement learning framework that leverages INSIGHT for analog sizing, achieves at least 50X improvement in sample efficiency across circuits. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first use of autoregressive transformers in analog front-end design.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Geometric Operators to Support Surrogate, Dimension Reduction and Generative Models for Engineering Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a set of physics-informed geometric operators (GOs) to enrich the geometric data provided for training surrogate/discriminative models, dimension reduction, and generative models, typically employed for performance prediction, dimension reduction, and creating data-driven parameterisations, respectively. However, as both the input and output streams of these models consist of low-level shape representations, they often fail to capture shape characteristics essential for performance analyses. Therefore, the proposed GOs exploit the differential and integral properties of shapes--accessed through Fourier descriptors, curvature integrals, geometric moments, and their invariants--to infuse high-level intrinsic geometric information and physics into the feature vector used for training, even when employing simple model architectures or low-level parametric descriptions. We showed that for surrogate modelling, along with the inclusion of the notion of physics, GOs enact regularisation to reduce over-fitting and enhance generalisation to new, unseen designs. Furthermore, through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that for dimension reduction and generative models, incorporating the proposed GOs enriches the training data with compact global and local geometric features. This significantly enhances the quality of the resulting latent space, thereby facilitating the generation of valid and diverse designs. Lastly, we also show that GOs can enable learning parametric sensitivities to a great extent. Consequently, these enhancements accelerate the convergence rate of shape optimisers towards optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>Boosting Bitcoin Minute Trend Prediction Using the Separation Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the trend of Bitcoin, a highly volatile cryptocurrency, remains a challenging task. Accurate forecasting holds immense potential for investors and market participants dealing with High Frequency Trading systems. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the significance of using a systematic approach toward selecting informative observations for enhancing Bitcoin minute trend prediction. While a multitude of data collection methods exist, a crucial barrier remains: efficiently selecting the most informative data for building powerful prediction models. This study tackles this challenge head-on by introducing the Separation Index, a groundbreaking tool for fast and effective data (feature) subset selection. The Separation Index operates by measuring the improvement in class separability (i.e. upward vs. downward trends) with each added feature set. This innovative metric guides the creation of a highly informative dataset, maximizing the model's ability to differentiate between price movements. Our research demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach, achieving unprecedented accuracy in minute-scale Bitcoin trend prediction, surpassing the performance of previous studies. This significant advancement paves the way for a new era of data-driven decision-making in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency markets.</description>

      <title>Trade When Opportunity Comes: Price Movement Forecasting via Locality-Aware Attention and Iterative Refinement Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.11972v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Price movement forecasting, aimed at predicting financial asset trends based on current market information, has achieved promising advancements through machine learning (ML) methods. Most existing ML methods, however, struggle with the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio and stochastic nature of financial data, often mistaking noises for real trading signals without careful selection of potentially profitable samples. To address this issue, we propose LARA, a novel price movement forecasting framework with two main components: Locality-Aware Attention (LA-Attention) and Iterative Refinement Labeling (RA-Labeling). (1) LA-Attention, enhanced by metric learning techniques, automatically extracts the potentially profitable samples through masked attention scheme and task-specific distance metrics. (2) RA-Labeling further iteratively refines the noisy labels of potentially profitable samples, and combines the learned predictors robust to the unseen and noisy samples. In a set of experiments on three real-world financial markets: stocks, cryptocurrencies, and ETFs, LARA significantly outperforms several machine learning based methods on the Qlib quantitative investment platform. Extensive ablation studies confirm LARA's superior ability in capturing more reliable trading opportunities.</description>

      <title>The Dark Side of NFTs: A Large-Scale Empirical Study of Wash Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) have seen significant growth since they first captured public attention in 2021. However, the NFT market is plagued by fake transactions and economic bubbles, e.g., NFT wash trading. Wash trading typically refers to a transaction involving the same person or two colluding individuals, and has become a major threat to the NFT ecosystem. Previous studies only detect NFT wash trading from the financial aspect, while the real-world wash trading cases are much more complicated (e.g., not aiming at inflating the market value). There is still a lack of multi-dimension analysis to better understand NFT wash trading. Therefore, we present the most comprehensive study of NFT wash trading, analyzing 8,717,031 transfer events and 3,830,141 sale events from 2,701,883 NFTs. We first optimize the dataset collected via the OpenSea API. Next, we identify three types of NFT wash trading and propose identification algorithms. Our experimental results reveal 824 transfer events and 5,330 sale events (accounting for a total of \$8,857,070.41) and 370 address pairs related to NFT wash trading behaviors, causing a minimum loss of \$3,965,247.13. Furthermore, we provide insights from six aspects, i.e., marketplace design, profitability, NFT project design, payment token, user behavior, and NFT ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Scattering-Based Characteristic Mode Theory for Structures in Arbitrary Background: Computation, Benchmarks, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for computing substructure characteristic modes. This method leverages electromagnetic scattering matrices and spherical wave expansion to directly decompose electromagnetic fields. Unlike conventional methods that rely on the impedance matrix generated by the method of moments (MoM), our technique simplifies the problem into a small-scale ordinary eigenvalue problem, improving numerical dynamics and computational efficiency. We have developed analytical substructure characteristic mode solutions for a scenario involving two spheres, which can serve as benchmarks for evaluating other numerical solvers. A key advantage of our method is its independence from specific MoM frameworks, allowing for the use of various numerical methods. This flexibility paves the way for substructure characteristic mode decomposition to become a universal frequency-domain technique.</description>
