      <title>Dirac and Majorana Fermions in the Anti-de Sitter spacetime with Tachyonic approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the Dirac equation in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime upon the comformally flat spacetime. We also apply the analysis to the Majorana condition. The analytical solutions are neat. We observe that Dirac fermions and Majorana fermions behave differently in AdS background. The wavefunction of tachyonic neutrinos leaves an track, clumping in a special flatland, embedded in the curved 3+1-D AdS spacetime. Besides, there emerges a boundary, and neutrinos also oscillate.</description>

      <title>The AdS Veneziano amplitude at small curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the AdS Veneziano amplitude for type IIB gluon scattering in $AdS_5 \times S^3$ to all orders in $\alpha'$ in a small curvature expansion. This is achieved by combining a dispersion relation in the dual $4d$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT with an ansatz for the amplitude as a worldsheet integral in terms of multiple polylogarithms. The first curvature correction is fully fixed in this way and satisfies consistency checks in the high energy limit, the low energy expansion as previously fixed using supersymmetric localisation, and for the energy of massive string operators, which we independently compute using a semiclassical expansion. We also combine localisation with this first curvature correction to fix the unprotected $D^4F^4$ correction to the amplitude at finite curvature.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos in the sparse SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a system of $N$ Majorana fermions with random interactions and strongly chaotic dynamics, which at low energy admits a holographically dual description as two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. Hence the SYK model provides a toy model of quantum gravity that might be feasible to simulate with near-term quantum hardware. Motivated by the goal of reducing the resources needed for such a simulation, we study a sparsified version of the SYK model, in which interaction terms are deleted with probability $1{-p}$. Specifically, we compute numerically the spectral form factor (SFF, the Fourier transform of the Hamiltonian's eigenvalue pair correlation function) and the nearest-neighbor eigenvalue gap ratio $r$ (characterizing the distribution of gaps between consecutive eigenvalues). We find that when $p$ is greater than a transition value $p_1$, which scales as $1/N^3$, both the SFF and $r$ match the values attained by the full unsparsified model and with expectations from random matrix theory (RMT). But for $p&lt;p_1$, deviations from unsparsified SYK and RMT occur, indicating a breakdown of holography in the highly sparsified regime. Below an even smaller value $p_2$, which also scales as $1/N^3$, even the spacing of consecutive eigenvalues differs from RMT values, signaling a complete breakdown of spectral rigidity. Our results cast doubt on the holographic interpretation of very highly sparsified SYK models obtained via machine learning using teleportation infidelity as a loss function.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, Soft Modes, and Celestial CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the calculation of vacuum entanglement entropy in free Maxwell theory in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Weyl invariance allows for this theory to be embedded as a patch inside the Einstein static universe. We use conformal inversions to extend the conformal primary solutions of the equations of motion labelled by a boost-weight $\Delta = 1 + i\lambda$ to an inverted Minkowski patch centered at spacelike infinity of the original patch. For $\lambda \neq 0$ these solutions admit an expansion in terms of wavefunctions supported in the (future) Milne wedges of the original and inverted Minkowski patches, that diagonalize the respective Milne times. The Minkowski vacuum can then be described as a thermofield double state on these two Milne wedges. We characterize the soft sectors of $\lambda = 0$ modes supported in the two Milne wedges. Upon reinterpreting the non-pure gauge $\lambda = 0$ wavefunctions as sourced by image charges in the inverse Minkowski patch, we construct an appropriate entangling constraint in the Minkowski theory, thereby characterizing the physical state space. We show that the edge mode contribution to the vacuum entanglement entropy is due to correlations between the soft charges of the two Milne patches, or equivalently non-trivial conformally soft mode configurations at the entangling surface.</description>

      <title>On scrambling, tomperature and superdiffusion in de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates basic properties of the de Sitter static patch using simple two-point functions in the probe approximation. We find that de Sitter equilibrates in a superdiffusive manner, unlike most physical systems which equilibrate diffusively. We also examine the scrambling time. In de Sitter, the two-point functions of free fields do not decay for sometime because quanta can reflect off the pole of the static patch. This suggests a minimum scrambling time of the order $\log(1/G_N)$, even for perturbations introduced on the stretched horizon, indicating fast scrambling inside de Sitter static patch. We also discuss the interplay between thermodynamic temperature and inverse correlation time, sometimes called "tomperature".</description>

      <title>Higgs radial modes and the UV completion of non-linear sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated non-linear sigma models with cosets G/H represented by $SU(N)\times SU(N)/SU(N)$, $SU(N)/SO(N)$, and $SU(2N)/USp(2N)$. These models exhibit a transition to a strongly coupled regime above a threshold energy scale $\Lambda^*$, where the effective field theory approach breaks down. To address this issue, we introduced the so called Higgs radial modes within the Linear Sigma Model, crucial for restoring perturbative unitarity. Analyzing the $N&gt;2$ case, we first notice that all radial modes coming from the most general irreducible representation of G are necessary for unitarizing scattering amplitudes and ensuring the weakly coupled nature of the theory. The phenomenology behind these extra radial modes recalls the physics of the Higgs in the electroweak sector of the Standard Model. In the case of a model describing electroweak symmetry breaking with a more complex pattern, despite strict constraints from electroweak precision tests, these modes could stabilize the Higgs potential and be a possible solution for the vacuum instability issue.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Unorientable JT Gravity and Matrix Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an orthogonal polynomial formulation of the double scaling limit of multicritical matrix models in the $\beta=1$ Dyson-Wigner class. They capture the physics of 2D quantum gravity coupled to minimal matter on unorientable surfaces, otherwise called unoriented minimal strings. We derive a formula for the density of states valid to all orders in perturbation theory. We show how to define an interpolation between the multicritical models and that a certain interpolation among an infinite number of them provides an alternative definition of unoriented JT gravity. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our formulation.</description>

      <title>A (2+1)-Dimensional Domain Wall at One-Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the domain wall in the (2+1)-dimensional $\phi^4$ double well model, created by extending the $\phi^4$ kink in an additional infinite direction. Classically, the tension is $m^3/3\lambda$ where $\lambda$ is the coupling and $m$ is the meson mass. At order $O(\lambda^0)$ all ultraviolet divergences can be removed by normal ordering, less trivial divergences arrive only at the next order. This allows us to easily quantize the domain wall, working at order $O(\lambda^0)$. We calculate the leading quantum correction to its tension as a two-dimensional integral over a function which is determined analytically. This integral is performed numerically, resulting in $-0.0866m^2$. We also find, at this order, the excitation spectrum.</description>

      <title>Generalized Free Conformal Field Theories at Infinite Temperature -- In memory of Iwasaki-sensei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can space-time symmetries such as Lorentz, dilatation, or conformal symmetry be recovered at infinite temperature? To address this question, we study correlation functions of generalized free conformal field theories (a.k.a free holographic theories in thermal AdS space-time) at infinite temperature. We show that they are broken at the leading order in bosonic correlation functions, but a non-trivial scaling symmetry may emerge.</description>

      <title>Developments in quasihydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At its core, hydrodynamics is a many-body low-energy effective theory for the long-wavelength, long-timescale dynamics of conserved charges in systems close to thermodynamic equilibrium. It has a wide range of applications spanning from nuclear physics, astrophysics, cosmology, and more recently strongly-interacting electronic phases of matter. In solid-state systems, however, symmetries are often only approximate, and softly broken by the presence of the lattice, impurities, and defects, or because the symmetry is accidental. Therefore, the hydrodynamic regime must be expanded to include weak non-conservation effects, which lead to a theory known as quasihydrodynamics. In this thesis we make progress in understanding the theory of (quasi) hydrodynamics, with a specific focus on applications to condensed matter systems and their holographic description.</description>

      <title>BRST construction for infinite spin field on $AdS_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the first class constraints that describe the infinite spin irreducible $4D$ Poincar\'{e} group representation in flat space to new first class constraints in $AdS_4$ space. The constraints are realized as operators acting in Fock space spanned by the creation and annihilation operators with two-component spinor indices. As a result, we obtain a new closed gauge algebra on $AdS_4$ with the known flat space limit. Using this gauge algebra, we construct the BRST charge and derive the Lagrangian and gauge transformations for free bosonic infinite spin field theory in $AdS_4$ space.</description>

      <title>Large N instantons, BPS states, and the replica limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relation between large N instantons and conventional instantons, focusing on matrix models and topological strings. We show that the resurgent properties of the perturbative series at fixed but arbitrary N, including the replica limit N = 0, can be obtained from large N instantons. In the case of topological strings, it has been conjectured that the resurgent structure encoded by large N instantons is closely related to the spectrum of BPS states. We give direct evidence for this connection in the case of Seiberg-Witten theory and other topological string models, and we show in detail how the resurgent properties at fixed N follow from the large N theory, and therefore can be used to obtain information on BPS invariants.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to study the three-dimensional $\mathcal N=2$ supersymmetric dual gauge theories on $S_b^3/\mathbb{Z}_r$ in the context of the gauge/YBE correspondence. We consider hyperbolic hypergeometric integral identities acquired via the equality of supersymmetric lens partition functions as solutions to the decoration transformation and the flipping relation in statistical mechanics. The solutions of those transformations aim at investigating various decorated lattice models possessing the Boltzmann weights of integrable Ising-like models obtained via the gauge/YBE correspondence. We also constructed The Bailey pairs for the decoration transformation and the flipping relation.</description>

      <title>An On-Shell Derivation of the Soft Effective Action in Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the soft effective action in $(d+2)$-dimensional abelian gauge theories from the on-shell action obeying Neumann boundary conditions at timelike and null infinity and Dirichlet boundary conditions at spatial infinity. This allows us to identify the on-shell degrees of freedom on the boundary with the soft modes living on the celestial sphere. Following the work of Donnelly and Wall, this suggests that we can interpret soft modes as entanglement edge modes on the celestial sphere and study entanglement properties of soft modes in abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Manifest color-kinematics duality for point particles interacting with self-dual fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find that point particles interacting with a self-dual Yang-Mills field and self-dual gravity manifestly satisfy color-kinematics duality at the level of action. In a similar way color-kinematics duality also holds for a scalar field minimally coupled to a self-dual Yang-Mills field and self-dual gravity. By applying the appropriate limiting procedure to these scalar field theories, we reproduce point particle theories we started from. This allows us to connect worldline color-kinematics duality to amplitude color-kinematics duality in field theory. Considering that point particles act as sources of classical solutions, our results may be regarded as a step towards establishing a precise relation between the amplitude and the classical double copies in the self-dual sector. Finally, we briefly mention that the extension of this discussion to the higher-spin case suggests that scalar point particles cannot interact with chiral higher-spin fields.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Edge Modes and Entanglement in Maxwell Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work on black hole partition functions and entanglement entropy suggests the existence of "edge" degrees of freedom living on the (stretched) horizon. We identify a local and "shrinkable" boundary condition on the stretched horizon that gives rise to such degrees of freedom. They can be interpreted as the Goldstone bosons of gauge transformations supported on the boundary, with the electric field component normal to the boundary as their symplectic conjugate. Applying the covariant phase space formalism for manifolds with boundary, we show that both the symplectic form and Hamiltonian exhibit a bulk-edge split. We then show that the thermal edge partition function is that of a codimension-two ghost compact scalar living on the horizon. In the context of a de Sitter static patch, this agrees with the edge partition functions found by Anninos et al. in arbitrary dimensions. It also yields a 4D entanglement entropy consistent with the conformal anomaly. Generalizing to Proca theory, we find that the prescription of Donnelly and Wall reproduces existing results for its edge partition function, while its classical phase space does not exhibit a bulk-edge split.</description>

      <title>Conformal Perturbation Theory and Tachyon-Dilaton Eschatology via String Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze deformations of two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) from the perspective of classical bosonic closed string field theory (SFT). The latter can be viewed as a version of Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) improved conformal perturbation theory, where the renormalization scheme is defined through the choice of string vertices in the construction of SFT. Furthermore, the CFT data at the RG fixed point can be recovered from the spectrum and amplitudes of string field fluctuations. As applications, we construct the Horowitz-Polchinski "string star" solution in SFT, and a solution of tachyon-dilaton condensation that deforms the noncompact boson to minimal models by creating a pair of "Runkel-Watts walls".</description>

      <title>Schur line defect correlators and giant graviton expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Schur line defect correlators in four dimensional $\mathcal N=4$ $U(N)$ SYM and their giant graviton expansion encoding finite $N$ corrections to the large $N$ limit. We compute in closed form the single giant graviton contribution to correlators with general insertions of $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS charged Wilson lines. For the 2-point function with fundamental and anti-fundamental Wilson lines, we match the result from fluctuations of two half-infinite strings ending on the giant graviton, recently proposed in arXiv:2403.11543. In particular, we prove exact factorization of the defect contribution with respect to wrapped D3 brane fluctuations representing the single giant graviton correction to the undecorated Schur index. This follows from a finite-difference representation of the Schur line defect index in terms of the index without defects, and similar factorization holds quite generally for more complicated defect configurations. In particular, the single giant graviton contribution to the 4-point function with two fundamental and two anti-fundamental lines is computed and discussed in this perspective.</description>

      <title>Exponential Networks for Linear Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work has given proof and evidence that BPS states in local Calabi-Yau 3-folds can be described and counted by exponential networks on the punctured plane, with the help of a suitable non-abelianization map to the mirror curve. This provides an appealing elementary depiction of moduli of special Lagrangian submanifolds, but so far only a handful of examples have been successfully worked out in detail. In this note, we exhibit an explicit correspondence between torus fixed points of the Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb C^2\subset\mathbb C^3$ and anomaly free exponential networks attached to the quadratically framed pair of pants. This description realizes an interesting, and seemingly novel, "age decomposition" of linear partitions. We also provide further details about the networks' perspective on the full D-brane moduli space.</description>

      <title>Wall-Crossing Effects on Quiver BPS Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BPS states in supersymmetric theories can admit additional algebro-geometric structures in their spectra, described as quiver Yangian algebras. Equivariant fixed points on the quiver variety are interpreted as vectors populating a representation module, and matrix elements for the generators are then defined as Duistermaat-Heckman integrals in the vicinity of these points. The well-known wall-crossing phenomena is that the fixed point spectrum establishes a dependence on the stability (Fayet-Illiopolous) parameters $\zeta$, jumping abruptly across the walls of marginal stability, which divide the $\zeta$-space into a collection of stability chambers -- "phases" of the theory. The standard construction of the quiver Yangian algebra relies heavily on the molten crystal model, valid in a sole cyclic chamber where all the $\zeta$-parameters have the same sign. We propose to lift this restriction and investigate the effects of the wall-crossing phenomena on the quiver Yangian algebra and its representations -- starting with the example of affine super-Yangian $\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$. In addition to the molten crystal construction more general atomic structures appear, in other non-cyclic phases (chambers of the $\zeta$-space). We call them \emph{glasses} and also divide in a few different classes. For some of the new phases we manage to associate an algebraic structure again as a representation of the same affine Yangian $\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$. This observation supports an earlier conjecture that the BPS algebraic structures can be considered as the new wall-crossing invariants.</description>

      <title>Minimal SU(5) theory on the edge: the importance of being effective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the minimal renormalizable $SU(5)$ grand unified theory is ruled out: it predicts same masses of down quarks and charged leptons, the gauge couplings do not unify and neutrinos are massless. We show here that all this can be cured simultaneously by the addition of higher-dimensional effective operators. However, the theory lives on the edge since the unification scale turns out as low as roughly $10^{14}\,$GeV, threatening proton longevity. If the lower bound on the proton lifetime was to be increased by an order of magnitude, the usual desert in energies between the weak and unification scales would be populated. We also revisit two minimal extensions of this theory that offer a dynamical seesaw origin of neutrino mass, and discuss the resulting consequences.</description>

      <title>A Noisy Approach to Intrinsically Mixed-State Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for studying two-dimensional (2D) topologically ordered states subject to local correlated errors and show that the resulting mixed-state can display intrinsically mixed-state topological order (imTO) -- topological order which is not expected to occur in the ground state of 2D local gapped Hamiltonians. Specifically, we show that decoherence, previously interpreted as anyon condensation in a doubled Hilbert space, is more naturally phrased as, and provides a physical mechanism for, "gauging out" anyons in the original Hilbert space. We find that gauging out anyons generically results in imTO, with the decohered mixed-state strongly symmetric under certain anomalous 1-form symmetries. This framework lays bare a striking connection between the decohered density matrix and topological subsystem codes, which can appear as anomalous surface states of 3D topological orders. Through a series of examples, we show that the decohered state can display a classical memory, encode logical qubits (i.e., exhibit a quantum memory), and even host chiral or non-modular topological order. We argue that the decohered states represent genuine mixed-state quantum phases of matter and that a partial classification of imTO is given in terms of braided fusion categories.</description>

      <title>Topological Dipole Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We expand the concept of two-dimensional topological insulators to encompass a novel category known as topological dipole insulators (TDIs), characterized by conserved dipole moments along the $x$-direction in addition to charge conservation. By generalizing Laughlin's flux insertion argument, we prove a no-go theorem and predict possible edge patterns and anomalies in a TDI with both charge $U^e(1)$ and dipole $U^d(1)$ symmetries. The edge of a TDI is characterized as a quadrupolar channel that displays a dipole $U^d(1)$ anomaly. A quantized amount of dipole gets transferred between the edges under the dipolar flux insertion, manifesting as `quantized quadrupolar Hall effect' in TDIs. A microscopic coupled-wire Hamiltonian realizing the TDI is constructed by introducing a mutually commuting pair-hopping terms between wires to gap out all the bulk modes while preserving the dipole moment. The effective action at the quadrupolar edge can be derived from the wire model, with the corresponding bulk dipolar Chern-Simons response theory delineating the topological electromagnetic response in TDIs. Finally, we enrich our exploration of topological dipole insulators to the spinful case and construct a dipolar version of the quantum spin Hall effect, whose boundary evidences a mixed anomaly between spin and dipole symmetry. Effective bulk and the edge action for the dipolar quantum spin Hall insulator are constructed as well.</description>

      <title>Higher memory effects and the post-Newtonian calculation of their gravitational-wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new hierarchy of lasting gravitational-wave effects (the higher memory effects) was recently identified in asymptotically flat spacetimes, with the better-known displacement, spin, and center-of-mass memory effects included as the lowest two orders in the set of these effects. These gravitational-wave observables are determined by a set of temporal moments of the news tensor, which describes gravitational radiation from an isolated source. The moments of the news can be expressed in terms of changes in charge-like expressions and integrals over retarded time of flux-like terms, some of which vanish in the absence of radiation. In this paper, we compute expressions for the flux-like contributions to the moments of the news in terms of a set of multipoles that characterize the gravitational-wave strain. We also identify a part of the strain that gives rise to these moments of the news. In the context of post-Newtonian theory, we show that the strain related to the moments of the news is responsible for the many nonlinear, instantaneous terms and "memory" terms that appear in the post-Newtonian expressions for the radiative multipole moments of the strain. We also apply our results to compute the leading post-Newtonian expressions for the moments of the news and the corresponding strains that are generated during the inspiral of compact binary sources. These results provide a new viewpoint on the waveforms computed from the multipolar post-Minkowski formalism, and they could be used to assess the detection prospects of this new class of higher memory effects.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Persistent Homology: a Fisher Forecast</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent homology naturally addresses the multi-scale topological characteristics of the large-scale structure as a distribution of clusters, loops, and voids. We apply this tool to the dark matter halo catalogs from the Quijote simulations, and build a summary statistic for comparison with the joint power spectrum and bispectrum statistic regarding their information content on cosmological parameters and primordial non-Gaussianity. Through a Fisher analysis, we find that constraints from persistent homology are tighter for 8 out of the 10 parameters by margins of 13-50%. The complementarity of the two statistics breaks parameter degeneracies, allowing for a further gain in constraining power when combined. We run a series of consistency checks to consolidate our results, and conclude that our findings motivate incorporating persistent homology into inference pipelines for cosmological survey data.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Theory Of Gravitation, Effective Field Theories, and Strings: Yesterday And Today</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the effective field theory perspective on modern physics through the lens of the quantum theory of gravitational interaction. The historical part argues that the search for a theory of quantum gravity stimulated the change in outlook that characterizes the modern approach to the Standard Model of particle physics and General Relativity. We present some landmarks covering a long period, i.e., from the beginning of the 1930s until 1994, when, according to Steven Weinberg, the modern bottom-up approach to General Relativity began. Starting from the first attempt to apply the quantum field theory techniques to perturbatively quantize Einstein's theory, we explore its developments and interaction with the top-down approach encoded by String Theory. In the last part of the paper, we focus on this last approach to describe the relationship between our modern understanding of String Theory and Effective Field Theory in today's panorama. To this end, the non-historical part briefly explains the modern concepts of moduli stabilization and Swampland to understand another change in focus that explains the present framework where some string theorists move.</description>

      <title>Motion of spinning particles around a polymer black hole in loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the curved spacetime background, the trajectory of a spinning test particle will deviate from the geodesic. Using the effective potential method, we study the motion of a spinning test particle on the equatorial plane of a polymer black hole in loop quantum gravity described by the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations with minimal spin-gravity interaction. We find that for the bounded orbits in the radial direction, the particle's motion is timelike when its spin is small. The radial range of the orbit and its eccentricity decrease with the loop quantum gravity parameter. However, when the particle takes a large enough spin, we observe an interesting phenomenon that the timelike and spacelike motions alternately appear while are separated by a critical radius. Outside the critical radius, the motion is timelike, however inside it is spacelike, and on the radius $r_c$ it is null. To explore more observable effects of the loop quantum gravity parameter on the motion of the spinning particle, we focus our attention on the circular orbits, particularly the innermost stable circular orbits, near the black hole. The result shows that for the same spin, there are two different innermost stable circular orbits, one with a larger radius and the other with a smaller radius. Both the radii decrease as the loop quantum gravity parameter increases. More significantly, with the increase of the spin of the particle, the small innermost stable circular orbit transition from timelike to spacelike, while the one with large radius does not. Instead, it terminates at a certain value of spin. All the results present the significant influences of the loop quantum gravity parameter on the motion of the spinning particles.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamical Topology of Quantum BTZ Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the study of black hole thermodynamics, topology offers a novel approach and perspective for classifying black hole systems. In this work, we explore the thermodynamical topology of the quantum BTZ black hole by employing the concept of the generalized free energy. To fully characterize the thermodynamics, we introduce two distinct topological numbers. The first one is determined by an expression, denoted by $z$, derived from the free energy. Although it can provide us with some local physical explanations, sufficient physical significance still lacks from a global perspective. On the other hand, the second topological number is based on the entropy expression of the generalized free energy, leading to a more meaningful interpretation of its physical implications. This result highlights the natural choice of entropy as the domain variable for the generalized free energy. Regarding the second topological number, our analysis reveals a topological transition that is associated with the thermodynamical stability of the ``cold" black hole state of the quantum BTZ black hole. Furthermore, our study suggests the existence of topological numbers beyond the conventional values of $\pm 1,0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many previous studies have explored models of dynamically interacting dark energy scenarios instead of a cosmological constant and cold dark matter. This work aims to offer a comprehensive investigation of the Yukawa-type interaction between dark energy and dark matter where dark matter mass is also a function of a dynamical scalar field value. Unlike previous work, instead of taking an approximate solution, we numerically solve the Klein-Gordon equation that governs the intricate interplay between these two components of the dark sector along with the corresponding perturbations, using a suitable shooting algorithm to determine precise initial conditions. We have conducted a thorough analysis of this interaction using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, incorporating diverse datasets such as Planck, BAO, Pantheon+, and SH$_0$ES. Our results, for the first time, reveal a discernible detection of the coupling constant, which encapsulates the strength of the dark sector interaction. We find non-zero $\beta$ values of 0.0487, 0.0680, 0.0712, and 0.0822 ($68\%$ Confidence Limit) corresponding to the inclusion of each dataset, respectively. Notably, the addition of SH$_0$ES data led to a significant increase in the prominence of $\beta$, suggesting the potential for new physics in the dark sector. This study serves as a strategic road map for future endeavours with non-linear cosmology, which will contribute to an enhanced understanding and refinement of constraints on the dark sector interaction.</description>

      <title>On Intermediate Exceptional Series</title>

Abstract: The Freudenthal--Tits magic square $\mathfrak{m}(\mathbb{A}_1,\mathbb{A}_2)$ for $\mathbb{A}=\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C},\mathbb{H},\mathbb{O}$ of semi-simple Lie algebras can be extended by including the sextonions $\mathbb{S}$. A series of non-reductive Lie algebras naturally appear in the new row associated with the sextonions, which we will call the \textit{intermediate exceptional series}, with the largest one as the intermediate Lie algebra $E_{7+1/2}$ constructed by Landsberg--Manivel. We study various aspects of the intermediate vertex operator (super)algebras associated with the intermediate exceptional series, including rationality, coset constructions, irreducible modules, (super)characters and modular linear differential equations. For all $\mathfrak{g}_I$ belonging to the intermediate exceptional series, the intermediate VOA $L_1(\mathfrak{g}_I)$ has characters of irreducible modules coinciding with those of the simple rational $C_2$-cofinite $W$-algebra $W_{-h^\vee/6}(\mathfrak{g},f_\theta)$ studied by Kawasetsu, with $\mathfrak{g} $ belonging to the Cvitanovi\'c--Deligne exceptional series. We propose some new intermediate VOA $L_k(\mathfrak{g}_I)$ with integer level $k$ and investigate their properties. For example, for the intermediate Lie algebra $D_{6+1/2}$ between $D_6$ and $E_7$ in the subexceptional series and also in Vogel's projective plane, we find that the intermediate VOA $L_2(D_{6+1/2})$ has a simple current extension to a SVOA with four irreducible Neveu--Schwarz modules. We also provide some (super) coset constructions such as $L_2(E_7)/L_2(D_{6+1/2})$ and $L_1(D_{6+1/2})^{\otimes2}\!/L_2(D_{6+1/2})$. In the end, we find that the theta blocks associated with the intermediate exceptional series produce some new holomorphic Jacobi forms of critical weight and lattice index.</description>

      <title>Constraining scalars of $16_H$ through proton decays in non-renormalisable $SO(10)$ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-renormalisable versions of $SO(10)$ based on irreducible representations with lesser degrees of freedom, are free of running into the catastrophe of non-perturbativity of standard model gauge couplings in contrast to the renormalisable versions having tensors with many degrees of freedom. $16_H$ is the smallest representation, participates in Yukawa Lagrangian at the non-renormalisable level, contributing to the charged and neutral fermion masses, and has six distinct scalars with different $B-L$ charges. We computed the leptoquark and diquark couplings of different pairs of scalars stemming from all possible decomposition of the term resulting from the coupling of $16_{\rm{H}}$ with the $\mathbf{16}$ dimensional fermion multiplet of $SO(10)$, i.e. $\frac{\mathbf{16}\,\mathbf{16}\,16_{\rm{H}}\,16_{\rm{H}}}{\Lambda}$. Computing the tree and loop level contribution of different pairs to the effective dimension six, $B-L$ conserving operators, it turns out only three pairs, viz $\sigma\big(1,1,0\big)- T\big(3,1,\frac{1}{3}\big)$, and $H\big(1,2,-\frac{1}{2}\big)-\Delta\big(3,2,\frac{1}{6}\big)$, and $H-T$ can induce proton decay at tree level. Assuming that the Yukawa couplings of the $16_{\rm{H}}$ are comparable to those of the $\overline{126}_{\rm{H}}$ of a realistic SO(10) model and setting the cutoff scale to the Planck scale typically constrains the $B-L$ breaking scale to be $4\sim 5$ orders of magnitude less than the cutoff scale $(\Lambda)$. Moreover, analysing the branching pattern of the leading two-body decay modes of the proton, we observed a preference for the proton to decay into second-generation mesons due to the hierarchical nature of Yukawa couplings. In a realistic $SO(10)$ scenario, we find that $M_T &gt;10^{8}$ TeV, while $M_\Delta$ could be as light as a few TeV$s$.</description>

      <title>Krylov localization as a probe for ergodicity breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity has recently gained attention where the growth of operator complexity in time is measured in terms of the off-diagonal operator Lanczos coefficients. The operator Lanczos algorithm reduces the problem of complexity growth to a single-particle semi-infinite tight-binding chain (known as the Krylov chain). Employing the phenomenon of Anderson localization, we propose the inverse localization length on the Krylov chain as a probe to detect weak ergodicity-breaking. On the Krylov chain we find delocalization in an ergodic regime, as we show for the SYK model, and localization in case of a weakly ergodicity-broken regime. Considering the dynamics beyond scrambling, we find a collapse across different system sizes at the point of weak ergodicity-breaking leading to a quantitative prediction. We further show universal traits of different operators in the ergodic regime beyond the scrambling dynamics. We test for two settings: (1) the coupled SYK model, and (2) the quantum East model. Our findings open avenues for mapping ergodicity/weak ergodicity-breaking transitions to delocalization/localization phenomenology on the Krylov chain.</description>

From the vertex function, we extract the effective coupling and show that it grows with increasing magnetic field. We consider the quark-gluon vertex and the three-gluon vertex, accounting for the propagators of charged particles within the loops using the lowest Landau level approximation in order to satisfy the condition where the magnetic field is the largest energy scale. Under this approximation, we find that the contribution from the three-gluon vertex vanishes. Therefore, this result arises from the competition between the color charge associated to gluons and to quarks as well, with the former being larger than the latter. The behavior of the QCD coupling as a function of the magnetic field strength is analogous to that exhibited by the light-quark condensate, indicating the magnetic catalysis occurs. This increasing behavior stems from the dominant contribution of color charge associated to gluons in the vertex function.</description>

      <title>No time to derive: unraveling total time derivatives in in-in perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The in-in formalism provides a way to systematically organize the calculation of primordial correlation functions. Although its theoretical foundations are now firmly settled, the treatment of total time derivative interactions, incorrectly trivialized as ``boundary terms'', has been the subject of intense discussions and conceptual mistakes. In this work, we demystify the use of total time derivatives -- as well as terms proportional to the linear equations of motion -- and show that they can lead to artificially large contributions cancelling at different orders of the in-in operator formalism. We discuss the treatment of total time derivative interactions in the Lagrangian path integral formulation of the in-in perturbation theory, and we showcase the importance of interaction terms proportional to linear equations of motion. We then provide a new route to the calculation of primordial correlation functions, which avoids the generation of total time derivatives, by working directly at the level of the full Hamiltonian in terms of phase-space variables. Instead of integrating by parts, we perform canonical transformations to simplify interactions. We explain how to retrieve correlation functions of the initial phase-space variables from the knowledge of the ones after canonical transformations, and we provide diagrammatic rules to systematically classify all possible contributions. As an important first application, we find the explicit sizes of Hamiltonian cubic interactions in single-field inflation with canonical kinetic terms and for any background evolution [...]. Our results are important for performing complete calculations of exchange diagrams in inflation [...]. Being already written in a form amenable to characterize quantum properties of primordial fluctuations, they also promise to shed light on the non-linear dynamics of quantum states during inflation.</description>

      <title>Shadows and Properties of Spin-Induced Scalarized Black Holes with and without a Ricci Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the properties and shadows of spin-induced scalarized black holes, as well as investigate how a Ricci coupling influences them. Our findings reveal significant deviations from the Kerr metric in terms of the location and geodesic frequencies of the innermost stable circular orbit and light ring, with the former exhibiting more pronounced disparities. The shadows of scalarized black holes exhibit relatively minor deviations when compared to those of Kerr black holes with the same mass and spin. Overall, the presence of a Ricci coupling is observed to mitigate deviations from the Kerr metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.03434v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of conservation laws on wormholes that are made traversable by a double trace deformation. After coupling the two asymptotic boundaries of a maximally extended $(d+1)$ dimensional black brane geometry with $U(1)$ conserved current operators, we find that the quantum matter stress-energy tensor of the corresponding bulk gauge fields in the hydrodynamic limit violates the averaged null energy condition (ANEC), rendering the wormhole traversable. Applying our results to axionic two-sided black hole solutions, we discuss how the wormhole opening depends on the charge diffusion constant, how this affects the amount of information that can be sent through the wormhole, and possible implications for many-body quantum teleportation protocols involving conserved current operators.</description>

      <title>Probing Pole Skipping through Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The holographic phenomena of pole skipping have been studied in the presence of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet interaction in the four-dimensional Anti-de Sitter-Schwarzchild black hole background. Pole skipping points are special points in phase space where the bulk linearised differential equations have multiple ingoing solutions. Those special points are claimed to be connected to chaos. In this paper, we initiated a novel study on understanding the response of those special points under the application of external sources. The source is identified with the holographic dual operator of the bulk scalar field with its non-normalizable solutions. We analyze in detail the dynamics of pole skipping points in both sound and shear channels, considering linear perturbation in bulk. In the perturbative regime, characteristic parameters for chaos, namely Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, remain unchanged. However, the diffusion coefficient has evolved non-trivially under the external source.</description>

      <title>On Bethe equations of 2d conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the higher spin algebras of two-dimensional conformal field theory from the perspective of quantum integrability. Starting from Maulik-Okounkov instanton R-matrix and applying the procedure of algebraic Bethe ansatz, we obtain infinite commuting families of Hamiltonians of quantum ILW hierarchy parametrized by the shape of the auxiliary torus. We calculate explicitly the first five of these Hamiltonians. Then, we numerically verify that their joint spectrum can be parametrized by solutions of Litvinov's Bethe ansatz equations and we conjecture a general formula for the joint spectrum of all ILW Hamiltonians, based on results of Feigin, Jimbo, Miwa and Mukhin.
  There are two interesting degeneration limits, the infinitely thick and the infinitely thin auxiliary torus. In one of these limits, the ILW hierarchy degenerates to Yangian or Benjamin-Ono hierarchy and the Bethe equations can be easily solved. The other limit is singular but we can nevertheless extract local Hamiltonians corresponding to quantum KdV or KP hierarchy. Litvinov's Bethe equations in this local limit provide an alternative to Bethe ansatz equations of Bazhanov, Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov, but are more transparent, work at any rank and are manifestly symmetric under triality symmetry of $\mathcal{W}_{1+\infty}$. Finally, we illustrate analytic properties of the solutions of Bethe equations in minimal models, in particular for Lee-Yang CFT. The analytic structure of Bethe roots is very rich as it captures the representation theory of $\mathcal{W}_N$ minimal models.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Dimensions in Hypercubic Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive perturbative study of the operator spectrum in multi-scalar theories with hypercubic global symmetry. This includes working out symmetry representations and their corresponding tensor structures. These structures are then used to compute the anomalous dimensions of scalar operators with up to four fields and arbitrary representations to six-loop order. Moreover, we determine one-loop anomalous dimensions for a large number of low-lying operators in the spectrum which include more powers of the fundamental field and/or insertions of derivatives. As an aside we show how projectors used in the conformal bootstrap can be conveniently reused in computations of anomalous dimensions. The results of our study are of use to the conformal bootstrap. They also illuminate features of conformal perturbation theory and the large $n$ expansion. Our results may be of interest for various crossover phenomena in statistical field theory. In total, we compute the scaling dimension of more than 300 operators, of which 16 are computed to six-loops. Our analysis is exhaustive with respect to group theory up to rank 4 for any number of flavours $n$, and also exhaustive with respect to which representations exist for $n \leq 4$.</description>

Abstract: We present single soliton states and soliton-antisoliton states with an adjoint Higgs field in 4D flat space. The action of a single soliton state diverges, while the action of soliton-antisoliton states converges. This means such solitons can exist in soliton-antisoliton states, although they cannot exist individually. The interaction in a soliton-antisoliton state takes a logarithmic dependence on separation. Such soliton-antisoliton states exhibit stability under a scaling transformation.</description>

      <title>Reduced tensor network formulation for non-Abelian gauge theories in arbitrary dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formulating non-Abelian gauge theories as a tensor network is known to be challenging due to the internal degrees of freedom that result in the degeneracy in the singular value spectrum. In two dimensions, it is straightforward to 'trace out' these degrees of freedom with the use of character expansion, giving a reduced tensor network where the degeneracy associated with the internal symmetry is eliminated. In this work, we show that such an index loop also exists in higher dimensions in the form of a closed tensor network we call the 'armillary sphere'. This allows us to completely eliminate the matrix indices and reduce the overall size of the tensors in the same way as is possible in two dimensions. This formulation allows us to include significantly more representations with the same tensor size, thus making it possible to reach a greater level of numerical accuracy in the tensor renormalization group computations.</description>

Abstract: We study 4d exceptional S-fold SCFTs obtained from the 6d $(2,0)$ theories of type $E_{6,7,8}$. We show that all but one of these theories are discrete gaugings of free theories because they do not admit a consistent charge lattice. We compute the 1-form symmetry of the only interacting theory, the $k=4$ exceptional S-fold SCFT of type $E_8$, and find that it is trivial. Along the way we develop a consistency condition for the Coulomb Branch stratification of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs with characteristic dimension $\varkappa \neq \{1,2\}$ and show that the triviality of (most) exceptional S-fold SCFTs follows directly from this constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Yang-Baxter deformations of the flat space string that result in exactly solvable models, finding the Nappi-Witten model and its higher dimensional generalizations. We then consider the spectra of these models obtained by canonical quantization in light-cone gauge, and match them with an integrability-based Bethe ansatz approach. By considering a generalized light-cone gauge we can describe the model by a nontrivially Drinfel'd twisted S matrix, explicitly verifying the twisted structure expected for such deformations. Next, the reformulation of the Nappi-Witten model as a Yang-Baxter deformation shows that Yang-Baxter models can have more symmetries than suggested by the $r$ matrix defining the deformation. We discuss these enhanced symmetries in more detail for some trivial and nontrivial examples. Finally, we observe that there are nonunimodular but Weyl-invariant Yang-Baxter models of a type not previously considered.</description>

      <title>Towards complexity in de Sitter space from the double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How can we define complexity in dS space from microscopic principles? Based on recent developments pointing towards a correspondence between a pair of double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DSSYK) models/ 2D Liouville-de Sitter (LdS$_2$) field theory/ 3D Schwarzschild de Sitter (SdS$_3$) space in arXiv:2310.16994, arXiv:2402.00635, arXiv:2402.02584, we study concrete complexity proposals in the microscopic models and their dual descriptions. First, we examine the spread complexity of the maximal entropy state of the doubled DSSYK model. We show that it counts the number of entangled chord states in its doubled Hilbert space. We interpret spread complexity in terms of a time difference between antipodal observers in SdS$_3$ space, and a boundary time difference of the dual LdS$_2$ CFTs. This provides a new connection between entanglement and geometry in dS space. Second, Krylov complexity, which describes operator growth, is computed for physical operators on all sides of the correspondence. Their late time evolution behaves as expected for chaotic systems. Later, we define the query complexity in the LdS$_2$ model as the number of steps in an algorithm computing n-point correlation functions of boundary operators of the corresponding antipodal points in SdS$_3$ space. We interpret query complexity as the number of matter operator chord insertions in a cylinder amplitude in the DSSYK, and the number of junctions of Wilson lines between antipodal static patch observers in SdS$_3$ space. Finally, we evaluate a specific proposal of Nielsen complexity for the DSSYK model and comment on its possible dual manifestations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.15225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple model which generates cosmological anisotropies on top of standard FLRW geometry. This is in some sense reminiscent of the mean field approximation, where the mean field cosmological model under consideration would be the standard FLRW, and the anisotropy is a small perturbative correction on top of it. Using a supergravity-inspired model, we confirm that the stable fixed point of our model corresponds to standard FLRW cosmology. We use a Bianchi VII$_0$-type model supplemented with a scalar and $U(1)$ gauge fields, and we show that the anisotropies of the geometry are generated by the non-trivial interaction between the gravity sector and the $U(1)$ gauge sector. Studying the attractor flow, we show that the anisotropies are present at early times (high redshift) and decay asymptotically to an FLRW attractor fixed point. With such a mechanism, observations of non-isotropy are not contradictory to FLRW geometry or indeed the $\Lambda$CDM model. Such models could in principle shed some insights on the present cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Negative Dark Energy Density from High Redshift Pantheon+ Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) framework, the Hubble constant $H_0$ is an integration constant. Thus, consistency of the model demands observational constancy of $H_0$. We demonstrate redshift evolution of best fit $\Lambda$CDM parameters $(H_0, \Omega_{m})$ in Pantheon+ supernove (SNe). Redshift evolution of best fit cosmological parameters is a prerequisite to finding a statistically significant evolution as well as identifying alternative models that are competitive with $\Lambda$CDM in a Bayesian model comparison. To assess statistical significance, we employ three different methods: i) Bayesian model comparison, ii) mock simulations and iii) profile distributions. The first shows a marginal preference for the vanilla $\Lambda$CDM model over an ad hoc model with 3 additional parameters and an unphysical jump in cosmological parameters at $z=1$. From mock simulations, we estimate the statistical significance of redshift evolution of best fit parameters and negative dark energy density ($\Omega_m &gt; 1$) to be in the $1-2 \sigma$ range, depending on the criteria employed. Importantly, in direct comparison to the same analysis with the earlier Pantheon sample we find that statistical significance of redshift evolution of best fit parameters has increased, as expected for a physical effect. Our profile distribution analysis demonstrates a shift in $(H_0, \Omega_m)$ in excess of $95\%$ confidence level for SNe with redshifts $z &gt; 1$ and also shows that a degeneracy in MCMC posteriors is not equivalent to a curve of constant $\chi^2$. Our findings can be interpreted as a statistical fluctuation or unexplored systematics in Pantheon+ or $\Lambda$CDM model breakdown. The first two possibilities are disfavoured by similar trends in independent probes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The single-letter characterisation of the entanglement-assisted capacity of a quantum channel is one of the seminal results of quantum information theory. In this paper, we consider a modified communication scenario in which the receiver is allowed an additional, `inconclusive' measurement outcome, and we employ an error metric given by the error probability in decoding the transmitted message conditioned on a conclusive measurement result. We call this setting postselected communication and the ensuing highest achievable rates the postselected capacities. Here, we provide a precise single-letter characterisation of postselected capacities in the setting of entanglement assistance as well as the more general nonsignalling assistance, establishing that they are both equal to the channel's projective mutual information -- a variant of mutual information based on the Hilbert projective metric. We do so by establishing bounds on the one-shot postselected capacities, with a lower bound that makes use of a postselected teleportation protocol and an upper bound in terms of the postselected hypothesis testing relative entropy. As such, we obtain fundamental limits on a channel's ability to communicate even when this strong resource of postselection is allowed, implying limitations on communication even when the receiver has access to postselected closed timelike curves.</description>

Abstract: The currently accepted mathematical description of the fundamental constituents and interactions of matter is the Standard Model of particle physics. Its last missing particle, the famous Higgs boson, was observed at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in 2012. However, it is clear that the Standard Model cannot be the ultimate theory of Nature, and e.g. cannot account for Dark Matter or non-vanishing neutrino masses (and does not include gravity). In fact, searches for physics beyond the SM have been intensified since the Higgs boson discovery. In this article, we review the hints for new physics, called ``anomalies'', obtained in particle physics experiments within the last years. We consider both direct high-energy searches for new resonances at the LHC and indirect low-energy precision experiments. These anomalies range from the nuclear scale (approximately the mass of the proton) to the electroweak scale (i.e. the mass of the Higgs boson) to the TeV scale (the highest scale directly accessible at the LHC), therefore spanning over four orders of magnitude. After discussing the experimental and theoretical status of the anomalies, we summarize possible explanations in terms of new particles and new interactions. In particular, new Higgs bosons and leptoquarks are promising candidates. Discovery prospects and implications for future colliders are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the total thrust resulting from the interaction between charged scalar modes and a superradiant Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, when the modes are deflected by a hemispherical perfect mirror located at a finite distance from the black hole's horizon.</description>

      <title>On the dependence of the Landau gauge ghost-gluon-vertex on the number of flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gauge-boson, ghost and fermion propagators as well as the gauge-boson--ghost vertex function are studied for SU(N), Sp(2N) and SO(N) gauge groups. We solve a set of coupled Dyson-Schwinger equations in Landau gauge for a variable, fractional number $N_f$ of massless fermions in the fundamental representation. For large $N_f$ we find a phase transition from a chirally broken into a chirally symmetric phase that is consistent with the behavior expected inside the conformal window. Even in the presence of fermions the gauge-boson--ghost-vertex dressing remains small. In the conformal window this vertex shows the expected power law behavior. It does not assume its tree-level value in the far infrared, but the respective dressing function is a constant greater than one.</description>

      <title>Two-loop massive QCD and QED helicity amplitudes for light-by-light scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the analytic and compact two-loop helicity amplitudes for QCD and QED corrections to the light-by-light scattering process with massive internal fermions. We express the master integrals either in terms of multiple polylogarithms or in terms of iterated integrals with dlog one-forms. We also elaborate on optimizing the analytic results for each phase-space region. This makes the numerical evaluation of the scattering amplitudes fast, stable and suitable for phenomenological applications.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of Horndeski Gravity under Positivity Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set of conditions that any effective field theory needs to satisfy in order to allow for the existence of a viable UV completion has recently gained attention in the cosmological context under the name of $\textit{positivity bounds}$. In this paper we revisit the derivation of such bounds for Horndeski gravity and translate them into a complete set of viability conditions in the language of effective field theory of dark energy. We implement the latter into $\texttt{EFTCAMB}$ and explore the large scale structure phenomenology of Horndeski gravity under positivity bounds. We build a statistically significant sample of viable Horndeski models, and derive the corresponding predictions for the background evolution, in terms of $w_{\rm DE}$, and the dynamics of linear perturbations, in terms of the phenomenological functions $\mu$ and $\Sigma$, associated to clustering and weak lensing, respectively. We find that the addition of positivity bounds to the traditional no-ghost and no-gradient conditions considerably tightens the theoretical constraints on all these functions. The most significant feature is a strengthening of the correlation $\mu\simeq\Sigma$, and a related tight constraint on the luminal speed of gravitational waves $c^2_T\simeq1$. In anticipation of a more complete formulation of positivity conditions in cosmology, this work demonstrates the strong potential of such bounds in shaping the viable parameter space of scalar-tensor theories.</description>
