      <title>Thermodynamic constraints and pseudotransition behavior in a one-dimensional water-like system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional water-like lattice model with Van der Waals and hydrogen-bond interactions, allowing for particle number fluctuations through a chemical potential. The model, defined on a chain with periodic boundary conditions, exhibits three ground-state phases: gas, bonded liquid, and dense liquid, separated by sharp phase boundaries in the chemical potential and temperature plane. Using the transfer matrix method, we derive exact analytical results within the grand-canonical ensemble and examine the finite-temperature behavior. The system exhibits clear pseudotransition features, including sharp but analytic changes in entropy, density, and internal energy, along with finite peaks in specific heat and correlation length. To assess the role of thermodynamic constraints, we consider the behavior under fixed density through a Legendre transformation. This constrained analysis reveals smoother anomalies, such as entropy kinks and finite jumps in specific heat, contrasting with the sharper grand-canonical signatures. These results underscore the ensemble dependence of pseudotransitions and show how statistical constraints modulate critical-like behavior. We also verify that the residual entropy continuity criterion holds in the grand-canonical ensemble but is violated when the system is constrained. Our findings illustrate how even a simple one-dimensional model can mimic water-like thermodynamic anomalies.</description>

      <title>Quenched properties of the Spectral Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Spectral Form Factor (SFF) is defined as the modulus squared of the partition function in complex temperature for hermitian matrices and a suitable generalisation has been given in the non hermitian case. In this work we compute the properties of the quenched SFF for hermitian and non hermitian random matrices. Despite the fact that the (annealed) SFF is not self-averaging the quenched SFF is self-averaging but these two averages coincide up to subleading constants (at least for high enough temperatures). The fluctuations of $\log \mathrm{SFF}$ are deep and one encounters thin spikes when moving close to a zero of the partition function. We study the partition function at late times by considering a suitable change of variable which turns out to be compatible with a Gumbel distribution. We note that the exponential tails of this distribution can be obtained by the deep spikes in the $\log \mathrm{SFF}$, namely the zeros of the partition function. We compare with the results obtained in isolated many-body systems and we show that same results hold at late times also for non-hermitian Hamiltonains and non-hermitian random matrices.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of an outlier in the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We endow the elements of a random matrix drawn from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble with a Dyson Brownian motion dynamics. We initialize the dynamics of the eigenvalues with all of them lumped at the origin, but one outlier. We solve the dynamics exactly which gives us a window on the dynamical scaling behavior at and around the Baik-Ben Arous-P\'ech\'e transition. Amusingly, while the statics is well-known and accessible via the Hikami-Br\'ezin integrals, our approach for the dynamics is explicitly based on the use of orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence and optimality of transformations of diffusive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce, inspired by Clausius and developing the ideas of \cite{pre}, the concept of equivalence of transformations in non equilibrium theory of diffusive systems within the framework of macroscopic fluctuation theory. Besides providing a new proof of a formula derived in \cite{mft,qc}, which is the basis of the equivalence, we show that equivalent quasistatic transformations can be distinguished in finite terms, by the renormalized work introduced in \cite{45,46,mft,qc}. This allows us to tackle the problem of determining the optimal quasistatic transformation among the equivalent ones.</description>

      <title>The Varieties of Schelling Model Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schelling model is a prototype for agent-based modeling in social systems. A comprehensive analysis of Schelling model rule variants is achieved by classification of the space of macroscopic outcomes via phase diagrams. Among 54 rule variants, only 3 phase diagram classes are found, characterized by the number of phase transitions. This classification scheme is found to be robust to the use of sociological and percolation-inspired measures of segregation. The statistical and dynamic drivers of these transitions are elucidated by analyzing the roles of vision, movement criteria, vacancies, the initial state, and rivalry. Schelling's original step function dictating satisfaction is found to be pathological at high thresholds, producing coordination failures as satisfactory sites become increasingly rare. This comprehensive classification gives new insight into the drivers of transitions in the Schelling model and creates a basis for studying more complex Schelling-like models.</description>

      <title>Mixed order phase transition in a locally constrained exclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a novel variant of the exclusion process in which particles perform asymmetric nearest-neighbor jumps across a bond \((k, k+1)\) only if the preceding site \((k-1)\) is unoccupied. This next-nearest-neighbor constraint significantly enriches the system's dynamics, giving rise to long-range correlations and a mixed-order transition controlled by the asymmetry parameter. We focus on the critical case of half filling, where the system splits into two ergodic components, each associated with an invariant reversible measure. The combinatorial structure of this equilibrium distribution is intimately connected to the \(q\)-Catalan numbers, enabling us to derive rigorously the asymptotic behavior of key thermodynamic quantities in the strongly asymmetric regime and to conjecture their behavior in the weakly asymmetric limit. Even though the system is one-dimensional and has short-range interactions, an equilibrium phase transition occurs between a clustered phase -- characterized by slow dynamics, long-range correlations with thermodynamic additivity, and spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry -- and a fluid phase where the correlations are short-range and which is thermodynamically additive. This equilibrium phase transition features characteristics of a first-order transition, such as a discontinuous order parameter as well as characteristics of a second-order transition, namely a divergent susceptibility at the transition point. We also briefly discuss density higher than one half where ergodicity is broken.</description>

      <title>Data coarse graining can improve model performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lossy data transformations by definition lose information. Yet, in modern machine learning, methods like data pruning and lossy data augmentation can help improve generalization performance. We study this paradox using a solvable model of high-dimensional, ridge-regularized linear regression under 'data coarse graining.' Inspired by the renormalization group in statistical physics, we analyze coarse-graining schemes that systematically discard features based on their relevance to the learning task. Our results reveal a nonmonotonic dependence of the prediction risk on the degree of coarse graining. A 'high-pass' scheme--which filters out less relevant, lower-signal features--can help models generalize better. By contrast, a 'low-pass' scheme that integrates out more relevant, higher-signal features is purely detrimental. Crucially, using optimal regularization, we demonstrate that this nonmonotonicity is a distinct effect of data coarse graining and not an artifact of double descent. Our framework offers a clear, analytical explanation for why careful data augmentation works: it strips away less relevant degrees of freedom and isolates more predictive signals. Our results highlight a complex, nonmonotonic risk landscape shaped by the structure of the data, and illustrate how ideas from statistical physics provide a principled lens for understanding modern machine learning phenomena.</description>

      <title>Minimal velocity of the travelling wave solutions in two coupled FKPP equations with the global conservation law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the system of two coupled one-dimensional Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (FKPP) equations which possess the global conservation law. Such system of equations has been recently derived for the quasiparticle densities in the two-band fermionic model with the particle-number conserving dissipative protocol. As standard FKPP equation the studied system of equations has one unstable and one stable homogeneous solution with travelling wave switching between them. We demonstrate that the conservation law enforces the synchronization of travelling waves for both densities and determine their minimal possible velocity. Surprisingly, we find the existence of jumps of the minimal velocity as function of control parameters. We obtain that the minimal velocity of the coupled FKPP equations may significantly exceed the minimal velocity for a single FKPP equation in a wide range of control parameters.</description>

      <title>Julia Set in Quantum Evolution: The case of Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are a class of
  non-equilibrium phase transitions that occur in many-body quantum
  systems during real-time evolution, rather than through parameter
  tuning as in conventional phase transitions. This paper
  presents an exact analytical approach to studying DQPTs by combining
  complex dynamics with the real-space renormalization group (RG).
  RG transformations are interpreted as iterated maps on the complex
  plane, establishing a connection between DQPTs and the Julia set,
  the fractal boundary separating the basins of attraction of the
  stable fixed points. This framework is applied to a quantum quench in
  the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model, and the
  sensitivity of DQPTs to changes in boundary conditions is examined. In
  particular, it is demonstrated how the topology of the spin chain influences
  the occurrence of DQPTs. Additionally, aqualitative argument based on quantum
  speed limits is provided to explain the suppression of DQPTs under certain
  boundary modifications.</description>

      <title>A pedestrian's approach to large deviations in semi-Markov processes with an application to entropy production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-Markov processes play an important role in the effective description of partially accessible systems in stochastic thermodynamics. They occur, for instance, in coarse-graining procedures such as state lumping and when analyzing waiting times between few visible Markovian events. The finite-time measurement of any coarse-grained observable in a stochastic system depends on the specific realization of the underlying trajectory. Moreover, the fluctuations of such observables are encoded in their rate function that follows from the rate function of the empirical measure and the empirical flow in the respective process. Derivations of the rate function of empirical measure and empirical flow in semi-Markov processes with direction-time independence (DTI) exist in the mathematical literature, but have not received much attention in the stochastic thermodynamics community. We present an accessible derivation of the rate function of the tuple frequency in discrete-time Markov chains and extend this to the rate function of the empirical semi-Markov kernel in semi-Markov processes without DTI. From this, we derive an upper bound on the rate function of the empirical entropy production rate, which leads to a lower bound on the variance of the mean entropy production rate measured along a finite-time trajectory. We illustrate these analytical bounds with simulated data.</description>

      <title>Accurate bootstrap bounds from optimal interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop new methods for approximating conformal blocks as positive functions times polynomials, with applications to the numerical bootstrap. We argue that to obtain accurate bootstrap bounds, conformal block approximations should minimize a certain error norm related to the asymptotics of dispersive functionals. This error norm can be made small using interpolation nodes with an appropriate optimal density. The optimal density turns out to satisfy a kind of force-balance equation for charges in one dimension, which can be solved using standard techniques from large-N matrix models. We also describe how to use optimal density interpolation nodes to improve condition numbers inside the semidefinite program solver SDPB. Altogether, our new approximation scheme and improvements to condition numbers lead to more accurate bootstrap bounds with fewer computational resources. They were crucial in the recent bootstrap study of stress tensors in the 3d Ising CFT.</description>

      <title>Generation of Volume-Law Entanglement by Local-Measurement-Only Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Repeated local measurements typically have adversarial effects on entangling unitary dynamics, as local measurements usually degrade entanglement. However, recent works on measurement-only dynamics have shown that strongly entangled states can be generated solely through non-commuting random multi-site and multi-spin projective measurements. In this work, we explore a generalized measurement setup in a system without intrinsic unitary dynamics and show that volume-law entangled states can be generated through local, non-random, yet non-commuting measurements. Specifically, we construct a one-dimensional model comprising a main fermionic chain and an auxiliary (ancilla) chain, where generalized measurements are performed by locally coupling the system to detector qubits. Our results demonstrate that long-time states with volume-law entanglement or mutual information are generated between different parts of the main chain purely through non-unitary measurement dynamics. Remarkably, we find that such large-entanglement generation can be achieved using only the measurements of one-body operators. Moreover, we show that measurements of non-local higher-body operators can be used to control and reduce entanglement generation by introducing kinetic constraints to the dynamics. We discuss the statistics of entanglement measures along the quantum trajectories, the approach to stationary distributions of entanglement or long-time steady states, and the associated notions of limited ergodicity in the measurement-only dynamics. Our findings highlight the potential of non-random measurement protocols for controlled entanglement generation and the study of non-unitary many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stress Response of Jammed Solids: Prestress and Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike classical elasticity, where stresses arise from deformations relative to a stress-free reference configuration, rigidity in amorphous systems is maintained by disordered force networks that generate internal prestress. Previously, we introduced a ''stress-only'' formulation, where mechanical equilibrium resembles Gauss's law in a rank-2 tensor electrostatics with vector charges, and demonstrated that the mechanical response of jammed solids is described by the dielectric response of this gauge-theoretic formulation. Here, we extend this framework by incorporating scale-dependent screening that captures both dielectric and Debye-type behaviour. This introduces a characteristic length scale in stress correlations as well as in the response to external forces. Through numerical simulations of soft-sphere packings, we show that this length scale is set by the particle size, thus providing a natural ultraviolet cutoff while preserving long-wavelength emergent elasticity. We show that this lengthscale remains finite for all pressures, with no evidence for an emergent Debye-like screening near the frictionless unjamming transition. We demonstrate that although individual realisations show strong fluctuations, disorder averaging at fixed macroscopic conditions yields a robust dielectric-like response that persists up to unjamming. Finally, we also provide a physical interpretation of the gauge field within the electrostatic mapping: relative grain displacements in response to localised external perturbations correspond to difference in the gauge field, linking the field-theoretic description to particle-level mechanics.</description>

      <title>A generative model of function growth explains hidden self-similarities across biological and social systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From genomes and ecosystems to bureaucracies and cities, the growth of complex systems occurs by adding new types of functions and expanding existing ones. We present a simple generative model that generalizes the Yule-Simon process by including: (i) a size-dependent probability of introducing new functions, and (ii) a generalized preferential attachment mechanism for expanding existing ones. We uncover a shared underlying structure that helps explain how function diversity evolves in empirical observations, such as prokaryotic proteomes, U.S. federal agencies, and urban economies. We show that real systems are often best represented as having non-Zipfian rank-frequency distributions, driven by sublinear preferential attachment, whilst still maintaining power-law scaling in their abundance distributions. Furthermore, our analytics explain five distinct phases of the organization of functional elements across complex systems. The model integrates empirical findings regarding the logarithmic growth of diversity in cities and the self-similarity of their rank-frequency distributions. Self-similarity previously observed in the rank-frequency distributions of cities is not observed in cells and federal agencies -- however, under a rescaling relative to the total diversity, all systems admit self-similar structures predicted by our theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the performance of Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) on typical instances of MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT when the transpose of the constraint matrix is drawn from a standard ensemble of LDPC parity check matrices. We prove that if the decoding step of DQI corrects up to the folklore efficient decoding threshold for LDPC codes, then DQI is obstructed by a topological feature of the near-optimal space of solutions known as the overlap gap property (OGP). As the OGP is widely conjectured to exactly characterize the performance of state-of-the-art classical algorithms, this result suggests that DQI has no quantum advantage in optimizing unstructured MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT instances. We also give numerical evidence supporting this conjecture by showing that approximate message passing (AMP)--a classical algorithm conjectured to saturate the OGP threshold--outperforms DQI on a related ensemble of MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT instances. Finally, we prove that depth-$1$ QAOA outperforms DQI at sufficiently large $k$ under the same decoding threshold assumption.
  Our result follows by showing that DQI is approximately Lipschitz under the quantum Wasserstein metric over many standard ensembles of codes. We then prove that MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT exhibits both an OGP and a related topological obstruction known as the chaos property; this is the first known OGP threshold for MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT at fixed $k$, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we prove that both of these topological properties inhibit approximately Lipschitz algorithms such as DQI from optimizing MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT to large approximation ratio.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity and Wightman power spectrum with positive chemical potentials in Schr\"odinger field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the Krylov complexity of fermionic fields in Schr\"odinger field theory as the chemical potential is positive, validated by the engineered Wightman power spectra. For non-positive chemical potentials, the Lanczos coefficients exhibit linear behaviors with respect to $n$. However, as the chemical potential becomes positive, a dynamical transition occurs -- Lanczos coefficient $b_{n}$ develops a two-stage linear growth profile, transitioning from an initial slope of $\pi/\beta$ to the asymptotic slope of $2/\beta$; while Lanczos coefficient $a_{n}$ shows a deflection from near-zero values to linear descent with slope $-4/\beta$ where $\beta$ is the inverse temperature. Moreover, the engineered power spectra are used to study the evolution of the Krylov complexity and some universal behaviors are uncovered -- the single-sided exponential decay of the power spectrum results in the quadratic growth of the complexity, consistent with that from the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ algebraic construction. Conversely, the double-sided exponential decay of the power spectrum restores the exponential growth of the complexity, satisfying the maximal chaos bound. These results may provide new insights into the profound impact of chemical potential on the operator growth and Krylov complexity in the quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Twist fields in many-body physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of twist fields has played a fundamental role in many-body physics. It is used to construct the so-called disorder parameter for the study of phase transitions in the classical Ising model of statistical mechanics, it is involved in the Jordan-Wigner transformation in quantum chains and bosonisation in quantum field theory, and it is related to measures of entanglement in many-body quantum systems. I provide a pedagogical introduction to the notion of twist field and the concepts at its roots, and review some of its applications, focussing on 1+1 dimension. This includes: locality and extensivity, internal symmetries, semi-locality, the standard exponential form and height fields, path integral defects and Riemann surfaces, topological invariance, and twist families. Additional topics touched upon include renormalisation and form factors in relativistic quantum field theory, tau functions of integrable PDEs, thermodynamic and hydrodynamic principles, and branch-point twist fields for entanglement entropy. One-dimensional quantum systems such as chains (e.g. quantum Heisenberg model) and field theory (e.g. quantum sine-Gordon model) are the main focus, but I also explain how the notion applies to equilibrium statistical mechanics (e.g. classical Ising lattice model), and how some aspects can be adapted to one-dimensional classical dynamical systems (e.g. classical Toda chain).</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic bosonisation, aspects of criticality, and the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner Theorem in parquet approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The parquet equations present a cornerstone of some of the most important diagrammatic many-body approximations and methods currently on the market for strongly correlated materials: from non-local extensions of the dynamical mean-field theory to the functional renormalization group. The recently introduced single-boson exchange decomposition of the vertex presents an alternative set of equivalent equations in terms of screened interactions, Hedin vertices, and rest functions. This formulation has garnered much attention for several reasons: opening the door to new approximations, for avoiding vertex divergences associated with local moment formation plaguing the traditional parquet decomposition, and for its interpretative advantage in its built-in diagrammatic identification of bosons without resorting to Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations. In this work, we show how the fermionic diagrams of the particle-particle and particle-hole polarizations can be mapped to diagrammatics of a bosonic self-energy of two respective bosonic theories with pure bosonic constituents, solidifying the identification of the screened interaction with a bosonic propagator. Resorting to a spin-diagonalized basis for the bosonic fields and neglecting the coupling between singlet and triplet components is shown to recover the trace log theory known from Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations. Armed with this concrete mapping, we revisit a conjecture claiming that universal aspects of the parquet approximation coincide with those of the self-consistent screening approximation for a bosonic $O(N)$ model. We comment on the role of the self-energy and crossing symmetry in enforcing the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem in parquet-related approaches.</description>

      <title>Circuit-based chatacterization of finite-temperature quantum phases and self-correcting quantum memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum phases at zero temperature can be characterized as equivalence classes under local unitary transformations: two ground states within a gapped phase can be transformed into each other via a local unitary circuit. We generalize this circuit-based characterization of phases to systems at finite-temperature thermal equilibrium described by Gibbs states. We construct a channel circuit that approximately transforms one Gibbs state into another provided the two are connected by a path in parameter space along which a certain correlation-decay condition holds. For finite-dimensional systems of linear size $L$ and approximation error $\epsilon$, the locality of the circuit is ${\rm polylog}({\rm poly}(L)/\epsilon)$. The correlation-decay condition, which we specify, is expected to be satisfied in the interior of many noncritical thermal phases, including those displaying discrete symmetry breaking and topological order. As an application, we show that any system in the same thermal phase as a zero-temperature topological code coherently preserves quantum information for a macroscopically long time, establishing self-correction as a universal property of thermal phases. As part of the proof, we provide explicit encoding and decoding channel circuits to encode information into, and decode it from, a system in thermal equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: Power-law exponents in the convergence to effective ergodicity is quantified for Ising-Lenz model in one dimension. Modified Thirumalai-Mountain (TM) metric for magnetisation is computed for the range of temperature values under strongly correlated dynamics. In producing evolution of TM metric over time, time-averaged dynamics is generated by using Metropolis and Glauber single-spin-flip dynamics, and ensemble-averaged dynamics with an exact solution. Superdiffusive behaviour is numerically identified in the parameter regimes studied, i.e., power-law exponents, $\alpha &gt; 1.0$.</description>

      <title>Optimal switching strategies for navigation in stochastic settings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When navigating complex environments, animals often combine multiple strategies to mitigate the effects of external disturbances. These modalities often correspond to different sources of information, leading to speed-accuracy trade-offs. Inspired by the intermittent reorientation strategy seen in the behavior of the dung beetle, we consider the problem of the navigation strategy of a correlated random walker moving in two dimensions. We assume that the heading of the walker can be reoriented to the preferred direction by paying a fixed cost as it tries to maximize its total displacement in a fixed direction. Using optimal control theory, we derive analytically and confirm numerically the strategy that maximizes the walker's speed, and show that the average time between reorientations scales inversely with the magnitude of the environmental noise. We then extend our framework to describe execution errors and sensory acquisition noise. As a result, we provide a range of testable predictions and suggest new experimental directions. Our approach may be amenable to other navigation problems involving multiple sensory modalities that require switching between egocentric and geocentric strategies.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of defect formation in the quantum annealing of the random transverse-field Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the strong-disorder renormalization group method, a microscopic mechanism of defect formation in the quantum annealing of the random transverse-field Ising chain is proposed, which represents the annealing process as a gradual aggregation of strongly coupled spin clusters. The ferromagnetic ground state of clusters is either preserved or get excited in pairwise fusions of clusters, depending on the effective annealing rate of the fusion, the latter events being responsible for the appearance of defects in the final state. A consequence of the theory is that, although the Griffiths-McCoy phases surrounding the critical point are gapless, they are still effectively gapped from the point of view of quantum annealing. Thereby we provide an explanation of the finiteness of gap outside of the critical point, which was implicit in an early approach to the problem by Kibble-Zurek scaling [Dziarmaga, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 74}, 064416 (2006)]. Furthermore, by identifying the accessible excitations, we refine the functional form of the vanishing of the gap at the critical point. The defect density in the final state is found to decrease with the annealing time $\tau$, as $n(\tau)\sim \ln^{-2}\left(\frac{\tau}{\ln^2\tau}\right)$ for large $\tau$. In addition to this, our approach gives access also to the density of defects at intermediate times of the annealing process.</description>

      <title>From Attraction to Repulsion: Emergent Interactions in Harmonically Coupled Active Binary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emergent interactions between two active Brownian particles coupled by an attractive harmonic potential and in contact with a thermal reservoir. By analyzing the stationary distribution of their separation, we demonstrate that the effective interaction can be either attractive or repulsive, depending on the interplay between activity, coupling strength, and temperature. Notably, we find that an effective short-range repulsion emerges in the strong and moderate-coupling regimes, when the temperature is below some threshold value, which we characterize analytically. In the strong-coupling regime, the repulsion emerges solely due to the difference in the self-propulsion speeds of the particles. We also compute the short-time position distribution of the centroid of the coupled particles, which shows strongly non-Gaussian fluctuations at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Extending the Limited Performance of the Quantum Refrigerator with Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum thermal machines offer promising platforms for exploring the fundamental limits of thermodynamics at the microscopic scale. The previous study in Ref.[1,2] demonstrated that the incorporation of a catalyst can significantly enhance the performance of a heat engine by broadening its operational regime and achieving a more favorable trade-off between work output and efficiency. Building on this powerful framework and innovative idea, here we further extend the concept to a two-stroke quantum refrigerator that extracts heat from a cold reservoir via discrete strokes powered by external work. The working medium consists of two two-level systems (TLSs) and two heat reservoirs at different temperatures and is assisted by an auxiliary system acting as a catalyst. Remarkably, the catalyst remains unchanged after each cycle, ensuring that heat extraction is driven entirely by the work input. We show that the presence of the catalyst leads to two significant enhancements: it enables the coefficient of performance (COP) and cooling capacity to exceed the Otto bound and allows the refrigerator to operate in frequency and temperature regimes that are inaccessible without a catalyst. Furthermore, through a comparison with catalytic heat engines, our analysis reveals that two distinct permutation types are necessary to simultaneously enhance the COP and operational range of refrigerators, in contrast to heat engines for which a single permutation suffices. These results highlight the potential of catalytic mechanisms to broaden the operational capabilities of quantum thermal devices and to surpass conventional thermodynamic performance limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The random current representation of the Ising model, along with a related path expansion, has been a source of insight on the stochastic geometric underpinning of the ferromagnetic model's phase structure and critical behavior in different dimensions. This representation is extended here to systems with a mild amount of frustration, such as generated by disorder operators and external field of mixed signs. Further examples of the utility of such stochastic geometric representations are presented in the context of the deconfinement transition of the $Z_2$ lattice gauge model -- particularly in three dimensions-- and in streamlined proofs of correlation inequalities with wide-ranging applications.</description>
