      <title>The Szendrei Expansion of Restriction Semigroupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a restriction semigroupoid S, which unifies the notion of restriction semigroups and restriction categories within a single structure. We prove a representation theorem, showing that every restriction semigroupoid can be embedded into a determined category of partial maps. Furthermore, we construct the Szendrei expansion Sz(S) of S and establish that each premorphism between two restriction semigroupoids S and T is uniquely factorized by a morphism between the Szendrei expansion Sz(S) and T.</description>

      <title>Rota-Type Operators on 2-Dimensional Pre-Lie Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies Rota-Baxter, Reynolds, Nijenhuis, and Averaging operators on 2-dimensional pre-Lie algebras over $\mathbb{C}$. Using the classification of 2-dimensional pre-Lie algebras and computational tools like Mathematica or Maple, we describe these Rota-type operators in detail. Our results provide a deeper understanding of these operators and their roles in algebraic structures.</description>

      <title>On DR-semigroups satisfying the ample conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A DR-semigroup $S$ (also known as a reduced E-semiabundant or reduced E-Fountain semigroup) is here viewed as a semigroup equipped with two unary operations $D,R$ satisfying finitely many equational laws. Examples include DRC-semigroups (hence Ehresmann semigroups), which also satisfy the congruence conditions. The ample conditions on DR-semigroups are studied here and are defined by the laws $$xD(y)=D(xD(y))x\mbox{ and }R(y)x=xR(R(y)x).$$ Two natural partial orders may be defined on a DR-semigroup and we show that the ample conditions hold if and only if the two orders are equal and the projections (elements of the form $D(x)$) commute with one-another. Restriction semigroups satisfy the generalized ample conditions, but we give other examples using strongly order-preserving functions on a quasiordered set as well as so-called ``double demonic" composition on binary relations. Following the work of Stein, we show how to construct a certain partial algebra $C(S)$ from any DR-semigroup, which is a category if $S$ satisfies the congruence conditions, but is ``almost" a category if the ample conditions hold. We then characterise the ample conditions in terms of a converse of the condition on $S$ ensuring that $C(S)$ is a category. Our main result is an ESN-style theorem for DR-semigroups satisfying the ample conditions, based on the $C(S)$ construction. We also obtain an embedding theorem, generalizing a result for restriction semigroups due to Lawson.</description>

      <title>The Graded Dual of a Combinatorial Hopf Algebra on Partition Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: John M. Campbell constructed a combinatorial Hopf algebra (CHA) \text{ParSym} on partition diagrams by lifting the CHA structure of \text{NSym} (the Hopf algebra of noncommutative symmetric functions) through an analogous approach. In this article, we define \text{ParQSym}, which is the graded dual of \text{ParSym}. Its CHA structure is defined in an explicit, combinatorial way, by analogy with that of the CHA \text{QSym} of quasisymmetric functions. And we give some subcoalgebra and Hopf subalgebras of \text{ParQSym}, some gradings and filtrations of \text{ParSym} and \text{ParQSym}, and some bases of \text{ParSym} and \text{ParQSym} by analogy with some distinguished bases of \text{NSym} and \text{QSym}.</description>

Abstract: This paper shows that a Poisson algebra is nilpotent if and only if it is both associative and Lie nilpotent and examines various properties of the nilradical and the solvable radical. It introduces a basic Frattini theory for dialgebras and then investigates a more detailed theory for Poisoon algebras.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster algebras are subquotients of cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Cluster Algebras (GCA) are generalizations of Cluster Algebras (CA) with higher-order exchange relations. Previously, Chekhov-Shapiro conjectured that every GCA can be embedded into a CA. In this paper, we prove a modified version of this conjecture by providing a construction that realizes a given GCA as subquotient of some CA, as an algebra over the ground ring of the GCA via restriction of scalars.</description>

      <title>Phase space of a Poisson algebra and the induced Pre-Poisson bialgebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first introduce the notion of a phase space of a Poisson algebra, and show that a Poisson algebra has a phase space if and only if it is sub-adjacent to a pre-Poisson algebra. Moreover, we introduce the notion of Manin triples of pre-Poisson algebras and show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between Manin triples of pre-Poisson algebras and phase spaces of Poisson algebras. Then we introduce the notion of pre-Poisson bialgebras, which is equivalent to Manin triples of pre-Poisson algebras. We study coboundary pre-Poisson bialgebras, which leads to an analogue of the classical Yang-Baxter equation. Furthermore, we introduce the notions of quasi-triangular and factorizable pre-Poisson bialgebras as special cases. A quasi-triangular pre-Poisson bialgebra gives rise to a relative Rota-Baxter operator of weight $1$. The double of a pre-Poisson bialgebra enjoys a natural factorizable pre-Poisson bialgebra structure. Finally, we introduce the notion of quadratic Rota-Baxter pre-Poisson algebras and show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between quadratic Rota-Baxter pre-Poisson algebras and factorizable pre-Poisson bialgebras. Based on this construction, we give a phase space for a Rota-Baxter symplectic Poisson algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.11841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Kupershmidt operators, Nijenhuis operators, and Kupershmidt-Nijenhuis structures on finite-dimensional pre-Malcev algebras over a field of characteristic zero. We construct several new families of complex pre-Malcev algebras that are not pre-Lie algebras in dimensions two, three and four. We use the compatibility of linear operators to establish connections between Kupershmidt operators, Nijenhuis operators, and Kupershmidt-Nijenhuis structures on pre-Malcev algebras. Moreover, we use a method from computational ideal theory to characterize the geometric structures of the varieties of Kupershmidt operators and Nijenhuis operators on a three-dimensional complex pre-Malcev algebra.</description>

      <title>Partially Alternative Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05850v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel generalization of the classical property of algebras known as "being alternative," which we term "partially alternative." This new concept broadens the scope of alternative algebras, offering a fresh perspective on their structural properties. We showed that partially alternative algebras exist in any even dimension. Then we classified middle $\mathbb C$-associative (noncommutative) algebras satisfying partial alternativity condition. We demonstrated that for any four-dimensional partially alternative real division algebra, one can select a basis that significantly simplifies its multiplication table. Furthermore, we established that every four-dimensional partially alternative real division algebra naturally gives rise to a real Lie algebra, thereby bridging these two important algebraic frameworks. Our work culminates in a description of all Lie algebras arising from such partially alternative algebras. These results extend our understanding of algebraic structures and reveal new connections between different types of algebras.</description>

      <title>The higher-order hom-associative Weyl algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the higher-order Weyl algebras over a field of characteristic zero, which are formally rigid as associative algebras, can be formally deformed in a nontrivial way as hom-associative algebras. We also show that these hom-associative Weyl algebras arise naturally as hom-associative iterated differential polynomial rings, that they contain no nonzero zero divisors, are power associative only when associative, and that they are simple. We then determine their commuters, nuclei, centers, and derivations. Last, we classify all hom-associative Weyl algebras up to isomorphism and conjecture that all nonzero homomorphisms between any two isomorphic hom-associative Weyl algebras are isomorphisms. The latter conjecture turns out to be stably equivalent to the Generalized Dixmier Conjecture, and hence also to the Jacobian Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck rings of ordered subgroups of $\mathbb{Q}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a proper subgroup of $\mathbb{Q}$ and $S_G$ be the set of primes $p$ for which $G$ is $p$-divisible. We show that the model-theoretic Grothendieck ring of the ordered abelian group $(G;+,&lt;)$ is a quotient of $(\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z})[T]/(T+T^2)$, where $q$ is the largest odd integer that divides $p-1$ for all $p \notin S_G$.
  This implies that the Grothendieck ring of $(G;+,&lt;)$ is trivial in various salient cases, for example when $S_G$ is finite, or when $S_G$ does not contain some prime of the form $2^n+1$, $n\in \mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing Auslander's formulas, I. Fundamental sequences associated with additive functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any additive functor from modules (or, more generally, from an abelian category with enough projectives or injectives), we construct long sequences tying up together the derived functors, the satellites, and the stabilizations of the functor. For half-exact functors, the obtained sequences are exact. For general functors, nontrivial homology may only appear at the derived functors. Specializing to the familiar Hom and tensor product functors on finitely presented modules, we recover the classical formulas of Auslander. Unlike those formulas, our results hold for arbitrary rings and arbitrary modules, finite or infinite. The same formalism leads to universal coefficient theorems for homology and cohomology of arbitrary complexes. The new results are even more explicit for the cohomology of projective complexes and the homology of flat complexes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-dimensional Reedy algebras form a ring-theoretic analogue of Reedy categories and were recently proved to be quasi-hereditary. We identify Reedy algebras with quasi-hereditary algebras admitting a triangular (or Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt type) decomposition into the tensor product of two oppositely directed subalgebras over a common semisimple subalgebra. This exhibits homological and representation-theoretic structure of the ingredients of the Reedy decomposition and it allows to give a characterisation of Reedy algebras in terms of idempotent ideals occurring in heredity chains, providing an analogue for Reedy algebras of a result of Dlab and Ringel on quasi-hereditary algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08800v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the number of positive integral points on $n$-dimensional affine varieties associated to arbitrary $n \times n$ generalized Cartan matrices. An application to the theory of cluster algebras and combinatorics is the resolution of the Fontaine-Plamondon conjecture, which says that there are exactly $4400$ and $26952$ positive integral friezes of type $E_7$ and $E_8$ respectively. An application to number theory refines and generalizes theorems of Mohanty, Mordell, and Schinzel to the positive integers and higher dimensions by exhibiting examples of Diophantine equations $xyz = G(x, y)$ and $xyzw = G(x, y, z)$ of every degree greater than $3$ with infinitely many positive integral solutions.</description>
