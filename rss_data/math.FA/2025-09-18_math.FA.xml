      <title>The double spherical cap rearrangement of planar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the proof of an isoperimetric property of the double spherical cap rearrangement of planar sets under the assumption of disconnection of non-trivial spherical slices. Additionally, the higher-dimensional case is briefly discussed; in particular, an explicit counterexample is given, thus explaining why an analogous result cannot hold.</description>

      <title>Fredholm criteria for Wiener-Hopf operators with continuous symbols acting on some Banach function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X(\mathbb{R}_{+})$ be one of the following three Banach function spaces: a Lorentz space $L^{p, q}(\mathbb{R}_{+})$ with $1 &lt; p, q &lt; \infty$; a reflexive Orlicz space $L^{\Phi}(\mathbb{R}_{+})$; or a variable Lebesgue space $L^{p(\cdot)}(\mathbb{R}_{+})$ with variable exponent $p(\cdot)\in \mathcal{B}_{M}(\mathbb{R})$. We extend the Fredholm criteria for Wiener-Hopf operators with continuous symbols on the Lebesgue space $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}_{+})$, $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$, obtained by Roland Duduchava in the late 1970s, to the space $X(\mathbb{R}_{+})$.</description>

      <title>Approximate isoperimetry for convex polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For all $n,\phi\in \mathbb{N}$ with $\phi\geqslant n+1$, the smallest possible isoperimetric quotient of an $n$-dimensional convex polytope that has $\phi$ facets is shown to be bounded from above and from below by positive universal constant multiples of $\max\big\{n/\sqrt{1+\log (\phi/n)},\sqrt{n}\big\}$. For all $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and $2n\leqslant \beta\in 2\mathbb{N}$, it is shown that every $n$-dimensional origin-symmetric convex polytope that has $\beta$ vertices admits an affine image whose isoperimetric quotient is at most a universal constant multiple of $\min\big\{\sqrt{\log(\beta/n)},n\big\}$, which is sharp. The weak isomorphic reverse isoperimetry conjecture is proved for $n$-dimensional convex polytopes that have $O(n)$ facets by demonstrating that any such polytope $K$ has an image $K'$ under a volume preserving matrix and a convex body $L\subseteq K'$ such that the isoperimetric quotient of $L$ is at most a universal constant multiple of $\sqrt{n}$, and also $\sqrt[n]{\mathrm{vol}_n(L)/\mathrm{vol}_n(K)}$ is at least a positive universal constant.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for probability graphons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a large deviation principle (LDP) for probability graphons, which are symmetric functions from the unit square into the space of probability measures. This notion extends classical graphons and provides a flexible framework for studying the limit behavior of large dense weighted graphs. In particular, our result generalizes the seminal work of Chatterjee and Varadhan (2011), who derived an LDP for Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs via graphon theory. We move beyond their binary (Bernoulli) setting to encompass arbitrary edge-weight distributions. Specifically, we analyze the distribution on probability graphons induced by random weighted graphs in which edges are sampled independently from a common reference probability measure supported on a compact Polish space. We prove that this distribution satisfies an LDP with a good rate function, expressed as an extension of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between probability graphons and the reference measure. This theorem can also be viewed as a Sanov-type result in the graphon setting. Our work provides a rigorous foundation for analyzing rare events in weighted networks and supports statistical inference in structured random graph models under distributional edge uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Nearly invariant subspaces and kernels of Toeplitz operators on the Hardy space over the bidisk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the analysis of nearly invariant subspaces and kernels of Toeplitz operators on the Hardy space over the bidisk is developed. Firstly, we transcribe Chalendar, Chevrot and Partington's result to vector-valued Hardy space $H^{2}_{\ma{H}}(\mathbb{D})$ when $\ma{H}$ is an infinite dimensional separable complex Hilbert space. Secondly, we explore the definition of nearly invariant subspaces on Hardy space over the bidisk, and apply it to characterize kernels of Toeplitz operators. Finally, we define the nearly invariant subspaces for commutative isometric tuples, which allows us to show that the kernel of general Toeplitz operators is also nearly invariant.</description>

      <title>Isometric Representation of Lipschitz-Free Spaces over Connected Orientable Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Lipschitz-Free Space over a connected orientable $n$-di\-men\-sio\-nal Riemannian manifold $M$ is isometrically isomorphic to a quotient of $L^1(M,TM)$, the integrable sections of the tangent bundle $TM$, if $M$ is either complete or lies isometrically inside a complete manifold $N$. Two functions are deemed equivalent in this quotient space if their difference has distributional divergence zero.
  This quotient is the pre-annihilator of the exact essentially bounded currents, and if $M$ is simply connected, one may replace ``exact'' with ``closed'' currents.</description>

      <title>$k$-Quasi $n$-Power Posinormal Operators: Theory and Weighted Conditional Type Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces and investigates the class of \textit{$k$-quasi $n$-power posinormal operators} in Hilbert spaces, generalizing both posinormal and $n$-power posinormal operators. We establish fundamental properties including matrix representations in $2 \times 2$ block form, tensor product preservation ($T\otimes S$ remains in the class when $T,S$ are), and complete characterizations for weighted conditional type operators $\tTwu := wE(uf)$ on $L^2(\Sigma)$. Key theoretical contributions include a structural decomposition theorem for operators with non-dense range, spectral properties, invariant subspace behavior, and interactions with isometric operators. For weighted operators, we derive explicit conditions for $k$-quasi $n$-power posinormality in terms of weight functions $w,u$ and their conditional expectations. The work bridges abstract operator theory with concrete applications, particularly in conditional expectation analysis, while significantly extending posinormal operator theory. The results provide new tools for operator analysis with potential applications in spectral theory, functional calculus, and mathematical physics. Concrete examples throughout the paper illustrate the theory, and the framework opens new research directions in operator theory and its applications, offering both theoretical insights and practical computational tools for analyzing this important class of operators in Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Algebraic and Graphical Analysis of H-Toeplitz operators on Fock space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of H-Toeplitz operators on the Fock space, a class of operators that synthesizes structural elements of both Toeplitz and Hankel operators. We derive explicit matrix representations for these operators with respect to the standard orthonormal basis of monomials, providing a foundational tool for their analysis. Central to our investigation are the algebraic and spectral properties of these operators. We establish precise conditions for commutativity, particularly for operators with harmonic symbols, and prove that non-zero H-Toeplitz operators cannot be Hilbert-Schmidt. Furthermore, we develop a Mellin transform-based framework to characterize the hyponormality and normality of operators with quasi-homogeneous symbols, deriving verifiable analytical criteria. Finally, we introduce the novel concept of directed H-Toeplitz graphs to visualize the adjacency relations encoded by the matrix structure of these operators. This graphical representation reveals distinct and interpretable patterns in indegree and outdegree sequences, offering a new combinatorial lens through which to understand their structure. Our results forge a significant connection between the analytic theory of operators on function spaces and the discrete structures of graph theory, enriching both fields.</description>

Abstract: We establish weighted weak-type bounds for the Bergman projection with respect to Bekoll\'e-Bonami characteristics. We present two proofs of an improved quantitative weak-type $(1,1)$ estimate, as well as sharp weak-type $(p,p)$ bounds for $p&gt;1$ and mixed weighted weak-type $(1,1)$ inequalities. Our results, which hold for a wide class of simple domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$, are new even in the classical settings of the upper half-plane and the unit disk.</description>

      <title>The Riemannian hemisphere is almost calibrated in the injective hull of its boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.04498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exact differential two-form is constructed in the injective hull of the Riemannian circle, whose comass norm, defined via the inscribed Riemannian area on normed planes, is stationary at every point of the open hemisphere spanned by the circle. As a consequence, in any metric space, the induced Finsler mass of a two-dimensional Ambrosio-Kirchheim rectifiable current with boundary a Riemannian circle of length $2\pi$ admits a lower bound of $2\pi$ plus a second-order term in the Hausdorff distance to an isometric copy of the hemisphere. This estimate applies to all oriented Lipschitz surfaces spanning the circle, regardless of their topology, and thus offers positive evidence for Gromov's filling area conjecture.</description>

      <title>Bernstein-Szeg\H{o} measures in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a class of Bernstein-Szeg\H{o} measures on $\mathbb{R}^2$ and we establish their spectral properties, providing a natural extension of the one-dimensional theory. We also derive conditions involving finitely many moments, which are new in the two-dimensional setting, and which completely characterize these measures. A key ingredient in the theory on the real line stems from the fact that a measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}$ determines a unique sequence of orthonormal polynomials which gives a simple formula for $d\mu/dx $ in the Bernstein-Szeg\H{o} family. Since there is no canonical way to introduce orthonormal polynomials in the plane, our extension is based on a new identity which connects a Fej\'er-Riesz factorization of the weight to a polynomial depending on three variables associated with $\mu$. Using recent results in the bivariate trigonometric Fej\'er-Riesz factorization problem, we define a nontrivial two-dimensional extension of the Szeg\H{o} mapping which provides explicit orthonormal bases of the spaces associated with Bernstein-Szeg\H{o} measures on $\mathbb{R}^2$. An important part of the paper is devoted to a self-contained development of the Bernstein-Szeg\H{o} theory for matrix-valued functionals. The proofs combine techniques from real analysis, complex analysis and algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional magnetic Laplacian when the magnetic field is allowed to be complex-valued. Under the assumption that the imaginary part of the magnetic potential is relatively form-bounded with respect to the real part of the magnetic Laplacian, we introduce the operator as an m-sectorial operator. In two dimensions, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee that the resolvent is compact. In the case of non-critical complex magnetic fields, a WKB approach is used to construct semiclassical pseudomodes, which do not exist when the magnetic field is real-valued.</description>

Abstract: We study evolutionary equations in exponentially weighted $\mathrm{L}^{2}$-spaces as introduced by Picard in 2009. First, for a given evolutionary equation, we explicitly describe the $\nu$-adjoint system, which turns out to describe a system backwards in time. We prove well-posedness for the $\nu$-adjoint system. We then apply the thus obtained duality to introduce and study notions of null-controllability for evolutionary equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06854v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the system of elastic waves with critical space dependent damping $V(x)$. We study the Cauchy problem for this model in the $2$-dimensional Euclidean space ${\bf R}^{2}$, and we obtain faster decay rates of the total energy as time goes to infinity. In the $2$-D case we do not have any suitable Hardy type inequality, so generally one has no idea to establish optimal energy decay. We develope a special type of multiplier method combined with some estimates brought by the $2$-D Newton potential belonging to the usual Laplacian $-\Delta$, not the operator $-a^2\Delta - (b^{2}-a^{2})\nabla {\rm div}$ itself. The property of finite speed propagation is important to get results for this system.</description>

      <title>Linear Convergence of Gradient Descent for Quadratically Regularized Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In optimal transport, quadratic regularization is an alternative to entropic regularization when sparse couplings or small regularization parameters are desired. Here quadratic regularization means that transport couplings are penalized by the squared $L^2$ norm, or equivalently the $\chi^2$ divergence. While a number of computational approaches have been shown to work in practice, quadratic regularization is analytically less tractable than entropic, and we are not aware of a previous theoretical convergence rate analysis. We focus on the gradient descent algorithm for the dual transport problem in continuous and semi-discrete settings. This problem is convex but not strongly convex; its solutions are the potential functions that approximate the Kantorovich potentials of unregularized optimal transport. The gradient descent steps are straightforward to implement, and stable for small regularization parameter -- in contrast to Sinkhorn's algorithm in the entropic setting. Our main result is that gradient descent converges linearly; that is, the $L^2$ distance between the iterates and the limiting potentials decreases exponentially fast. Our analysis centers on the linearization of the gradient descent operator at the optimum and uses functional-analytic arguments to bound its spectrum. These techniques seem to be novel in this area and are substantially different from the approaches familiar in entropic optimal transport.</description>

      <title>A Kernel-based Stochastic Approximation Framework for Nonlinear Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a stochastic approximation framework for learning nonlinear operators between infinite-dimensional spaces utilizing general Mercer operator-valued kernels. Our framework encompasses two key classes: (i) compact kernels, which admit discrete spectral decompositions, and (ii) diagonal kernels of the form $K(x,x')=k(x,x')T$, where $k$ is a scalar-valued kernel and $T$ is a positive operator on the output space. This broad setting induces expressive vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) that generalize the classical $K=kI$ paradigm, thereby enabling rich structural modeling with rigorous theoretical guarantees. To address target operators lying outside the RKHS, we introduce vector-valued interpolation spaces to precisely quantify misspecification error. Within this framework, we establish dimension-free polynomial convergence rates, demonstrating that nonlinear operator learning can overcome the curse of dimensionality. The use of general operator-valued kernels further allows us to derive rates for intrinsically nonlinear operator learning, going beyond the linear-type behavior inherent in diagonal constructions of $K=kI$. Importantly, this framework accommodates a wide range of operator learning tasks, ranging from integral operators such as Fredholm operators to architectures based on encoder-decoder representations. Moreover, we validate its effectiveness through numerical experiments on the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations.</description>
