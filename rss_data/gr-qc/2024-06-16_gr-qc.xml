      <title>Effect of magnetized plasma on shadow and gravitational lensing of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the influence of the axion-plasmon on the optical properties of the charged black hole and show how the axion-plasmon coupling modifies the motion of photons around the charged black hole. We then explore in details observational effects such as the black hole shadow, the gravitational deflection angle, Einstein rings and shadow images obtained by radially infalling gas on a black hole within a plasma medium. An important finding is that the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation increases with the increase of charge and the size of the black hole shadow decreases with increase of the electric charge for a fixed axion-plasmon coupling values when observed from sufficiently large distance. Overall, for a constant value of charge the optical appearance of the black hole shadow depends on the surrounding plasma model and the largest shadow radius if found for the case of no plasma, while the smallest shadow radius is found for the case of homogeneous plasma.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Generalization of the {\Lambda}CDM Universe Model with Application to the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I deduce an exact and analytic Bianchi type I solution of Einsteins field equations, which generalizes the isotropic LambdaCDM universe model to a corresponding model with anisotropic expansion. The main point of the article is to present the anisotropic generalization of the LambdaCDM universe model in a way suitable for investigating how anisotropic expansion modifies observable properties of the LambdaCDM universe model. Although such generalizations of the isotropic LambdaCDM universe model have been considered earlier, they have never been presented in this form before. Several physical properties of the model are pointed out and compared with properties of special cases, such as the isotropic LambdaCDM universe model. The solution is then used to investigate the Hubble tension. It has recently been suggested that the cosmic largescale anisotropy may solve the Hubble tension. I consider those earlier suggestions and find that the formulae of these papers lead to the result that the anisotropy of the cosmic expansion is too small to solve the Hubble tension. Then, I investigate the problem in a new way, using the exact solution of the field equations. This gives the result that the cosmic expansion anisotropy is still too small to solve the Hubble tension in the general Bianchi type I universe with dust and LIVE (Lorentz Invariant Vacuum Energy with a constant energy density, which is represented by the cosmological constant) and anisotropic expansion in all three directions even if one neglects the constraints coming from the requirement that the anisotropy should be sufficiently small so that it does not have any significant effect upon the results coming from the calculations of the comic nucleosynthesis during the first ten minutes of the universe. If this constraint is taken into account, the cosmic expansion anisotropy is much too small to solve the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Three-space as a quantum hyper-layer in 1+3 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a formalism where a universe is identified with the support of a wave function propagating through space-time. As opposed to classical cosmology, the resulting universe is not a spacelike section of some space-time, but a hyper-layer of a finite timelike width, a set which is not a three-dimensional submanifold of space-time. We test the formalism on the example of a universe that contains a single harmonic oscillator (a generalization of the curvature-dependent Cari\~nena-Ra\~nada-Santander (CRS) model). As opposed to the original CRS formulation, here the curvature is not a parameter but a quantum observable, a function of the world-position operator. It is shown that asymptotically, for large values of the invariant evolution parameter $\tau$, one reconstructs the standard quantum results, with one modifiication: The effective (renormalized) mass of the oscillator decreases with $\tau$. The effect does not seem to be a peculiarity of harmonic oscillators, so one may speculate that masses of distant elementary quantum systems are greater from their values known from our quantum mechanical measurements.</description>

      <title>Shadow and strong gravitational lensing of new wormhole solutions supported by embedding Class-I condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study deals with the new class of embedded wormhole solutions in the background of general relativity. Two newly calculated wormhole solutions satisfy all the required properties. All the energy conditions are discussed through their validity regions for the different ranges of involved parameters. In maximum regions, all energy conditions are violated. We investigate the shadow and strong gravitational lensing by the wormhole throat for the two new wormhole models, namely Model-I and Model-II. The present paper considers the wormhole throat to act as a photon sphere. We first derive null geodesics using the Hamilton-Jacobi separation method to investigate the shadow and strong gravitational lensing caused by the wormhole throat. We then numerically obtain the radius of wormhole shadow, strong deflection angle, and various lensing observables by taking the example of supermassive black M87* and Sgr A* in the context of both Model-I and Model-II. Keeping all other parameters fixed, it is observed that the parameters $\zeta_1$ and $\zeta_2$ for Model-I; and $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$ for Model-II have significant effects on the wormhole shadow and strong gravitational lensing phenomena. Our conclusion is that it is possible to detect relativistic images, such as Einstein rings, produced by wormholes with throat radii of $r_{th}=3M$. Additionally, current technology enables us to test hypotheses related to astrophysical wormholes.</description>

      <title>The Black Hole Explorer: Photon Ring Science, Detection and Shape Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General relativity predicts that black hole images ought to display a bright, thin (and as-of-yet-unresolved) ring. This "photon ring" is produced by photons that explore the strong gravity of the black hole, flowing along trajectories that experience extreme light bending within a few Schwarzschild radii of the horizon before escaping. The shape of the photon ring is largely insensitive to the precise details of the emission from the astronomical source surrounding the black hole and therefore provides a direct probe of the Kerr geometry and its parameters. The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) is a proposed space-based experiment targeting the supermassive black holes M87* and Sgr A* with radio-interferometric observations at frequencies of 100 GHz through 300 GHz and from an orbital distance of ~30,000 km. This design will enable measurements of the photon rings around both M87* and Sgr A*, confirming the Kerr nature of these sources and delivering sharp estimates of their masses and spins.</description>

      <title>Boundary terms and on-shell action in Ricci-based gravity theories: the Hamiltonian formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the so-called Ricci-based gravity theories, a family of extensions of General Relativity whose action is given by a non-linear function of contractions and products of the (symmetric part of the) Ricci tensor of an independent connection, the Hamiltonian formulation of the theory is obtained. To do so, the independent connection is decomposed in two parts, one compatible with a metric tensor and the other one given by a 3-rank tensor. Subsequently, the Riemann tensor is expressed in terms of its projected components onto a hypersurface, allowing to construct the $3+1$ decomposition of the theory and the corresponding Gauss-Codazzi relations, where the boundary terms naturally arise in the gravitational action. Finally, the ADM decomposition is followed in order to construct the corresponding Hamiltonian and the ADM energy for any Ricci-based gravity theory. The formalism is applied to the simple case of Schwarzschild space-time.</description>

      <title>Metric-affine cosmological models and the inverse problem of the calculus of variations. Part II: Variational bootstrapping of the $\Lambda$CDM model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The method of variational bootstrapping, based on canonical variational completion, allows one to construct a Lagrangian for a physical theory depending on two sets of field variables, starting from a guess of the field equations for only one such set. This setup is particularly appealing for the construction of modified theories of gravity since one can take lessons from GR for the "educated guess" of the metric field equations; the field equations for the other fields are then fixed by the obtained Lagrangian (up to terms completely independent from the metric tensor). In the present paper, we explore the applications of variational bootstrapping in the context of metric-affine theories of gravity. We find those metric-affine models which are, in a variational sense, closest to the $\Lambda$CDM model of cosmology. The method then allows to find "corrected" metric equations and to "bootstrap" the connection field equations. The Lagrangians obtained via this method, though imposing some restricting criteria, encompass a wide variety of metric-affine models. In particular, they allow for quadratic metric-affine theories only if these avoid non-linear terms in the curvature tensor.</description>

      <title>Rotating black holes experience dynamical tides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the tidal response of a rotating black hole from the Teukolsky equation in the near-horizon and small-frequency regime. While the static tidal Love number of an arbitrarily rotating black hole is still zero, the dynamical tidal Love number is not; rather, it is proportional to the angular velocity of the black hole -- in the linear order of frequency -- and to the square of the angular velocity of the black hole -- in the zeroth order. Intriguingly, the zero-frequency limit of the dynamical tidal response function is not equal to the static tidal response function. We demonstrate that these results hold true for an extremal rotating black hole as well, with the dynamical tidal Love numbers being non-zero. This shows that Kerr black holes experience dynamical tides.</description>

      <title>Implications of a Scalar Field Interacting with the Dark Matter Fluid on the Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the implications of a scalar field interacting with the dark matter fluid on the energy spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves. We choose an interaction type which before a critical matter density $\rho_m^c$ during the reheating era or early radiation domination era, the scalar field loses energy transferring it to the dark matter fluid, while after the critical matter density $\rho_m^c$ the dark matter fluid loses energy transferring it to the scalar field. The scalar field is assumed to have an exponential potential and at the critical matter density with $\rho_m\sim \rho_m^c$, at which point, the interaction between the scalar and the dark matter fluid is switched off, we demand that the effective equation of state of scalar field is described by a matter dominated era. This is crucial since it affects the behavior of the trajectories and the fixed points of the two dimensional dynamical system composed by the dark matter fluid and the scalar field. Specifically the phase space contains two stable dark matter dominated final attractors and two unstable stiff era dominated fixed points. Thus, there exists the remarkable possibility that the Universe might feel the passing of the scalar field through the unstable kinetic dominated fixed points, during the reheating era, with the total equation of state parameter of the Universe being deformed to be larger than $w=1/3$. This deformation of the total equation of state parameter during the reheating era can potentially have significant effects on the energy spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves. Also the model we use also contains an $F(R)$ gravity which controls in a dominant way inflation and the late-time acceleration, in a phenomenologically viable way.</description>

      <title>The Virgo Newtonian calibration system for the O4 observing run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After initial tests performed during previous observing runs, a Newtonian Calibrator (NCal) system was developed and installed on the Virgo gravitational wave detector for the O4 observing run. This system, which is continuously operated, provides the absolute calibration of Virgo for this run. Its uncertainty of 0.17% on the amplitudes of the injected signals is better than that obtained with other calibration techniques like the photon calibrator (PCal). This paper presents this NCal system and details the different sources of uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions, shadows, and microstructure of Reissner-Nordstr\"om-Anti-de-Sitter black holes from a geometrothermodynamic perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole with cosmological constant, expressed in terms of the curvature radius, by using the approach of shadow thermodynamics and the formalism of geometrothermodynamics. We derive explicit expressions for the shadow radius in terms of the horizon, photon sphere, and observer radii. The phase transition structure turns out to strongly depend on the value of the curvature radius, including configurations with zero, one, or two phase transitions. We also analyze the black hole microscopic structure and find differences between the approaches of thermodynamic geometry and geometrothermodynamics, which are due to the presence of the curvature radius. We impose the important condition that the black hole is a quasi-homogeneous thermodynamic system to guarantee the consistency of the geometrothermodynamic approach.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of slowly-spinning horizonless compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main predictions of general relativity is the existence of black holes featuring a horizon beyond which nothing can escape. Gravitational waves from the remnants of compact binary coalescences have the potential to probe new physics at the BH horizons. This prospect is of particular interest given several quantum-gravity models that predict the presence of horizonless compact objects. The membrane paradigm is a generic framework that allows one to parametrise the interior of compact objects in terms of the properties of a fictitious fluid located at the object's radius. It has been used to derive the quasinormal mode spectrum of static horizonless compact objects. Extending the membrane paradigm to rotating objects is crucial to constrain the properties of the spinning merger remnants. In this work, we extend the membrane paradigm to linear order in spin and use it to analyse the relationships between the quasi-normal modes, the reflectivity, and the membrane parameters. We find that the spin tends to increase the damping time of the fundamental mode for reflective ultracompact objects. We also find a breaking of isospectrality between axial and polar modes, and that the spin enhances the deviations from the black hole quasinormal mode spectrum as the compactness decreases. We thus show that spinning horizonless compact objects may be more easily differentiated than nonspinning ones in the prompt ringdown.</description>

      <title>Black string solutions in Lifshitz spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study black string solutions considering the Lifshitz anisotropic scaling. We have shown that a new class of asymptotically Lifshitz solutions can be generated by an Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory with a cosmological constant. In the limit where we recover conformal scale invariance, we retrieve the usual black string solution. Furthermore, we demonstrated that to incorporate the effects of electric charge in the black string, at least two independent gauge fields coupled to the dilaton field are necessary. The charged black string solution exhibits new horizons that depend on the potential in Lifshitz exponent $z$. The stability of these new solutions is investigated through the thermodynamic analysis of the charged black string. The temperature, entropy, and heat capacity indicate that these modified black strings are thermodynamically stable.</description>

      <title>On Twisted Spacetimes: a new class of Galilean cosmological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the generalized Newton-Cartan theory, Galilean Twisted spacetimes are introduced as dual models of the well-known relativistic twisted spacetimes. As a natural generalization, torqued vector fields in Galilean spacetimes are defined, showing that the local structure of a Galilean spacetime admitting a timelike torqued vector field is given by a Twisted spacetime. In addition, several results assuring the global splitting as Twisted spacetime are obtained. On the other hand, completeness of free falling observers is studied, as well as general geodesic completeness.</description>

      <title>PSALTer: Particle Spectrum for Any Tensor Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the PSALTer software for efficiently computing the mass and energy of the particle spectrum for any (e.g. higher-rank) tensor field theory in the Wolfram Language. The user must provide a Lagrangian density which is expanded quadratically in the fields around a Minkowski vacuum, is linear in the coupling coefficients, and otherwise built from the partial derivative and Minkowski metric. PSALTer automatically computes the spin-projection operators, saturated propagator, bare masses, residues of massive and massless poles and overall unitarity conditions in terms of the coupling coefficients. The constraints on the source currents and total number of gauge symmetries are produced as a by-product. We provide examples from scalar, vector, tensor and gauge theories of gravity. Each example, including spectra of higher-spin modified gravity theories, may be obtained on a personal computer in a matter of minutes. The software is also parallelised for use on high-performance computing resources. The initial release allows for parity-preserving operators constructed from fields of up to rank three: this functionality will be extended in future versions. PSALTer is a contribution to the xAct project.</description>

      <title>On the genericity of singularities in spacetimes with weakly trapped submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate suitable, physically motivated conditions on spacetimes containing certain submanifolds - the so-called {weakly trapped submanifolds} - that ensure, in a set of neighboring metrics with respect to a convenient topology, that the phenomenon of nonspacelike geodesic incompleteness (i.e., the existence of singularities) is generic in a precise technical sense. We obtain two sets of results. First, we use strong Whitney topologies on spaces of Lorentzian metrics on a manifold $M$, in the spirit of Lerner, and obtain that while the set of singular Lorentzian metrics around a fiducial one possessing a weakly trapped submanifold $\Sigma$ is not really generic, it is nevertheless prevalent in a sense we define, and thus still quite ``large'' in this sense. We prove versions of that result both for the case when $\Sigma$ has codimension 2, and for the case of higher codimension.
  The second set of results explore a similar question, but now for initial data sets containing MOTS. For this case, we use certain well-known infinite dimensional, Hilbert manifold structures on the space of initial data and use abstract functional-analytic methods based on the work of Biliotti, Javaloyes, and Piccione to obtain a true genericity of null geodesic incompleteness around suitable initial data sets containing MOTS.</description>

      <title>On the fidelity of information retrieval in the black hole final state model with scrambling interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fidelity of information retrieval in the black hole final state model by taking into account the interactions between the collapsing matter and the infalling Hawking radiation inside the event horizon. By utilizing a scrambling unitary operator to model these interactions, our direct calculations suggest that the information is almost lost during the process of black hole evaporation. We then proceed to employ the Yoshida-Kitaev decoding strategy for information retrieval. Although we observe a finite improvement in decoding fidelity, it does not reach unity. This indicates that the issue of unitarity in black hole evaporation may not be fully resolved within the framework of the final state model.</description>

      <title>Indefinitely Flat Circular Velocities and the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation from Weak Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a new deprojection formula to infer the gravitational potential around isolated galaxies from weak gravitational lensing. The results imply circular velocity curves that remain flat for hundreds of kpc, greatly extending the classic result from 21 cm observations. Indeed, there is no clear hint of a decline out to 1 Mpc, well beyond the expected virial radii of dark matter halos. Binning the data by mass reveals a correlation with the flat circular speed that closely agrees with the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation known from kinematic data. These results apply to both early and late type galaxies, indicating a common universal behavior.</description>

      <title>Fitting the DESI BAO Data with Dark Energy Driven by the Cohen--Kaplan--Nelson Bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravity constrains the range of validity of quantum field theory. As has been pointed out by Cohen, Kaplan, and Nelson (CKN), such effects lead to interdependent ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) cutoffs that may stabilize the dark energy of the universe against quantum corrections, if the IR cutoff is set by the Hubble horizon. As a consequence of the cosmic expansion, this argument implies a time-dependent dark energy density. In this paper we confront this idea with recent data from DESI BAO, Hubble and supernova measurements. We find that the CKN model provides a better fit to the data than the $\Lambda$CDM model and can compete with other models of time-dependent dark energy that have been studied so far.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a contribution to a memorial volume, we provide a comprehensive discussion of resonant configurations in analogue gravity, focusing on its implementation in atomic condensates and combining review features with original insights and calculations. In particular, we analyze the analogues of the Andreev and Hawking effects using a microscopic description based on the Bogoliubov approximation. We contemplate several resonant scenarios whose efficiency to enhance anomalous scattering processes is compared to that of non-resonant setups. The presence of quantum signatures in analogue configurations, such as the violation of Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities or entanglement, is analyzed, observing that resonant configurations highly increase the entanglement signal, especially for the Andreev effect. We also discuss how these results have served as inspiration for the rapidly expanding field of quantum information in high-energy colliders. Finally, we study the physics of black-hole lasers as further examples of resonant analogue structures, distinguishing three stages in its time evolution. For short times, we compute the linear and non-linear spectrum for different models. For intermediate times, we generalize the current analysis of the BHL-BCL crossover. For long times, we discuss the emerging concept of spontaneous Floquet state and its potential implications.</description>

Abstract: Within the framework of geometric inflation, where the Friedmann equation is modified to incorporate an infinite series of higher curvature corrections, we describe the emergence of a de Sitter inflationary phase near the poles of an arbitrary dynamical function. Our analysis is quite general and does not depend on any specific choice of cosmological dynamics.</description>

      <title>The impact of a primordial gravitational wave background on LISA resolvable sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of a primordial stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) is a common prediction in various models of the early Universe. Despite constraints at different frequency ranges and claims of detection in the nHz range by Pulsar Timing Arrays, the amplitude and spectral dependence of the SGWB in the mHz range remain largely unknown. Plausible models of early Universe Physics predict a wide range of SGWB amplitudes, from undetectable to exceeding the constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. This paper explores the potential impact of a prominent primordial SGWB on LISA's main scientific targets. Our main analyses focuses on Massive Black Hole Binaries (MBHBs). By employing publicly available MBHB population models and state-of-the-art LISA's forecasting pipeline, we analyze the effects of the SGWB on MBHB detections. We find that the decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio induced by a strong primordial GWB can significantly reduce the number of detectable events, compromise the precision of constraints, and even hinder sky localization for some events. We also examine the impact of the SGWB on Stellar Origin Black Hole Binaries (SOBHBs) and Galactic Binaries (GBs), which are fainter sources than MBHBs. Depending on the spectral properties of the SGWB, we conclude that these sources could be either marginally affected or rendered completely undetectable. This largely unexplored aspect raises critical questions about the potential challenges posed by a prominent SGWB to LISA's astrophysical objectives, including MBHBs, SOBHBs, and GBs.</description>

      <title>The quantumness of relic gravitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the relic gravitons are produced in entangled states of opposite (comoving) three-momenta, their distributions and their averaged multiplicities must determine the maximal frequency of the spectrum above which the created pairs are exponentially suppressed. The absolute upper bound on the maximal frequency derived in this manner coincides with the THz domain and does not rely on the details of the cosmological scenario. The THz limit also translates into a constraint of the order of $10^{-33}$ on the minimal chirp amplitudes that should be effectively reached by all classes of hypothetical detectors aiming at the direct scrutiny of a signal in the frequency domain that encompasses the MHz and the GHz bands. The obtained high-frequency limit is deeply rooted in the quantumness of the produced gravitons whose multiparticle final sates are macroscopic but always non-classical. Since the unitary evolution preserves their coherence, the quantumness of the gravitons can be associated with an entanglement entropy that is associated with the loss of the complete information on the underlying quantum field. It turns out that the reduction of the density matrix in different bases leads to the same Von Neumann entropy whose integral over all the modes of the spectrum is dominated by the maximal frequency. Thanks to the THz bound the total integrated entropy of the gravitons can be comparable with the cosmic microwave background entropy but not larger. Besides the well known cosmological implications, we then suggest that a potential detection of gravitons between the MHz and the THz may therefore represent a direct evidence of macroscopic quantum states associated with the gravitational field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Asymptotic Safety Hypothesis for gravity relies on the existence of an interacting fixed point of the Wilsonian renormalization group flow, which controls the microscopic dynamics, and provides a UV completion of the theory. Connecting such UV completion to observable physics has become an active area of research in the last decades. In this work we show such connection within the framework of scalar-tensor models. More specifically, we found that cosmological inflation naturally emerges from the integration of the RG flow equations, and that the predicted parameters of the emergent effective potentials provide a slow-roll model of inflation compatible with current observations. Furthermore, the RG evolution of the effective action starting at the UV fixed point, provides a prediction for the initial value of the inflaton field.</description>

      <title>On the first test of the Weak Equivalence Principle in low Earth orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06400v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Weak Equivalence Principle is the founding pillar of General Relativity and as such should be verified as precisely as possible. The Microscope experiment tested it in low Earth orbit, finding that Pt and Ti test masses fall toward Earth with the same acceleration to about 1e-15, an improvement of about two orders of magnitude over ground tests. Space missions, even if small, are expensive and hard to replicate; yet, the essence of physics is repeatability. This work is an assessment of the Microscope results based on the laws of physics and knowledge from previous experiments, focusing on the limiting thermal noise and the treatment of acceleration outliers. Thermal noise reveals anomalies that we explain by stray sub-microVolt potentials caused by patch charges, giving rise to an unstable zero. The measurements were affected by numerous acceleration spikes occurring at the synodic frequencies relative to the Earth (the signal frequency) and the Sun, which we interpret as evidence of a thermal origin. In Microscope authors' analysis, the spikes were removed and the resulting gaps replaced with artificial data (up to 35, 40 per cent of the sessions data), which retain memory of the gaps and may simulate or cancel an effect (signal or systematic). An alternative approach based exclusively on real measured data would avoid any ambiguity. The lessons of Microscope are crucial to any futures improved mission.</description>

Abstract: We study the quasinormal modes (QNM) for scalar, and electromagnetic perturbations in the Schwarzschild black hole with a deficit solid angle and quintessence-like matter. Using the sixth--order WKB approximation and the improved asymptotic iteration method (AIM) we can determine the dependence of the quasinormal modes on the parameters of the black hole and the parameters on the test fields. The values of the real part and imaginary parts of the quasi--normal modes increase with the decrease of the values of the deficit solid angle and density of quintessence-like matter. The quasinormal modes gotten by these two methods are in good agreement. Using the finite difference method, we obtain the time evolution profile of such perturbations in this Black Hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06208v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the gravitational memory effect in pp-wave spacetimes due to the passage of a pulse having the form of a ramp profile through this spacetime. We have analyzed the effect of this pulse on the evolution of nearby geodesics, and have determined analytical solutions of the geodesic equations in the Brinkmann coordinates. We have also examined the changes in the separation between a pair of geodesics and their velocity profiles. The separation (along $ x $ or $ y $-direction) increases monotonically from an initial constant value. In contrast, the relative velocity grows from zero and settles to a final non-zero constant value. These resulting changes are retained as memory after the pulse dies out. The nature of this memory is similar to that determined by earlier workers using Gaussian, square, and other pulse profiles, thereby validating the universality of gravitational wave memory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space-borne gravitational wave (GW) detectors can detect the merger of massive black holes. The early warning and localization of GW events before merging can be used to inform electromagnetic telescopes and conduct multimessenger observations. However, this requires real-time data transmission and analysis capabilities. The geocentric orbit of the space-borne GW detector TianQin makes it possible to conduct real-time data transmission. In this study, we develop a search and localization pipeline for massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with TianQin under both regular and real-time data transmission modes. We demonstrate that, with real-time data transmission, MBHBs can be accurately localized on the fly. With the approaching merger, each analysis can be finished in only 40 min. For an MBHB system at a distance of 1 Gpc, if we receive data every hour, then we can pinpoint its location to within less than 1 deg$^2$ on the final day before the merger.</description>

      <title>First constraint on the dissipative tidal deformability of neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by neutron star binaries probe the physics of matter at supra nuclear densities. During the late inspiral, tidal deformations raised on each star by the gravitational field of its companion depend crucially on the star's internal properties. The misalignment of a star's tidal bulge with its companion's gravitational field encodes the strength of internal dissipative processes, which imprint onto the phase of the gravitational waves emitted. We here analyze GW data from the GW170817 (binary neutron star) event detected by LIGO and Virgo and find the first constraint on the dissipative tidal deformability of a neutron star. From this constraint, \emph{assuming} a temperature profile for each star in the binary, we obtain an order of magnitude bound on the averaged bulk ($\zeta$) and shear ($\eta$) viscosity of each star during the inspiral.: $\zeta \lesssim 10^{31} \mathrm{g}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $\eta \lesssim 10^{28} \mathrm{g}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1} $. We forecast that these bounds could be improved by two orders of magnitude with third-generation detectors, like Cosmic Explorer, using inspiral data. These constraints already inform nuclear physics models and motivate further theoretical work to better understand the interplay between viscosity and temperature in the late inspiral of neutron stars.</description>

Depending on where the bubble is re-attached, matter may travel superluminally or backwards-in-time through the bubble. Quasiregular singularities are formed at the detachment and re-attachment spacetime points. The spacetime is traversable and not covered by any horizons. Exotic matter violating energy conditions is required to realize such spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of holographic dark energy with apparent-horizon cutoff and non-minimal derivative coupling gravity in non-flat FLRW universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background cosmological dynamics for a universe with matter, a scalar field non-minimally derivative coupling to Einstein tensor under power-law potential and holographic vacuum energy is considered here. The holographic IR cutoff scale is apparent horizon which, for accelerating universe, forms a trapped null surface in the same spirit as blackhole's event horizon. For non-flat case, effective gravitational constant cannot be expressed in the Friedmann equation. Therefore holographic vacuum density is defined with standard gravitational constant instead of the effective one. Dynamical and stability analysis shows four independent fixed points. One fixed point is stable and it corresponds to $w_{\text{eff}} = -1$. One branch of the stable fixed-point solutions corresponds to de-Sitter expansion. The others are either unstable or saddle nodes. Numerical integrations of the dynamical system are performed and plotted confronting with $H(z)$ data. It is found that for flat universe, $H(z)$ observational data favors large negative value of NMDC coupling, $\kappa$. Larger holographic contribution, $c$, and larger negative NMDC coupling increase slope and magnitude of the $w_{\text{eff}}$ and $H(z)$. Negative $\kappa$, can contribute to phantom equation of state, $w_{\text{eff}} &lt; -1$. The NMDC-spatial curvature coupling could have phantom energy contribution. Free negative spatial curvature term can also contribute to phantom equation of state, but only with significantly large negative value of the spatial curvature. The model could give phantom equation of state for $\kappa = -200$ and high value of $c$ for both flat and open cases.</description>

      <title>Tidal deformations of slowly spinning isolated horizons</title>

Abstract: It is generally believed that tidal deformations of a black hole in an external field, as measured using its gravitational field multipoles, vanish. However, this does not mean that the black hole horizon is not deformed. Here we shall discuss the deformations of a black hole horizon in the presence of an external field using a characteristic initial value formulation. Unlike existing methods, the starting point here is the black hole horizon itself. The effect of, say, a binary companion responsible for the tidal deformation is encoded in the geometry of the spacetime in the vicinity of the horizon. The near horizon spacetime geometry, i.e. the metric, spin coefficients, and curvature components, are all obtained by integrating the Einstein field equations outwards starting from the horizon. This method yields a reformulation of black hole perturbation theory in a neighborhood of the horizon. By specializing the horizon geometry to be a perturbation of Kerr, this method can be used to calculate the metric for a tidally deformed Kerr black hole with arbitrary spin. As a first application, we apply this formulation here to a slowly spinning black hole and explicitly construct the spacetime metric in a neighborhood of the horizon. We propose natural definitions of the electric and magnetic surficial Love numbers based on the Weyl tensor component $\Psi_2$. From our solution, we calculate the tidal perturbations of the black hole, and we extract both the field Love numbers and the surficial Love numbers which quantify the deformations of the horizon.</description>

      <title>Thin accretion disk and shadow of Kerr-Sen black hole in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the accretion process in a thin disk surrounding a supermassive black hole in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion (EMDA) gravity by using the Novikov-Thorne model. The results reveal that as the dilaton parameter $r_2$ increase, the energy flux, radiation temperature, spectra luminosity, and radiative efficiency of the disk all increases. By narrowing down the dilaton parameter range to $0\leqslant \frac{r_2}{M}\leqslant0.4$, we discover that in the high-frequency region, the Kerr-Sen black hole demonstrates higher energy output compared to the Kerr black hole. We also investigated the Kerr-Sen black hole shadow in a uniform plasma environment. For a fixed inclination angle of $\theta_0=90^\circ$, $\frac{r_2}{M} = \frac{a}{M} = 0.5$, the shadow increase as the homogeneous plasma parameter $k$ increase. Conversely, when $k = 0.1$ and $\frac{a}{M} = 0.5$, an increase in $r_2$ leads to a decrease in the shadow. Furthermore, by using observational data from M87* and Sgr A*, we compared the theoretical and observed shadow diameters to constrain the range of the model parameters.</description>

Abstract: Nilpotent deformations of an arbitrary background spacetime are considered . Those are of the form $\bg_{\m\n}+ l_\m l_\n$ with $l^2=0$. The relationship between the Ricci tensor of the background metric and the Ricci tensor of the deformed metric is found exactly. It consists of two terms. one is essentially the Fierz-Pauli operator, and the other is new. When the background is flat, the Kerr-Schild family is recovered. Novel examples for more general backgrounds are discussed.</description>

      <title>The role of the irreducible mass in repetitive Penrose energy extraction processes in a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of the irreducible mass ($M_{\rm irr}$) has led to the mass-energy ($M$) formula of a Kerr-Newman black hole (BH), in turn leading to an expression for its surface area $S=16\pi M_{\rm irr}^2$. This allowed as well the coeval identification of the reversible and irreversible transformations. The concepts of \textit{extracted} and \textit{extractable} energy soon followed. This new conceptual framework avoids inconsistencies recently evidenced in a repetitive Penrose process. We consider repetitive decays in the ergosphere of an initially extreme Kerr BH and show that these processes are highly irreversible. For each decay, including the BH capture of the particle falling into the horizon, the increase of the irreducible mass is much larger than the extracted energy. Correspondingly, the horizon radius increases. The energy extraction process saturates and stops when the horizon reaches the decay radius. Thus, reaching a final non-rotating Schwarzschild BH state by this accretion process is impossible. We have assessed such processes for three selected decay radii, $r= 1.2 M$, $1.5 M$, and $1.9 M$. The energy extracted until saturation is only $2.75\%$, $4.54\%$, and $2.45\%$ of the BH initial mass, while the extractable energy is reduced by $25\%$, $56\%$, and $92\%$. The BH rotational energy is mostly converted into irreducible mass, which increases to $75\%$, $83\%$, and $95\%$ of the initial BH mass. Therefore, evaluating the effect of the irreducible mass increase in the energy extraction processes in the Kerr BH ergosphere is now mandatory.</description>

      <title>Categorical Quantum Volume Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generalization of the quantum volume operator quantifying the volume in curved three-dimensional discrete geometries. In its standard form, the quantum volume operator is constructed from tetrahedra whose faces are endowed with irreducible representations of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. Here, we show two equivalent constructions that allow general objects in fusion categories as degrees of freedom. First, we compute the volume operator for ribbon fusion categories. This includes the important class of modular tensor categories (such as quantum doubles), which are the building blocks of anyon models. Second, we further generalize the volume operator to spherical fusion categories by relaxing the categorical analog of the closure constraint (known as tetrahedral symmetry). In both cases, we obtain a volume operator that is Hermitian, provided that the input category is unitary. As an illustrative example, we consider the case of $\mathrm{SU}(2)_k$ and show that the standard $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ volume operator is recovered in the limit $k\rightarrow\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.05611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) trapped inside an expanding toroid that can realize an analogue inflationary universe. As the system expands, we find that phonons in the BEC undergo redshift and damping due to quantum pressure effects, owing to the thinness of the ring. We predict that rapidly expanding toroidal BEC's can exhibit spontaneous particle creation, and study this phenomenon in the context of an initial coherent state wavefunction. We show how particle creation would be revealed in the atom density and density correlations, and discuss connections to the cosmological theory of inflation.</description>

      <title>Causal evolution of probability measures and continuity equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.02552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the notion of a causal time-evolution of a conserved nonlocal physical quantity in a globally hyperbolic spacetime $\mathcal{M}$. The role of the `global time' is played by a chosen Cauchy temporal function $\mathcal{T}$, whereas the instantaneous configurations of the nonlocal quantity are modeled by probability measures $\mu_t$ supported on the corresponding time slices $\mathcal{T}^{-1}(t)$. We show that the causality of such an evolution can be expressed in three equivalent ways: (i) via the causal precedence relation $\preceq$ extended to probability measures, (ii) with the help of a probability measure $\sigma$ on the space of future-directed continuous causal curves endowed with the compact-open topology and (iii) through a causal vector field $X$ of $L^\infty_{\textrm{loc}}$-regularity, with which the map $t \mapsto \mu_t$ satisfies the continuity equation in the distributional sense. In the course of the proof we find that the compact-open topology is sensitive to the differential properties of the causal curves, being equal to the topology induced from a suitable $H^1_{\textrm{loc}}$-Sobolev space. This enables us to construct $X$ as a vector field in a sense `tangent' to $\sigma$. In addition, we discuss the general covariance of descriptions (i)-(iii), unraveling the geometrical, observer-independent notions behind them.</description>

      <title>Covariant cosmography: the observer-dependence of the Hubble parameter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09875v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The disagreement between low- and high-redshift measurements of the Hubble parameter is emerging as a serious challenge to the standard model of cosmology. We develop a covariant cosmographic analysis of the Hubble parameter in a general spacetime, which is fully model-independent and can thus be used as part of a robust assessment of the tension. Here our focus is not on the tension but on understanding the relation between the physical expansion rate and its measurement by observers -- which is critical for model-independent measurements and tests. We define the physical Hubble parameter and its multipoles in a general spacetime and derive for the first time the covariant boost transformation of the multipoles measured by a heliocentric observer. The analysis is extended to the covariant deceleration parameter. Current cosmographic measurements of the expansion anisotropy contain discrepancies and disagreements, some of which may arise because the correct transformations for a moving observer are not applied. A heliocentric observer will detect a dipole, generated not only by a Doppler effect, but also by an aberration effect due to shear. In principle, the observer can measure both the intrinsic shear anisotropy and the velocity of the observer relative to the matter -- without any knowledge of peculiar velocities, which are gauge dependent and do not arise in a covariant approach. The practical implementation of these results is investigated in a follow-up paper. We further show that the standard cosmographic relation between the Hubble parameter, the redshift and the luminosity distance (or magnitude) is not invariant under boosts and holds only in the matter frame. A moving observer who applies the standard cosmographic relation should correct the luminosity distance by a redshift factor -- otherwise an incorrect dipole and a spurious octupole are predicted.</description>

      <title>Natural Metric-Affine Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider here natural inflation in the low energy (two-derivative) metric-affine theory containing only the minimal degrees of freedom in the inflationary sector, i.e. the massless graviton and the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (PNGB). This theory contains the Ricci-like and parity-odd Holst invariants together with non-minimal couplings between the PNGB and the above-mentioned invariants. The Palatini and Einstein-Cartan realizations of natural inflation are particular cases of our construction. Explicit models of this type featuring non-minimal couplings are shown to emerge from the microscopic dynamics of a QCD-like theory with an either sub-Planckian or trans-Planckian confining scale and that is renormalizable on Minkowski spacetime. Moreover, for these models, we find regions of the parameter space where the inflationary predictions agree with the most recent observations at the $2\sigma$ level. We find that in order to enter the $1\sigma$ region it is necessary (and sufficient) to have a finite value of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and a sizable non-minimal coupling between the inflaton and the Holst invariant (with sign opposite to the Barbero-Immirzi parameter). Indeed, in this case the potential of the canonically normalized inflaton develops a plateau as shown analytically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study holographic supersymmetric Renyi entropies from a family of hyperbolic black holes in an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD) system under the BPS condition. We calculate the thermodynamic quantities of these hyperbolic black holes. We find a remarkably simple formula of the supersymmetric Renyi entropy that unifies (interpolates) 11 cases embeddable to 10 or 11 dimensional supergravity. It reproduces many known results in the literature, and gives new results with distinctive features. We show that the supersymmetric version of the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement cannot be mapped to thermal quantities, due to the dependence of the temperature and the chemical potential by the BPS condition. We also calculate the entanglement spectrum. We derive the potential of the EMD system from a $V=0$ solution and obtain two neutral solutions with scalar hair as a byproduct.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Casimir effect of a wedge and its holographic dual. We prove that the displacement operator universally determines the wedge Casimir effect in the smooth limit. Besides, we argue that the wedge Casimir energy increases with the opening angle and test it with several examples. Furthermore, we construct the holographic dual of wedges in AdS/BCFT in general dimensions. We verify that our proposal can produce the expected Casimir effect within smooth and singular limits. We observe that the Casimir energy density of a wedge increases with the brane tension. Next, we discuss the wedge contribution to holographic entanglement entropy and find it increases with the opening angle, similar to the wedge Casimir energy. Finally, we briefly discuss the holographic polygon in AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$ and its generalization to higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that a complex coordinate transformation maps the Taub-NUT instanton metric to a Kerr-Schild metric. This metric involves a semi-infinite line defect as a gravitational analog of the Dirac string, much like the original metric. Also, it corresponds to self-dual dyon in electromagnetism through three versions of classical double copy, one of them being a novel nonlocal operator form. The relevance to Newman-Janis algorithm is briefly noted.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to memory of late Professor V. G. Bagrov, who was my first teacher in theoretical physics. About 45 years later, theoretical physics has changed and me too. The subject of this paper relates some old ideas in cosmology with some recent ideas, as is reflected in the title. The current status of Starobinsky inflation is reviewed and compared to three main conjectures in the Swampland program. It is argued that the Starobinsky inflation model is not in conflict with those Swampland conjectures in their basic versions.</description>
