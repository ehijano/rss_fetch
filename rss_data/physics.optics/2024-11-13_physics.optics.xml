      <title>Unbounded Tellegen Response in Media with Multiple Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tellegen response is a special type of nonreciprocal magneto-electric coupling which long remained elusive in photonics and extremely weak in condensed matter. It is widely accepted that the Tellegen coefficient is restricted by $\chi^2&lt;\varepsilon\mu$, where $\varepsilon$ and $\mu$ are permittivity and permeability of the material. Here, we demonstrate that this restriction is lifted in the medium with several close resonances, which provides a theoretical foundation for giant Tellegen response.</description>

      <title>Hybrid skin-topological effect in non-Hermitian checkerboard lattices with large Chern numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian topology provides a research frontier for exploring topological phenomena, revealing novel topological effects and driving the development of emergent materials and platforms. Here, we explore the non-Hermitian Chern insulator phases and the hybrid skin-topological effects in checkerboard lattices with synthetic gauge fluxes. Such lattices can be realized in integrated silicon photonic nanocircuits and microresonators as well as in arrays of evanescently coupled helical optical waveguides. With a simple and tunable design, the system is found to support non-Hermitian hybrid skin topological effects, exhibiting corner skin effects when the lattice symmetry either $C_4$ or $C_2$. An unconventional physical mechanism is revealed as the origin of such a transition which is connected to the corner-induced scattering between the multiple chiral edge channels. These properties are enabled by the large Chern number and the rich non-Hermitian topological edge states in our system, revealing the diverse non-Hermitian topological bulk-boundary correspondence. Our design offers excellent controllability and experimental feasibility, making it appealing for studying non-Hermitian topological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Laguerre-Gaussian modes become elegant after an azimuthal phase modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes are solutions of the paraxial Helmholtz equation in cylindrical coordinates and are associated with light fields carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM). It is customary to modulate such beams using phase-only vortex profiles, for example, when increasing (laddering up) or decreasing (laddering down) the OAM content of some given LG mode. However, the resulting beams have been shown to be hypergeometric-Gaussian modes, due to the changing radial amplitudes on propagation. In this work, we show that these beams in fact have the angular spectrum of elegant Laguerre-Gaussian (eLG) modes, and therefore map back to LG-type modes. Accordingly, the fields obtain new OAM and radial quantum numbers that depend on the initial OAM and additional OAM gained during modulation.</description>

      <title>Topological resilience of optical skyrmions in local decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of skyrmions was introduced as early as the 1960s by Tony Skyrme. The topologically protected configuration embedded in skyrmions has prompted some investigations into their fundamental properties and versatile applications, sparking interest and guiding ongoing development. The topological protection associated with skyrmions was initially observed in systems with interactions. It is widely believed that skyrmions are stable yet relevant confirmation and empirical research remains limited. A pertinent question is whether skyrmion configurations formed by single-particle wave functions also exhibit topological stability. In this study, we affirm this hypothesis by investigating the effects of local decoherence. We analytically and numerically demonstrate the topological resilience of skyrmions and occurrence of transition points of skyrmion numbers in local decoherence of three typical decoherence channels. On the other hand, we show that these qualities are independent of the initial state. From the numerical results, we verify that inhomogeneous but continuous decoherence channels also adhere to the same behaviors and hold topological stability of skyrmions as homogeneous decoherence channels. These properties of skyrmions contribute to further applications in various areas including communication and imaging.</description>

      <title>Triad of Equivalence Theorems for the Radiant Intensity of Partially Coherent Beams on Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using Laplace's method for double integrals and the so-called beam condition obeyed by a partially coherent beamlike light field, we report the equivalence theory (ET) of partially coherent beams on scattering for the first time. We present the necessary and sufficient condition for the two scattered fields that have the same normalized radiant intensity distribution when Gaussian Schell-model beams whose effective beam widths are much greater than the effective transverse spectral coherence lengths are scattered by Gaussian Schell-model media. We find that the condition contain three implications, and each of them corresponds to a statement of an ET of radiant intensity in a scattering scenario, which exposes the concept of a previously unreported triad of ETs for the radiant intensity of partially coherent beams on scattering. We further find that the existing ET of plane waves on scattering, which only asserts that two scatterers with scattering potentials' correlations whose low-frequency antidiagonal spatial Fourier components are identical, essentially is merely the first member of our triad of ETs, while the other two hidden important members are completely ignored. Our findings are crucial for the inverse scattering problem since they contribute to avoid possible reconstruction errors in realistic situations, where the light field used to illuminate an unknown object is a partially coherent beam rather than an idealized plane wave.</description>

      <title>Heralded pure single-photon sources using nanophotonic waveguides with quadratic and cubic nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents, to our knowledge, a new approach in developing integrated pure heralded single-photon sources based on the interplay between the spontaneous four-wave mixing and sum-frequency generation parametric processes. We introduce a comprehensive quantum model to exploit this interplay in AlGaAs and LiNbO$_3$ nanophotonic waveguides. The developed model is used to assess the performance of the sources based on the photon-pair generation and the associated spectral purity. We find that this approach can remarkably improve the spectral purity of low-pure generated photon pairs, relaxing the restrictions on the structure design and the used pump wavelength. In addition, it overcomes the current hurdles in implementing on-chip photon detectors operating at room temperature, paving the way for advanced applications in integrated quantum photonics and information processing.</description>

      <title>Quasiannealed Monte Carlo method for light transport in strongly heterogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random-walk Monte Carlo simulations are widely used to predict the optical properties of complex, disordered materials. In presence of large heterogeneities (e.g., spatially-extended nonscattering regions in a turbid environment), an explicit description of the micro and macrostructures and of the light propagation therein is generally required, in addition to a statistical average over a representative set of microstructures, thereby making simulations in so-called ``quenched'' disorder particularly time-consuming. We explore here the possibility to model light transport in finite-size strongly heterogeneous media without an explicit description of the underlying microstructure but from the knowledge of typical random-walk trajectories in infinite-size media, that take correlations between successive interaction events into account. Simulations may thus be performed for media of any macroscopic shape and size more efficiently. We illustrate this approach, coined ``quasiannealed'', with the case of a two-phase emulsion consisting of transparent spherical droplets dispersed in a turbid medium. Good agreement with predictions from simulations in quenched disorder on the reflectance of finite-thickness slab is found for a large set of microstructure properties and thicknesses with typical errors on the reflectance on the order of a percent.</description>

      <title>Computational refocusing in phase-resolved confocal microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate numerical refocusing in coherent confocal laser scanning microscopy based on synthetic optical holography. This physics-based approach implements a computational propagation on the complex signal recovered in synthetic holography consistent with the wave physics and the parameters of the microscope. An experimental demonstration is shown to restore an in-focus image of a test object from data acquired at several focal plane off-sets. Numerical refocusing can provide focused views on samples with large height variation with a potential application in confocal optical surface profiling.</description>

      <title>Beam quality $M^2(\psi)$ factor, spot rotation angle, and angular speed in general laser beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unified definition for the rotation angle and rotation angular speed of general beams, including those with orbital angular momentum (OAM), has been lacking until now. The rotation of a general beam is characterized by observing the rotational behavior of the directions of the extreme spot sizes during propagation. We introduce the beam quality $M^2(\psi)$ factor to characterize the unique beam quality of a general beam across all directions, not limited to the $x$- or $y$-axes. Besides that, we present the beam center $s_{\psi}(\psi,z)$, spot size $w_{\psi}(\psi,z)$, waist position, waist radius, and divergence angle along the direction that forms an angle $\psi$ with the $x$-axis in the plane perpendicular to the $z$-axis for the general beam. Furthermore, this paper presents rapid calculation formulas for these parameters, utilizing the mode expansion method (MEM). Subsequently, we prove that only two extreme spot sizes exist in a given detection plane and the angle between the maximum and minimum spot angles is consistently $90^{\circ}$ during the propagation. We also prove the spot rotation angles converge as $z$ approaches either positive or negative infinity. We first show the extreme spot sizes, spot rotation angle, and angular speed for the vortex beam. Our formulas efficiently differentiate between vortex OAM beams and asymmetry OAM beams.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated Inverse Lithography Towards High Quality Curvy Mask Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse Lithography Technology (ILT) has emerged as a promising solution for photo mask design and optimization. Relying on multi-beam mask writers, ILT enables the creation of free-form curvilinear mask shapes that enhance printed wafer image quality and process window. However, a major challenge in implementing curvilinear ILT for large-scale production is mask rule checking, an area currently under development by foundries and EDA vendors. Although recent research has incorporated mask complexity into the optimization process, much of it focuses on reducing e-beam shots, which does not align with the goals of curvilinear ILT. In this paper, we introduce a GPU-accelerated ILT algorithm that improves not only contour quality and process window but also the precision of curvilinear mask shapes. Our experiments on open benchmarks demonstrate a significant advantage of our algorithm over leading academic ILT engines.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metrology for Gravitational Wave Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein's General Theory of Relativity predicts that accelerating mass distributions produce gravitational radiation, analogous to electromagnetic radiation from accelerating charges. These gravitational waves have not been directly detected to date, but are expected to open a new window to the Universe in the near future. Suitable telescopes are kilometre-scale laser interferometers measuring the distance between quasi free-falling mirrors. Recent advances in quantum metrology may now provide the required sensitivity boost. So-called squeezed light is able to quantum entangle the high-power laser fields in the interferometer arms, and could play a key role in the realization of gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Detection of 15 dB Squeezed States of Light and their Application for the Absolute Calibration of Photoelectric Quantum Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Squeezed states of light belong to the most prominent nonclassical resources. They have compelling applications in metrology, which has been demonstrated by their routine exploitation for improving the sensitivity of a gravitational-wave detector since 2010. Here, we report on the direct measurement of 15 dB squeezed vacuum states of light and their application to calibrate the quantum efficiency of photoelectric detection. The object of calibration is a customized InGaAs positive intrinsic negative (p-i-n) photodiode optimized for high external quantum efficiency. The calibration yields a value of 99.5% with a 0.5% (k = 2) uncertainty for a photon flux of the order 10^17/s at a wavelength of 1064 nm. The calibration neither requires any standard nor knowledge of the incident light power and thus represents a valuable application of squeezed states of light in quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>SoundSil-DS: Deep Denoising and Segmentation of Sound-field Images with Silhouettes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Development of optical technology has enabled imaging of two-dimensional (2D) sound fields. This acousto-optic sensing enables understanding of the interaction between sound and objects such as reflection and diffraction. Moreover, it is expected to be used an advanced measurement technology for sonars in self-driving vehicles and assistive robots. However, the low sound-pressure sensitivity of the acousto-optic sensing results in high intensity of noise on images. Therefore, denoising is an essential task to visualize and analyze the sound fields. In addition to denoising, segmentation of sound and object silhouette is also required to analyze interactions between them. In this paper, we propose sound-field-images-with-object-silhouette denoising and segmentation (SoundSil-DS) that jointly perform denoising and segmentation for sound fields and object silhouettes on a visualized image. We developed a new model based on the current state-of-the-art denoising network. We also created a dataset to train and evaluate the proposed method through acoustic simulation. The proposed method was evaluated using both simulated and measured data. We confirmed that our method can applied to experimentally measured data. These results suggest that the proposed method may improve the post-processing for sound fields, such as physical model-based three-dimensional reconstruction since it can remove unwanted noise and separate sound fields and other object silhouettes. Our code is available at https://github.com/nttcslab/soundsil-ds.</description>

      <title>Stochastic resonance in vibrational polariton chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of ambient noise intensity on the rate modifications of ground-state chemical reactions in an optical cavity under vibrational strong-coupling conditions. To achieve this, we utilize a numerically exact open quantum system approach--the hierarchical equations of motion in twin space, combined with a flexible tree tensor network state solver. Our findings reveal a stochastic resonance phenomenon in cavity-modified chemical reactivities: an optimal reaction rate enhancement occurs at an intermediate noise level. In other words, this enhancement diminishes if ambient noise, sensed by the cavity-molecule system through cavity leakage, is either too weak or excessively strong. In the collective coupling regime, when the cavity is weakly damped, rate enhancement strengthens as more molecules couple to the cavity. In contrast, under strong cavity damping, reaction rates decline as the number of molecules grows.</description>

      <title>Collective multimode strong coupling in plasmonic nanocavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanocavities enable access to the quantum properties of matter, but are often simplified to single mode models despite their complex multimode structure. Here, we show that off-resonant plasmonic modes in fact play a crucial role in strong coupling, and determine the onset of a novel collective interaction. Our analysis reveals that $n$ strongly coupled plasmonic modes, introduce up to $n(n+1)/2$ oscillation frequencies that depend on their coupling strengths and detunings from the quantum emitter. Furthermore, we identify three distinct regions as the coupling strength increases: (1) single mode, (2) multimode, and (3) collective multimode strong coupling. Our findings enhance the understanding of quantum dynamics in realistic plasmonic environments and demonstrate their potential to achieve ultra-fast energy transfer in light-driven quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Near-field refractometry of van der Waals crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common techniques for measuring refractive indices, such as ellipsometry and goniometry, are ineffective for van der Waals crystal flakes because of their high anisotropy and small, micron-scale, lateral size. To address this, we employ near-field optical microscopy to analyze the guided optical modes within these crystals. By probing these modes in MoS$_2$ flakes with subwavelength spatial resolution at a wavelength of $1570\,\mathrm{nm}$, we determine both the in-plane and out-of-plane permittivity components of MoS$_2$ as $16.11$ and $6.25$, respectively, with a relative uncertainty below $1\%$, while overcoming the limitations of traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Expanding momentum bandgaps in photonic time crystals through resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The realization of photonic time crystals is a major opportunity but also comes with significant challenges. The most pressing one, potentially, is the requirement for a substantial modulation strength in the material properties to create a noticeable momentum bandgap. Reaching that noticeable bandgap in optics is highly demanding with current, and possibly also future, material platforms since their modulation strength is small by tendency. Here, we demonstrate that by introducing temporal variations in a resonant material, the momentum bandgap can be drastically expanded with modulation strengths in reach with known low-loss materials and realistic laser pump powers. The resonance can emerge from an intrinsic material resonance or a suitably spatially structured material supporting a structural resonance. Our concept is validated for resonant bulk media and optical metasurfaces and paves the way toward the first experimental realizations of photonic time crystals.</description>

      <title>On-Chip Cross-Polarization Backward SBS in Lithium Niobate Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the experimental demonstration of cross-polarization backward stimulated Brillouin scattering (BSBS) in lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) waveguides. Performing polarization-sensitive pump and probe measurements, we captured both intra and intermodal scattering between counter-propagating fundamental optical modes. Remarkably, cross-polarization scattering achieved SBS gains exceeding $G_{B}=$80m$^{-1}$W$^{-1}$. This substantial gain not only broadens the utility of polarization in SBS but also paves the way for high-performance devices, including ultra-narrowband lasers, robust non-reciprocal components, RF filters, and microwave-to-optical converters.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing nanoparticles in the intensity minimum: feedback levitation on an inverted potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the stable trapping of a levitated nanoparticle on top of an inverted potential using a combination of optical readout and electrostatic control. The feedback levitation on an inverted potential (FLIP) method stabilizes the particle at an intensity minimum. By using a Kalman-filter-based linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control method, we confine a particle to within $\sigma_x = (9.0 \pm 0.5) nm$ of the potential maximum at an effective temperature of $(16 \pm 1) K$ in a room-temperature environment. Despite drifts in the absolute position of the potential maximum, we can keep the nanoparticle at the apex by estimating the drift from the particle dynamics using the Kalman filter. Our approach may enable new levitation-based sensing schemes with enhanced bandwidth. It also paves the way for optical levitation at zero intensity of an optical potential, which alleviates decoherence effects due to material-dependent absorption and is hence relevant for macroscopic quantum experiments.</description>

      <title>Transverse orbital angular momentum of amplitude-perturbed fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review and clarify several recent theoretical approaches to transverse orbital angular momentum (tOAM). We then apply our tOAM theory [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021)] to calculate the spatiotemporal torque applied to a light pulse by a pure amplitude perturbation. The theoretical results and associated simulations are in excellent agreement with experiments measuring the change in tOAM per photon, delta_Ly. The crucial factor in determining delta_Ly is the spatiotemporal distribution of tOAM density in the pulse. We show that even Gaussian pulses with zero total tOAM can have net tOAM induced by an amplitude perturbation stationary in the lab frame.</description>

      <title>A quantum picture of light-suppressed photosynthetic charge transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a dynamic mechanism for the reversible regulation of photosynthesis in varying light environments. We employ a three-level quantum model to take into account the correlations between charge donors and charge acceptors immediately before photoexcitation, and show that under continuous illumination, the transfer efficiency of a single charge is inversely proportional to the intensity of light, which can be suppressed so severely that it becomes a limiting factor on linear electron transport. This result is used to derive a set of analytical expressions that characterize the light response curves of photosynthetic parameters, including that of gross photosynthetic rate which saturates in high light and has long been assumed to obey a Michaelis-Menten function. We discuss the implications of thermal fluctuation in the light source, and argue that at a given intensity of light, the quantum yields measured with an incandescent lamp may be higher than those measured with a laser, a manifestation of thermal fluctuation in lamp illumination. Our new picture helps understand the observed plastocyanin-dependent electron transport in photosystem I and provides a donor-side scheme for the onset of irreversible damage to photosystem II by visible light.</description>

      <title>Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg interference in edge state pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The adiabatic edge state pumping (ESP) in one dimensional model, which has important applications in topological phase transition and quantum simulation, has been widely performed in both theories and experiments. This phenomenon has been observed in some systems with sizes $L = 9 - 100$, and it seems that due to the topological protection, the ESP can be survived even in the presence of weak random potential. Yet the fundamental issues of adiabaticity for this process have not been clarified. In this paper, we revisit this problem and show that this process involves two non-adiabatic points during the transition between the edge state and bulk state, yielding non-abadiatic physics. As a result, the ESP can be described by the Landau-Zener-St\"{u}ckelberg (LZS) interference process, in which the relative phase between the edge state and the bulk state determine the fate of the edge state during pumping. Furthermore, in a relatively long chain with weak disorder, the ESP can break down due to the anti-crossing of the edge state and the bulk edge states. We unveil these physics in terms of non-adiabaticity. The new mechanisms for ESP unveiled in this work is readily accessible in experiment, and shall therefore offer a down-to-earth platform for the intriguing LZS dynamics in terms of edge states.</description>

      <title>Trapping of Single Atoms in Metasurface Optical Tweezer Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have emerged as a key experimental platform for quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology, enabling unprecedented levels of control over single atoms and molecules. Existing methods to generate tweezer arrays mostly rely on active beam-shaping devices, such as acousto-optic deflectors or liquid-crystal spatial light modulators. However, these approaches have fundamental limitations in array geometry, size, and scalability. Here we demonstrate the trapping of single atoms in optical tweezer arrays generated via holographic metasurfaces. We realize two-dimensional arrays with more than 250 tweezer traps, arranged in arbitrary geometries with trap spacings as small as 1.5 um. The arrays have a high uniformity in terms of trap depth, trap frequency, and positional accuracy, rivaling or exceeding existing approaches. Owing to sub-micrometer pixel sizes and high pixel densities, holographic metasurfaces open a path towards optical tweezer arrays with &gt;100,000 traps, facilitating tweezer-array based quantum applications that require large system sizes.</description>
