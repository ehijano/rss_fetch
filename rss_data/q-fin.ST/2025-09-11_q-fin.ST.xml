      <title>Note on pre-taxation reported data by UK FTSE-listed companies. A search for Benford's laws compatibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-taxation analysis plays a crucial role in ensuring the fairness of public revenue collection. It can also serve as a tool to reduce the risk of tax avoidance, one of the UK government's concerns. Our report utilises pre-tax income ($PI$) and total assets ($TA$) data from 567 companies listed on the FTSE All-Share index, gathered from the Refinitiv EIKON database, covering 14 years, i.e., the period from 2009 to 2022. We also derive the $PI/TA$ ratio, and distinguish between positive and negative $PI$ cases. We test the conformity of such data to Benford's Laws,- specifically studying the first significant digit ($Fd$), the second significant digit ($Sd$), and the first and second significant digits ($FSd$). We use and justify two pertinent tests, the $\chi^2$ and the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD). We find that both tests are not leading to conclusions in complete agreement with each other, - in particular the MAD test entirely rejects the Benford's Laws conformity of the reported financial data. From the mere accounting point of view, we conclude that the findings not only cast some doubt on the reported financial data, but also suggest that many more investigations be envisaged on closely related matters. On the other hand, the study of a ratio, like $PI/TA$, of variables which are (or not) Benford's Laws compliant add to the literature debating whether such indirect variables should (or not) be Benford's Laws compliant.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Communicability and Connectivity in the Indian Stock Market During Crises</title>

Abstract: Understanding how information flows through the financial networks is important, especially during times of market turbulence. Unlike traditional assumptions where information travels along the shortest paths, real-world diffusion processes often follow multiple routes. To capture this complexity, we apply communicability, a network measure that quantifies the ease of information flow between nodes, even beyond the shortest path. In this study, we aim to examine how communicability responds to structural disruptions in financial networks during periods of high volatility. We compute communicability-based metrics on correlation-derived networks constructed from financial market data, and apply statistical testing through permutation methods to identify significant shifts in network structure. Our results show that approximately 70\% and 80\% of stock pairs exhibit statistically significant changes in communicability during the global financial crisis and the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis, respectively, at a significance level of 0.001. The observed shifts in shortest communicability path lengths offer directional cues about the nature and depth of each crisis. Furthermore, when used as features in machine learning classification models, communicability measures outperform the shortest-path-based measures in distinguishing between market stability and volatility periods. The performance of geometric measures was also comparable to that of topology-based measures. These findings offer valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of financial markets during times of crises and underscore the practical relevance of communicability in modeling systemic risk and information diffusion in complex networks.</description>

      <title>Identification of phase correlations in Financial Stock Market Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The basis of arbitrage methods depends on the circulation of information within the framework of the financial market. Following the work of Modigliani and Miller, it has become a vital part of discussions related to the study of financial networks and predictions. The emergence of the efficient market hypothesis by Fama, Fisher, Jensen and Roll in the early 1970s opened up the door for discussion of information affecting the price in the market and thereby creating asymmetries and price distortion. Whenever the micro and macroeconomic factors change, there is a high probability of information asymmetry in the market, and this asymmetry of information creates turbulence in the market. The analysis and interpretation of turbulence caused by the differences in information is crucial in understanding the nature of the stock market using price patterns and fluctuations. Even so, the traditional approaches are not capable of analyzing the cyclical price fluctuations outside the realm of wave structures of securities prices, and a proper and effective technique to assess the nature of the Financial market. Consequently, the analysis of the price fluctuations by applying the theories and computational techniques of mathematical physics ensures that such cycles are disintegrated, and the outcome of decomposed cycles is elucidated to understand the impression of the information on the genesis and discovery of price and to assess the nature of stock market turbulence. In this regard, the paper will provide a framework of Spectrum analysis that decomposes the pricing patterns and is capable of determining the pricing behavior, eventually assisting in examining the nature of turbulence in the National Stock Exchange of India.</description>
