      <title>The Complexity of Maximizing the MST-ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite set of red and blue points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, the MST-ratio is the combined length of the Euclidean minimum spanning trees of red points and of blue points divided by the length of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree of the union of them. The maximum MST-ratio of a point set is the maximum MST-ratio over all non-trivial colorings of its points by red and blue. We prove that the problem of finding the maximum MST-ratio of a given point set is NP-hard when the dimension is a part of the input. Moreover, we present a $O(n^2)$ running time $3$-approximation algorithm for it. As a part of the proof, we show that in any metric space, the maximum MST-ratio is smaller than $3$. Additionally, we study the average MST-ratio over all colorings of a set of $n$ points. We show that this average is always at least $\frac{n-2}{n-1}$, and for $n$ random points uniformly distributed in a $d$-dimensional unit cube, the average tends to $\sqrt[d]{2}$ in expectation as $n$ goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>New Lower Bound and Algorithms for Online Geometric Hitting Set Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hitting set problem is one of the fundamental problems in combinatorial optimization and is well-studied in offline setup. We consider the online hitting set problem, where only the set of points is known in advance, and objects are introduced one by one. Our objective is to maintain a minimum-sized hitting set by making irrevocable decisions. Here, we present the study of two variants of the online hitting set problem depending on the point set. In the first variant, we consider the point set to be the entire $\mathbb{Z}^d$, while in the second variant, we consider the point set to be a finite subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$.
  For hitting similarly sized {$\alpha$-fat objects} in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with diameters in the range $[1, M]$ using points in $\mathbb{Z}^d$, we propose a deterministic algorithm having a competitive ratio of at most ${\lfloor\frac{2}{\alpha}+2\rfloor^d}$ $\left(\lfloor\log_{2}M\rfloor+1\right)$. This improves the current best-known upper bound due to Alefkhani et al. [WAOA'23]. Then, for homothetic hypercubes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with side lengths in the range $[1, M]$ using points in $\mathbb{Z}^d$, we propose a randomized algorithm having a competitive ratio of $O(d^2\log M)$. To complement this result, we show that no randomized algorithm can have a competitive ratio better than $\Omega(d\log M)$. This improves the current best-known (deterministic) upper and lower bound of $25^d\log M$ and $\Omega(\log M)$, respectively, due to Alefkhani et al. [WAOA'23].
  Next, we consider the hitting set problem when the point set consists of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and the objects are homothetic regular $k$-gons having diameter in the range $[1, M]$. We present an $O(\log n\log M)$ competitive randomized algorithm. In particular, for a fixed $M$ this result partially answers an open question for squares proposed by Khan et al. [SoCG'23] and Alefkhani et al. [WAOA'23].</description>

      <title>Towards Instance-Optimal Euclidean Spanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Euclidean spanners are important geometric objects that have been extensively studied since the 1980s. The two most basic "compactness'' measures of a Euclidean spanner $E$ are the size (number of edges) $|E|$ and the weight (sum of edge weights) $\|E\|$. In this paper, we initiate the study of instance optimal Euclidean spanners. Our results are two-fold.
  We demonstrate that the greedy spanner is far from being instance optimal, even when allowing its stretch to grow. More concretely, we design two hard instances of point sets in the plane, where the greedy $(1+x \epsilon)$-spanner (for basically any parameter $x \geq 1$) has $\Omega_x(\epsilon^{-1/2}) \cdot |E_\mathrm{spa}|$ edges and weight $\Omega_x(\epsilon^{-1}) \cdot \|E_\mathrm{light}\|$, where $E_\mathrm{spa}$ and $E_\mathrm{light}$ denote the per-instance sparsest and lightest $(1+\epsilon)$-spanners, respectively, and the $\Omega_x$ notation suppresses a polynomial dependence on $1/x$.
  As our main contribution, we design a new construction of Euclidean spanners, which is inherently different from known constructions, achieving the following bounds: a stretch of $1+\epsilon\cdot 2^{O(\log^*(d/\epsilon))}$ with $O(1) \cdot |E_\mathrm{spa}|$ edges and weight $O(1) \cdot \|E_\mathrm{light}\|$. In other words, we show that a slight increase to the stretch suffices for obtaining instance optimality up to an absolute constant for both sparsity and lightness. Remarkably, there is only a log-star dependence on the dimension in the stretch, and there is no dependence on it whatsoever in the number of edges and weight.</description>

      <title>Towards Practical Finite Sample Bounds for Motion Planning in TAMP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When using sampling-based motion planners, such as PRMs, in configuration spaces, it is difficult to determine how many samples are required for the PRM to find a solution consistently. This is relevant in Task and Motion Planning (TAMP), where many motion planning problems must be solved in sequence. We attempt to solve this problem by proving an upper bound on the number of samples that are sufficient, with high probability, to find a solution by drawing on prior work in deterministic sampling and sample complexity theory. We also introduce a numerical algorithm to compute a tighter number of samples based on the proof of the sample complexity theorem we apply to derive our bound. Our experiments show that our numerical bounding algorithm is tight within two orders of magnitude on planar planning problems and becomes looser as the problem's dimensionality increases. When deployed as a heuristic to schedule samples in a TAMP planner, we also observe planning time improvements in planar problems. While our experiments show much work remains to tighten our bounds, the ideas presented in this paper are a step towards a practical sample bound.</description>
