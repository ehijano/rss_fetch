      <title>Open-Source Drift Detection Tools in Action: Insights from Two Use Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data drifts pose a critical challenge in the lifecycle of machine learning (ML) models, affecting their performance and reliability. In response to this challenge, we present a microbenchmark study, called D3Bench, which evaluates the efficacy of open-source drift detection tools. D3Bench examines the capabilities of Evidently AI, NannyML, and Alibi-Detect, leveraging real-world data from two smart building use cases.We prioritize assessing the functional suitability of these tools to identify and analyze data drifts. Furthermore, we consider a comprehensive set of non-functional criteria, such as the integrability with ML pipelines, the adaptability to diverse data types, user-friendliness, computational efficiency, and resource demands. Our findings reveal that Evidently AI stands out for its general data drift detection, whereas NannyML excels at pinpointing the precise timing of shifts and evaluating their consequent effects on predictive accuracy.</description>

      <title>Digital Evolution: Novo Nordisk's Shift to Ontology-Based Data Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biomedical data is growing exponentially, and managing it is increasingly challenging. While Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data principles provide guidance, their adoption has proven difficult, especially in larger enterprises like pharmaceutical companies. In this manuscript, we describe how we leverage an Ontology-Based Data Management (OBDM) strategy for digital transformation in Novo Nordisk Research &amp; Early Development. Here, we include both our technical blueprint and our approach for organizational change management. We further discuss how such an OBDM ecosystem plays a pivotal role in the organizations digital aspirations for data federation and discovery fuelled by artificial intelligence. Our aim for this paper is to share the lessons learned in order to foster dialogue with parties navigating similar waters while collectively advancing the efforts in the fields of data management, semantics and data driven drug discovery.</description>
