      <title>Log-free estimate of the full nonlinearity in the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations outside the diagonal regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the contribution of the full nonlinearity outside the narrow diagonal zone in the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. We consider the off-diagonal components, including lh, hl, as well as part of the resonant block hh -&gt; l for |xi + eta| &gt;= N^(1-delta). The proof relies on three main elements: (i) six-fold integration by parts in the phase Phi(t,x,xi,eta) = x*(xi + eta) + 4trho1rho2 with respect to (t,rho1,rho2); on the window |t| &lt;= N^(-1/2) the phase Hessian A = nabla^2_(t,rho1,rho2) Phi is non-degenerate and provides a reserve |det A| ~ N^(3/2 - delta); (ii) local Strichartz estimates on cylinders of scale N^(-1/2); in Sec. 4 a strengthened version is used to combine with the decoupling scheme, while the unconditional framework is based on heat reduction (App. D) and globalization (App. E); and (iii) bilinear epsilon-free decoupling in folded geometry of rank 4 (Appendix B), yielding a gain of N^(-1/4) for angular tiles of width N^(-1/2). For the narrow corona, suppression of the null-form type symbol is realized when delta &gt; 1/2; for the block hh -&gt; h with output projection P_N this mechanism is not required and is accounted for separately (see App. E.6). The combined count yields an a priori estimate without logarithmic losses in the norm L^1_t H^-1_x over the whole zone |xi + eta| &gt;= N^(1 - delta) for delta in (1/3, 5/8]; the upper bound is imposed by the stability of the phase reserve |det A| ~ N^(3/2 - delta) &gt;&gt; 1 on the window |t| &lt;= N^(-1/2). The full scheme and navigation through the sections are given in the text.</description>

      <title>Scattering Theory and dispersive estimates for general $1$d Charge Transfer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our study of scattering theory and dispersive properties for one-dimensional charge transfer models, namely linear Schr\"odinger equations with multiple moving potentials. By the discovery of a refined structure of the construction of distorted Fourier transforms adapted to the multi-potential framework, we remove the large-velocity separation assumption imposed in [8]. This work thus completes the full scattering theory and dispersive analysis for general one-dimensional charge transfer models. These dispersive estimates provide the foundation for analyzing asymptotic stability and collision phenomena for multi-solitons in a general setting.</description>

      <title>On ill-posedness for the Gabitov--Turitsyn equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the well- and ill-posedness theory for the Gabitov--Turitsyn equation, which models the long-time dynamics of pulses in dispersion-managed optical fibers. We identify two critical regularities, corresponding to two scaling pseudo-symmetries, that demarcate regimes of ill-posedness. First, we identify $s_m = \tfrac{d}{2} - \tfrac{2}{p},$ coinciding with the monomial NLS. For $s \geq \max(s_m,0)$, local well-posedness is known to hold in $H^s$, while for $s &lt; s_m$, we show that the data-to-solution map fails to be $C^{p+1}$ in $H^s$. Second, we identify $s_i = \tfrac{d}{2} - \tfrac{4}{p},$ below which we conjecture that norm inflation occurs. We resolve this conjecture in $H^s$ in the case $s &lt; \min (s_i, 0)$ -- specifically for the one-dimensional cubic model -- and in the case $1 \leq s &lt; s_i$. In the case $s_i \geq 1$, we establish norm inflation by showing that suitable solutions undergo {\em energy equipartition}: a rapid renormalization of kinetic and potential energy.</description>

      <title>Non-spherical minimizers in the generalized liquid drop model for Yukawa and truncated Coulomb potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate generalized liquid drop models with screened Riesz-type interactions, focusing in particular on truncated Coulomb and Yukawa potentials in three dimensions. While the classical Gamow model with Coulomb interaction is conjectured to admit only spherical minimizers below a critical mass and no minimizer above, we show that this conjecture fails if the interaction is screened. In the case of truncated Coulomb and Yukawa potentials, we establish the existence of non-spherical minimizers for some values of the screening parameter. This gives the first evidence of such minimizers in the class of repulsive, radial, and radially nonincreasing kernels in three dimensions. Our approach relies on a comparison of the energy-per-mass ratios of balls and cylinders, in contrast with recent two-dimensional results obtained via $\Gamma$-convergence. We further show that in the unscreened Riesz case, the conjecture remains consistent, though delicate. Indeed we observe that the energy-per-mass ratios of balls and of cylinders are surprisingly close.</description>

      <title>Long-time contractivity estimates for kinetic Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove long-time contractivity estimates and exponential rates of convergence to equilibrium for solutions of hypoelliptic diffusion equations, which include the well-known Kolmogorov equation and similar kinetic Fokker-Planck equations in $\R^d$. Compared to the existing literature, our proof exploits a different approach, elementary and self-contained, based on oscillation estimates for the adjoint problem. We first prove contractivity in Wasserstein distances through doubling variables (coupling) methods. Next, we upgrade the estimate to weighted $L^1$-(or total variation) norms, thanks to short-time hypocoercivity gradient estimates.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of the scattered wave and scattering resonances for periodic high-contrast subwavelength resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study time-harmonic scattering by a periodic array of penetrable, high-contrast obstacles with small period, confined to a bounded Lipschitz domain. The strong contrast between the obstacles and the background induces subwavelength resonances. We derive a frequency-dependent effective model in the vanishing-period limit and prove quantitative convergence of the heterogeneous scattered wave to the effective scattered wave. We also identify the limiting set of scattering resonances and establish convergence rates. Finally, we establish convergence rates for the far-field pattern of the heterogeneous problem to that of the effective model.</description>

      <title>Time Averaged Statistics of the 3D Stochastic Ladyzenskaya-Smagorinsky Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the chaotic nature of turbulence, statistical quantities are often more informative than pointwise characterizations. In this work, we consider the stochastic Ladyzhenskaya-Smagorinsky equation driven by space-time Gaussian noise on a three-dimensional periodic domain. We derive a rigorous upper bound on the first moment of the energy dissipation rate and show that it remains finite in the vanishing viscosity limit, consistent with Kolmogorov's phenomenological theory. This estimate also agrees with classical results obtained for the Navier-Stokes equations and demonstrates that, in the absence of boundary layers, as considered here, the model does not over-dissipate.</description>

      <title>On three dimensional steady super-Alfv\'{e}nic magnetohydrodynamics shocks with aligned fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupled motion between the hydrodynamic flow and magnetic field introduces significant complexity into the structure of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. A key factor contributing to this complexity is the presence of Alfv\'en waves, which critically influences the character of the flow and makes the problem considerably more challenging. Within the framework where the magnetic field is everywhere parallel to the flow velocity, we give an effective decomposition of the steady MHD equations in terms of the deformation tensor and the modified vorticity, where the modification in the vorticity is to record the effect of the Lorentz force on the velocity field. The existence and structural stability of the super-Alfv\'{e}nic cylindrical transonic shock solutions for the steady MHD equations are established under three-dimensional perturbations of the incoming flow and the exit total pressure (kinetic plus magnetic).</description>

      <title>Remarks on propagation of discontinuities in stationary radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stationary transport equation with the incoming boundary condition. We are interested in discontinuities of the solution. Under the generalized convexity condition, it is known that it has only boundary-induced discontinuities, which are discontinuities arising from discontinuous boundary data, they propagate along positive characteristic lines, and we can reconstruct the attenuation coefficient from boundary measurements by the inverse X-ray transform. In this article, we observe that coefficient-induced discontinuities, discontinuities of the solution arising from discontinuous coefficients, would also appear without the generalized convexity condition. If the set of discontinuous points of the coefficients contains at most finite number of flat parts, coefficient-induced discontinuities do not affect the inverse X-ray transform. We also remark that, under the generalized convexity condition, a three dimensional inverse problem can be reduced to the two dimensional one. A numerical experiment is exhibited.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we prove some convergence results for kinetic Fokker-Planck equations with strong space confinement but fat-tailed local equilibria and non-explicit global steady states. We extend the results of \cite{C21} to a wider class of fat-tailed local equilibria, with rates of convergence in a large class of weighted $\sfL^1$ spaces. We complement our results with numerical simulations to investigate the shape of the non-explicit steady state.</description>

Abstract: We derive the weak elliptic Harnack inequality and the elliptic Harnack inequality for mixed local and nonlocal $p$-energy form on metric measure spaces. The proof relies on the Poincar\'e inequality, the cutoff Sobolev inequality, and some mild conditions on the jump measure. Our approach is based on the De Giorgi-Nash-Moser method, extending the corresponding result for Dirichlet forms without a killing part (the case $p=2$).</description>

      <title>Semi-Global Existence and Trapped Surface Formation for the Einstein-Vlasov System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a large-data semi-global existence theorem and the dynamical formation of trapped surfaces for the Einstein-massless Vlasov system in 3+1 dimensions, without any symmetry assumptions. The analysis critically hinges on a finely calibrated hierarchy of estimates for the Weyl curvature, Ricci coefficients, and velocity moments of the distribution function, designed to capture the delicate interaction between the geometric and kinetic structures of the coupled system. The presence of the Vlasov field introduces significant analytic challenges, both in terms of integrability and regularity. These are circumvented through a refined renormalization of the Ricci coefficients, a strategic restriction of the need for the elliptic estimates to a minimal number of Ricci coefficients, and a precise commutator calculus adapted to the geometry of the mass-shell of the tangent bundle of the dynamical spacetime. The results constitute the first large-data, symmetry-free construction of dynamical black hole formation in the context of kinetic matter. Beyond its immediate application to the Einstein-Vlasov system in regimes of strong gravitational interaction and absence of symmetry, we anticipate that this framework will prove useful in a broader context, including, for instance, simplified approaches to the proof of nonlinear stability of Minkowski spacetime with massless Vlasov matter</description>

      <title>Two-temperature fluid models for a polyatomic gas based on kinetic theory for nearly resonant collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A polyatomic ideal gas with weak interaction between the translational and internal modes is considered. For the purpose of describing the behavior of such a gas, a Boltzmann equation is proposed in the form that the collision integral is a linear combination of inelastic and elastic (or resonant) collisions, and its basic properties are discussed. Then, in the case where the elastic collisions are dominant, fluid dynamic equations of Euler and Navier--Stokes type including two temperatures, i.e., translational and internal temperatures, as well as relaxation terms are systematically obtained by means of the Chapman--Enskog expansion. The obtained equations are different depending on the degree of weakness of the interaction between the translational and internal modes.</description>

      <title>Classification and qualitative properties of positive solutions to double-power nonlinear stationary Schr\"{o}dinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate positive radial solutions to double-power nonlinear stationary Schrodinger equations in three space dimensions. It is now known that the non-uniqueness of H^{1}-positive solutions can occur in three dimensions when the frequency is sufficiently small. Under suitable conditions, in addition to the ground state solution (whose L^{\infty} norm vanishes as the frequency tends to zero), there exists another positive solution that minimizes a different constrained variational problem, with an L^{\infty} norm diverging as the frequency tends to zero (see Theorem 1.4). We classify all positive solutions with small frequency into two categories: the ground state and the Aubin-Talenti type solution. As a consequence, we establish the multiplicity of positive solutions. Finally, we also examine the non-degeneracy and Morse index of each positive solution.</description>

      <title>Liouville results for $(p,q)$-Laplacian elliptic equations with source terms involving gradient nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a series of Liouville-type theorems for a class of nonhomogeneous quasilinear elliptic equations featuring reactions that depend on the solution and its gradient. Specifically, we investigate equations of the form $-\Delta_p u - \Delta_q u = f(u,\nabla u)$ with $p &gt; q &gt; 1$, where the nonlinearity $f$ takes forms such as $u^s|\nabla u|^m$ or $u^s + M|\nabla u|^m$ ($s, m\geq 0$). Our approach is twofold. For cases where the reaction term satisfies $|f(u,\nabla u)|\leq g(u)|\nabla u|^m$ with $m&gt;q$ and $g$ is continuous, we prove that every bounded solution (without sign restriction) in $\mathbb{R}^N$ is constant by means of an Ishii-Lions type technique. In the remaining scenarios, we turn to the Bernstein method. The application of this method to the nonhomogeneous operator requires a nontrivial adaptation, as, roughly speaking, constant coefficients are replaced by functions that may not be bounded from above, which enables us to establish a crucial a priori estimate for the gradient of solutions in any domain $\Omega$. This estimate, in turn, implies the desired Liouville properties on the entire space $\mathbb{R}^N$. As a consequence, we have fully extended Lions Liouville-type result for the Hamilton-Jacobi equation to the $(p,q)$-Laplacian setting, while for the $(p,q)$ generalized Lane-Emden equation, we provide an initial contribution in the direction of the classical result by Gidas and Spruck for $p=q=2$, as well as that of Serrin and Zou for $p=q$.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper which studies Liouville properties for equations with nonhomogeneous operator involving source gradient terms.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the solution of the Cauchy problem for a singularly perturbed system of hyperbolic equations. Part 2. Initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An asymptotic small parameter expansion of a single Cauchy problem is constructed for a singularly perturbed system of hyperbolic equations describing vibrations of two rigidly connected strings. Equations (such as generalized Korteweg-de Vriesequations) and initial conditions for the terms of the asymptotic expansion of the solution are determined, and under certain assumptions, the residual term is estimated from the residual.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric Bounds for Weighted Steklov Eigenvalues with Radial Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the following class of Steklov eigenvalue problems: \[ \nabla \cdot \bigl( w \nabla u \bigr) = 0 \quad \text{in } \Omega, \qquad \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu} = \gamma v u \quad \text{on } \partial \Omega, \] where $w$ and $v$ are prescribed positive radial functions, $\Omega$ is a Lipschitz domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with $N \geq 2$ and $\nu$ denotes its outward unit normal. Extending classical results in the unweighted case due to Weinstock, the first author, and others, we establish isoperimetric inequalities for low-order eigenvalues under suitable symmetry assumptions on the domain. In the first part, we consider the case $w(x) = |x|^{\alpha}$ and $v(x) = |x|^{\beta-\alpha}$, where the parameters $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}$ satisfy appropriate constraints. Our analysis relies on an explicit computation of the spectrum in the radial case, variational principles, and a family of weighted isoperimetric inequalities with ``double density''. In the second part, we address the case $v \equiv 1$ and $w(x) = W(|x|)$, where $W$ is a non-decreasing, log-convex function. In this setting, the proof relies, among other tools, on a new weighted isoperimetric inequality, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with a posteriori estimates for approximations of boundary value problems generated by the spectral fractional operator. The derivation is based upon the Stinga--Torrea extension that transfers the corresponding nonlocal problem to a local problem of higher dimensionality. The estimates are fully computable and contain no conditions and constants depending on a method or mesh used to compute an approximation. They are valid for any energy admissible approximation of the extended problem.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear instability for the 3D MHD equations around the Taylor-Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the 3D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations in an annular cylinder, perturbed around the explicit steady state given by the 3D Taylor-Couette velocity field and zero magnetic field. Combining a recent linear instability result for the magnetic field with the framework of Friedlander, Pavlovi\'c and Shvydkoy [Comm. Math. Phys. 264 (2006), no. 2, 335-347], we prove nonlinear instability of the solution around this steady state in $L^p$, for any $p&gt;1$. In particular, our results are, to the best of our knowledge, the first rigorous instability results for 3D MHD without forcing, in which the instability is produced as a result of the (exponential) growth of the magnetic field. Furthermore, we offer a mathematical proof of the physically conjectured transfer of energy from the velocity field to the magnetic field in the MHD system.</description>

      <title>Rate of convergence to equilibrium for the heated string</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present manuscript, we calculate the exponential rate of convergence of the heated string system (a mixed-type hyperbolic-parabolic system of PDEs) towards the equilibrium, independently of the initial data. As a by-product of our analysis, we obtain an enhanced time decay of the solution.
  The main tool of our reasoning consists of asymptotic analysis at the Fourier side of the linearized problem in the spirit of Kato. The latter method fits very well to the estimates obtained earlier for the system. The matching between the linear problem and the nonlinear original system requires delicate estimates of the nonlinear terms at the Fourier side as well as careful spectral analys</description>

Abstract: We introduce Besov and Triebel--Lizorkin spaces on a manifold with boundary adapted to H\"ormander vector fields, near a so-called non-characteristic point of the boundary. We prove sharp results in these spaces for the corresponding restriction and trace operators, show these operators are retractions, and other related results. This is the second paper in a forthcoming series devoted to a general theory of maximally subelliptic boundary value problems, and lays the function space foundation for this general theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent article, a localization of the Huisken--Stampacchia iteration method was developed, and used to establish localizations of the well-known "umbilic", "convexity" and "cylindrical" estimates for hypersurfaces evolving in Euclidean space by mean curvature flow. Here, we adapt the methods developed there to treat more general (fully nonlinear) flows, establishing localizations of asymptotically sharp curvature pinching estimates for hypersurfaces evolving by one-homogeneous functions of curvature under very general conditions. We also briefly describe how the method can be adapted to treat the deformation of hypersurfaces in curved ambient spaces (by suitable speed functions), which is fundamental for many important applications of such flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we primarily focus on the two-phase solutions and their stability to the focusing mKdV equation. By employing the algebro-geometric approach in combination with an effective integration method, we construct explicit two-phase solutions and their corresponding wave-functions expressed in terms of the Riemann theta function. The spectral stability of two-phase solutions is examined via a modified squared-eigenfunction approach, and their stability with respect to subharmonic perturbations is further analyzed under spectrally unstable conditions. In addition, the orbital stability of the two-phase solutions is investigated. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first rigorous stability theory for the two-phase solutions of the focusing mKdV equation.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability of vector multi-solitons in coupled NLS and modified KdV equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the $N$-solitons, including breathers and multi-hump solitons, of the coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger (CNLS) equations are nonlinearly stable in the Sobolev space $H^{N}$. Moreover, $(N_{1},N_{2})$-solitons of the coupled modified Korteweg--de Vries (CmKdV) equations are shown to be nonlinearly stable in the Sobolev space $H^{2N_{1}+N_{2}}$. The number of negative eigenvalues of the second variation of the Lyapunov functional is $N$ for $N$-solitons of the CNLS equations, and $N_{1}+\lfloor (N_{2}+1)/2 \rfloor$ for $(N_{1},N_{2})$-solitons of the CmKdV equations, which is obtained by exploiting integrable properties. The stability of solitons for the classical NLS and mKdV equations also follows from the same method. In addition, we show that solutions to the linearized spectral problem of the mixed flow equation can be constructed from solutions of the stationary zero curvature equations in a large class of Lie algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the second of two works concerning the Sobolev calculus on metric measure spaces and its applications. In this work, we focus on several approaches to vector calculus in the non-smooth setting of complete and separable metric spaces equipped with a boundedly-finite Borel measure. More precisely, we study different notions of (co)vector fields and derivations appearing in the literature, as well as their mutual relation. We also carry forward a thorough investigation of gradients, divergence measures, and Laplacian measures, together with their applications in potential analysis (for example, regarding the condenser capacity) and in the study of duality properties of Sobolev spaces. Most of the results are obtained for the full range of exponents $p\in[1,\infty)$ and without finiteness assumption on the measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for constructing generative models using one-dimensional noising processes. Beyond diffusion processes, we outline examples that demonstrate the flexibility of our approach. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework in which the 1D processes themselves are learnable, achieved by parameterizing the noise distribution through quantile functions that adapt to the data. Our construction integrates seamlessly with standard objectives, including Flow Matching and consistency models. Learning quantile-based noise naturally captures heavy tails and compact supports when present. Numerical experiments highlight both the flexibility and the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Two-Sided Free Boundary Problems Arising From Branching-Selection Particle Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and analyse a two-sided free boundary problem arising from a generalization of the well-known $N$-particle branching Brownian motion ($N$-BBM) model, called the $(N, p)$-BBM, where selection can occur on both the leftmost and rightmost particles according to a parameter $p\in(0,1)$. The main result here establishes that, as $N\to\infty$, the empirical distribution of the $(N,p)$-BBM converges to a deterministic hydrodynamic limit described by a free boundary problem on a finite interval with two moving boundaries, and explicit Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions parametrized by $p$. We further prove that the asymptotic velocity $v_{N,p}$ of the $(N,p)$-BBM converges, as $N\to\infty$, to $v_p$, the unique travelling wave speed of the limiting free boundary problem. These results generalize previous one-sided models and connect to broader classes of free boundary problems found in evolutionary dynamics and flame propagation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider compact Riemannian manifolds with arbitrary interior geometry, assuming only that the Ricci tensor vanishes on the boundary. In this setting, we prove that, under the linear Bianchi gauge and extended Cauchy data, the linearized Einstein equations with sources are globally solvable if and only if the source lies in the kernel of a lifted divergence operator and vanishes on the boundary; the solution is unique. This is the first result of its kind without rigid structural restrictions on topology, geometry, or source. The proof combines generalized Hodge theory with unique continuation results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1801.01418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a variational model, given by a weighted sum of perimeter, bending and Riesz interaction energies, that could be considered as a toy model for charged elastic drops. The different contributions have competing preferences for strongly localized and maximally dispersed structures. We investigate the energy landscape in dependence of the size of the 'charge', i.e. the weight of the Riesz interaction energy. In the two-dimensional case we first prove that for simply connected sets of small elastic energy, the elastic deficit controls the isoperimetric deficit. Building on this result, we show that for small charge the only minimizers of the full variational model are either balls or centered annuli. We complement these statements by a non-existence result for large charge. In three dimensions, we prove area and diameter bounds for configurations with small Willmore energy and show that balls are the unique minimizers of our variational model for sufficiently small charge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study well-posedness of degenerate mixed-type parabolic-hyperbolic equations $$ \partial_tu+\text{div}\big(f(u)\big)=\mathcal{L}[b(u)] $$ on bounded domains with general Dirichlet boundary/exterior conditions. The nonlocal diffusion operator $\mathcal{L}$ can be any symmetric L{\'e}vy operator (e.g. fractional Laplacians) and $b$ is nondecreasing and allowed to have degenerate regions ($b'=0$). We propose an entropy solution formulation for the problem and show uniqueness of bounded entropy solutions under general assumptions. Existence of solutions is shown in a separate paper. The uniqueness proof is based on the Kru\v{z}kov doubling of variables technique and incorporates several a priori results derived from our entropy formulation: an $L^\infty$-bound, an energy estimate, strong initial trace, weak boundary traces, and a \textit{nonlocal} boundary condition. Our work can be seen as both extending nonlocal theories from the whole space to domains and local theories on domains to the nonlocal case. Unlike local theories our formulation does not assume energy estimates. They are now a consequence of the formulation, but as opposed to previous nonlocal theories, they play an essential role in our arguments.</description>

      <title>Spreading properties of the Fisher--KPP equation when the intrinsic growth rate is maximal in a moving patch of bounded size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with spreading properties of space-time heterogeneous Fisher--KPP equations in one space dimension. We focus on the case of everywhere favorable environment with three different zones, a left half-line with slow or intermediate growth, a central patch with fast growth and a right half-line with slow or intermediate growth. The central patch moves at various speeds. The behavior of the front changes drastically depending on the speed of the central patch. Among other things, intriguing phenomena such as nonlocal pulling and locking may occur, which would make the behavior of the front further complicated. The problem we discuss here is closely related to questions in biomathematical modelling. By considering several special cases, we illustrate the remarkable diversity of possible behaviors. In particular, when the central patch has constant size and constant speed, we provide a complete set of explicit formulas for the spreading speed.</description>

      <title>Regularity lost: the fundamental limitations and constraint qualifications in the problems of elastoplasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and non-existence of a function-valued strain solution in various models of elastoplasticity from the perspective of the constraint-based ``dual'' formulations. We describe abstract frameworks for linear elasticity, elasticity-perfect plasticity and elasticity-hardening plasticity in terms of adjoint linear operators and convert them to equivalent formulations in terms of differential inclusions (the sweeping process in particular). Within such frameworks we consider several manually solvable examples of discrete and continuous models. Despite their simplicity, the examples show how for discrete models with perfect plasticity it is possible to find the evolution of stress and strain (elongation), yet continuum models within the same framework may not possess a function-valued strain. Although some examples with such phenomenon are already known, we demonstrate that it may appear due to displacement loading. The central idea of the paper is to explain the loss of strain regularity in the dual formulation by the lack of additivity of the normal cones and the failure of Slater's constraint qualification.
  In contrast to perfect plasticity, models with hardening are known to be well-solvable for strains. We show that more advanced constraint qualifications can help to distinguish between those cases and, in the case of hardening, ensure the additivity of the normal cones, which means the existence of a function-valued strain rate.</description>

      <title>Stable bi-frequency spinor modes as Dark Matter candidates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that spinor systems with scalar self-interaction, such as the Dirac--Klein--Gordon system with Yukawa coupling or the Soler model, generically have bi-frequency solitary wave solutions. We develop the approach to stability properties of such waves and use the radial reduction to show that indeed the (linear) stability is available for a wide range of parameters. We show that only bi-frequency modes can be dynamically stable and suggest that stable bi-frequency modes can serve as storages of the Dark Matter. The approach is based on linear stability results of one-frequency solitary waves in (3+1)D Soler model, which we obtain as a by-product.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07271v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain semiclassical resolvent estimates for the Schr{\"o}dinger operator (ih$\nabla$ + b)^2 + V in R^d , d $\ge$ 3, where h is a semiclassical parameter, V and b are real-valued electric and magnetic potentials independent of h. Under quite general assumptions, we prove that the norm of the weighted resolvent is bounded by exp(Ch^{-2} log(h^{ -1} )) . We get better resolvent bounds for electric potentials which are H{\"o}lder with respect to the radial variable and magnetic potentials which are H{\"o}lder with respect to the space variable. For long-range electric potentials which are Lipschitz with respect to the radial variable and long-range magnetic potentials which are Lipschitz with respect to the space variable we obtain a resolvent bound of the form exp(Ch^{-1}) .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metaplectic operators form a relevant class of operators appearing in different applications, in the present work we study their Schwartz kernels. Namely, diagonality of a kernel is defined by imposing rapid off-diagonal decay conditions, and quasi-diagonality by imposing the same conditions on the smoothing of the kernel through convolution with the Gaussian. Kernels of metaplectic operators are not diagonal. Nevertheless, as we shall prove, they are quasi-diagonal under suitable conditions. Motivation for our study comes from problems in time-frequency analysis, that we discuss in the last section.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \Subset \mathbb R^n$ and a continuous function $\mathrm H$ be given, where $n,k,N \in \mathbb N$. For $p\in [1,\infty]$, we consider the functional \[ \mathrm E_p(u) := \big\| \mathrm H \big(\cdot,u,\mathrm D u, \ldots, \mathrm D^ku \big) \big\|_{\mathrm L^p(\Omega)},\ \ \ u\in \mathrm W^{k,p}(\Omega;\mathbb R^N). \] We are interested in the $L^\infty$ variational problem \[ \mathrm C_{\infty,p}(u_\infty)\, =\, \inf \Big\{\mathrm C_{\infty,p}(u) \ : \ u\in \mathrm W^{k,\infty}_\varphi(\Omega;\mathbb R^N), \ \mathrm E_1(u)\neq 0 \Big\}, \] where $\varphi\in \mathrm W^{k,\infty}(\Omega;\mathbb R^N)$, $p$ is fixed, and \[ \mathrm C_{\infty,p}(u)\, := \, \frac{\mathrm E_\infty(u)}{\mathrm E_p(u)} . \] The variational problem is ill-posed. $\mathrm C_{\infty,2}$ is known as the ``Crest factor" and arises as the ``peak--to--average ratio" problem in various applications, including eg. nuclear reactors and signal processing in sound engineering. We solve it by characterising the set of minimisers as the set of strong solutions to the eigenvalue Dirichlet problem for the fully nonlinear PDE \[ \left\{ \ \ \begin{array}{ll} \big| \mathrm H \big(\cdot,u,\mathrm D u, \ldots, \mathrm D^ku \big) \big|= \Lambda, &amp; \text{ a.e.\ in }\Omega, \\ u = \varphi, &amp; \text{ on }\partial \Omega,\\ \mathrm D u = \mathrm D \varphi, &amp; \text{ on }\partial\Omega,
  \vdots &amp; \vdots \\ \mathrm D^{k-1}u = \mathrm D^{k-1}\varphi, &amp; \text{ on }\partial\Omega. \end{array} \right. \] Under appropriate assumptions for $\mathrm H$, we show existence of infinitely-many solutions $(u,\Lambda) \in \mathrm W^{k,\infty}_\varphi(\Omega;\mathbb R^N) \times [\Lambda_*,\infty)$ for $\Lambda_*\geq0$, by utilising the Baire Category method for implicit PDEs. In the case of $k=1$ and $n=N$, these assumptions do not require quasiconvexity.</description>

      <title>Convolution estimates for the Boltzmann gain operator with hard spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09554v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove new moment-preserving polynomially weighted convolution estimates for the gain operator of the Boltzmann equation with hard potentials, including the critical case of hard-spheres. Our approach relies crucially on a novel cancellation mechanism dealing with the pathological case of energy-absorbing collisions (that is, collisions that accumulate energy to only one of the outgoing particles). This difficulty is specific to hard potentials, and is not present for Maxwell molecules. Our method quantifies the heuristic that, while energy-absorbing collisions occur with non-trivial probability, they are statistically rare, and therefore do not affect the overall averaging behavior of the gain operator. At the technical level, our proof relies solely on tools from kinetic theory, such as geometric identities and angular averaging.</description>

      <title>High-capillarity limit and smoothing effect of large solutions for a multi-dimensional generic non-conservative compressible two-fluid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the global existence and long-time behavior of large solutions, in the high-capillarity regime, for a general multidimensional non-conservative compressible two-fluid model with the capillary pressure relation \(f(\alpha^{-}\rho^{-})=P^{+}-P^{-}\). Our main contributions are threefold. First, for sufficiently large capillarity coefficients, we prove the existence and uniqueness of global solutions in critical Besov spaces for large initial perturbations, under the sharp stability condition \(-\frac{s_{-}^{2}(1,1)}{\alpha^{-}(1,1)}&lt;f^{\prime}(1)&lt;0\), thereby removing the additional negativity restriction assumed by Evje--Wang--Wen [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 221:1285--1316, 2016]. Second, we give a rigorous justification of the global-in-time convergence to the incompressible Navier-Stokes flows and obtain explicit convergence rates in critical spaces for ill-prepared data. Third, if in addition the initial perturbation lies in a lower-regularity Besov space, we derive optimal decay rates for the solution and for its derivatives of any order, revealing a long-term smoothing effect. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on global large-amplitude strong solutions for multidimensional compressible two-fluid flows. Our analysis exploits the interplay between dispersion (two-phase Gross--Pitaevskii structure) and parabolic dissipation, both induced by capillarity effects.</description>

      <title>The epsilon-regularity theorem for Brakke flows near triple junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem for $k$-dimensional, possibly forced, Brakke flows near a static, multiplicity-one triple junction. This result provides the parabolic analogue to L. Simon's foundational work on the singular set of stationary varifolds and confirms that the regular structure of triple junctions persists under weak mean curvature flow. The regularity holds provided the flow satisfies a mild structural assumption on its 1-dimensional slices taken orthogonal to the junction's $(k-1)$-dimensional spine, which prohibits certain topological degeneracies. We prove that this assumption is automatically satisfied by two fundamental classes of flows where such singularities are expected: codimension-one multi-phase flows, such as the canonical $\mathrm{BV}$-Brakke flows constructed by the authors, and flows of arbitrary codimension with the structure of a mod 3 integral current, which arise from Ilmanen's elliptic regularization. For such flows, therefore, the Simon type regularity holds unconditionally.</description>

      <title>Frequency conditions for the global stability of nonlinear delay equations with several equilibria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04716v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our adjacent work, we developed a spectral comparison principle for compound cocycles generated by delay equations. It allows to derive frequency inequalities for the uniform exponential stability of such cocycles by means of their comparison with stationary problems. Such inequalities are hard to verify purely analytically, and in this work we develop approximation schemes to verify some of the arising frequency inequalities. Besides some general theoretical results, in applications we stick to the case of scalar equations. By means of the Suarez--Schopf delayed oscillator and the Mackey--Glass equations, we demonstrate applications of the theory to reveal regions in the space of parameters where the absence of closed invariant contours can be guaranteed. Since the frequency inequalities are robust, so close systems also satisfy them, we expect the method to actually imply the global stability, as in known finite-dimensional results utilizing variants of the closing lemma, which is still awaiting developments in infinite dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider first-order elliptic differential operators acting on vector bundles over smooth manifolds with smooth boundary, which is permitted to be noncompact. Under very mild assumptions, we obtain a regularity theory for sections in the maximal domain. Under additional geometric assumptions, and assumptions on an adapted boundary operator, we obtain a trace theorem on the maximal domain. This allows us to systematically study both local and nonlocal boundary conditions. In particular, the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer boundary condition occurs as a special case. Furthermore, we study contexts which induce semi-Fredholm and Fredholm extensions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider a class of incompressible stochastic third-grade fluids (non-Newtonian fluids) equations on two- as well as three-dimensional Poincar\'e domains $\mathcal{O}$ (which may be bounded or unbounded). Our aims are to study the well-posedness and asymptotic analysis for the solutions of the underlying system. Firstly, we prove that the underlying system defined on $\mathcal{O}$ has a unique weak solution (in the analytic sense) under Dirichlet boundary condition and it also generates random dynamical system $\Psi$. Secondly, we consider the underlying system on bounded domains. Using the compact Sobolev embedding $\mathbb{H}^1(\mathcal{O}) \hookrightarrow\mathbb{L}^2(\mathcal{O})$, we prove the existence of a unique random attractor for the underlying system on bounded domains with external forcing in $\mathbb{H}^{-1}(\mathcal{O})+\mathbb{W}^{-1,\frac{4}{3}}(\mathcal{O})$. Thirdly, we consider the underlying system on unbounded Poincar\'e domains with external forcing in $\mathbb{L}^{2}(\mathcal{O})$ and show the existence of a unique random attractor. In order to obtain the existence of a unique random attractor on unbounded domains, due to the lack of compact Sobolev embedding $\mathbb{H}^1(\mathcal{O}) \hookrightarrow\mathbb{L}^2(\mathcal{O})$, we use the uniform-tail estimates method which helps us to demonstrate the asymptotic compactness of $\Psi$.
  Note that due to the presence of several nonlinear terms in the underlying system, we are not able to use the energy equality method to obtain the asymptotic compactness of $\Psi$ in unbounded domains, which makes the analysis of this work in unbounded domains more difficult and interesting. Finally, as a consequence of the existence of random attractors, we address the existence of invariant measures for underlying system.</description>

      <title>How smooth are restrictions of Besov functions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a previous work, we showed that Besov spaces do not enjoy the restriction property unless $q\leq p$. Specifically, we proved that if $p&lt;q$, then it is always possible to construct a function $f\in B_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^N)$ such that $f(\cdot,y)\notin B_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for a.e. $y\in \mathbb{R}^{N-d}$, while this "pathology" does not happen if $q\leq p$. We showed that the partial maps belong, in fact, to the Besov space of generalised smoothness $B_{p,q}^{(s,\Psi)}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ provided the function $\Psi$ satisfies a simple summability condition involving $p$ and $q$. This short note completes the picture by showing that this characterisation is sharp.</description>

      <title>Conditional existence of maximizers for the Tomas-Stein inequality for the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Tomas-Stein inequality for a compact subset $\Gamma$ of the sphere $S^d$ states that the mapping $f\mapsto \widehat{f\sigma}$ is bounded from $L^2(\Gamma,\sigma)$ to $L^{2+4/d}(\R^{d+1})$. Then conditional on a strict comparison between the best constants for the sphere and for the Strichartz inequality for the Schr\"odinger equations, we prove that there exist functions which extremize this inequality, and any extremising sequence has a subsequence which converges to an extremizer. The method is based on the refined Tomas-Stein inequality for the sphere and the profile decompositions. The key ingredient to establish orthogonality in profile decompositions is that we use Tao's sharp bilinear restriction theorem for the paraboloids beyond the Tomas-Stein range. Similar results have been previously established by Frank, Lieb and Sabin \cite{Frank-Lieb-Sabin:2007:maxi-sphere-2d}, where they used the method of the missing mass.</description>
