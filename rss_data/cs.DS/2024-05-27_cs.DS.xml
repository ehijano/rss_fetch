      <title>Maximizing Weighted Dominance in the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let P be a set of n weighted points, Q be a set of m unweighted points in the plane, and k a non-negative integer. We consider the problem of computing a subset $Q'\subseteq Q$ with size at most k such that the sum of the weights of the points of P dominated by at least one point in the set Q' is maximized. A point q in the plane dominates another point p if and only if $x(q)\ge x(p)$ and $y(q)\ge y(p)$, and at least one inequality is strict.
  We present a solution to the problem that takes O(n + m)-space and $O(k \min\{n+m, \frac{n}{k}+m^2\}\log m)$-time. We (conditionally) improve upon the existing result (the bounds of our solution are interesting when $m= o(\sqrt{n}))$.
  Moreover, we also present a simple algorithm solving the problem in $O(km^2+n\log m)$-time and $O(n+m)$-space. The bounds of the algorithm are interesting when $m= o(\sqrt{n})$.</description>

      <title>Learning Minimum Linear Arrangement of Cliques and Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the well-known Minimum Linear Arrangement problem (MinLA), the goal is to arrange the nodes of an undirected graph into a permutation so that the total stretch of the edges is minimized. This paper studies an online (learning) variant of MinLA where the graph is not given at the beginning, but rather revealed piece-by-piece. The algorithm starts in a fixed initial permutation, and after a piece of the graph is revealed, the algorithm must update its current permutation to be a MinLA of the subgraph revealed so far. The objective is to minimize the total number of swaps of adjacent nodes as the algorithm updates the permutation.
  The main result of this paper is an online randomized algorithm that solves this online variant for the restricted cases where the revealed graph is either a collection of cliques or a collection of lines. We show that the algorithm is $8 \ln n$-competitive, where $n$ is the number of nodes of the graph. We complement this result by constructing an asymptotically matching lower bound of $\Omega(\ln n)$.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Clustering via Local Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a local search algorithm for hierarchical clustering. For the local step, we consider a tree re-arrangement operation, known as the {\em interchange}, which involves swapping two closely positioned sub-trees within a tree hierarchy. The interchange operation has been previously used in the context of phylogenetic trees. As the objective function for evaluating the resulting hierarchies, we utilize the revenue function proposed by Moseley and Wang (NIPS 2017.)
  In our main result, we show that any locally optimal tree guarantees a revenue of at least $\frac{n-2}{3}\sum_{i &lt; j}w(i,j)$ where is $n$ the number of objects and $w: [n] \times [n] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ is the associated similarity function. This finding echoes the previously established bound for the average link algorithm as analyzed by Moseley and Wang. We demonstrate that this alignment is not coincidental, as the average link trees enjoy the property of being locally optimal with respect to the interchange operation. Consequently, our study provides an alternative insight into the average link algorithm and reveals the existence of a broader range of hierarchies with relatively high revenue achievable through a straightforward local search algorithm.
  Furthermore, we present an implementation of the local search framework, where each local step requires $O(n)$ computation time. Our empirical results indicate that the proposed method, used as post-processing step, can effectively generate a hierarchical clustering with substantial revenue.</description>

      <title>Boolean Matrix Multiplication for Highly Clustered Data on the Congested Clique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a protocol for the Boolean matrix product of two $n\times b$ Boolean matrices on the congested clique designed for the situation when the rows of the first matrix or the columns of the second matrix are highly clustered in the space $\{0,1\}^n.$ With high probability (w.h.p), it uses $\tilde{O}\left(\sqrt {\frac M n+1}\right)$ rounds on the congested clique with $n$ nodes, where $M$ is the minimum of the cost of a minimum spanning tree (MST) of the rows of the first input matrix and the cost of an MST of the columns of the second input matrix in the Hamming space $\{0,1\}^n.$ A key step in our protocol is the computation of an approximate minimum spanning tree of a set of $n$ points in the space $\{0,1\}^n$. We provide a protocol for this problem (of interest in its own rights) based on a known randomized technique of dimension reduction in Hamming spaces. W.h.p., it constructs an $O(1)$-factor approximation of an MST of $n$ points in the Hamming space $\{ 0,\ 1\}^n$ using $O(\log^3 n)$ rounds on the congested clique with $n$ nodes.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration and Enumeration of Optimal Cyclic Ladder Lotteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A ladder lottery, known as ``Amidakuji'' in Japan, is a common way to decide an assignment at random. In this paper, we investigate reconfiguration and enumeration problems of cyclic ladder lotteries. First, when a permutation $\pi$ and an optimal displacement vector $\bm{x}$ are given, we investigate the reconfiguration and enumeration problems of the ``optimal'' cyclic ladder lotteries of $\pi$ and $\bm{x}$. Next, for a give permutation $\pi$ we consider reconfiguration and enumeration problems of the optimal displacement vectors of $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Private Edge Density Estimation for Random Graphs: Optimal, Efficient and Robust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give the first polynomial-time, differentially node-private, and robust algorithm for estimating the edge density of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs and their generalization, inhomogeneous random graphs. We further prove information-theoretical lower bounds, showing that the error rate of our algorithm is optimal up to logarithmic factors. Previous algorithms incur either exponential running time or suboptimal error rates.
  Two key ingredients of our algorithm are (1) a new sum-of-squares algorithm for robust edge density estimation, and (2) the reduction from privacy to robustness based on sum-of-squares exponential mechanisms due to Hopkins et al. (STOC 2023).</description>

      <title>Finding Maximum Common Contractions Between Phylogenetic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we lay the groundwork on the comparison of phylogenetic networks based on edge contractions and expansions as edit operations, as originally proposed by Robinson and Foulds to compare trees. We prove that these operations connect the space of all phylogenetic networks on the same set of leaves, even if we forbid contractions that create cycles. This allows to define an operational distance on this space, as the minimum number of contractions and expansions required to transform one network into another. We highlight the difference between this distance and the computation of the maximum common contraction between two networks. Given its ability to outline a common structure between them, which can provide valuable biological insights, we study the algorithmic aspects of the latter. We first prove that computing a maximum common contraction between two networks is NP-hard, even when the maximum degree, the size of the common contraction, or the number of leaves is bounded. We also provide lower bounds to the problem based on the Exponential-Time Hypothesis. Nonetheless, we do provide a polynomial-time algorithm for weakly-galled networks, a generalization of galled trees.</description>

      <title>Scaling up the Banded Matrix Factorization Mechanism for Differentially Private ML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DP-BandMF offers a powerful approach to differentially private machine learning, balancing privacy amplification with noise correlation for optimal noise reduction. However, its scalability has been limited to settings where the number of training iterations is less than $10^4$. In this work, we present techniques that significantly extend DP-BandMF's reach, enabling use in settings with and over $10^6$ training iterations. Our enhanced implementation, coupled with extensive experiments, provides clear guidelines on selecting the optimal number of bands. These insights offer practitioners a deeper understanding of DP-BandMF's performance and how to maximize its utility for privacy-preserving machine learning.</description>

      <title>Delta-modular ILP Problems of Bounded Co-dimension, Discrepancy, and Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $k, n \geq 0$, and $c \in Z^n$, we consider ILP problems \begin{gather*}
  \max\bigl\{ c^\top x \colon A x = b,\, x \in Z^n_{\geq 0} \bigr\}\text{ with $A \in Z^{k \times n}$, $rank(A) = k$, $b \in Z^{k}$ and}
  \max\bigl\{ c^\top x \colon A x \leq b,\, x \in Z^n \bigr\} \text{ with $A \in Z^{(n+k) \times n}$, $rank(A) = n$, $b \in Z^{n+k}$.} \end{gather*} The first problem is called an \emph{ILP problem in the standard form of the codimension $k$}, and the second problem is called an \emph{ILP problem in the canonical form with $n+k$ constraints.} We show that, for any sufficiently large $\Delta$, both problems can be solved with $$ 2^{O(k)} \cdot (f_{k,d} \cdot \Delta)^2 / 2^{\Omega\bigl(\sqrt{\log(f_{k,d} \cdot \Delta)}\bigr)} $$ operations, where $
  f_{k,d} = \min \Bigl\{ k^{k/2},
  \bigl(\log k \cdot \log (d + k)\bigr)^{k/2}
  \Bigr\} $, $d$ is the dimension of a corresponding polyhedron and $\Delta$ is the maximum absolute value of $rank(A) \times rank(A)$ sub-determinants of $A$.
  As our second main result, we show that the feasibility variants of both problems can be solved with $$ 2^{O(k)} \cdot f_{k,d} \cdot \Delta \cdot \log^3(f_{k,d} \cdot \Delta) $$ operations. The constant $f_{k,d}$ can be replaced by other constant $g_{k,\Delta} = \bigl(\log k \cdot \log (k \Delta)\bigr)^{k/2}$ that depends only on $k$ and $\Delta$. Additionally, we consider different partial cases with $k=0$ and $k=1$, which have interesting applications.
  As a result of independent interest, we propose an $n^2/2^{\Omega\bigl(\sqrt{\log n}\bigr)}$-time algorithm for the tropical convolution problem on sequences, indexed by elements of a finite Abelian group of the order $n$. This result is obtained, reducing the above problem to the matrix multiplication problem on a tropical semiring and using seminal algorithm by R. Williams.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by privacy concerns in long-term longitudinal studies in medical and social science research, we study the problem of continually releasing differentially private synthetic data from longitudinal data collections. We introduce a model where, in every time step, each individual reports a new data element, and the goal of the synthesizer is to incrementally update a synthetic dataset in a consistent way to capture a rich class of statistical properties. We give continual synthetic data generation algorithms that preserve two basic types of queries: fixed time window queries and cumulative time queries. We show nearly tight upper bounds on the error rates of these algorithms and demonstrate their empirical performance on realistically sized datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation.</description>

      <title>New Graph Decompositions and Combinatorial Boolean Matrix Multiplication Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the fundamental Boolean Matrix Multiplication (BMM) problem. With the invention of algebraic fast matrix multiplication over 50 years ago, it also became known that BMM can be solved in truly subcubic $O(n^\omega)$ time, where $\omega&lt;3$; much work has gone into bringing $\omega$ closer to $2$. Since then, a parallel line of work has sought comparably fast combinatorial algorithms but with limited success. The naive $O(n^3)$-time algorithm was initially improved by a $\log^2{n}$ factor [Arlazarov et al.; RAS'70], then by $\log^{2.25}{n}$ [Bansal and Williams; FOCS'09], then by $\log^3{n}$ [Chan; SODA'15], and finally by $\log^4{n}$ [Yu; ICALP'15].
  We design a combinatorial algorithm for BMM running in time $n^3 / 2^{\Omega(\sqrt[7]{\log n})}$ -- a speed-up over cubic time that is stronger than any poly-log factor. This comes tantalizingly close to refuting the conjecture from the 90s that truly subcubic combinatorial algorithms for BMM are impossible. This popular conjecture is the basis for dozens of fine-grained hardness results.
  Our main technical contribution is a new regularity decomposition theorem for Boolean matrices (or equivalently, bipartite graphs) under a notion of regularity that was recently introduced and analyzed analytically in the context of communication complexity [Kelley, Lovett, Meka; arXiv'23], and is related to a similar notion from the recent work on $3$-term arithmetic progression free sets [Kelley, Meka; FOCS'23].</description>

      <title>Approximation Algorithms for Packing Cycles and Paths in Complete Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an edge-weighted (metric/general) complete graph with $n$ vertices, the maximum weight (metric/general) $k$-cycle/path packing problem is to find a set of $\frac{n}{k}$ vertex-disjoint $k$-cycles/paths such that the total weight is maximized. In this paper, we consider approximation algorithms. For metric $k$-cycle packing, we improve the previous approximation ratio from $3/5$ to $7/10$ for $k=5$, and from $7/8\cdot(1-1/k)^2$ for $k&gt;5$ to $(7/8-0.125/k)(1-1/k)$ for constant odd $k&gt;5$ and to $7/8\cdot (1-1/k+\frac{1}{k(k-1)})$ for even $k&gt;5$. For metric $k$-path packing, we improve the approximation ratio from $7/8\cdot (1-1/k)$ to $\frac{27k^2-48k+16}{32k^2-36k-24}$ for even $10\geq k\geq 6$. For the case of $k=4$, we improve the approximation ratio from $3/4$ to $5/6$ for metric 4-cycle packing, from $2/3$ to $3/4$ for general 4-cycle packing, and from $3/4$ to $14/17$ for metric 4-path packing.</description>

Abstract: The dynamic programming solution to the traveling salesman problem due to Bellman, and independently Held and Karp, runs in time $O(2^n n^2)$, with no improvement in the last sixty years. We break this barrier for the first time by designing an algorithm that runs in deterministic time $2^n n^2 / 2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})}$. We achieve this by strategically remodeling the dynamic programming recursion as a min-plus matrix product, for which faster-than-na\"ive algorithms exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the design of risk-sensitive online algorithms, in which risk measures are used in the competitive analysis of randomized online algorithms. We introduce the CVaR$_\delta$-competitive ratio ($\delta$-CR) using the conditional value-at-risk of an algorithm's cost, which measures the expectation of the $(1-\delta)$-fraction of worst outcomes against the offline optimal cost, and use this measure to study three online optimization problems: continuous-time ski rental, discrete-time ski rental, and one-max search. The structure of the optimal $\delta$-CR and algorithm varies significantly between problems: we prove that the optimal $\delta$-CR for continuous-time ski rental is $2-2^{-\Theta(\frac{1}{1-\delta})}$, obtained by an algorithm described by a delay differential equation. In contrast, in discrete-time ski rental with buying cost $B$, there is an abrupt phase transition at $\delta = 1 - \Theta(\frac{1}{\log B})$, after which the classic deterministic strategy is optimal. Similarly, one-max search exhibits a phase transition at $\delta = \frac{1}{2}$, after which the classic deterministic strategy is optimal; we also obtain an algorithm that is asymptotically optimal as $\delta \downarrow 0$ that arises as the solution to a delay differential equation.</description>

Abstract: Streaming interactive proofs (SIPs) enable a space-bounded algorithm with one-pass access to a massive stream of data to verify a computation that requires large space, by communicating with a powerful but untrusted prover.
  This work initiates the study of zero-knowledge proofs for data streams. We define the notion of zero-knowledge in the streaming setting and construct zero-knowledge SIPs for the two main algorithmic building blocks in the streaming interactive proofs literature: the sumcheck and polynomial evaluation protocols. To the best of our knowledge all known streaming interactive proofs are based on either of these tools, and indeed, this allows us to obtain zero-knowledge SIPs for central streaming problems such as index, point and range queries, median, frequency moments, and inner product.
  Our protocols are efficient in terms of time and space, as well as communication: the verifier algorithm's space complexity is $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ and, after a non-interactive setup that uses a random string of near-linear length, the remaining parameters are $n^{o(1)}$.
  En route, we develop an algorithmic toolkit for designing zero-knowledge data stream protocols, consisting of an algebraic streaming commitment protocol and a temporal commitment protocol.Our analyses rely on delicate algebraic and information-theoretic arguments and reductions from average-case communication complexity.</description>

      <title>Solving Woeginger's Hiking Problem: Wonderful Partitions in Anonymous Hedonic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02067</link>

Abstract: A decade ago, Gerhard Woeginger posed an open problem that became well-known as "Woeginger's Hiking Problem": Consider a group of $n$ people that want to go hiking; everyone expresses preferences over the size of their hiking group in the form of an interval between $1$ and $n$. Is it possible to efficiently assign the $n$ people to a set of hiking subgroups so that every person approves the size of their assigned subgroup? The problem is also known as efficiently deciding if an instance of an anonymous Hedonic Game with interval approval preferences admits a wonderful partition.
  We resolve the open problem in the affirmative by presenting an $O(n^5)$ time algorithm for Woeginger's Hiking Problem. Our solution is based on employing a dynamic programming approach for a specific rectangle stabbing problem from computational geometry. Moreover, we propose natural, more demanding extensions of the problem, e.g., maximizing the number of satisfied participants and variants with single-peaked preferences, and show that they are also efficiently solvable. Last but not least, we employ our solution to efficiently compute a partition that maximizes the egalitarian welfare for anonymous single-peaked Hedonic Games.</description>

      <title>Fast algorithms for classical specifications of stabiliser states and Clifford gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10357</link>

Abstract: The stabiliser formalism plays a central role in quantum computing, error correction, and fault-tolerance. Stabiliser states are used to encode computational basis states. Clifford gates are those which can be easily performed fault-tolerantly in the most common error correction schemes. Their mathematical properties are the subject of significant research interest.
  Conversions between and verifications of different specifications of stabiliser states and Clifford gates are important components of many classical algorithms in quantum information, e.g. for gate synthesis, circuit optimisation, and for simulating quantum circuits. These core functions are also used in the numerical experiments critical to formulating and testing mathematical conjectures on the stabiliser formalism.
  We develop novel mathematical insights concerning stabiliser states and Clifford gates that significantly clarify their descriptions. We then utilise these to provide ten new fast algorithms which offer asymptotic advantages over any existing implementations. We show how to rapidly verify that a vector is a stabiliser state, and interconvert between its specification as amplitudes, a quadratic form, and a check matrix. These methods are leveraged to rapidly check if a given unitary matrix is a Clifford gate and to interconvert between the matrix of a Clifford gate and its compact specification as a stabiliser tableau.
  For example, we extract the stabiliser tableau of a Clifford gate matrix with $N^2$ entries in $O(N \log N)$ time. Remarkably, it is not necessary to read all the elements of a Clifford matrix to extract its stabiliser tableau. This is an asymptotic speedup over the best-known method that is superexponential in the number of qubits.
  We provide example implementations of our algorithms in Python.</description>

      <title>On the Distance from Calibration in Sequential Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a sequential binary prediction setting where the forecaster is evaluated in terms of the calibration distance, which is defined as the $L_1$ distance between the predicted values and the set of predictions that are perfectly calibrated in hindsight. This is analogous to a calibration measure recently proposed by B{\l}asiok, Gopalan, Hu and Nakkiran (STOC 2023) for the offline setting. The calibration distance is a natural and intuitive measure of deviation from perfect calibration, and satisfies a Lipschitz continuity property which does not hold for many popular calibration measures, such as the $L_1$ calibration error and its variants.
  We prove that there is a forecasting algorithm that achieves an $O(\sqrt{T})$ calibration distance in expectation on an adversarially chosen sequence of $T$ binary outcomes. At the core of this upper bound is a structural result showing that the calibration distance is accurately approximated by the lower calibration distance, which is a continuous relaxation of the former. We then show that an $O(\sqrt{T})$ lower calibration distance can be achieved via a simple minimax argument and a reduction to online learning on a Lipschitz class.
  On the lower bound side, an $\Omega(T^{1/3})$ calibration distance is shown to be unavoidable, even when the adversary outputs a sequence of independent random bits, and has an additional ability to early stop (i.e., to stop producing random bits and output the same bit in the remaining steps). Interestingly, without this early stopping, the forecaster can achieve a much smaller calibration distance of $\mathrm{polylog}(T)$.</description>
