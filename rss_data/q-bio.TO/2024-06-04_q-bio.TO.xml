      <title>Localized FDG loss in lung cancer lesions</title>

Abstract: Purpose: Analysis of [18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) kinetics in cancer has been most often limited to the evaluation of the average uptake over relatively large volumes. Nevertheless, tumor lesion almost contains inflammatory infiltrates whose cells are characterized by a significant radioactivity washout due to the hydrolysis of FDG-6P catalyzed by glucose-6P phosphatase. The present study aimed to verify whether voxel-wise compartmental analysis of dynamic imaging can identify tumor regions characterized by tracer washout. Materials &amp; Methods: The study included 11 patients with lung cancer submitted to PET/CT imaging for staging purposes. Tumor was defined by drawing a volume of interest loosely surrounding the lesion and considering all inside voxels with standardized uptake value (SUV) &gt;40% of the maximum. After 20 minutes dynamic imaging centered on the heart, eight whole body scans were repeated. Six parametric maps were progressively generated by computing six regression lines that considered all eight frames, the last seven ones, and so on, up to the last three. Results: Progressively delaying the starting point of regression line computation identified a progressive increase in the prevalence of voxels with a negative slope. Conclusions: The voxel-wise parametric maps provided by compartmental analysis permits to identify a measurable volume characterized by radioactivity washout. The spatial localization of this pattern is compatible with the recognized preferential site of inflammatory infiltrates populating the tumor stroma and might improve the power of FDG imaging in monitoring the effectiveness of treatments aimed to empower the host immune response against the cancer.</description>
