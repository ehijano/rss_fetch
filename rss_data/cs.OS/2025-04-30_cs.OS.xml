      <title>CrashFixer: A crash resolution agent for the Linux kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on a multitude of software engineering tasks. In particular, they have demonstrated remarkable utility in the task of code repair. However, common benchmarks used to evaluate the performance of code LLMs are often limited to small-scale settings. In this work, we build upon kGym, which shares a benchmark for system-level Linux kernel bugs and a platform to run experiments on the Linux kernel.
  This paper introduces CrashFixer, the first LLM-based software repair agent that is applicable to Linux kernel bugs. Inspired by the typical workflow of a kernel developer, we identify the key capabilities an expert developer leverages to resolve a kernel crash. Using this as our guide, we revisit the kGym platform and identify key system improvements needed to practically run LLM-based agents at the scale of the Linux kernel (50K files and 20M lines of code). We implement these changes by extending kGym to create an improved platform - called kGymSuite, which will be open-sourced. Finally, the paper presents an evaluation of various repair strategies for such complex kernel bugs and showcases the value of explicitly generating a hypothesis before attempting to fix bugs in complex systems such as the Linux kernel. We also evaluated CrashFixer's capabilities on still open bugs, and found at least two patch suggestions considered plausible to resolve the reported bug.</description>

      <title>OSVBench: Benchmarking LLMs on Specification Generation Tasks for Operating System Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce OSVBench, a new benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating complete specification code pertaining to operating system kernel verification tasks. The benchmark first defines the specification generation problem into a program synthesis problem within a confined scope of syntax and semantics by providing LLMs with the programming model. The LLMs are required to understand the provided verification assumption and the potential syntax and semantics space to search for, then generate the complete specification for the potentially buggy operating system code implementation under the guidance of the high-level functional description of the operating system. This benchmark is built upon a real-world operating system kernel, Hyperkernel, and consists of 245 complex specification generation tasks in total, each is a long context task of about 20k-30k tokens. Our comprehensive evaluation of 12 LLMs exhibits the limited performance of the current LLMs on the specification generation tasks for operating system verification. Significant disparities in their performance on the benchmark highlight differences in their ability to handle long-context code generation tasks. The evaluation toolkit and benchmark are available at https://github.com/lishangyu-hkust/OSVBench.</description>
