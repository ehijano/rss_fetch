      <title>Quantum evolution: terrestrial fine-tuning of magnetic parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time in history, humankind might conceivably begin to imagine itself as a multi-planetary species. This goal will entail technical innovation in a number of contexts, including that of healthcare. All life on Earth shares an evolution that is coupled to specific environmental conditions, including gravitational and magnetic fields. While the human body may be able to adjust to short term disruption of these fields during space flights, any long term settlement would have to take into consideration the effects that different fields will have on biological systems, within the space of one lifetime, but also across generations. Magnetic fields, for example, influence the growth of stem cells in regenerative processes. Circadian rhythms are profoundly influenced by magnetic fields, a fact that will likely have an effect on mental as well as physical health. Even the brain responds to small perturbations of this field. One possible mechanism for the effects of weak magnetic fields on biological systems has been suggested to be the radical pair mechanism. The radical pair mechanism originated in the context of spin chemistry to describe how magnetic fields influence the yields of chemical reactions. This mechanism was subsequently incorporated into the field of quantum biology. Quantum biology, most generally, is the study of whether non-trivial quantum effects play any meaningful role in biological systems. The radical pair mechanism has been used most consistently in this context to describe the avian compass. Recently, however, a number of studies have investigated other biological contexts in which the radical pair might play a role, from the action of anaesthetics and antidepressants, to microtubule development and the proper function of the circadian clock...

      <title>The Goldman-Hodgkins-Katz Equation, Reverse-Electrodialysis, and Everything in Between</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past eighty years, the Goldman-Hodgkins-Katz (GHK) equation has been the gold-standard framework for interpreting countless biological and physiological experiments and simulations that involve ion transport in nanopores/nanochannels/ion-channels subjected to a combined ionic concentration and electric potential gradients. In this work, we revisit the mathematical derivation used to develop the GHK model and show that this model is internally inconsistent. In particular, we show that its infamous assumption of a constant electric field is incorrect, which leads to substantial errors, including the inability of this model to satisfy local and global electroneutrality. Then, leveraging key insights from the field of reverse electrodialysis (RED), we derive a new internally consistent model that does not assume that the electric field is constant and satisfies electroneutrality. This new model has several advantages. First, while the mathematics are substantially more complicated, the derivation does not include ad-hoc assumptions, and the model is internally consistent. Second, the new solution connects the two realms of GHK and RED, which consider the same equations but in opposing limits, negligible or substantial surface charge density effects, respectively. Third, while the expressions for the new model are complicated, the new model can be reduced to several limits, which allows for a much easier and more straightforward analysis. Finally, all of our newly derived results show remarkable correspondence to non-approximated numerical simulations. This work provides a brand-new framework for interpreting (and reinterpreting) ion transport experiments in any charge-selective system.</description>

      <title>A Printed Microscopic Universal Gradient Interface for Super Stretchable Strain-Insensitive Bioelectronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stretchable electronics capable of conforming to nonplanar and dynamic human body surfaces are central for creating implantable and on-skin devices for high-fidelity monitoring of diverse physiological signals. While various strategies have been developed to produce stretchable devices, the signals collected from such devices are often highly sensitive to local strain, resulting in inevitable convolution with surface strain-induced motion artifacts that are difficult to distinguish from intrinsic physiological signals. Here we report all-printed super stretchable strain-insensitive bioelectronics using a unique universal gradient interface (UGI) to bridge the gap between soft biomaterials and stiff electronic materials. Leveraging a versatile aerosol-based multi-materials printing technique that allows precise spatial control over the local stiffnesses with submicron resolution, the UGI enables strain-insensitive electronic devices with negligible resistivity changes under a 180% stretch ratio. We demonstrate various stretchable devices directly printed on the UGI for on-skin health monitoring with high signal quality and near perfect immunity to motion artifacts, including semiconductor-based photodetectors for sensing blood oxygen saturation levels and metal-based temperature sensors. The concept in this work will significantly simplify the fabrication and accelerate the development of a broad range of wearable and implantable bioelectronics for real-time health monitoring and personalized therapeutics.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Energy Landscapes and Temperature paths: Dynamic Transition Rates in locally Ultrametric Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the dynamics of complex systems with time-dependent transition rates, focusing on $p$-adic analysis in modeling such systems. Starting from the master equation that governs the stochastic dynamics of a system with a large number of interacting components, we generalize it by $p$-adically parametrizing the metabasins to account for hierarchically organized states within the energy landscape. This leads to a non-homogeneous Markov process described by a time-dependent operator acting on an ultrametric space. We prove the well-posedness of the initial value problem and analyze the stochastic nature of the master equation with time-dependent transition-operator. We demonstrate how ultrametricity simplifies the description of intra-metabasin dynamics without increasing computational complexity. We apply our theoretical framework to two scenarios: glass relaxation under rapid cooling and protein folding dynamics influenced by temperature variations. In the glass relaxation model, we observe anomalous relaxation behavior where the dynamics slows during cooling, with lasting effects depending on how drastic the temperature drop is. In the protein folding model, we incorporate temperature-dependent energy barriers and transition rates to simulate folding and unfolding processes across the melting temperature. Our results capture a "whiplash" effect: from an unfolded state, the system folds and then returns to an unfolded state (which may differ from the initial one) in response to temperature changes. This study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of $p$-adic parametrization and ultrametric analysis in modeling complex systems with dynamic transition rates, providing analytical solutions to relaxation processes in material and biological systems.</description>

      <title>Exo-Daisy World: Revisiting Gaia Theory through an Informational Architecture Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Daisy World model has long served as a foundational framework for understanding the self-regulation of planetary biospheres, providing insights into the feedback mechanisms that may govern inhabited exoplanets. In this study, we extend the classic Daisy World model through the lens of Semantic Information Theory (SIT), aiming to characterize the information flow between the biosphere and planetary environment -- what we term the \emph{information architecture} of Daisy World systems. Our objective is to develop novel methodologies for analyzing the evolution of coupled planetary systems, including biospheres and geospheres, with implications for astrobiological observations and the identification of agnostic biosignatures. To operationalize SIT in this context, we introduce a version of the Daisy World model tailored to reflect potential conditions on M-dwarf exoplanets, formulating a system of stochastic differential equations that describe the co-evolution of the daisies and their planetary environment. Analysis of this Exo-Daisy World model reveals how correlations between the biosphere and environment intensify with rising stellar luminosity, and how these correlations correspond to distinct phases of information exchange between the coupled systems. This \emph{rein control} provides a quantitative description of the informational feedback between the biosphere and its host planet. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of our approach for developing detailed ExoGaia models of inhabited exoplanetary systems, proposing new avenues for interpreting astrobiological data and exploring biosignature candidates.</description>

      <title>Transcription factor clusters as information transfer agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deciphering how genes interpret information from the concentration of transcription factors (TFs) within the cell nucleus remains a fundamental question in gene regulation. Recent advancements have unveiled the heterogeneous distribution of TF molecules in the nucleus, posing challenges to the precise decoding of concentration signals. To explore this phenomenon, we employ high-resolution single-cell imaging of a fluorescently tagged TF protein, Bicoid, in living fly embryos. We show that accumulation of Bicoid in submicron clusters preserves the spatial information of the maternal Bicoid gradient, and that cluster intensity, size, and frequency offer remarkably precise spatial cues. We further discover that various known gene targets of Bicoid activation colocalize with clusters and that for the target gene Hunchback, this colocalization is dependent on its enhancer binding affinity. Modeling information transfer through these clusters suggests that clustering offers a more rapid sensing mechanism for global nuclear concentrations than freely diffusing TF molecules detected by simple enhancers.</description>

      <title>The low-rank hypothesis of complex systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.04848v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems are high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems with intricate interactions among their constituents. To make interpretable predictions about their large-scale behavior, it is typically assumed, without a clear statement, that these dynamics can be reduced to a few number of equations involving a low-rank matrix describing the network of interactions -- what we call the low-rank hypothesis. Our paper sheds light on this assumption and questions its validity. By leveraging fundamental theorems on singular value decomposition, we expose the hypothesis for various random graphs, either by making explicit their low-rank formulation or by demonstrating the exponential decrease of their singular values. Notably, we verify the hypothesis experimentally for real networks by revealing the rapid decrease of their singular values, which has major consequences on their effective ranks. We then evaluate the impact of the low-rank hypothesis for general dynamical systems on networks through an optimal dimension reduction. This allows us to prove that recurrent neural networks can be exactly reduced, and to connect the rapidly decreasing singular values of real networks to the dimension reduction error of the nonlinear dynamics they support, be it microbial, neuronal or epidemiological. Finally, we prove that higher-order interactions naturally emerge from the dimension reduction, thus providing theoretical insights into the origin of higher-order interactions in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Possibilities for methanogenic and acetogenic life in molecular cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to panspermia, life on Earth may have originated from life forms transported through space from elsewhere. These life forms could have passed through molecular clouds, where the process of methanogenesis could have provided enough energy to sustain living organisms. In this study, we have calculated the Gibbs free energy released from synthesizing hydrocarbons for methanogenic (acetogenic) life in a molecular cloud, with methane (acetic acid) as the final metabolic product. Our calculations demonstrate that the chemical reactions during methanogenesis can release enough free energy to support living organisms. The methanogenic life may have served as the predecessor of life on Earth, and there is some preliminary evidence from various molecular biology studies to support this idea. Furthermore, we propose a potential distinguishing signal to test our model.</description>

      <title>Enlightening the blind spot of the Michaelis-Menten rate law: The role of relaxation dynamics in molecular complex formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The century-long Michaelis-Menten rate law and its modifications in the modeling of biochemical rate processes stand on the assumption that the concentration of the complex of interacting molecules, at each moment, rapidly approaches an equilibrium (quasi-steady state) compared to the pace of molecular concentration changes. Yet, in the case of actively time-varying molecular concentrations with transient or oscillatory dynamics, the deviation of the complex profile from the quasi-steady state becomes relevant. A recent theoretical approach, known as the effective time-delay scheme (ETS), suggests that the delay by the relaxation time of molecular complex formation contributes to the substantial breakdown of the quasi-steady state assumption. Here, we systematically expand this ETS and inquire into the comprehensive roles of relaxation dynamics in complex formation. Through the modeling of rhythmic protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions and the mammalian circadian clock, our analysis reveals the effect of the relaxation dynamics beyond the time delay, which extends to the dampening of changes in the complex concentration with a reduction in the oscillation amplitude compared to the quasi-steady state. Interestingly, the combined effect of the time delay and amplitude reduction shapes both qualitative and quantitative oscillatory patterns such as the emergence and variability of the mammalian circadian rhythms. These findings highlight the drawback of the routine assumption of quasi-steady states and enhance the mechanistic understanding of rich time-varying biomolecular activities.</description>

      <title>Complete mathematical theory of the jamming transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The jamming transition of frictionless athermal particles is a paradigm to understand the mechanics of amorphous materials at the atomic scale. Concepts related to the jamming transition and the mechanical response of jammed packings have cross-fertilized into other areas such as atomistic descriptions of the elasticity and plasticity of glasses. In this perspective article, the microscopic mathematical theory of the jamming transition is reviewed from first-principles. The starting point of the derivation is a microscopically-reversible particle-bath Hamiltonian from which the governing equation of motion for the grains under an external deformation is derived. From this equation of motion, microscopic expressions are obtained for both the shear modulus and the viscosity as a function of the distance from the jamming transition (respectively, above and below the transition). Regarding the vanishing of the shear modulus at the unjamming transition, this theory, as originally demonstrated in [Zaccone \&amp; Scossa-Romano, Phys. Rev. B 83, 184205 (2011)], is currently the only quantitative microscopic theory in parameter-free agreement with numerical simulations of [O'Hern et al. Phys. Rev. E 68, 011306 (2003)] for jammed packings. The divergence of the viscosity upon approaching the jamming transition from below is derived here, for the first time, from the same microscopic Hamiltonian. The quantitative microscopic prediction of the diverging viscosity is shown to be in fair agreement with numerical results of sheared 2D soft disks from [Olsson \&amp; Teitel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 178001 (2007)].</description>
