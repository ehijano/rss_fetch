      <title>Emergent behaviors of the singular continuum Kuramoto model and its graph limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emergent dynamics of the singular continuum Kuramoto model (in short, SCKM) and its graph limit. The SCKM takes the form of an integro-differential equation exhibiting two types of nonlocal singularities: a nonlocal singular interaction weight and a nonlocal singular alignment force. The natural frequency function determines the emergent dynamics of the SCKM, and we emphasize that singularity plays a crucial role in the occurrence of sticking phenomena. For the identical natural frequency function, we derive the complete phase synchronization in finite time under a suitable set of conditions for system parameters and initial data. In contrast, for a nonidentical natural frequency function, we show the emergence of practical synchronization, meaning that the phase diameter is proportional to the inverse of coupling strength asymptotically. Furthermore, we rigorously establish a graph limit from the singular Kuramoto model with a finite system size to the SCKM. We also provide several numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On the Dynamics of Weighted Composition Operators II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish complete characterizations of various notions of expansivity for weighted composition operators on a very general class of locally convex spaces of continuous functions. This class includes several classical classes of continuous function spaces, such as the Banach spaces $C_0(X)$ of continuous scalar-valued functions vanishing at infinity on a Hausdorff locally compact space $X$, endowed with the sup norm, and the locally convex spaces $C(X)_c$ of continuous scalar-valued functions on a completely regular space $X$, endowed with the compact-open topology. We also obtain complete characterizations of various notions of expansivity for weighted composition operators on $L^p(\mu)$ spaces, thereby complementing and extending previously known results in the unweighted case. Finally, we establish a conjugation between weighted and unweighted composition operators in the case of dissipative systems on $L^p(\mu)$ spaces and apply it to the study of several dynamical properties.</description>

      <title>Exploring baby Julia sets in parameter space slices for Generalized McMullen Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the family of complex rational functions of the form R(z)= z^n + a/z^n+b, known as "Generalized McMullen maps", for non-zero a, and integer n fixed and at least 3, we describe the apparent phenomena of baby Julia sets in parameter space appearing both in slices with independent critical orbits and a slice defined by imposing a critical orbit relation.
  Specifically, we introduce the subfamily where one of two critical orbits is set to be a super-attracting fixed point, provide some general results on this subfamily and describe how Julia set copies in the parameter space slice occur--due to parameters for which the other critical orbit is in the (not immediate) basin of attraction of this fixed critical point. We provide several conjectures on this intriguing phenomena to catalyze further study.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of multiplicative groups over fields and Folner-Kloosterman sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For two countably infinite fields whose multiplicative groups are isomorphic, we examine invariant couplings between the actions that these groups induce on the additive Pontryagin duals of the fields. We show that the actions are disjoint unless the fields themselves are isomorphic and the group isomorphism extends (possibly after a finite twist) to a field isomorphism. As an application, we establish equidistribution of F\o lner-Kloosterman sums - an extension of classical Kloosterman sums to infinite fields. Unlike the classical case over algebraic closures of finite fields, these averages exhibit an inherent multiplicative asymmetry, revealing new and fundamentally different behavior. Finally, we derive several combinatorial consequences, including results on sum-product phenomena and a Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy-type theorem for Laurent polynomials over general fields.</description>

      <title>Sterile Insect Technique in a n-patch system with Allee effect and mass trapping: modeling, analysis and simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sterile insect technique (SIT) is a biological control method aimed at reducing or eliminating populations of pests or disease vectors. This technique involves releasing sterilised insects which, by mating with wild individuals, will reduce the target population. In this study, we take into account the spatial dimension by modelling the pest/vector population as being distributed over several plots, with wild insects and sterile insects migrating between these plots. The main objective is to identify the critical plots for intervention, using the network connectivity and potential intervention constraints.
  Using results from monotone systems theory, we first derive a sufficient condition guaranteeing the elimination of the wild population through SIT, which relies on the sign of the Perron value of a certain Metzler matrix. When an Allee effect is naturally present, releases are finite in time, and an upper bound of the control time is provided. We then formulate an optimisation problem aimed at minimising the total daily number of sterile insects released to ensure population elimination. We focus in particular on the oriental fruit fly, which significantly impacts mango orchards in La R\'eunion.
  Through numerical simulations, we illustrate our theoretical results and study different scenarios, including some where releases are limited to certain orchards. Indeed, when implementing SIT in the field, some owners may be reluctant to allow releases on their property. We also consider additional control by mass trapping, which can affect the sterile insects entering trapped areas, and show that although it increases the critical number of sterile insects to be released daily, it reduces the duration of the SIT program. Mass trapping may thus decrease the total number of sterile insects released over the entire elimination program.</description>

      <title>Expansivity of algebraic semigroup actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a semigroup $S$ and a right $\mathbb{Z}[S]$-submodule $J\leq \mathbb{Z}[S]^n$, we study expansivity of the algebraic action of $S$ induced on the Pontryagin dual of $\mathbb{Z}[S]^n/J$. We completely determine the class of semigroups for which expansivity of this action is characterized by the triviality of $J^\perp$, in terms of the existence of a finite subset $K\subseteq S$ such that $S=KS$. This condition is satisfied in particular by every monoid, and more generally by every semigroup with a left unital convolution Banach algebra, in which case we are able to extend the characterization of expansivity in terms of an invertibility condition when $J$ is finitely generated. We also exhibit examples of non-unital semigroups satisfying the hypotheses of our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brouwer homeomorphisms are fixed-point-free, orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the plane. In recent years, their dynamics have been mostly studied through two complementary approaches, one introduced by Handel and the other by Le Calvez, each offering a distinct perspective on the behavior of Brouwer homeomorphisms. In this work, we present a unified framework that allows Le Calvez's foliated methods to recover, and in some cases improve, the classical results of Handel's theory.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of the period function for planar Hamiltonian vector fields: A Generalization of Chicone's Criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the monotonicity of the period function associated with planar Hamiltonian systems of the form $H(x,y) = F(x) + G(y)$. We establish sufficient conditions ensuring the monotonicity of the period function corresponding to a nondegenerate center, expressed explicitly in terms of the functions F and G. Our approach extends Chicone's classical criterion, originally formulated for systems of the type $x' = y$, $y' = -F'(x)$, to a broader Hamiltonian framework. As a main application, we analyze the monotonicity of the period function associated with the center at (0,0) of the polynomial Hamiltonian system $$H(x,y) = (1/2)x^2 + (a/3)x^3 + (b/4)x^4 + (1/2)y^2 + (c/4)y^4,$$ as a function of the parameters $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>A winning approach to the intersections of twisted non-recurrent sets with fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that if $S\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$ is hyperplane absolute winning on a closed hyperplane diffuse set $L\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$, then $\mathrm{dim}_H S\cap K=\mathrm{dim}_H K$ for any irreducible self-conformal set $K\subseteq L$ without assuming any separation condition on $K$. The result is then applied to obtain the Hausdorff dimension of intersections between irreducible self-conformal sets and twisted non-recurrent sets $\mathrm{N}(T,\mathcal{G})$ defined as
  $$
  \mathrm{N}(T,\mathcal{G}):=\left\{\mathbf{x}\in[0,1]^d:\liminf_{n\to\infty}\|T^n(\mathbf{x})-g_n(\mathbf{x})\|&gt;0\right\},
  $$
  where $T:[0,1]^d\to[0,1]^d$ belongs to a broad class of product maps, $\mathcal{G}:=\{g_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence of self-maps on $[0,1]^d$ with uniform Lipschitz constant and $\|\cdot\|$ denotes the maximal norm in $\mathbb{R}^d$. When $T$ is the $\beta$-transformation on $[0,1]$, it provides a positive answer to a question raised informally by Broderick, Bugeaud, Fishman, Kleinbock and Weiss (Math. Res. Lett., 2010). For the case $T$ is a $d\times d$ diagonal matrix transformations, our results provide a partial answer asked in a paper of Li, Liao, Velani and Zorin (Adv. Math., 2023). A natural generalization to non-autonomous setting is also obtained.</description>

      <title>Investigating the effect of adaptive optimal control function in epidemic dynamics: predictions and strategy evolution based on SIR/V game theoretic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an adaptive optimal control problem for an SIR/V epidemic model with human behavioral effects.We develop a model where effective management of infectious diseases are monitored by the means of non pharmaceutical interventions.This study develops an adaptive optimal control function within an SIR/V framework embedding a non cooperative game theoretic mechanism to capture the dynamic interplay between individual vaccination behavior and population level transmission. We derive analytical expression for the optimal control trajectory under resource constrain and heterogeneous susceptibility and we validate our model using numerical simulations,calibrated with the real world epidemic parameters. We find that for the adaptive optimal policy for a generally known SIR/V model depending on the game theoretic epidemic state leads to substantial reduction in expenses compared to non adaptive policies. Moreover, our results demonstrate that, adaptive strategies significantly outperform the static policies by achieving lower peak infections and faster epidemic extinctions while evolutionary game dynamics identify critical behavioral thresholds that drive strategy evolution and inform timely policy adaptation</description>

      <title>Entropic Regularization in the Deep Linear Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study regularization for the deep linear network (DLN) using the entropy formula introduced in arXiv:2509.09088. The equilibria and gradient flow of the free energy on the Riemannian manifold of end-to-end maps of the DLN are characterized for energies that depend symmetrically on the singular values of the end-to-end matrix.
  The only equilibria are minimizers and the set of minimizers is an orbit of the orthogonal group. In contrast with random matrix theory there is no singular value repulsion. The corresponding gradient flow reduces to a one-dimensional ordinary differential equation whose solution gives explicit relaxation rates toward the minimizers. We also study the concavity of the entropy in the chamber of singular values. The entropy is shown to be strictly concave in the Euclidean geometry on the chamber but not in the Riemannian geometry defined by the DLN metric.</description>

      <title>Determining Modes, State Reconstruction, and Intertwinement: Existence of Self-Synchronizing Intertwinements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the companion paper of the authors, a general synchronization framework was developed in the paradigmatic context of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations that allows one to precisely study the relation between the determining modes property of the corresponding dynamical system and the ability of certain continuous data assimilation algorithms to reconstruct unobserved state variables from sufficiently many observed state variables in this system, i.e., the reconstruction property. In this framework, the determining modes property and the reconstruction property can be viewed in a unified way as the ability of certain couplings of the Navier-Stokes equations to self-synchronize; due to the bi-directionality of coupling, the coupled system is referred to as an "intertwinement." A central achievement of this framework is to deduce a conceptual equivalence between the determining modes property and the reconstruction property of continuous data assimilation algorithms. In this paper, we prove that there are at least two non-trivial classes of intertwinements to which this framework applies. Moreover, these intertwinements encompass the continuous data assimilation algorithms studied in (Olson, Titi 2003) and (Azouani, Olson, Titi 2014) as special cases. Specifically, we show that there exist two types of intertwinements that are globally well-posed and we identify conditions under which these intertwinements self-synchronize. We emphasize that the intertwinements studied here can be induced by nonlinear perturbations of the underlying system, which are subsequently coupled bi-directionally to a copy of itself. Thus, establishing global well-posedness and suitable global-in-time uniform bounds, which are crucial to proving the claimed synchronization phenomenon, requires careful consideration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a class of $\mathbb{R}^d$-ations and $\mathbb{Z}^d$-actions on the $n$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^n$, we characterize their unique ergodicity and establish a theorem of Weyl type. This result allows us to establish an isomorphism between the Banach algebra of quasi-periodic functions with spectrum in a given $\mathbb{Z}$-module and the Banach algebra of periodic functions on a torus. This, in return, allows us to give a very simple proof of Hausdorff-Young inequalities for Besicovitch almost periodic functions. The regularity of the parent function of a quasi-periodic function is also studied.</description>

Abstract: A polynomial matrix description(PMD) of a rational matrix $G(\lambda)$ is a matrix polynomial of the form $$ \mathbf{P}(\lambda) := \left[\begin{array}{c|c} A(\lambda) &amp; B(\lambda) \\ \hline -C(\lambda) &amp; D(\lambda)\end{array}\right] \text{ such that } G(\lambda) = D(\lambda) + C(\lambda) A(\lambda)^{-1} B(\lambda),$$ where $A(\lambda)$ is regular and called the state matrix. PMDs have been studied extensively in the context of higher order linear time-invariant systems. An analytic matrix description(AMD) of a meromorphic matrix $ M(\lambda)$ is a holomorphic matrix (i.e., a holomorphic matrix-valued function) of the form $$ \mathbf{H}(\lambda) := \left[\begin{array}{c|c} A(\lambda) &amp; B(\lambda) \\ \hline -C(\lambda) &amp; D(\lambda)\end{array}\right] \text{ such that } M(\lambda) = D(\lambda) + C(\lambda) A(\lambda)^{-1} B(\lambda),$$ where $A(\lambda)$ is regular and called the state matrix. AMDs arise in the study of linear time-invariant time-delay systems (TDS). Our aim is to develop a framework for analysis of AMDs analogous to the framework for PMDs and discuss the extent to which results of PMDs can be generalized to AMDs. We show that important results (e.g., coprime matrix-fraction descriptions (MFDs), least order PMDs, equivalence of PMDs, canonical forms, characterization of PMDs by transfer functions, structural indices of zeros and poles) which hold for PMDs can be generalized to AMDs which in turn can be utilized to analyze time-delay systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetry, Invariant Manifolds and Flow Reversals in Active Nematic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how symmetry, exact coherent structures (ECSs), and their invariant manifolds organize spontaneous flow reversals in a 2D active nematic confined to a periodic channel. In minimal flow units commensurate with the intrinsic active vortex scale, we use equivariant bifurcation theory to trace the origin of dynamically relevant ECSs via a sequence of symmetry-constrained local and global bifurcations. At low activity level, we identify relative periodic orbits, created via a sequence of SNIPER, homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations, whose invariant manifolds provide robust heteroclinic pathways between left- and right-flowing nearly uniaxial states. These result in several symmetry-dictated reversal mechanisms in the preturbulent regime, with and without vortex-lattice intermediate states. In the active turbulent regime, this ECS skeleton persists and organizes chaotic attractors exhibiting persistent two-way reversals. By classifying ECSs through their symmetry signatures, we relate a small set of ECSs embedded in turbulence back to the preturbulent branches, and show that typical turbulent trajectories repeatedly shadow these ECSs and their unstable manifolds, resulting in near-heteroclinic transitions between opposite-flow states. Our results establish that channel confined active nematic turbulence is organized by a low-dimensional, symmetry-governed network of invariant solutions and their manifolds, and identify dynamical mechanisms that could be exploited to design, promote, or suppress flow reversals in active matter microfluidic devices.</description>

      <title>Structure-conditioned input-to-state stability for layer-by-layer molecular computations in parallel chemical reaction networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular computation in chemical reaction networks (CRNs) now constitutes a foundational framework for designing programmable biological systems. However, prevailing design methodologies primarily treat parallelism of chemical reactions as a liability, consequently motivating researchers to redirect research focus toward leveraging parallelism to implement layer-by-layer computations of composite functions in coupled mass-action systems (MASs). MASs exhibiting this property are termed composable. Present composability verification for MASs mainly depends on input-to-state stability (ISS) conditions, with structural characteristics of networks remaining underexplored. This paper investigates the structural conditions under which two MASs are composable. By leveraging ISS-Lyapunov functions, we identify a class of CRN architectures, whose reduced systems have zero deficiency, that guarantee composability with other networks. We also extend our conclusions to encompass some CRN architectures possessing nonzero deficiency. Some examples are presented to demonstrate the validity of our theoretical results. Finally, we employ our methods to devise an algorithm for constructing MASs capable of executing specified molecular computations.</description>

      <title>Understanding LLM Agent Behaviours via Game Theory: Strategy Recognition, Biases and Multi-Agent Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly operate as autonomous decision-makers in interactive and multi-agent systems and human societies, understanding their strategic behaviour has profound implications for safety, coordination, and the design of AI-driven social and economic infrastructures. Assessing such behaviour requires methods that capture not only what LLMs output, but the underlying intentions that guide their decisions. In this work, we extend the FAIRGAME framework to systematically evaluate LLM behaviour in repeated social dilemmas through two complementary advances: a payoff-scaled Prisoners Dilemma isolating sensitivity to incentive magnitude, and an integrated multi-agent Public Goods Game with dynamic payoffs and multi-agent histories. These environments reveal consistent behavioural signatures across models and languages, including incentive-sensitive cooperation, cross-linguistic divergence and end-game alignment toward defection. To interpret these patterns, we train traditional supervised classification models on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to FAIRGAME trajectories, showing that LLMs exhibit systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioural intentions, with linguistic framing at times exerting effects as strong as architectural differences. Together, these findings provide a unified methodological foundation for auditing LLMs as strategic agents and reveal systematic cooperation biases with direct implications for AI governance, collective decision-making, and the design of safe multi-agent systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative version of Zhang's fundamental inequality for heights attached to polarizable endomorphisms. As an application, we obtain a gap principle for the N\'eron-Tate height on abelian varieties over function fields of arbitrary transcendence degree and characteristic zero, extending the result of Gao-Ge-K\"uhne. We also establish instances of effective gap principles for regular polynomial endomorphisms of $\mathbb{P}^2$, in the sense that all constants can are explicit. These yield effective instances of uniformity in the dynamical Bogomolov conjecture in both the arithmetic and geometric settings, including examples in prime characteristic.</description>

      <title>Quantitative indistinguishability and sparse and dense clusters in factor of IID percolations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chifan-Ioana (2010) implies that, for any factor of IID percolation on any nonamenable Cayley graph $G$, there is a countable set of (strong) indistinguishability classes for non-hyperfinite clusters. We introduce quantitative strengthenings, called (qI) and (qSI): for $\eta$-non-hyperfinite clusters, there are at most $M(G,\eta)&lt;\infty$ (strong) indistinguishability classes, for any FIID percolation.
  We first show that (qI) and (qSI) for any $G$ are equivalent to the ``sparse implies thin'' property (SiT): any FIID percolation with $\eta$-non-hyperfinite clusters has density at least $c(G,\eta)&gt;0$. Also, (SiT) is independent of the finite generating set of a group. We prove, using entropy inequalities, that (SiT) holds for free groups, even for weak FIIDs. On the other hand, recent work of Jard\'on-S\'anchez, Mellick, Poulin, and Wr\'obel implies that (SiT) fails for weak FIIDs on non-exact, i.e., not property (A) groups.
  Furthermore, (SiT) implies that the Bernoulli graphing over any non-hyperfinite FIID cluster is strongly ergodic, and that indistinguishability for non-hyperfinite FIID clusters is equivalent to strong indistinguishability. These results follow from the work of Chifan-Ioana for every nonamenable Cayley graph, but with non-probabilistic proofs.
  We also prove, again using entropy inequalities, this time for all nonamenable Cayley graphs, that any FIID percolation with high enough expected degree must have a density close to 1, and there must be a single indistinguishability class of such clusters. On Kazhdan groups, there must be a single such cluster.
  Our results have finite counterparts: in any large girth $d$-regular graph sequence, any FIID subgraph of average degree at least $2+\delta$ must have density at least $c(d,\delta)&gt;0$. In the uniform random d-regular graph $G_{n,d}$, this holds for every subgraph of average degree at least $2+\delta$.</description>

      <title>Dynamics on invariant tori emerging through forced symmetry breaking in phase oscillator networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider synchrony patterns in coupled phase oscillator networks that correspond to invariant tori. For specific nongeneric coupling, these tori are equilibria relative to a continuous symmetry action. We analyze how the invariant tori deform under forced symmetry breaking as more general network interaction terms are introduced. We first show in general that perturbed tori that are relative equilibria can be computed using a parametrization method; this yields an asymptotic expansion of an embedding of the perturbed torus, as well as the local dynamics on the torus. We then apply this result to a coupled oscillator network, and we numerically study the dynamics on the persisting tori in the network by looking for bifurcations of their periodic orbits in a boundary-value-problem setup. This way we find new bifurcating stable synchrony patterns that can be the building blocks of larger global structures such as heteroclinic cycles.</description>

      <title>Dynamics, data and reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19734v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of data-driven learning of dynamical systems is to interpret time series as a continuous observation of an underlying dynamical system. This task is not well-posed for a variety of reasons - such as multiple co-existing sub-systems, topologically inter-weaving of these sub-systems; and more importantly, the non-injectivity of the correspondence between dynamical systems and time series. We show how these ambiguities are circumvented if one considers dynamical systems and measurement maps collectively. Dynamical systems, observed dynamical systems, and time series data - each of these three collections have an extensive network of relations within them, which gives them the mathematical structure of a category. One of the new concepts proposed is a rigorous definition of time series data as a chain of measurement sequences with decreasing information content. This definition subsumes the familiar notions of sequences, time series and even subshifts. Using these notions it is shown that the entire process of converting an observed dynamical systems into a time series object is functorial, and passes through a number of phases each bearing its own categorical structure. This discovery sheds new light on the nature of reconstruction algorithms. Under mild conditions of consistency, reconstruction itself is shown to be functorial operation. This provides a new category theoretic perspective on the nature and limits of reconstruction.</description>

      <title>On global rigidity of transversely holomorphic Anosov flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study transversely holomorphic flows, i.e. those whose holonomy pseudo-group is given by biholomorphic maps. We prove that for Anosov flows on smooth compact manifolds, the strong unstable (respectively, stable) distribution is integrable to complex manifolds, on which the flow acts holomorphically. Furthermore, assuming its complex dimension to be one, it is uniquely integrable to complex affine one-dimensional manifolds, each moreover affinely diffeomorphic to $\mathbb C$, on which the flow acts affinely. In this case, the weak stable (respectively, unstable) foliation is transversely holomorphic, and even transversely projective if the flow is assumed to be topologically transitive. By combining these facts in low dimensions, our main result is as follows : if a transversely holomorphic Anosov flow on a smooth compact five-dimensional manifold is topologically transitive, then it is either $C^\infty$-orbit equivalent to the suspension of a hyperbolic automorphism of a complex torus, or, up to finite covers, $C^\infty$-orbit equivalent to the geodesic flow of a compact hyperbolic manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13882v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety defined on a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. On $X$ there is a special morphism $Fr_X$, which raises coordinates to exponent $q$: $t\mapsto t^q$. The two main results in this paper are:
  Result 1: If Standard conjecture D holds (for algebraic cycles of dimension $=\dim (X)$) on $X\times X$, then all polarised endomorphisms on $X$ are semisimple.
  Result 2: We provide heuristic arguments to show that Standard Conjecture D should imply both Dynamical degree comparison conjecture (a generalisation of both Weil's Riemann hypothesis and Tate's question on the absolute value of the eigenvalues of polarised endomorphisms), Norm comparison conjecture (allowing to bound the growth of the pullback of iterations of an endomorphism on cohomology groups in terms of that on algebraic cycles, in particularly implying the semisimplicity of polarised endomorphisms), and Conjecture $G_r$ (which together with Standard conjecture D imply the previous mentioned two conjectures), proposed in previous works by Fei Hu and the author. The heuristic argument relies on the possibility of defining the self-composition $Fr_X^s$ in a good way, where $s$ is an arbitrary rational number (allowed to be negative), and similarly for another object related to the Frobenius morphism.</description>

      <title>Distributions of bounded real sequences and Astorg-Boc Thaler's question</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While studying the existence of wandering domains in complex dynamics, Astorg-Boc Thaler posed a question concerning the distribution of bounded real sequences: for $\alpha&gt;1$ that has the Pisot property, is $\frac{\beta\ln\alpha}{\alpha-1}$ being rational necessary for the existence of an increasing sequence of integers $(n_k)_{k\geqslant 1}$ such that $(n_{k+1}-\alpha n_k-\beta\ln n_k)_{k\geqslant 1}$ converges to a cycle?
  When $\alpha$ is an algebraic number, we answer Astorg-Boc Thaler's question in the affirmative: the condition $\theta$ being rational is necessary and sufficient for the convergence to a cycle.
  Furthermore, let $P(x)\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ be the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$. We prove that $P(1)\theta\in\mathbb{Z}$ is a necessary condition, while $\frac{P(1)\theta}{\gcd(P(1),P'(1))}\in\mathbb{Z}$ is a sufficient condition, for the convergence to a cycle of length 1.
  As an application, we present explicit new examples of polynomial skew products in $\mathbb{C}^2$ with wandering domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While exploring dynamical systems, we often come across the principle of contraction mapping, or better known as the Banach fixed point theorem. It is an essential concept based on successive approximation, whose utility comes from two main guarantees: establishing existence and uniqueness of a solution, and establishing constructive proof. The intent of this manuscript is to break down two major proofs incorporating this in ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and make them a little more understandable step-by-step to an audience that presumably has adequate knowledge of modern calculus and real analysis. These are not original proofs, only original narration.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Synchronization States in the Hybrid Kuramoto Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a unified synchronization framework for the all-to-all hybrid Kuramoto model that couples first- and second-order oscillators within a single dynamical system. Although the Kuramoto model has become one of the most widely used paradigms for describing synchronization phenomena-appearing in more than 100,000 scientific studies-the fundamental relationships among distinct synchronization states remain unresolved. In this work, we rigorously prove that full phase-locking, phase-locking, frequency synchronization, and order-parameter synchronization are equivalent for arbitrary hybrid ensembles. The proof combines dissipative energy methods, LaSalle-type compactness arguments, the Poincar{\'e}-Bendixson theorem, and Thieme's asymptotically autonomous theory to demonstrate that synchronization equivalence is topological, determined solely by the finite equilibrium structure of the all-to-all network. This result provides a complete mathematical characterization of synchronization in finite oscillator systems and clarifies its geometric invariance across first-, second-, and hybrid-order models.</description>

      <title>Fredholm Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09484v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the family of explainable machine-learning, we present Fredholm neural networks (Fredholm NNs): deep neural networks (DNNs) architectures motivated by fixed-point iteration schemes for the solution of linear and nonlinear Fredholm integral equations (FIEs) of the second kind. We also show how the proposed framework can be used for the solution of inverse problems. Applications of FIEs include the solution of ordinary, as well as partial differential equations (ODEs, PDEs) and many more. We first prove that Fredholm NNs provide accurate solutions. We then provide insight into the values of the hyperparameters and trainable/explainable weights and biases of the DNN, by directly connecting their values to the underlying mathematical theory. For our illustrations, we use Fredholm NNs to solve both linear and nonlinear problems, including elliptic PDEs and boundary value problems. We show that the proposed scheme achieves significant numerical approximation accuracy across both the domain and boundary. The proposed methodology provides insight into the connection between neural networks and classical numerical methods, and we posit that it can have applications in fields such as Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Thus, we believe that it will trigger further advances in the intersection between scientific machine learning and numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Chaotic Itinerancy Phenomenon using Entropy and Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22643v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new methodology for the analysis of the phenomenon of chaotic itinerancy in a dynamical system using the notion of entropy and a clustering algorithm. We determine systems likely to experience chaotic itinerancy by means of local Shannon entropy and local permutation entropy. In such systems, we find quasi-stable states (attractor ruins) and chaotic transition states using a density-based clustering algorithm. Our approach then focuses on examining the chaotic itinerancy dynamics through the characterization of residence times within these states and chaotic transitions between them with the help of some statistical tests. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods on the system of globally coupled logistic maps (GCM), a well-known model exhibiting chaotic itinerancy. In particular, we conduct comprehensive computations for a large number of parameters in the GCM system and algorithmically identify itinerant dynamics observed previously by Kaneko in numerical simulations as coherent and intermittent phases.</description>

      <title>Effective permeability conditions for diffusive transport through impermeable membranes with gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10694v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the optimal continued fractions studied independently by Selenius and Bosma, we define and introduce algorithms producing superoptimal continued fraction expansions of irrationals. The convergents of these expansions simultaneously provide arbitrarily good rational approximations and converge arbitrarily quickly.</description>

      <title>Computation of Feasible Assume-Guarantee Contracts: A Resilience-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a resilience-based framework for computing feasible assume-guarantee contracts that ensure the satisfaction of temporal specifications in interconnected discrete-time systems. Interconnection effects are modeled as structured disturbances. We use a resilience metric, the maximum disturbance under which local specifications hold, to refine assumptions and guarantees across subsystems iteratively. We first demonstrate correctness and monotone refinement of guarantees for two subsystems. Then, we extend our approach to general networks of L subsystems using weighted combinations of interconnection effects. We instantiate the framework on linear systems by meeting finite-horizon safety, exact-time reachability, and finite-horizon reachability specifications, and on nonlinear systems by fulfilling general finite-horizon specifications. Our approach is demonstrated through numerical linear examples and a nonlinear DC microgrid case study, showcasing the impact of our framework on verifying temporal logic specifications with compositional reasoning.</description>

      <title>Marked Poincar\'e rigidity near hyperbolic metrics and injectivity of the Lichnerowicz Laplacian in dimension 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact manifold without boundary equipped with a Riemannian metric $g$ of negative curvature. In this paper, we introduce the marked Poincar\'e determinant (MPD), a homothety invariant of $g$ depending on differentiable periodic data of its geodesic flow. The MPD associates to each free homotopy class of closed curves in $M$ a number which measures the unstable volume expansion of the geodesic flow along the associated closed geodesic. We prove a local MPD rigidity result in dimension 3: if $g$ is sufficiently close to a hyperbolic metric $g_0$ and both metrics have the same MPD, then they are homothetic. As a by-product of our proof, we show the Lichnerowicz Laplacian of $g_0$ is injective on the space of trace-free divergence-free symmetric 2-tensors, which, to our knowledge, is the first result of its kind in negative curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lagrange identity expresses the second derivative of the moment of inertia of a system of material points through kinetic energy and homogeneous potential energy, from which follows the Jacobi well-known result on the instability of a system of gravitating bodies. In this work, it is proven that if a Hamiltonian system satisfies the Lagrange identity, then it possesses additional tensor invariants that are not expressed through the basic invariants existing for all Hamiltonian systems. A new class of Hamiltonian systems with inhomogeneous potentials is considered, which also possess similar additional tensor invariants.</description>

      <title>An Information Theory of Finite Abstractions and their Fundamental Scalability Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite abstractions are discrete approximations of dynamical systems, such that the set of abstraction trajectories contains all system trajectories. There is a consensus that abstractions suffer from the curse of dimensionality: for the same ``accuracy" (how closely the abstraction represents the system), the abstraction size scales poorly with system dimensions. And yet, after decades of research on abstractions, there are no formal results on their accuracy-size tradeoff. In this work, we derive a statistical, quantitative theory of abstractions' accuracy-size tradeoff and uncover fundamental limits on their scalability, through rate-distortion theory -- the information theory of lossy compression. Abstractions are viewed as encoder-decoder pairs, encoding trajectories of dynamical systems. Rate measures abstraction size, while distortion describes accuracy, defined as the spatial average deviation between abstract trajectories and system ones. We obtain a fundamental lower bound on the minimum achievable abstraction distortion, given the system dynamics and the abstraction size; and vice-versa a lower bound on the minimum size, for given distortion. The bound depends on the complexity of the dynamics, through trajectory entropy. We demonstrate its tightness on some dynamical systems. Finally, we showcase how this new theory enables constructing minimal abstractions, optimizing the size-accuracy tradeoff, through an example on a chaotic system.</description>
