      <title>Constructing the spin-1 Haldane phase on a qudit quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological phases have fundamentally changed our understanding of quantum matter. An archetypal example of such a quantum phase of matter is the Haldane phase, containing the spin-1 Heisenberg chain. The intrinsic quantum nature of such phases, however, often makes it challenging to study them using classical means. Here, we use trapped-ion qutrits to natively engineer spin-1 chains within the Haldane phase. Using a scalable, deterministic procedure to prepare the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state within the Haldane phase, we study the topological features of this system on a qudit quantum processor. Notably, we verify the long-range string order of the state, despite its short-range correlations, and observe spin fractionalization of the physical spin-1 particles into effective qubits at the chain edges, a defining feature of this system. The native realization of Haldane physics on a qudit quantum processor and the scalable preparation procedures open the door to the efficient exploration of a wide range of systems beyond spin-1/2</description>

      <title>Quantum Neural Network Training of a Repeater Node</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of robust and scalable quantum gates is a uniquely hard problem in the field of quantum computing. Real-world quantum computers suffer from many forms of noise, characterized by the decoherence and relaxation times of a quantum circuit, which make it very hard to construct efficient quantum algorithms. One example is a quantum repeater node, a circuit that swaps the states of two entangled input and output qubits. Robust quantum repeaters are a necessary building block of long-distance quantum networks. A solution exists for this problem, known as a swap gate, but its noise tolerance is poor. Machine learning may hold the key to efficient and robust quantum algorithm design, as demonstrated by its ability to learn to control other noisy and highly nonlinear systems. Here, a quantum neural network (QNN) is constructed to perform the swap operation and compare a trained QNN solution to the standard swap gate. The system of qubits and QNN is constructed in MATLAB and trained under ideal conditions before noise is artificially added to the system to test robustness. We find that the QNN easily generalizes for two qubits and can be scaled up to more qubits without additional training. We also find that as the number of qubits increases, the noise tolerance increases with it, meaning a sufficiently large system can produce extremely noise-tolerant results. This begins to explore the ability of neural networks to construct those robust systems.</description>

      <title>Dicke states as matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an exact canonical matrix product state (MPS) representation for Dicke states $|D^n_k\rangle$ with minimal bond dimension $\chi=k+1$, for general values of $n$ and $k$, for which the W-state is the simplest case $k=1$. We use this MPS to formulate a quantum circuit for sequentially preparing Dicke states deterministically, relating it to the recursive algorithm of B\"artschi and Eidenbenz. We also find exact canonical MPS representations with minimal bond dimension for higher-spin and qudit Dicke states.</description>

      <title>Latent optical nonclassicality of conditionally-prepared states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of information obtained from informationally-incomplete quantum measurements can prevent the detection of quantum resources, such as optical nonclassicality. We develop a technique that overcomes this limitation for single-mode quantum states conditionally prepared through measurements on another mode of a two-mode state. This task is performed by testing nonclassical steering -- a class of quantum correlations beyond quantum entanglement and quantum discord, for which we introduce a rigorous description.</description>

      <title>Sequential Hamiltonian Assembly: Enhancing the training of combinatorial optimization problems on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in quantum machine learning is the design and training of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). Much like in deep learning, vanishing gradients pose significant obstacles to the trainability of PQCs, arising from various sources. One such source is the presence of non-local loss functions, which require the measurement of a large subset of qubits involved. To address this issue and facilitate parameter training for quantum applications using global loss functions, we propose Sequential Hamiltonian Assembly (SHA). SHA iteratively approximates the loss by assembling it from local components. To further demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we extend our previous case study by introducing a new partitioning strategy, a new merger between QAOA and SHA, and an evaluation of SHA onto the Max-Cut optimization problem. Simulation results show that SHA outperforms conventional parameter training by 43.89% and the empirical state-of-the-art, Layer-VQE by 29.08% in the mean accuracy for Max-Cut. This paves the way for locality-aware learning techniques, mitigating vanishing gradients for a large class of practically relevant problems.</description>

      <title>Currents in non-equilibrium steady states of open inhomogeneous $XX$-spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spin and heat currents in the non-equilibrium steady state of inhomogeneous $XX$-spin chains, which act as interfaces between two bosonic heat baths. Using special functions that diagonalize the single-particle Hamiltonian, we derive closed-form expressions for these currents. For small temperature differences between the baths, we show that inhomogeneities breaking the mirror symmetry of the chain significantly reduce both heat and spin conductivities. Connections with perfect state transfer are discussed.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous PT-symmetry breaking transitions under the influence of noise in an optomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a phenomenon of an alteration of a state symmetry without a change in the system symmetry. A transition from a state with unbroken symmetry to a state with broken symmetry leads to a qualitative change in system properties, and respective states are called as symmetric and non-symmetric phases of the system. Usually, the change in the system parameters is necessary for the transition between symmetric and non-symmetric phases. In this letter, we consider the behavior of an optomechanical system with an exceptional point under the influence of noise. We demonstrate that below the exceptional point, PT-symmetric and non-PT-symmetric phases can coexist. In this regime, a noise can lead to random transitions between the symmetric and non-symmetric phases. These transitions are accompanied by the abrupt changes in the intensities of photon and phonon modes. The predicted phenomenon opens up the possibility of studying the kinetics of phase transitions caused by spontaneous breaking of PT symmetry.</description>

      <title>Qualitatively altered driven Dicke superradiance in extended systems due to infinitesimal perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The driven Dicke model, with interesting quantum phases induced by parameterized driving, has been intensively studied in cavities, where permutation symmetry applies due to the atoms' equal coupling to the field and identical interaction. As a result, the system, with proper initialization, can remain in a highly symmetric subset of the state space, where the photon emission of each atom constructively interferes with each other, leading to superradiance at steady state. However, because of the degeneracy of steady states for the driven Dicke model, the steady state can be qualitatively altered by an infinitesimal perturbation. In this work, we simulate superconducting qubits coupled to a 1D waveguide as the extended system and theoretically investigate four kinds of perturbations: local dephasing, individual driving phases, the separation between adjacent qubits, and individual detunings. Using an angular momentum basis, we predict the dimension of the degenerate subspace and study the transition within the subspace due to the perturbation.</description>

      <title>Tensor-based quantum phase difference estimation for large-scale demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an energy calculation algorithm leveraging quantum phase difference estimation (QPDE) scheme and a tensor-network-based unitary compression method in the preparation of superposition states and time-evolution gates. Alongside its efficient implementation, this algorithm reduces depolarization noise affections exponentially. We demonstrated energy gap calculations for one-dimensional Hubbard models on IBM superconducting devices using circuits up to 32-system (plus one-ancilla) qubits, a five-fold increase over previous QPE demonstrations, at the 7242 controlled-Z gate level of standard transpilation, keying a Q-CTRL error suppression module. Additionally, we propose a technique towards molecular executions using spatial orbital localization and index sorting, verified by an eight-qubit butadiene simulation. Since QPDE can handle the same objectives as QPE, our algorithm represents a leap forward in quantum computing on real devices.</description>

      <title>Regeneration of Spin Wave in Atomic Vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventionally, atomic vapor is perceived as a non-living system governed by the principles of thermodynamics and statistical physics. However, the demarcation line between life and non-life appears to be less distinct than previously thought. In a study of amplifying spin waves, we observe a phenomenon reminiscent of life: The atomic spin wave stored in atomic vapor has a capability of absorbing energy from an external light source, and exhibits behaviors akin to active regeneration. We demonstrate that this regeneration significantly enhances the lifetime and retrieval efficiency of the spin wave, while concurrently the noise is effectively suppressed. Our results suggest that the regeneration mechanism holds promise for mitigating the pronounced decoherence typically encountered in spin waves carried by room-temperature media, therefore offering potential applications in the realms of quantum information and precision measurements at ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>On the Liouville-von Neumann equation for unbounded Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of mixed states of a closed quantum system is described by a group of evolution superoperators whose infinitesimal generator (the quantum Liouville superoperator, or Liouvillian) determines the mixed-state counterpart of the Schr\"odinger equation: the Liouville-von Neumann equation. When the state space of the system is infinite-dimensional, the Liouville superoperator is unbounded whenever the corresponding Hamiltonian is. In this paper, we provide a rigorous, pedagogically-oriented, and self-contained introduction to the quantum Liouville formalism in the presence of unbounded operators. We present and discuss a characterization of the domain of the Liouville superoperator originally due to M. Courbage; starting from that, we develop some simpler characterizations of the domain of the Liouvillian and its square. We also provide, with explicit proofs, some domains of essential self-adjointness (cores) of the Liouvillian.</description>

      <title>Exploring Non-Markovianity in Ergodic Channels: Introducing Ergotropy as a Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we characterise a general set of quantum operations which possess a singular fixed point. These channels are dubbed as quantum ergodic channels. We have constructed Lindblad-type master equations for such channels for arbitrary dimensions. We also characterise the aspect of non-Markovianity for such a general class of channels. Interestingly, if the fixed point is considered a passive state, it turns out to be an ergotropy-decreasing channel at a given instant. The formalism of ergotropy is widely used in quantum batteries, where it quantifies how effectively a quantum battery can be used as an energy source under unitary evolution only. Our investigation explores how the usefulness of a quantum battery, or the ergotropy of a system, varies under ergodic dynamics. We observed that, while ergotropy always decreases in a Markovian process, it fluctuates under non-Markovian ergodic dynamics. This ergotropy backflow in the non-Markovian process makes it a potential candidate for measuring non-Markovianity. Consequently, this study enhances our understanding of quantum battery evolution in open dynamics and paves the way for more efficient quantum technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor networks are a popular and computationally efficient approach to simulate general quantum systems on classical computers and, in a broader sense, a framework for dealing with high-dimensional numerical problems. This paper presents a broad literature review of state-of-the-art applications of tensor networks and related topics across many research domains including: machine learning, mathematical optimisation, materials science, quantum chemistry and quantum circuit simulation. This review aims to clarify which classes of relevant applications have been proposed for which class of tensor networks, and how these perform compared with other classical or quantum simulation methods. We intend this review to be a high-level tour on tensor network applications which is easy to read by non-experts, focusing on key results and limitations rather than low-level technical details of tensor networks.</description>

      <title>Learning symmetry-protected topological order from trapped-ion experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical machine learning has proven remarkably useful in post-processing quantum data, yet typical learning algorithms often require prior training to be effective. In this work, we employ a tensorial kernel support vector machine (TK-SVM) to analyze experimental data produced by trapped-ion quantum computers. This unsupervised method benefits from directly interpretable training parameters, allowing it to identify the non-trivial string-order characterizing symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. We apply our technique to two examples: a spin-1/2 model and a spin-1 model, featuring the cluster state and the AKLT state as paradigmatic instances of SPT order, respectively. Using matrix product states, we generate a family of quantum circuits that host a trivial phase and an SPT phase, with a sharp phase transition between them. For the spin-1 case, we implement these circuits on two distinct trapped-ion machines based on qubits and qutrits. Our results demonstrate that the TK-SVM method successfully distinguishes the two phases across all noisy experimental datasets, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in quantum data interpretation.</description>

      <title>Concept learning of parameterized quantum models from limited measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical learning of the expectation values of observables for quantum states is a natural variant of learning quantum states or channels. While learning-theoretic frameworks establish the sample complexity and the number of measurement shots per sample required for learning such statistical quantities, the interplay between these two variables has not been adequately quantified before. In this work, we take the probabilistic nature of quantum measurements into account in classical modelling and discuss these quantities under a single unified learning framework. We provide provable guarantees for learning parameterized quantum models that also quantify the asymmetrical effects and interplay of the two variables on the performance of learning algorithms. These results show that while increasing the sample size enhances the learning performance of classical machines, even with single-shot estimates, the improvements from increasing measurements become asymptotically trivial beyond a constant factor. We further apply our framework and theoretical guarantees to study the impact of measurement noise on the classical surrogation of parameterized quantum circuit models. Our work provides new tools to analyse the operational influence of finite measurement noise in the classical learning of quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Hidden curved spaces in Bosonic Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum matter in curved spaces exhibits remarkable properties unattainable in flat spaces. To access curved spaces in laboratories, the conventional wisdom is that physical distortions need to be implemented into a system. In contrast to this belief, here, we show that two hyperbolic surfaces readily exist in bosonic Kitaev model in the absence of any physical distortions and give rise to a range of intriguing phenomena, such as chiral quantum transport or chiral reaction-diffusion. A finite chemical potential couples these two hyperbolic surfaces, delivering a quantum sensor whose sensitivity grows exponentially with the size of the system. Our results provide experimentalists with an unprecedented opportunity to explore intriguing quantum phenomena in curve spaces without distortion or access non-Hermitian phenomena without dissipation. Our work also suggests a new class of quantum sensors in which geometry amplifies small signals.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an open quantum system consisting of a qubit coupled to a harmonic oscillator subject to two-photon relaxation and demonstrate that such a system can be utilized to construct a cat qubit capable of passive error correction. To this end, we first show that the steady state of the qubit-oscillator system, described by the open quantum Rabi model with two-photon relaxation, undergoes a superradiant phase transition that breaks the strong symmetry of the Lindblad master equation. In the strong symmetry-broken phase, we show that a cat qubit can be stabilized in the steady state by tuning the qubit-oscillator coupling strength and demonstrate that passive error correction can be realized against errors due to fluctuations in the system frequencies. Our study deepens the understanding of dissipative phases in a qubit-oscillator system with strong symmetry and paves the way to utilize them for passive error correction.</description>

      <title>Deterministic remote entanglement using a chiral quantum interconnect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum interconnects facilitate entanglement distribution between non-local computational nodes. For superconducting processors, microwave photons are a natural means to mediate this distribution. However, many existing architectures limit node connectivity and directionality. In this work, we construct a chiral quantum interconnect between two nominally identical modules in separate microwave packages. We leverage quantum interference to emit and absorb microwave photons on demand and in a chosen direction between these modules. We optimize the protocol using model-free reinforcement learning to maximize absorption efficiency. By halting the emission process halfway through its duration, we generate remote entanglement between modules in the form of a four-qubit W state with 62.4 +/- 1.6% (leftward photon propagation) and 62.1 +/- 1.2% (rightward) fidelity, limited mainly by propagation loss. This quantum network architecture enables all-to-all connectivity between non-local processors for modular and extensible quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Decoding Quantum LDPC Codes Using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel decoding method for Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (QLDPC) codes based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Similar to the Belief Propagation (BP)-based QLDPC decoders, the proposed GNN-based QLDPC decoder exploits the sparse graph structure of QLDPC codes and can be implemented as a message-passing decoding algorithm. We compare the proposed GNN-based decoding algorithm against selected classes of both conventional and neural-enhanced QLDPC decoding algorithms across several QLDPC code designs. The simulation results demonstrate excellent performance of GNN-based decoders along with their low complexity compared to competing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis conducted by Rymarz and DiVincenzo (Phys. Rev. X 13, 021017 (2023)) regarding quantization of superconducting circuits is insufficient to justify their general conclusions, most importantly the need to discard Kirchhoff's laws to effect variable reductions. Amongst a variety of reasons, one source of several disagreements with experimental and theoretical results is the long-standing dispute between extended vs compact variables in the presence of Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>Relational dynamics and Page-Wootters formalism in group field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03432v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group field theory posits that spacetime is emergent and is hence defined without any background notion of space or time; dynamical questions are formulated in relational terms, in particular using (scalar) matter degrees of freedom as time. Unlike in canonical quantisation of gravitational systems, there is no obvious notion of coordinate transformations or constraints, and established quantisation methods cannot be directly applied. As a result, different canonical formalisms for group field theory have been discussed in the literature. We address these issues using a parametrised version of group field theory, in which all (geometry and matter) degrees of freedom evolve in a fiducial parameter. There is a constraint associated to the freedom of reparametrisation and the Dirac quantisation programme can be implemented. Using the "trinity of relational dynamics", we show that the resulting "clock-neutral" theory is entirely equivalent to a deparametrised canonical group field theory, interpreted in terms of the Page-Wootters formalism. Our results not only show that the deparametrised quantisation is fully covariant and can be seen as encoding the dynamics of joint quantum matter and geometry degrees of freedom, they also appear to be the first application of the Page-Wootters formalism directly to non-perturbative quantum gravity. We show extensions to a setting in which many independent gauge symmetries are introduced, which connects to the "multi-fingered time" idea in quantum gravity and provides a somewhat novel extension of the Page-Wootters formalism.</description>

      <title>The effect of quantum decoherence on inflationary gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of inflation provides a mechanism to explain the structures we observe today in the Universe, starting from quantum-mechanically generated fluctuations. However, this leaves the question of: how did the quantum-to-classical transition, occur? During inflation, tensor perturbations interact (at least gravitationally) with other fields, meaning that we need to view these perturbations as an open system that interacts with an environment. In this paper, the evolution of the system is described using a Lindblad equation, which describes the quantum decoherence of the system. This is a possible mechanism for explaining the quantum-to-classical transition. We show that this quantum decoherence leads to a scale-dependent increase of the gravitational wave power spectrum, depending on the strength and time dependence of the interaction between the system and the environment. By using current upper bounds on the gravitational wave power spectrum from inflation, obtained from CMB and the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA constraints, we find an upper bound on the interaction strength. Furthermore, we compute the decoherence criterion, which indicates the minimal interaction strength needed for a specific scale to have successfully decohered by the end of inflation. Assuming that the CMB modes have completely decohered, we indicate a lower bound on the interaction strength. In addition, this decoherence criterion allows us to look at which scales might not have fully decohered and could still show some relic quantum signatures. Lastly, we use sensitivity forecasts to study how future gravitational-wave detectors, such as LISA and ET, could constrain the decoherence parameter space. Due to the scale-dependence of the power spectrum, LISA could only have a very small impact. However, ET will be able to significantly improve our current constraints for specific decoherence scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Description of Wave Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We outline a fundamentally quantum description of bosonic dark matter (DM) from which the conventional classical-wave picture emerges in the limit $m \ll 10~\textrm{eV}$. As appropriate for a quantum system, we start from the density matrix which encodes the full information regarding the possible measurements we could make of DM and their fluctuations. Following fundamental results in quantum optics, we argue that for DM it is most likely that the density matrix takes the explicitly mixed form of a Gaussian over the basis of coherent states. Deviations from this would generate non-Gaussian fluctuations in DM observables, allowing a direct probe of the quantum state of DM. Our quantum optics inspired approach allows us to rigorously define and interpret various quantities that are often only described heuristically, such as the coherence time or length. The formalism further provides a continuous description of DM through the wave-particle transition, which we exploit to study how density fluctuations over various physical scales evolve between the two limits and to reveal the unique behavior of DM near the boundary of the wave and particle descriptions.</description>

Abstract: The derivation of a function is a fundamental tool for solving problems in calculus. Consequently, the motivations for investigating physical systems capable of performing this task are numerous. Furthermore, the potential to develop an optical computer to replace conventional computers has led us to create an optical algorithm and propose an experimental setup for implementing the derivative of one-dimensional real-valued functions using a paraxial and monochromatic laser beam. To complement the differentiation algorithm, we have experimentally implemented a novel optical algorithm that can transfer a two-dimensional phase-encoded function to the intensity profile of a light beam. Additionally, we demonstrate how to implement the n-th derivative of functions encoded in the phase of the transverse profile of photons.</description>

      <title>Modeling Athermal Phonons in Novel Materials using the G4CMP Simulation Toolkit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding phonon and charge propagation in superconducting devices plays an important role in both performing low-threshold dark matter searches and limiting correlated errors in superconducting qubits. The Geant4 Condensed Matter Physics (G4CMP) package, originally developed for the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) experiment, models charge and phonon transport within silicon and germanium detectors and has been validated by experimental measurements of phonon caustics, mean charge-carrier drift velocities, and heat pulse propagation times. In this work, we present a concise framework for expanding the capabilities for phonon transport to a number of other novel substrate materials of interest to the dark matter and quantum computing communities, including sapphire (Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$), gallium arsenide (GaAs), lithium fluoride (LiF), calcium tungstate (CaWO$_{4}$), and calcium fluoride (CaF$_{2}$). We demonstrate the use of this framework in generating phonon transport properties of these materials and compare these properties with experimentally-determined values where available.</description>

      <title>A framework for generalizing toric inequalities for holographic entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conjecture and prove a multi-parameter generalization of the toric inequalities of \cite{Czech:2023xed} for some range of parameters. In addition, we extend their proof methods for the generalized toric inequalities in two ways. The first extension constructs the graph corresponding to the toric inequalities and the generalized toric conjectures by tiling the Euclidean space. An entanglement wedge nesting relation then determines the geometric structure of the tiles. In the second extension, we exploit the cyclic nature of the inequalities and conjectures to construct cycle graphs. Then, the graph can be obtained using graph Cartesian products of cycle graphs. In addition, we define a set of knots on the graph by following \cite{Czech:2023xed}. These graphs with knots then imply the validity of their associated inequality. We study the particular case where the graph can be decomposed into disjoint unions of torii. %We extend and propopse the proof by a contraction map of toric inequalities to the conjectures. We also discuss ways to explore the conjectured inequalities whose corresponding geometries are $d$-dimensional torus $(d&gt;2)$.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Witness for Indistinguishable Electrons using Solid-State Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing entanglement in quantum materials is crucial for advancing next-generation quantum technologies. Despite recent strides in witnessing entanglement in magnetic materials with distinguishable spin modes, quantifying entanglement in systems formed by indistinguishable electrons remains a formidable challenge. To solve this problem, we introduce a method to extract various four-fermion correlations by analyzing the nonlinearity in resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra. These correlations constitute the primary components of the cumulant two-particle reduced density matrix (RDM). We further derive bounds for its eigenvalues and demonstrate the linear scaling with fermionic entanglement depth, providing a reliable witness for entanglement. Using the material-relevant strongly correlated models as examples, we show how this this entanglement witness can efficiently quantify multipartite entanglement across different phase regions, highlighting its advantage over quantum Fisher information (QFI).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate the performance of several density-based methods in predicting the inversion of S$_1$ and T$_1$ states of a few N-heterocyclic fused ring molecules (popularly known as INVEST molecules) with an eye to identify a well performing but cheap preliminary screening method. Both conventional LR-TDDFT and $\Delta$SCF methods (namely MOM, SGM, ROKS) are considered for excited state computations using exchange-correlation (XC) functionals from different rungs of the Jacob's ladder. A well-justified systematism is observed in the performance of the functionals when compared against FICMRCISD and/or EOM-CCSD, with the most important feature being the capture of spin-polarization in presence of correlation. A set of functionals with the least mean absolute error (MAE) is proposed for both the approaches, LR-TDDFT and $\Delta$SCF, which can be cheaper alternatives for computations on synthesizable larger derivatives of the templates studied here. We have based our findings on extensive studies of three cyclazine-based molecular templates, with additional studies on a set of six related templates. Previous benchmark studies for subsets of the functionals were conducted against the DLPNO-STEOM-CCSD, which resulted in an inadequate evaluation due to deficiencies in the benchmark theory. The role of exact-exchange, spin-contamination and spin-polarization in the context of DFT comes to the forefront in our studies and supports the numerical evaluation of XC functionals for these applications. Suitable connections are drawn to two and three state exciton models which identify the minimal physics governing the interactions in these molecules.</description>

      <title>Instability of the engineered dark state in two-band fermions under number-conserving dissipative dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated quantum many-body states can be created and controlled by the dissipative protocols. Among these, particle number-conserving protocols are particularly appealing due to their ability to stabilize topologically nontrivial phases. Is there any fundamental limitation to their performance? We address this question by examining a general class of models involving a two-band fermion system subjected to dissipation designed to transfer fermions from the upper band to the lower band. By construction, these models have a guaranteed steady state -- a dark state -- with a completely filled lower band and an empty upper band. In the limit of weak dissipation, we derive equations governing the dynamics of the fermion densities over long length and time scales. These equations belong to the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov reaction-diffusion universality class. Our analysis reveals that the engineered dark state is generically unstable, giving way to a new steady state with a finite density of particles in the upper band. Our results suggest that number-conserving dissipative protocols may not be a reliable universal tool for stabilizing dark states.</description>

      <title>When do molecular polaritons behave like optical filters?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This perspective outlines several linear optical effects featured by molecular polaritons arising in the collective strong light-matter coupling regime, focusing on the limit when the number of molecules per photon mode is large. We show that, under these circumstances, molecular absorption within a cavity can be understood as the overlap between the polariton transmission and bare molecular absorption spectra, suggesting that polaritons act in part as optical filters. This framework demystifies and provides a straightforward explanation for a large class of theoretical models of polaritonic phenomena, highlighting that similar effects might be achievable outside a cavity with shaped laser pulses. With a few modifications, this simple conceptual picture can also be adapted to understand the incoherent nonlinear response of polaritonic systems. However, we note that there are experimental observations in the collective regime that exhibit phenomena that go beyond this treatment. Our analysis underscores the importance of the notion that the field still needs to establish a clear distinction between polaritonic phenomena that can be fully explained through classical optics and those that require a more advanced theoretical framework. The linear optics approach presented here is exact when the number of molecules tends to infinity and is quite accurate for a large, but finite, number of molecules. We highlight the limitations of this treatment when the rates of the single-molecule processes that facilitate dark-state-to-polariton relaxation cannot be neglected and in systems under strong coupling with few molecules. Further exploration in these areas is needed to uncover novel polaritonic phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, subdimensional particles including fractons have attracted much attention from various areas. Notable features of such matter phases are mobility constraints and subextensive ground state degeneracies (GSDs). In this paper, we propose a BF-like theory motivated by the Godbillon-Vey invariant, which is a mathematical invariant of the foliated manifold. Our theory hosts subsystem higher form symmetries which manifestly ensure the mobility constraint and subextensive GSD through the spontaneous symmetry breaking. We also discuss some lattice spin models which realize the same low energy behaviours as the BF-like theory. Furthermore, we explore dynamical matter theories which are coupled to the BF-like theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a linear relationship between product of bound energy, a thermodynamic quantity, of a ground state with system size and square of half-chain entanglement entropy has been established for free fermionic chain with nearest neighbor hopping and conjectured to be true for all 1D conformal field theories [Phys. Rev. B, 107,075116(20230]. We probe this relationship in domain where conformal symmetry is broken using 1D Kitaev model with pairing term which decays with distance as a power-law with exponent $\alpha$. We analytically show that for $\alpha=1$, this relationship persists with same slope as found in $\alpha \to \infty$ case where conformal symmetry is unbroken. We recall that conformal symmetry is broken for $\alpha&lt;3/2$ [Phys. Rev. Lett., 113,156402(2014)]. We numerically show that linearity persists for intermediate values of $\alpha$. The presence of long range pairing helps in extracting more energy for the work i.e. ergotropy.

      <title>On estimating the entropy of shallow circuit outputs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2002.12814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating the entropy of probability distributions and quantum states is a fundamental task in information processing. Here, we examine the hardness of this task for the case of probability distributions or quantum states produced by shallow circuits. Specifically, we show that entropy estimation for distributions or states produced by either log-depth circuits or constant-depth circuits with gates of bounded fan-in and unbounded fan-out is at least as hard as the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem, and thus believed to be intractable even for efficient quantum computation. This illustrates that quantum circuits do not need to be complex to render the computation of entropy a difficult task. We also give complexity-theoretic evidence that this problem for log-depth circuits is not as hard as its counterpart with general polynomial-size circuits, seemingly occupying an intermediate hardness regime. Finally, we discuss potential future applications of our work for quantum gravity research by relating our results to the complexity of the bulk-to-boundary dictionary of AdS/CFT.</description>

Abstract: Gopalakrishnan, Islam, and Knap adopted a perturbative approach employing a method to investigate the transport in localized systems coupled to non-Markovian dephasing noise in the deeply localized limit where the single-particle hopping is the smallest energy scale. All their subsequent analytical and numerical calculations are limited to the deeply localized systems. Nevertheless, in the majority of their results, they used this approximation outside this limit which makes their results wrong. We point at these wrong results and propose the changes in the parameter values which can give correct results.</description>

      <title>Cost vector analysis &amp; multi-path entanglement routing in quantum networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.00418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a static framework for analysing quantum routing protocols that we call the \textit{cost-vector formalism}. Here, quantum networks are recast as multi-graphs where edges represent two-qubit entanglement resources that \textit{could} exist under some sequence of operations. Each edge is weighted with a \textit{transmission probability} that represents the likelihood of the pair existing and a \textit{coherence probability} which is the likelihood that the pair is suitable for teleportation. Routing operations such as entanglement swapping and purification are then interpreted as \textit{contractions on the multi-graph} with relatively simple rules for updating the edge-weights. Moreover, we extend our formalism to include routing scenarios over time by developing a compatible resource theory for quantum memories. We develop rudimentary greedy algorithms for routing in this framework and test them over a variety of toy networking scenarios. Our results indicate that congestion in quantum networks does not improve significantly when more nodes (computers) are added. Rather, we find that congestion is all but eliminated by waiting a small amount of time.</description>

      <title>Determination of All Unknown Pure Quantum States with Two Observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.05752v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently extracting information from pure quantum states using minimal observables on the main system is a longstanding and fundamental issue in quantum information theory. Despite the inability of probability distributions of position and momentum to uniquely specify a wavefunction, Peres conjectured a discrete version wherein two complementary observables, analogous to position and momentum and realized as projective measurements onto orthogonal bases, can determine all pure qudits up to a finite set of ambiguities. Subsequent findings revealed the impossibility of uniquely determining $d$-dimenisonal pure states even when neglecting a measure-zero set with any two orthogonal bases, and Peres's conjecture is also correct for $d=3$ but not for $d=4$. In this study, we show that two orthogonal bases are capable of effectively filtering up to $2^{d-1}$ finite candidates by disregarding a measure-zero set, without involving complex numbers in the bases' coefficients. Additionally, drawing inspiration from sequential measurements to directly calculate the target coefficients of the wavefunction using two complementary observables, we show that almost all pure qudits can be uniquely determined by adaptively incorporating a POVM in the middle, followed by measuring the complementary observable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.02878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum networks an important goal is to reduce resource requirements for the transport and communication of quantum information. Quantum network coding presents a way of doing this by distributing entangled states over a network that would ordinarily exhibit contention. In this work, we study measurement-based quantum network coding (MQNC), which is a protocol particularly suitable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. In particular, we develop techniques to adapt MQNC to state-of-the-art superconducting processors and subsequently demonstrate successful teleportation of quantum information, giving new insight into MQNC in this context after a previous study was not able to produce a useful degree of entanglement. The teleportation in our demonstration is shown to occur with fidelity higher than could be achieved via classical means, made possible by considering qubits from a polar cap of the Bloch Sphere. We also present a generalization of MQNC with a simple mapping onto the heavy-hex processor layout and a direct mapping onto a proposed logical error-corrected layout. Our work provides some useful techniques for testing and successfully carrying out quantum network coding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00094v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of quantum technology, the interest in communication tasks assisted by quantum systems has increased both in academia and industry. Nonetheless, the transmission of a quantum state in real-world scenarios is bounded by environmental noise, so that the quantum channel is an open quantum system. In this work, we study a high-dimensional open quantum system in a multicore optical fiber by characterizing the environmental interaction as quantum operations corresponding to probabilistic phase-flips. The experimental platform is currently state-of-the-art for quantum information processing with multicore fibers. At a given evolution stage we observe a non-Markovian behaviour of the system, which is demonstrated through a proof-of-principle implementation of the Quantum Vault protocol. A better understanding of phase-noise in multicore fibers will improve several real-world communication protocols, since they are a prime candidate to be adopted in future telecom networks.</description>

Abstract: The concept of randomized measurements on individual particles has proven to be useful for analyzing quantum systems and is central for methods like shadow tomography of quantum states. We introduce $\textit{collective}$ randomized measurements as a tool in quantum information processing. Our idea is to perform measurements of collective angular momentum on a quantum system and actively rotate the directions using simultaneous multilateral unitaries. Based on the moments of the resulting probability distribution, we propose systematic approaches to characterize quantum entanglement in a collective-reference-frame-independent manner. First, we show that existing spin-squeezing inequalities can be accessible in this scenario. Next, we present an entanglement criterion based on three-body correlations, going beyond spin-squeezing inequalities with two-body correlations. Finally, we apply our method to characterize entanglement between spatially-separated two ensembles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum processors have made significant progress in size and computing potential. As a result, the practical cryogenic limitations of operating large numbers of superconducting qubits are becoming a bottleneck for further scaling. Due to the low thermal conductivity and the dense optical multiplexing capacity of telecommunications fiber, converting qubit signal processing to the optical domain using microwave-to-optics transduction would significantly relax the strain on cryogenic space and thermal budgets. Here, we demonstrate optical readout through an optical fiber of a superconducting transmon qubit connected via a coaxial cable to a fully integrated piezo-optomechanical transducer. Using a demolition readout technique, we achieve a single shot readout fidelity of 81%. Due to the small footprint (&lt;0.15mm$^2$) and the modular fiber-based architecture, this device platform has the potential to scale towards use with thousands of qubits. Our results illustrate the potential of piezo-optomechanical transduction for low-dissipation operation of large quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Approximate Quantum Codes From Long Wormholes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss families of approximate quantum error correcting codes which arise as the nearly-degenerate ground states of certain quantum many-body Hamiltonians composed of non-commuting terms. For exact codes, the conditions for error correction can be formulated in terms of the vanishing of a two-sided mutual information in a low-temperature thermofield double state. We consider a notion of distance for approximate codes obtained by demanding that this mutual information instead be small, and we evaluate this mutual information for the SYK model and for a family of low-rank SYK models. After an extrapolation to nearly zero temperature, we find that both kinds of models produce fermionic codes with constant rate as the number, $N$, of fermions goes to infinity. For SYK, the distance scales as $N^{1/2}$, and for low-rank SYK, the distance can be arbitrarily close to linear scaling, e.g. $N^{.99}$, while maintaining a constant rate. We also consider an analog of the no low-energy trivial states property which we dub the no low-energy adiabatically accessible states property and show that these models do have low-energy states that can be prepared adiabatically in a time that does not scale with system size $N$. We discuss a holographic model of these codes in which the large code distance is a consequence of the emergence of a long wormhole geometry in a simple model of quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: We study the dissipative phase transition in a quantum oscillator with two-photon drive and two-photon dissipation. Using the semi-classical Langevin equation and the Fokker-Plank approach, we construct a theory of non-perturbative quantum fluctuations and go beyond the semi-classical approximation. We demonstrate the mapping of a two-photon quantum dissipative oscillator onto a classical equilibrium model of a nonlinear classical oscillator in a colored-noise environment. Then, we justify the applicability of the Landau theory for a given dissipative phase transition. To do that, we explicitly demonstrate the Boltzmann-like form of stationary distribution function depending on the effective temperature, which is determined by the frequency detuning and the rates of two-photon drive and dissipation. In addition, we provide a description of the quantum critical region and obtain critical exponents that appear to be in very good agreement with numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: Quantum embedding is a fundamental prerequisite for applying quantum machine learning techniques to classical data, and has substantial impacts on performance outcomes. In this study, we present Neural Quantum Embedding (NQE), a method that efficiently optimizes quantum embedding beyond the limitations of positive and trace-preserving maps by leveraging classical deep learning techniques. NQE enhances the lower bound of the empirical risk, leading to substantial improvements in classification performance. Moreover, NQE improves robustness against noise. To validate the effectiveness of NQE, we conduct experiments on IBM quantum devices for image data classification, resulting in a remarkable accuracy enhancement from 0.52 to 0.96. In addition, numerical analyses highlight that NQE simultaneously improves the trainability and generalization performance of quantum neural networks, as well as of the quantum kernel method.</description>

Abstract: This work provides a nonasymptotic error analysis of quantum Krylov algorithms based on real-time evolutions, subject to generic errors in the outputs of the quantum circuits. We prove upper and lower bounds on the resulting ground state energy estimates, and the error in the upper bound is linear in the input error rates. This resolves a misalignment between known numerics, which exhibit approximately linear error scaling, and prior theoretical analysis, which only provably obtained square-root scaling. Our main technique is to express generic errors in terms of an effective target Hamiltonian studied in an effective Krylov space. These results provide a theoretical framework for understanding the main features of quantum Krylov errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Destructive interference-based photon-phonon antibunching can lead to violations of classical inequalities in optomechanical cavity systems. In this paper, we explore the violation of the classical Cauchy-Schwarz inequality by examining second-order auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions, as well as Bell's nonlocality, to analyze the quantum correlations of single photon-phonon excitations when the system is driven by two weak probe fields. We propose that the violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality can serve as an indicator for the stronger nonclassical tests associated with Bell's theorem. Our system reveals strong quantum correlations of photon-phonon pairs with distinctive antidiagonal patterns of photon filtering. For numerical analysis, we consider a weak effective optomechanical coupling strength and various optical-to-mechanical field amplitude ratios that enable unconventional photon (phonon) blockades at resonance. The findings are significant for producing sub-Poissonian signals under optimal conditions and have potential applications in hybrid systems for generating on-demand single photon-phonon pairs.</description>

Abstract: Simulating quantum dynamics is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. While the upper bound of the simulation cost has been extensively studied through various quantum algorithms, much less work has focused on establishing the lower bound, particularly for the simulation of open quantum system dynamics. In this work, we present a general framework to calculate the lower bound for simulating a broad class of quantum Markov semigroups. Given a fixed accessible unitary set, we introduce the concept of convexified circuit depth to quantify the quantum simulation cost and analyze the necessary circuit depth to construct a quantum simulation scheme that achieves a specific order. Our framework can be applied to both unital and non-unital quantum dynamics, and the tightness of our lower bound technique is illustrated by showing that the upper and lower bounds coincide in several examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a noise-aware distributed Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) tailored for execution on near-term quantum hardware. Leveraging a distributed framework, we address the limitations of current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, which are hindered by limited qubit counts and high error rates. Our approach decomposes large QAOA problems into smaller subproblems, distributing them across multiple Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) to enhance scalability and performance. The noise-aware strategy incorporates error mitigation techniques to optimize qubit fidelity and gate operations, ensuring reliable quantum computations. We evaluate the efficacy of our framework using the HamilToniQ Benchmarking Toolkit, which quantifies the performance across various quantum hardware configurations. The results demonstrate that our distributed QAOA framework achieves significant improvements in computational speed and accuracy, showcasing its potential to solve complex optimization problems efficiently in the NISQ era. This work sets the stage for advanced algorithmic strategies and practical quantum system enhancements, contributing to the broader goal of achieving quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Parameterized Quantum Circuits: on The Connection Between Expressibility and Types of Quantum Gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expressibility is a crucial factor of a Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC). In the context of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) based Quantum Machine Learning (QML), a QML model composed of highly expressible PQC and sufficient number of qubits is theoretically capable of approximating any arbitrary continuous function. While much research has explored the relationship between expressibility and learning performance, as well as the number of layers in PQCs, the connection between expressibility and PQC structure has received comparatively less attention. In this paper, we analyze the connection between expressibility and the types of quantum gates within PQCs using a Gradient Boosting Tree model and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. Our analysis is performed on 1,615 instances of PQC derived from 19 PQC topologies, each with 2-18 qubits and 1-5 layers. The findings of our analysis provide guidance for designing highly expressible PQCs, suggesting the integration of more RX or RY gates while maintaining a careful balance with the number of CNOT gates. Furthermore, our evaluation offers an additional evidence of expressibility saturation, as observed by previous studies.</description>

Abstract: The entangled photons are crucial resources for quantum communications and networking. Here, we present an ultra-bright polarization-entangled photon source based on a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide designed for practical quantum communication networks. Using a 780 nm pump laser, the source achieves a pair generation rate of 2.4 $\times 10^{10}$ pairs/s/mW. This work has achieved a directly measured power of 17.9 nW in entangled photon generation with a 3.2 mW pump power. Based on this, we demonstrate the practicality of the source by conducting quantum key distribution experiments over long-distance fiber links, achieving the applicable secure key rates of up to 440.80 bits/s over 200 km with 62 dB loss and reaching a maximum secure key generation distance of 404 km. These results demonstrate the potential of wavelength-multiplexed polarization-entangled photon sources for high-speed, long-distance quantum communication, positioning them as key components for future large-scale quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Bound states in the continuum induced via local symmetries in complex structures</title>

Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) defy conventional wisdom that assumes a spectral separation between propagating waves, that carry energy away, and spatially localized waves corresponding to discrete frequencies. They can be described as resonance states with infinite lifetime, i.e., leaky modes with zero leakage. The advent of metamaterials and nanophotonics allowed the creation of BICs in a variety of systems. Mainly, BICs have been realized by destructive interference between outgoing resonant modes or exploiting engineered global symmetries that enforce the decoupling of a symmetry-incompatible bound mode from the surrounding radiation modes. Here, we introduce theoretically BICs relying on a different mechanism, namely local symmetries that enforce a field concentration on a part of a complex system without implying any global symmetry. We experimentally implement such BICs using microwaves in a compact one-dimensional photonic network and show that they emerge from the annihilation of two topological singularities, a zero and a pole, of the measured scattering matrix. Our alternative for achieving BICs in complex wave systems may be useful for applications like sensing, lasing, and enhancement of nonlinear interactions that require high-$Q$ modes.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Properties of Gauge Theories from Higher-Form Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16235</link>

Abstract: We explore the relationship between higher-form symmetries and entanglement properties in discrete lattice gauge theories, which can exhibit both topologically ordered phases and higher-form symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. Our study centers on generalizing the Fradkin-Shenker model, where the Gauss law constraint can be either emergent or exact. The phase diagram includes a topologically ordered phase and a non-trivial SPT phase protected by a 1-form and a 0-form symmetry. We obtain the following key findings: First, the entanglement properties depend on whether the 1-form symmetries and the Gauss law are exact or emergent. For the emergent Gauss law, the entanglement spectrum (ES) of the non-trivial SPT phase exhibits degeneracies, which are robust at low energies against weak perturbations that explicitly break the exact 1-form symmetry. When the Gauss law and the 1-form symmetry are both exact, the ES degeneracy is extensive. This extensive degeneracy is fragile and can be removed completely by infinitesimal perturbations that explicitly break the exact 1-form symmetry while keeping the Gauss law exact. Second, we consider the ES in the topologically ordered phase where 1-form symmetries are spontaneously broken. In contrast to the ES of the non-trivial SPT phase, we find that spontaneous higher-form symmetry breaking removes "half" of the ES levels, leading to a non-degenerate ES in the topologically ordered phase in general. Third, we derive a connection between spontaneous higher-form symmetry breaking and the topological entanglement entropy (TEE). Using this relation, we investigate the entanglement entropy that can be distilled in the deconfined phase of the original Fradkin-Shenker model using gauge-invariant measurements. We show that the TEE is robust against the measurement when the 1-form symmetry is emergent but fragile when the 1-form symmetry is exact.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement and Bell inequality violation at colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of entanglement in particle physics has been gathering pace in the past few years. It is a new field that is providing important results about the possibility of detecting entanglement and testing Bell inequality at colliders for final states as diverse as top-quark, $\tau$-lepton pairs and $\Lambda$-baryons, massive gauge bosons and vector mesons. In this review, after presenting definitions, tools and basic results that are necessary for understanding these developments, we summarize the main findings -- as published by the beginning of year 2024 -- including analyses of experimental data in $B$ meson decays and top-quark pair production. We include a detailed discussion of the results for both qubit and qutrits systems, that is, final states containing spin one-half and spin one particles. Entanglement has also been proposed as a new tool to constrain new particles and fields beyond the Standard Model and we introduce the reader to this promising feature as well.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio variational wave functions for the time-dependent many-electron Schr\"odinger equation</title>

Abstract: Describing the real-time evolution of many-electron quantum systems is crucial for understanding the dynamical properties of condensed matter, molecular systems in quantum chemistry, and the behaviors of complex materials. However, the real-time evolution of non-equilibrium quantum electronic systems poses a significant challenge for theoretical and computational approaches. This work introduces a variational approach for fermionic time-dependent wave functions, surpassing mean-field approximations by capturing many-body correlations. Our methodology introduces a parameterization of the time-evolving quantum state, enabling an accurate approximation of its evolution. To account for electron correlations, we employ time-dependent Jastrow factors and backflow transformations, which can be further enhanced by incorporating neural networks for function parameterization. We utilize the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo technique to efficiently compute optimal time-dependent parameters. Additionally, we introduce a new time-evolution method based on Trotter-root expansions of the propagator, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of our simulations. The approach is demonstrated in three distinct systems: the solvable harmonic interaction model, the dynamics of a diatomic molecule in intense laser fields, and a quenched quantum dot. In all cases, we show clear signatures of many-body correlations in the dynamics that are not captured by mean-field methods. The results showcase the ability of our variational approach to accurately capture the time evolution of quantum states, providing insight into the quantum dynamics of interacting electronic systems, beyond the capabilities of mean-field.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Relativistic Vortex Electrons in External Laser Fields</title>

Abstract: Investigating vortex electron interactions with electromagnetic fields is essential for advancing particle acceleration techniques, scattering theory in background fields, and obtaining novel electron beams for material diagnostics. A systematic investigation into the dynamics of vortex electrons in external laser fields and the exploration of laser-induced vortex modes remains lacking. In this work, we study the propagation of vortex electrons in linearly polarized (LP) and circularly polarized (CP) laser pulses, both separately and in their combined form in two-mode laser pulses. The theoretical formalism is developed by utilizing Volkov-Bessel wave functions, and the four-current density is obtained as a crucial observable quantity. Numerical results illustrate the dynamics of vortex electrons in external lasers, showing that the beam center of the vortex electron follows the classical motion of a point charge electron, while maintaining the probability distribution structure for both vortex eigenstates and superposition modes. The combined effect of LP and CP laser pulses in the two-mode laser field allows for the versatile control of vortex electrons, which is absent with LP or CP lasers alone, at femtosecond and sub-nanometer scales. Our findings demonstrate the versatile control over vortex electrons via laser pulses, with our formalism providing a reference for vortex scattering in laser backgrounds and inspiring the laser-controlled achievement of novel vortex modes as targeted diagnostic probes for specialized materials.</description>
