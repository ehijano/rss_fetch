      <title>On the Incompressibility of Truth With Application to Circuit Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the fundamentals of Circuit Complexity and the nature of efficient computation from a new perspective. We present a framework for understanding Circuit Complexity through the lens of Information Theory with analogies to results in Kolmogorov Complexity, viewing circuits as descriptions of truth tables, encoded in logical gates and wires, rather than purely computational devices. From this framework, we re-prove some existing strong Circuit Complexity bounds, explain what the optimal circuits for most Boolean functions look like structurally, give insight into new circuit bounds, and explain the aforementioned results in a unifying intuition that re-frames time entirely.</description>

      <title>Mis\`ere Partizan Arc Kayles is PSPACE-complete, even on Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Mis\`ere Partizan Arc Kayles is PSPACE-complete on planar graphs via a reduction from Bounded Two-Player Constraint Logic. Furthermore, we show how to embed our gadgets onto the square and triangular grids. In order to clearly explain these results, we get into the details of Bounded Two-Player Constraint Logic and find three PSPACE-complete variants of that as well.</description>

      <title>Interactive Proofs For Distribution Testing With Conditional Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the framework of interactive proofs for distribution testing, first introduced by Chiesa and Gur (ITCS 2018), which has recently experienced a surge in interest, accompanied by notable progress (e.g., Herman and Rothblum, STOC 2022, FOCS 2023; Herman, RANDOM~2024). In this model, a data-poor verifier determines whether a probability distribution has a property of interest by interacting with an all-powerful, data-rich but untrusted prover bent on convincing them that it has the property. While prior work gave sample-, time-, and communication-efficient protocols for testing and estimating a range of distribution properties, they all suffer from an inherent issue: for most interesting properties of distributions over a domain of size $N$, the verifier must draw at least $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ samples of its own. While sublinear in $N$, this is still prohibitive for large domains encountered in practice.
  In this work, we circumvent this limitation by augmenting the verifier with the ability to perform an exponentially smaller number of more powerful (but reasonable) \emph{pairwise conditional} queries, effectively enabling them to perform ``local comparison checks'' of the prover's claims. We systematically investigate the landscape of interactive proofs in this new setting, giving polylogarithmic query and sample protocols for (tolerantly) testing all \emph{label-invariant} properties, thus demonstrating exponential savings without compromising on communication, for this large and fundamental class of testing tasks.</description>

      <title>Complexity Aspects of Homomorphisms of Ordered Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine ordered graphs, defined as graphs with linearly ordered vertices, from the perspective of homomorphisms (and colorings) and their complexities. We demonstrate the corresponding computational and parameterized complexities, along with algorithms associated with related problems. These questions are interesting, and we show that numerous problems lead to various complexities. The reduction from homomorphisms of unordered structures to homomorphisms of ordered graphs is proved, achieved with the use of ordered bipartite graphs. We then determine the NP-completeness of the problem of finding ordered homomorphisms of ordered graphs and the XP and W[1]-hard nature of this problem parameterized by the number of vertices of the image ordered graph. Classes of ordered graphs for which this problem can be solved in polynomial time are also presented.</description>

      <title>On Computational Aspects of Ordered Matching Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordered matchings, defined as graphs with linearly ordered vertices, where each vertex is connected to exactly one edge, play a crucial role in the area of ordered graphs and their homomorphisms. Therefore, we consider related problems from the complexity point of view and determine their corresponding computational and parameterized complexities. We show that the subgraph of ordered matchings problem is NP-complete and we prove that the problem of finding ordered homomorphisms between ordered matchings is NP-complete as well, implying NP-completeness of more generic problems. In parameterized complexity setting, we consider a natural choice of parameter - a number of vertices of the image ordered graph. We show that in contrast to the complexity context, finding homomorphisms if the image ordered graph is an ordered matching, this problem parameterized by the number of vertices of the image ordered graph is FPT, which is known to be W[1]-hard for the general problem. We also determine that the problem of core for ordered matchings is solvable in polynomial time which is again in contrast to the NP-completeness of the general problem. We provide several algorithms and generalize some of these problems into ordered graphs with colored edges.</description>

      <title>On Computational Aspects of Cores of Ordered Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ordered graph is a graph enhanced with a linear order on the vertex set. An ordered graph is a core if it does not have an order-preserving homomorphism to a proper subgraph. We say that $H$ is the core of $G$ if (i) $H$ is a core, (ii) $H$ is a subgraph of $G$, and (iii) $G$ admits an order-preserving homomorphism to $H$. We study complexity aspects of several problems related to the cores of ordered graphs. Interestingly, they exhibit a different behavior than their unordered counterparts. We show that the retraction problem, i.e., deciding whether a given graph admits an ordered-preserving homomorphism to its specific subgraph, can be solved in polynomial time. On the other hand, it is \NP-hard to decide whether a given ordered graph is a core. In fact, we show that it is even \NP-hard to distinguish graphs $G$ whose core is largest possible (i.e., if $G$ is a core) from those, whose core is the smallest possible, i.e., its size is equal to the ordered chromatic number of $G$. The problem is even \wone-hard with respect to the latter parameter.</description>

      <title>Privacy-preserving formal concept analysis: A homomorphic encryption-based concept construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is extensively used in knowledge extraction, cognitive concept learning, and data mining. However, its computational demands on large-scale datasets often require outsourcing to external computing services, raising concerns about the leakage of sensitive information. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach to enhance data security and privacy in FCA-based computations. Specifically, we introduce a Privacy-preserving Formal Context Analysis (PFCA) framework that combines binary data representation with homomorphic encryption techniques. This method enables secure and efficient concept construction without revealing private data. Experimental results and security analysis confirm the effectiveness of our approach in preserving privacy while maintaining computational performance. These findings have important implications for privacy-preserving data mining and secure knowledge discovery in large-scale FCA applications.</description>

      <title>Solving Four Open Problems about Core Stability in Altruistic Hedonic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hedonic games -- at the interface of cooperative game theory and computational social choice -- are coalition formation games in which the players have preferences over the coalitions they can join. Kerkmann et al. [13] introduced altruistic hedonic games where the players' utilities depend not only on their own but also on their friends' valuations of coalitions. The complexity of the verification problem for core stability has remained open in four variants of altruistic hedonic games: namely, for the variants with average- and minimum-based "equal-treatment" and "altruistic-treatment" preferences. We solve these four open questions by proving the corresponding problems coNP-complete; our reductions rely on rather intricate gadgets in the related networks of friends.</description>

      <title>Skating System Unveiled: Exploring Preference Aggregation in Ballroom Tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Skating System, which originated from the scrutineering system in dance sport tournaments, can be formulated as a voting system: We introduce and formalize the Skating System Single (SkS, for short), a new voting system embedded into the framework of computational social choice. Although SkS has similarities with Bucklin voting, it differs from it because it is subject to additional constraints when determining the election winners. Through an analysis of the axiomatic properties of SkS and of its vulnerability to manipulative and electoral control attacks, we compare SkS with Bucklin voting and provide insights into its potential strengths and weaknesses. In particular, we show that SkS satisfies nondictatorship as well as the majority criterion, positive responsiveness, monotonicity, and citizens' sovereignty but violates the Condorcet criterion, strong monotonicity, independence of clones, consistency, participation, resoluteness, and strategy-proofness. Further, we study manipulation, i.e., where (groups of) voters vote strategically to improve the outcome of an election in their favor, showing that the constructive coalitional weighted manipulation problem for SkS is NP-complete, while the destructive variant can be solved in polynomial time. Lastly, we initiate the study of electoral control, where an external agent attempts to change the election outcome by interfering with the structure of the election. Here, we show NP-completeness for constructive and destructive control by deleting candidates as well as for constructive control by adding voters, whereas we show that the problem of destructive control by adding voters can be solved in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Graphical Tests of Causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bell inequalities limit the possible observations of non-communicating parties. Here, we present analogous inequalities for any number of communicating parties under the causal constraints of static causal order, definite causal order, and bi-causal order. All derived inequalities are remarkably simple. They correspond to upper bounds on the winning chance in graphical games: Given a specific directed graph over the parties, the parties are challenged to communicate along a randomly chosen arc. In the case of definite causal order, every game that we find is specified by a kefalopoda digraph. Based on this we define weakly causal correlations as those that satisfy all kefalopoda inequalities. We show that the problem of deciding whether some correlations are weakly causal is solvable in polynomial time in the number of parties.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Obstructions and the Collapse of Elementary Structure in the Kronecker Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Kronecker coefficients $g(\lambda,\mu,\nu)$ with bounded rows are polynomial-time computable via lattice-point methods, no explicit closed-form formulas have been obtained for genuinely three-row cases in the 87 years since Murnaghan's foundational work. This paper provides such formulas for the first time and identifies a universal structural boundary at parameter value 5 where elementary combinatorial patterns collapse.
  We analyze two independent families of genuinely three-row coefficients and establish that for $k \leq 4$, the formulas exhibit elementary structure: oscillation bounds follow the triangular-Hogben pattern, and polynomial expressions factor completely over $\mathbb{Z}$. At the critical threshold $k=5$, this structure collapses: the triangular pattern fails, and algebraic obstructions -- irreducible quadratic factors with negative discriminant -- emerge.
  We develop integer forcing, a proof technique exploiting the tension between continuous asymptotics and discrete integrality. As concrete results, we prove that $g((n,n,1)^3) = 2 - (n \mod 2)$ for all $n \geq 3$ -- the first explicit formula for a genuinely three-row Kronecker coefficient -- derive five explicit polynomial formulas for staircase-hook coefficients, and verify Saxl's conjecture for 132 three-row partitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of quantum polymorphisms to the complexity theory of non-local games. We use this notion to give a full characterisation of the existence of commutativity gadgets for relational structures, introduced by Ji as a method for achieving quantum soundness of classical CSP reductions. Prior to our work, a classification was only known in the Boolean case [Culf--Mastel, STOC'25]. As an application of our framework, we prove that the entangled CSP parameterised by odd cycles is undecidable. Furthermore, we establish a quantum version of Galois connection for entangled CSPs in the case of non-oracular quantum homomorphisms.</description>

Abstract: We study Frege proofs for the one-to-one graph Pigeon Hole Principle defined on the $n\times n$ grid where $n$ is odd. We are interested in the case where each formula in the proof is a depth $d$ formula in the basis given by $\land$, $\lor$, and $\neg$. We prove that in this situation the proof needs to be of size exponential in $n^{\Omega (1/d)}$. If we restrict the size of each line in the proof to be of size $M$ then the number of lines needed is exponential in $n/(\log M)^{O(d)}$. The main technical component of the proofs is to design a new family of random restrictions and to prove the appropriate switching lemmas.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Algebraic Circuits and Homomorphism Polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06740v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The central open question of algebraic complexity is whether VP is unequal to VNP, which is saying that the permanent cannot be represented by families of polynomial-size algebraic circuits. For symmetric algebraic circuits, this has been confirmed by Dawar and Wilsenach (2020) who showed exponential lower bounds on the size of symmetric circuits for the permanent. In this work, we set out to develop a more general symmetric algebraic complexity theory. Our main result is that a family of symmetric polynomials admits small symmetric circuits if and only if they can be written as a linear combination of homomorphism counting polynomials of graphs of bounded treewidth. We also establish a relationship between the symmetric complexity of subgraph counting polynomials and the vertex cover number of the pattern graph. As a concrete example, we examine the symmetric complexity of immanant families (a generalisation of the determinant and permanent) and show that a known conditional dichotomy due to Curticapean (2021) holds unconditionally in the symmetric setting.</description>

      <title>Anti-Concentration for the Unitary Haar Measure and Applications to Random Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a Carbery-Wright style anti-concentration inequality for the unitary Haar measure, by showing that the probability of a polynomial in the entries of a random unitary falling into an $\varepsilon$ range is at most a polynomial in $\varepsilon$. Using it, we show that the scrambling speed of a random quantum circuit is lower bounded: Namely, every input qubit has an influence that is at least inverse exponential in depth, on any output qubit touched by its lightcone. Our result on scrambling speed works with high probability over the choice of a circuit from an ensemble, as opposed to just working in expectation.
  As an application, we give the first polynomial-time algorithm for learning log-depth random quantum circuits with Haar random gates up to polynomially small diamond distance, given oracle access to the circuit. Other applications of this new scrambling speed lower bound include:
  $\bullet$ An optimal $\Omega(\log \varepsilon^{-1})$ depth lower bound for $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary designs on any circuit architecture;
  $\bullet$ A polynomial-time quantum algorithm that computes the depth of a bounded-depth circuit, given oracle access to the circuit.
  Our learning and depth-testing algorithms apply to architectures defined over any geometric dimension, and can be generalized to a wide class of architectures with good lightcone properties.</description>

      <title>Minimum Selective Subset on Unit Disk Graphs and Circle Graphs</title>

Abstract: In a connected simple graph G = (V(G),E(G)), each vertex is assigned one of c colors, where V(G) can be written as a union of a total of c subsets V_{1},...,V_{c} and V_{i} denotes the set of vertices of color i. A subset S of V(G) is called a selective subset if, for every i, every vertex v in V_{i} has at least one nearest neighbor in $S \cup (V(G) \setminus V_{i})$ that also lies in V_{i}. The Minimum Selective Subset (MSS) problem asks for a selective subset of minimum size.
  We show that the MSS problem is log-APX-hard on general graphs, even when c=2. As a consequence, the problem does not admit a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) unless P = NP. On the positive side, we present a PTAS for unit disk graphs, which works without requiring a geometric representation and applies for arbitrary c. We further prove that MSS remains NP-complete in unit disk graphs for arbitrary c. In addition, we show that the MSS problem is log-APX-hard on circle graphs, even when c=2.</description>
