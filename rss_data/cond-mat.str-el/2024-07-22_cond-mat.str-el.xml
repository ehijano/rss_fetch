      <title>Correlated Topological Mixed-Valence Insulators in Moir\'e Hetero-Bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials provide an ideal playground for studying the combined interplay of strong interactions and band-topology over a range of electronic fillings. Here we investigate the panoply of interaction-induced electronic phases that arise at a total commensurate filling of $\nu_T=2$ in moir\'e TMD heterobilayers, focusing specifically on their renormalized band-topology. We carry out a comprehensive self-consistent parton mean-field analysis on an interacting mixed-valence Hamiltonian describing AB-stacked MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ to highlight different ingredients that arise due to "Mottness", band-flattening, an enhanced excitonic tendency, and band-inversion, leading to correlated topological semi-metals and insulators. We also propose a possible route towards realizing fractionalized insulators with emergent neutral fermionic excitations in this and other closely related platforms.</description>

      <title>DanceQ: High-performance library for number conserving bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of quantum many-body problems scales exponentially with the size of the system, rendering any finite size scaling analysis a formidable challenge. This is particularly true for methods based on the full representation of the wave function, where one simply accepts the enormous Hilbert space dimensions and performs linear algebra operations, e.g., for finding the ground state of the Hamiltonian. If the system satisfies an underlying symmetry where an operator with degenerate spectrum commutes with the Hamiltonian, it can be block-diagonalized, thus reducing the complexity at the expense of additional bookkeeping. At the most basic level, required for Krylov space techniques (like the Lanczos algorithm) it is necessary to implement a matrix-vector product of a block of the Hamiltonian with arbitrary block-wavefunctions, potentially without holding the Hamiltonian block in memory. An efficient implementation of this operation requires the calculation of the position of an arbitrary basis vector in the canonical ordering of the basis of the block. We present here an elegant and powerful, multi-dimensional approach to this problem for the $U(1)$ symmetry appearing in problems with particle number conservation. Our divide-and-conquer algorithm uses multiple subsystems and hence generalizes previous approaches to make them scalable. In addition to the theoretical presentation of our algorithm, we provide DanceQ, a flexible and modern - header only - C++20 implementation to manipulate, enumerate, and map to its index any basis state in a given particle number sector as open source software under https://DanceQ.gitlab.io/danceq.</description>

      <title>NMR Evidence of Kitaev Fractional Excitations and the perspective of Quantum Glassiness in Na2Co2TeO6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The suppression of magnetic order and the detection of a half-quantized thermal Hall effect in {\alpha}-RuCl3 under the influence of an external magnetic field have sparked significant debate, whether these phenomena point to spin fractionalization, as posited by the Kitaev quantum spin liquid model, or if they arise from more conventional mechanisms in an antiferromagnetically ordered spin state. Here, through 23Na NMR measurements on the layered oxide Na2Co2TeO6 at two distinct magnetic fields (4.7 and 9.4 Tesla), we provide compelling evidence that upon cooling, Kitaev fractional excitations dominate NMR relaxation. This remains true even at 4.7 Tesla, where NMR experiments reveal the onset of an antiferromagnetic phase at TN ~ 25 K. Notably, below 10 K, the NMR relaxation times bifurcate into two components: one retaining the characteristic Kitaev spin liquid features and the other showcasing ultraslow fluctuations adhering to an Arrhenius activation law, indicative of glassy characteristics. These findings suggest that Na2Co2TeO6, and eventually other real-world Kitaev materials, may behave as quantum glass formers rather than homogeneous quantum spin liquids when cooled.</description>

      <title>Electronically Amplified Electron-Phonon Interaction and Metal-Insulator Transition in Perovskite Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relative role of electron-electron and electron-lattice interactions in driving the metal-insulator transition in perovskite nickelates opens a rare window into the non-trivial interplay of the two important degrees of freedom in solids. The most promising solution is to extract the electronic and lattice contributions during the phase transition by performing high-resolution spectroscopy measurements. Here, we present a three-dimensional electronic structure study of Nd1-xSrxNiO3 (x = 0 and 0.175) thin films with unprecedented accuracy, in which the low energy fermiology has a quantitative agreement with model simulations and first-principles calculations. Two characteristic phonons, the octahedral rotational and breathing modes, are illustrated to be coupled with the electron dynamics in the metallic phase, showing a kink structure along the band dispersion, as well as a hump feature in the energy spectrum. Entering the insulating state, the electron-phonon interaction is amplified by strong electron correlations, transforming the mobile large polarons at high temperatures to localized small polarons in the ground state. Moreover, the analysis of quasiparticle residue enables us to establish a transport-spectroscopy correspondence in Nd1-xSrxNiO3 thin films. Our findings demonstrate the essential role of electron-lattice interaction enhanced by the electronic correlation to stabilize the insulating phase in the perovskite nickelates.</description>

      <title>First Order Preemptive Ising-nematic Transition in K$_{5}$Fe$_{4}$Ag$_{6}$Te$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing inelastic X-ray scattering and neutron scattering techniques, we observed nematic and magnetic phase transitions with distinct characters in K$_{5}$Fe$_{4}$Ag$_{6}$Te$_{10}$. Upon cooling, the nematic order undergoes a strongly first-order phase transition followed by a second-order magnetic transition at $T_{\textrm{N}}$ $\approx$ 34.6 K. The temperature difference between these two phase transitions is $\sim$ 1 K. The observed phenomenon can be attributed to a distinctive first-order preemptive Ising-nematic transition, a characteristic unique to a quasi-two-dimensional scenario marked by strong out-of-plane spatial anisotropy due to weak coupling. Our studies establish K$_{5}$Fe$_{4}$Ag$_{6}$Te$_{10}$ as the first material in the family of iron pnictides and chalcogenides that possesses a nematic tricritical point preceding the magnetic one upon decreasing nematic coupling.</description>

      <title>Non-local quench spectroscopy of fermionic excitations in 1D quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elementary excitations of quantum spin systems have generally the nature of weakly interacting bosonic quasi-particles, generated by local operators acting on the ground state. Nonetheless in one spatial dimension the nature of the quasiparticles can change radically, since many relevant one-dimensional $S=1/2$ Hamiltonians can be exactly mapped onto models of spinless fermions with local hopping and interactions. Due to the non-local nature of the spin-to-fermion mapping, observing directly the fermionic quasiparticle excitations is impossible using local probes, which are at the basis of all the forms of spectroscopy (such as neutron scattering) traditionally available in condensed matter physics. Here we show theoretically that \emph{quench spectroscopy} for synthetic quantum matter -- which probes the excitation spectrum of a system by monitoring the nonequilibrium dynamics of its correlation functions -- can reconstruct accurately the dispersion relation of fermionic quasiparticles in spin chains. This possibility relies on the ability of quantum simulation experiments to measure non-local spin-spin correlation functions, corresponding to elementary fermionic correlation functions. Our analysis is based on new exact results for the quench dynamics of quantum spin chains; and it opens the path to probe arbitrary quasiparticle excitations in synthetic quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Exotic Nd 4f electron magnetism in Nd2RhSi3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compound, Nd2PdSi3, belonging to R2PdSi3 family (R = rare-earths) has been known to exhibit exotic behavior due to unusual Nd 4f hybridization. Here, we study the electronic properties of Nd2RhSi3 employing ac and dc magnetization, heat-capacity, electrical resistivity and magnetoresistance measurements, as Nd 4f hybridization is expected to be slightly different due to the changes in the 4d element. The experimental results establish that, like the Pd analogue, this compound also exhibits ferromagnetic ordering at a rather high temperature of 16.5 K, unlike many other rare-earth members of this family which are antiferromagnetic, with a complex magnetism at further lower temperatures (less than 10 K). There are differences in the measured properties with respect to the Pd analogue, the most important one being the observation of spin-glass features at a temperature significantly higher than the Curie temperature. This is attributed to a gradual evolution of cluster magnetism with decreasing temperature. We infer that the changes in Nd 4f hybridization due to Rh 4d (instead of Pd 4d) plays a role in some fashion for such differences. These properties are attributed to the competing magnetic ground states due to geometrical frustration arising out of triangular arrangement of Nd ions with a bond disorder.</description>

      <title>Low-energy inter-band Kondo bound states in orbital-selective Mott phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-energy excitations may manifest intricate behaviors of correlated electron systems and provide essential insights into the dynamics of quantum states and phase transitions. We study a two-orbital Hubbard model featuring the so-called holon-doublon low-energy excitations in the Mott insulating narrow band in the orbital-selective Mott phase (OSMP). We employ an improved dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) technique to calculate the spectral functions at zero temperature. We show that the holon-doublon bound state is not the sole component of the low-energy excitations. Instead, it should be a bound state composed of a Kondo-like state in the wide band and a doublon in the narrow band, named inter-band Kondo-like (IBK) bound states. Notably, as the bandwidths of the two bands approach each other, we find anomalous IBK bound-state excitations in the metallic {\em wide} band.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in quenched extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with anomalous dynamical quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on topological models unveils fascinating physics, especially in the realm of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs). However, the understanding of entanglement structures and properties near DQPT in models with longer-range hoppings is far from complete. In this work, we study DQPTs in the quenched extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Anomalous DQPTs, where the number of critical momenta exceeds the winding number differences between the pre-quench and post-quench phases, are observed. We find that the entanglement exhibits local maximum (minimum) around the anomalous DQPTs, in line with the level crossings (separations) around the middle of the correlation matrix spectrum. We further categorize the phases in the equilibrium model into two classes and distinctive features in the time evolution of the entanglement involving quenches within and across the two classes are identified. The findings pave the way to a better understanding of topological models with longer-range hoppings in the out-of-equilibrium regime.</description>

      <title>Beyond Boundaries: efficient Projected Entangled Pair States methods for periodic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) are recognized as a potent tool for exploring two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. However, a significant challenge emerges when applying conventional PEPS methodologies to systems with periodic boundary conditions (PBC), attributed to the prohibitive computational scaling with the bond dimension. This has notably restricted the study of systems with complex boundary conditions. To address this challenge, we have developed a strategy that involves the superposition of PEPS with open boundary conditions (OBC) to treat systems with PBC. This approach significantly reduces the computational complexity of such systems while maintaining their translational invariance and the PBC. We benchmark this method against the Heisenberg model and the $J_1$-$J_2$ model, demonstrating its capability to yield highly accurate results at low computational costs, even for large system sizes. The techniques are adaptable to other boundary conditions, including cylindrical and twisted boundary conditions, and therefore significantly expands the application scope of the PEPS approach, shining new light on numerous applications.</description>

      <title>Time evolution of the local density of states of strongly correlated fermions coupled to a nanoprobe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of a one-dimensional system of strongly correlated electrons (a 'sample') that is suddenly coupled to a smaller, initially empty system (a 'nanoprobe'), which can subsequently move along the system. Our purpose here is to study the role of interactions in this model system when it is far from equilibrium. We therefore take both the sample and the nanoprobe to be described by a Hubbard model with on-site repulsive interactions and nearest-neighbor hopping. We compute the behavior of the local particle density and the local density of states (LDOS) as a function of time using time-dependent matrix product states at quarter and at half filling, fillings at which the chain realizes a Luttinger liquid or a Mott insulator, respectively. This allows us to study in detail the oscillation of the particles between the sample and the nanoprobe. While, for noninteracting systems, the LDOS is time-independent, in the presence of interactions, the backflow of electrons to the sample will lead to nontrivial dynamics in the LDOS. In particular, studying the time-dependent LDOS allows us to study how the Mott gap closes locally and how this melting of the Mott insulator propagates through the system in time after such a local perturbation -- a behavior that we envisage can be investigated in future experiments on ultrashort time scales or on optical lattices using microscopy setups.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic magnetic interactions in a candidate Kitaev spin liquid close to a metal-insulator transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Kitaev honeycomb model, spins coupled by strongly-frustrated anisotropic interactions do not order at low temperature but instead form a quantum spin liquid with spin fractionalization into Majorana fermions and static fluxes. The realization of such a model in crystalline materials could lead to major breakthroughs in understanding entangled quantum states, however achieving this in practice is a very challenging task. The recently synthesized honeycomb material RuI$_3$ shows no long-range magnetic order down to the lowest probed temperatures and has been theoretically proposed as a quantum spin liquid candidate material on the verge of an insulator to metal transition. Here we report a comprehensive study of the magnetic anisotropy in un-twinned single crystals via torque magnetometry and detect clear signatures of strongly anisotropic and frustrated magnetic interactions. We attribute the development of sawtooth and six-fold torque signal to strongly anisotropic, bond-dependent magnetic interactions by comparing to theoretical calculations. As a function of magnetic field strength at low temperatures, torque shows an unusual non-parabolic dependence suggestive of a proximity to a field-induced transition. Thus, RuI$_3$, without signatures of long-range magnetic order, displays key hallmarks of an exciting new candidate for extended Kitaev magnetism with enhanced quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of the zigzag order in the Kitaev honeycomb magnet $\alpha$-RuBr$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kitaev materials often order magnetically at low temperatures due to the presence of non-Kitaev interactions. Torque magnetometry is a very sensitive technique for probing the magnetic anisotropy, which is critical in understanding the magnetic ground state. In this work, we report detailed single-crystal torque measurements in the proposed Kitaev candidate honeycomb magnet $\alpha$-RuBr$_3$, which displays zigzag order below 34 K. Based on angular-dependent torque studies in magnetic fields up to 16 T rotated in the plane normal to the honeycomb layers, we find an easy-plane anisotropy with a temperature dependence of the torque amplitude following closely the behaviour of the powder magnetic susceptibility. The torque for field rotated in the honeycomb plane has a clear six-fold periodicity with a saw-tooth shape, reflecting the three-fold symmetry of the crystal structure and stabilization of different zigzag domains depending on the field orientation, with a torque amplitude that follows an order parameter form inside the zigzag phase. By comparing experimental data with theoretical calculations we identify the relevant anisotropic interactions and the role of the competition between different zigzag domains in this candidate Kitaev material.</description>

      <title>Impact of electron correlations on two-particle charge response in electron- and hole-doped cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating many-body effects that deviate from an independent particle approach, has long been a key research interest in condensed matter physics. Layered cuprates are prototypical systems, where electron-electron interactions are found to strongly affect the dynamics of single-particle excitations. It is however, still unclear how the electron correlations influence charge excitations, such as plasmons, which have been variously treated with either weak or strong correlation models. In this work, we demonstrate the hybridised nature of collective valence charge fluctuations leading to dispersing acoustic-like plasmons in hole-doped La$_{1.84}$Sr$_{0.16}$CuO$_{4}$ and electron-doped La$_{1.84}$Ce$_{0.16}$CuO$_{4}$ using the two-particle probe, resonant inelastic x-ray scattering. We then describe the plasmon dispersions in both systems, within both the weak mean-field Random Phase Approximation (RPA) and strong coupling $t$-$J$-$V$ models. The $t$-$J$-$V$ model, which includes the correlation effects implicitly, accurately describes the plasmon dispersions as resonant excitations outside the single-particle intra-band continuum. In comparison, a quantitative description of the plasmon dispersion in the RPA approach is obtained only upon explicit consideration of re-normalized electronic band parameters. Our comparative analysis shows that electron correlations significantly impact the low-energy plasmon excitations across the cuprate doping phase diagram, even at long wavelengths. Thus, complementary information on the evolution of electron correlations, influenced by the rich electronic phases in condensed matter systems, can be extracted through the study of two-particle charge response.</description>

The $\{9,3\}$ is formed by a regular 3-coordinated tiling of nonagons, where the 3-color coding of bonds according to the inequivalent Kitaev Ising spin couplings yields the natural generalization of the original Kitaev model for Euclidean regular honeycomb tiling. Upon investigation of the bulk spectrum for large finite size droplets, we identify a gapless chiral $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid state featuring spontaneous time reversal symmetry breaking. Due to its non-commutative translation group structure, such type of hyperbolic spin liquid is conjectured to feature chiral quasiparticles with a potentially non-Abelian Bloch profile.</description>

      <title>Flux-mediated effective Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in an impurity decorated diamond chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In flat-band systems with non-orthogonal compact localized states (CLSs), onsite perturbations couple neighboring CLSs and generate exponentially-decaying impurity states, whose degree of localization depends on lattice parameters. In this work, a diamond chain with constant magnetic flux per plaquette is decorated with several controlled onsite impurities in a patterned arrangement, generating an effective system that emerges from the flat band. The coupling distribution of the effective system is determined by the relative distance between impurities and the value of the flux, which can be chosen to engineer a wide variety of models. We employ a staggered distribution of impurities that effectively produces the well-known Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, and show that the topological edge states display an enhanced robustness to non-chiral disorder due to an averaging effect over their extension. Finally, we provide a route to implement the system experimentally using optical waveguides that guide orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes. This work opens the way for the design of topologically protected impurity states in other flat-band systems or physical platforms with non-orthogonal bases.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing in an exciton-polariton condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extreme sensitivity of critical systems has been explored to improve quantum sensing and weak signal detection. The closing of the energy gap and abrupt change in the nature of the ground state at a quantum phase transition (QPT) critical point enhance indicators of parameter estimation, such as the quantum Fischer information. Here, we show that even if the system lacks a QPT, the quantum Fischer information can still be amplified due to the presence of an excited-state quantum phase transition (ESQPT). This is shown for a light-driven anharmonic quantum oscillator model that describes the low-lying spectrum of an exciton-polariton condensate proposed as a platform for quantum computation. In the classical limit, the ESQPT translates into the emergence of a hyperbolic point that explains the clustering of the energy levels at the vicinity of the ESQPT and the changed structure of the corresponding eigenstates, justifying the enhanced sensitivity of the system. Our study showcases the relationship between non-conventional quantum critical phenomena and quantum sensing with potential experimental applications in exciton-polariton systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy measurements of an Anderson impurity system in MoS$_{2}$ mirror twin boundaries, where both the quantum confined impurity state and the Kondo resonance resulting from the interaction with the substrate are accessible. Using a spin-polarized tip, we observe magnetic field induced changes in the peak heights of the Anderson impurity states as well as in the magnetic field-split Kondo resonance. Quantitative comparison with numerical renormalization group calculations provides evidence of the notable spin polarization of the spin-resolved impurity spectral function under the influence of a magnetic field. Moreover, we extract the field and temperature dependence of the impurity magnetization from the differential conductance measurements and demonstrate that this exhibits the universality and asymptotic freedom of the $S=1/2$ Kondo effect. This work shows that mirror twin boundaries can be used as a testing ground for theoretical predictions on quantum impurity models.</description>

      <title>Vacuum induced three-body delocalization in cavity quantum materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate that the vacuum itself suffices to delocalize an Anderson insulator inside a cavity. By studying a disordered one-dimensional spinless fermion system coupled to a single photon mode describing the vacuum fluctuation, we find that even though the cavity mode does not qualitatively change the localization behavior for a single-fermion system, it indeed leads to delocalization via a vacuum fluctuation-induced correlated hopping mechanism for systems with at least three fermions. A mobility edge separating the low-energy localized eigenstates and the high-energy delocalized eigenstates has been revealed. It is shown that such a one-dimensional three-fermion system in with correlated hopping can be mapped to a single-particle system with hopping along the face diagonals in a three dimensional lattice. The effect of the dissipation as well as a many-body generalization have also been discussed.</description>

      <title>Bilayer stacking A-type altermagnet: A general approach to generating two-dimensional altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new concept of bilayer stacking A-type altermagnet (BSAA), in which two identical ferromagnetic monolayers are stacked with antiferromagnetic coupling to form a two-dimensional A-type altermagnet. By solving the stacking model, we derive all BSAAs for all layer groups and draw three key conclusions: (1) Only 17 layer groups can realize intrinsic A-type altermagnetism. All 2D A-type altermagnets must belong to these 17 layer groups, which will be helpful to search for 2D A-type altermagnet. (2) It is impossible to connect the two sublattices of BSAA using $S_{3z}$ or $S_{6z}$, a constraint that is also applicable to all 2D altermagnets. (3) $C_{2\alpha}$ is a general stacking operation to generate BSAA for an arbitrary monolayer. Our theory not only can explain the previously reported twisted-bilayer altermagnets, but also can provide more possibilities to generate A-type altermagnets. Our research has significantly broadened the range of candidate materials for 2D altermagnets. Based on conclusion (1), the bilayer NiZrCl$_6$ is predicted to exhibit intrinsic A-type altermagnetism. Additionally, we use twisted-bilayer NiCl$_2$, previously reported in the literature, as the second example of BSAA. Furthermore, utilizing symmetry analysis and first-principles calculation, we scrutinize their spin-momentum locking characteristic to substantiate their altermagnetic properties.</description>

      <title>A Feasible Way to Find Above-Room-Temperature Ferromagnetic Spintronic Materials: from Flat Band Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding and designing ferromagnets that operate above room temperature is crucial in advancing high-performance spintronic devices. The pioneering van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ has extended the way for spintronic applications by achieving a record-high Curie temperature among its analogues. However, the physical mechanism of increasing Cuire temperature still needs to be explored. Here, we propose a practical approach to discovering high-temperature ferromagnetic materials for spintronic applications through flat band engineering. We simulate the magnetic transition directly from strongly correlated calculations, reconciling the dual nature of $d$-electrons with both localization and itinerant characters. Significantly, our systematic studies unveil the emergence of quasi-particle flat bands arising from collective many-body excitations preceding the ferromagnetic phase transition, reinforcing magnetic stability through a positive feedback mechanism. This research provides a promising pathway for exploring next-generation spintronic devices utilizing low-dimensional vdW flat band systems.</description>

      <title>Lattice study of SU(2) gauge theory coupled to four adjoint Higgs fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories with matter fields in various representations play an important role in different branches of physics. Recently, it was proposed that several aspects of the interesting pseudogap phase of cuprate superconductors near optimal doping may be explained by an emergent $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry. Around the transition with positive hole-doping, one can construct a $(2+1)-$dimensional $SU(2)$ gauge theory coupled to four adjoint scalar fields which gives rise to a rich phase diagram with a myriad of phases having different broken symmetries. We study the phase diagram of this model on the Euclidean lattice using the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. We find the existence of multiple broken phases as predicted by previous mean field studies. Depending on the quartic couplings, the $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry is broken down either to $U(1)$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2$ in the perturbative description of the model. We further study the confinement-deconfinement transition in this theory, and find that both the broken phases are deconfining. However, there exists a marked difference in the behavior of the Polyakov loop between the two phases.</description>

      <title>Concurrent VQE for Simulating Excited States of the Schwinger Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the application of the concurrent variational quantum eigensolver (cVQE) for computing excited states of the Schwinger model. By designing suitable ansatz circuits utilizing universal SO(4) or SO(8) qubit gates, we demonstrate how to efficiently obtain the lowest two, four, and eight eigenstates with one, two, and three ancillary qubits for both vanishing and non-vanishing background electric field cases. Simulating the resulting quantum circuits classically with tensor network techniques, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to compute the two lowest eigenstates of systems with up to $\mathcal{O}(100)$ qubits. Given that our method allows for measuring the low-lying spectrum precisely, we also present a novel technique for estimating the additive mass renormalization of the lattice based on the energy gap. As a proof-of-principle calculation, we prepare the ground and first-excited states with one ancillary and four physical qubits on quantum hardware, demonstrating the practicality of using the cVQE to simulate excited states.</description>

      <title>Unified Description of Charge Density Waves in Electron- and Hole-doped Cuprate Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-temperature cuprates superconductors are characterised by the complex interplay between superconductivity (SC) and charge density wave (CDW) in the context of intertwined competing orders. In contrast to abundant studies for hole-doped cuprates, the exact nature of CDW and its relationship to SC was much less explored in electron-doped counterparts. Here, we performed resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) experiments to investigate the relationship between CDW and SC in electron-doped La$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$. The short-range CDW order with a correlation length $\sim35$~\AA~was found in a wide range of temperature and doping concentration. Near the optimal doping, the CDW order is weakened inside the SC phase, implying an intimate relationship between the two orders. This interplay has been commonly reported in hole-doped La-based cuprates near the optimal doping. We reconciled the diverging behaviour of CDW across the superconducting phase in various cuprate materials by introducing the CDW correlation length as a key parameter. Our study paves the way for establishing a unified picture to describe the phenomenology of CDW and its relationship with SC in the cuprate family.</description>

Abstract: Studies on the heavy-fermion pyrochlore iridate (Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$) point to the role of time-reversal-symmetry breaking in geometrically frustrated Kondo lattices. With this motivation, here we study the effect of Kondo coupling and chiral spin liquids in a frustrated $J_1-J_2$ model on a square lattice. We treat the Kondo effect within a slave-fermion approach, and discuss our results in the context of a proposed global phase diagram for heavy fermion metals. We calculate the anomalous Hall response for the chiral states of both the Kondo destroyed and Kondo screened phases. Across the quantum critical point, a reconstruction of the Fermi surface leads to a sudden change of the Berry curvature distribution and, consequently, a jump of the anomalous Hall conductance. We discuss the implications of our results for the heavy-fermion pyrochlore iridate and propose an interface structure based on Kondo insulators to further explore such effects.</description>

Abstract: Strange metals develop near quantum critical points (QCPs) in a variety of strongly correlated systems. Some of the important issues include how the quantum critical state loses quasiparticles, how it drives superconductivity, and to what extent the strange-metal physics in different classes of correlated systems is interconnected. In this review, we confront some of these issues from the vantage point of heavy fermion metals. We will describe the notion of Kondo destruction and how it leads to a transformation of the Fermi surface from ``large" to ``small" when the system is tuned across the QCP, a loss of quasiparticles everywhere on the Fermi surface when it is perched at the QCP, and a dynamical Planckian scaling in various physical properties including charge responses. We close with a brief discussion about the connections between the strange-metal physics in heavy fermion metals and its counterparts in the cuprates and other correlated materials.</description>

Abstract: In this work we study gapped boundary states of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in 4+1d, which are characterized by mixed $\mathbb{Z}_N$-gravity response, and the closely related phases protected by $C_N$ rotation symmetry. We show that if $N\notin \{2,4,8,16\}$, any symmetry-preserving boundary theory is necessarily gapless for the root SPT state. We then propose a (3+1)$d$ $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to fermionic matter as a candidate boundary theory for $N=2,4,8,16$, where the anomalous symmetry is implemented by invertible topological defects obtained from gauging (2+1)$d$ chiral topological superconductors. For the $C_N$ case, we present an explicit construction for the boundary states for $N=2,4,8,16$, and argue that the construction fails for other values of $N$.</description>

Abstract: Nonlocal effective interactions are inherent to non-relativistic quantum many-body systems, but their systematic resummation poses a significant challenge known as the ``vertex problem" in many-body perturbation theory. We introduce a renormalization scheme based on a projection-based renormalization condition that selectively resums the most essential nonlocal contributions to the effective interaction vertex, avoiding the computational complexity of the full vertex function. This enables us to derive a renormalized Feynman diagrammatic series with large parameters canceled by counter-diagrams, efficiently generated using a perturbative expansion of the parquet equations and computed using a diagrammatic Monte Carlo algorithm. Applying our approach to a 3D Yukawa Fermi liquid, we demonstrate that the renormalized perturbation theory remains predictive even in the strongly correlated regime and uncover significant sign cancellations between different channels contributing to the scattering amplitude. Our work establishes a novel framework for investigating strong correlations in quantum many-body systems, offering a systematic approach to explore nonlocal theories for challenging systems like the electron liquid in material science.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional fracton topological orders with boundary Toeplitz braiding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically study a class of 3D non-liquid states that show exotic boundary phenomena in the thermodynamical limit. More concretely, we focus on a class of 3D fracton topological orders formed via stacking 2D twisted \(\mathbb{Z}_N\) topologically ordered layers along \(z\)-direction. Nearby layers are coupled while maintaining translation symmetry along \(z\) direction. The effective field theory is given by infinite-component Chern-Simons theory, with an integer-valued symmetric block-tridiagonal Toeplitz \(K\)-matrix whose size is thermodynamically large. With open boundary conditions (OBC) along \(z\), certain choice of \(K\)-matrices exhibits exotic boundary ``Toeplitz braiding'', where the mutual braiding phase angle between two anyons at opposite boundaries oscillates and remains non-zero in the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, in trivial case, the mutual braiding phase angle decays exponentially to zero in the thermodynamical limit. As a necessary condition, this phenomenon requires the existence of boundary zero modes in the \(K\)-matrix spectrum under OBC. We categorize nontrivial \(K\)-matrices into two distinct types. Each type-I possesses two boundary zero modes, whereas each type-II possesses only one boundary zero mode. Interestingly, the integer-valued Hamiltonian matrix of the familiar 1D ``Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model'' can be used as a non-trivial $K$-matrix. Importantly, since large-gauge-invariance ensures integer quantized \(K\)-matrix entries, global symmetries are not needed to protect these zero modes. We also present numerical simulation as well as finite size scaling, further confirming the above analytical results. Motivated by the present field-theoretical work, it will be interesting to construct 3D lattice models for demonstrating Toeplitz braiding, which is left to future investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Out of equilibrium, the action-reaction symmetry of the interactions is often broken, leading to the emergence of various collective phenomena with no equilibrium counterparts. Although ubiquitous in classical active systems, implementing such non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state systems has remained challenging, as the known quantum schemes require precise control over the system on a single-site level. Here, we propose a novel dissipation-engineering protocol to induce non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state platforms with light, which we expect to be achievable with state-of-the-art experimental techniques. Focusing on magnetic metals for concreteness, we show microscopically that a light injection that introduces the decay channel to a virtually excited state gives rise to non-reciprocal interactions between localized spins. One can even realize a situation where spin A tries to align with spin B but the B tries the opposite, resulting in a chase-and-runaway dynamics. Applying our scheme to layered ferromagnets, we show that a non-reciprocal phase transition from a static to a many-body time-dependent chiral phase emerges. Our work paves the way to bring solid-state systems to the realm of non-reciprocal science, providing yet another possibility to control quantum matter with light.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Response of Dipolar-Octupolar Quantum Spin Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dipolar-octupolar (DO) pyrochlore systems Ce$_2$(Zr,Sn,Hf)$_2$O$_7$ have garnered much attention as recent investigations suggest that they may stabilize a novel quantum spin ice (QSI), a quantum spin liquid (QSL) with an emergent $U(1)$ gauge field. In particular, the experimentally estimated microscopic exchange parameters place Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ in the $\pi$-flux QSI regime, and recent neutron scattering experiments have corroborated some key theoretical predictions. On the other hand, to make a definitive conclusion, more multifaceted experimental signatures are desirable. In this regard, recent neutron scattering investigation of the magnetic field dependence of the spin correlations in Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ may provide valuable information. However, there have not been any comprehensive theoretical studies for comparison. In this work, we provide such information using gauge mean-field theory (GMFT), allowing for theoretical investigation beyond the perturbative regime. In particular, we construct the phase diagrams for the [110], [111], and [001] field directions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the distinctive evolution of the equal-time and dynamical spin structure factors as a function of the magnetic field for each field direction. These predictions will help future experiments confirm the true nature of the DO-QSI.</description>

      <title>Induction of non-Fermi liquids by critical cavity photons at the onset of superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid (NFL) at a putative quantum critical point signalling the onset of superradiance, in a set-up involving cavity quantum electrodynamics. Although the finiteness of the cavity, being bounded by reflecting mirrors, endows the cavity photons with an effective mass, they become massless at the continuous phase transition point. We consider the matter part coming from the fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice near half-filling, featuring doped Dirac cones at two sets of inequivalent valleys. This choice is dictated by the presence of a fermion-boson interaction vertex which can give rise to Landau damping of the critical bosons, eventually leading to an NFL phase for the fermions. To set up the quantum effective action, we identify the hot spots of the generically anisotropic (trigonally-warped) Fermi surfaces, which are the set of points having parallel/antiparallel tangent vectors. The cavity photons act as charge density wave (CDW) order parameters, connecting pairs of hot spots belonging to the Fermi surface of a single valley. With these ingredients, we have set upon identifying NFL phases, using the tools of dimensional regularization and renormalization-group-flow equations. Our final results indicate that stable NFL phases exist in the low-energy limit, for the projections of the flows along the CDW coupling constant.</description>

      <title>Deconfined quantum criticality of frustrated hard-core dipolar bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical points (DQCPs) are proposed as unconventional second-order phase transitions beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. The nature and experimental realizations of DQCPs are crucial issues of importance. We illustrate the potential for DQCPs between the valence bond solid state and the antiferromagnetic phase to arise in optical lattices containing frustrated dipolar bosons subject to hard-core constraints. The emergence of DQCPs is comprehended through the fusion of two Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions. The DQCPs and the BKTs are confirmed by the finite-size scaling of ground-state fidelity susceptibilities. The numerical analysis reveals varying critical exponents of the correlation length in DQCPs and the logarithmic scaling in BKTs, respectively. This work offers a promising platform for realizing DQCPs and provides valuable insights into their nature within the framework of topological phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study spin transport in a one-dimensional finite-length wire connected to fermionic leads. The interacting wire is described by the sine-Gordon model while the leads are either noninteracting or interacting Luttinger liquids. We calculate the spin current driven by a spin bias by solving numerically the classical equation of motion, and we find that the cosine term in the sine-Gordon model gives rise to an oscillating spin current when the spin bias exceeds its critical value. We discuss the results in connection with transport experiments with ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Finite width of anyons changes their braiding signature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15094v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anyons are particles intermediate between fermions and bosons, characterized by a nontrivial exchange phase, yielding remarkable braiding statistics. Recent experiments have shown that anyonic braiding has observable consequences on edge transport in the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). Here, we study transport signatures of anyonic braiding when the anyons have a finite width. We show that the width of the anyons, even extremely small, can have a tremendous impact on transport properties and braiding signatures. In particular, we find that taking the finite width into account allows us to explain recent experimental results on FQHE at filling factor $2/5$ [Ruelle et al., Phys. Rev. X \textbf{13}, 011031 (2023)]. Our work shows that the finite width of anyons crucially influences setups involving anyonic braiding, especially when the exchange phase is larger than $\pi/2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we prove that the quantum critical point in the ground state of quantum many-body systems, can also govern the universal dynamical behavior when the systems are driven far from equilibrium, which can be captured by the evolution of the quantum geometry of the systems. By investigating quantum quench dynamics in quadratic fermionic models, we prove that the quantum volume of these systems typically grows linearly over time, with a growth velocity demonstrating universal behavior: its first derivative over the control parameter exhibits a discontinuity at the quantum critical point, with an universal jump value that is independent of specific models, but is crucially determined by the system dimension. This result reveals universal dynamical properties of non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems</description>

      <title>Hidden zero modes and topology of multiband non-Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a finite one-dimensional non-Hermitian system, the number of zero modes does not necessarily reflect the topology of the system. This is known as the breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence and has lead to misconceptions about the topological protection of edge modes in such systems. Here we show why this breakdown does occur and that it typically results in hidden zero modes, extremely long-lived zero energy excitations, which are only revealed when considering the singular value instead of the eigenvalue spectrum. We point out, furthermore, that in a finite multiband non-Hermitian system with Hamiltonian $H$, one needs to consider also the reflected Hamiltonian $\tilde H$, which is in general distinct from the adjoint $H^\dagger$, to properly relate the number of protected zeroes to the winding number of $H$.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from spin-canting fluctuations in rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rhombohedral graphene multilayers host various broken-symmetry metallic phases as well as superconductors whose pairing mechanism and order parameter symmetry remain unsettled. Strikingly, experiments have revealed prominent new superconducting regions in rhombohedral bilayer and trilayer graphene devices with proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling. We propose that these superconductors descend from a common spin-canted normal state that spontaneously breaks a U(1) spin symmetry and thus supports a gapless (Goldstone) magnon mode. In particular, we develop a scenario wherein pairing in the spin-canted state emerges from a novel type of magnon-mediated attraction: Contrary to conventional mechanisms that involve the exchange of a single boson, we show that second-order processes that exchange two magnons are dominant and produce an $s$-wave pairing interaction featuring a unique logarithmic low-frequency divergence. This low-frequency divergence disappears when spin-orbit coupling vanishes, providing a promising explanation for spin-orbit-enabled pairing. Numerous other experimental observations -- including nontrivial dependence of superconductivity on the spin-orbit coupling strength, in-plane magnetic fields, and Fermi surface structure -- also naturally follow from our scenario.</description>

      <title>A theorem on extensive ground state entropy and some related models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physics of the paradigmatic one-dimensional transverse field quantum Ising model $H= J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \sigma^x_i \sigma^x_j + h \sum_i \sigma^z_i$ is well-known. Instead, let us imagine "applying" the transverse field via a transverse Ising coupling of the spins to partner auxiliary spins, i.e. $H= J_x \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \sigma^x_i \sigma^x_j + J_z \sum_i \sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{\text{partner of }i}$. If each spin of the chain has a unique auxiliary partner, then the theorem states that the resultant eigenspectrum is still the same as that of the quantum Ising model with $\frac{h}{J} = \frac{J_z}{J_x}$ and the degeneracy of the entire spectrum is $2^{\text{number of auxiliary spins}}$. This follows from the existence of extensively large and mutually anticommuting sets of conserved quantities for $H$. We can interpret this as the auxiliary spins remaining paramagnetic down to zero temperature with an extensive ground state degeneracy. This is lost upon the loss of the unique partner condition for the full spin chain. Other cases where such extensive degeneracy survives or gets lost are also discussed. Thus this theorem forms the basis for an exact statement on the existence of extensive ground state entropy in general.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Emergent Spacetime Supersymmetry with Rydberg Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the zoo of emergent symmetries in quantum many-body physics, the previously unrealized emergent spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) is particularly intriguing. Although it was known that spacetime SUSY could emerge at the (1+1)d tricritical Ising transition, an experimental realization is still absent. In this letter, we propose to realize the tricritical Ising transition with Rydberg atom arrays, taking advantage of the reconfigurability of these systems. In such systems, the spacetime SUSY manifests itself in the respective correlation functions of a bosonic mode and its fermionic partner. However, the correlation function of the fermionic mode inevitably involves a string operator, making direct measurement challenging in the conventional setting. Here, we utilize the analog--digital hybrid nature of the Rydberg atom arrays, which can simulate a physical Hamiltonian and perform a digital quantum circuit on the same platform, to measure the correlation function of the fermionic mode. This hybridized protocol provides an experimentally feasible way to reveal the hidden structure of the spacetime SUSY that emerges at the tricritical Ising transition.</description>
