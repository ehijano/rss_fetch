      <title>Controlling complex rhythms: A hierarchical approach to limit cycle switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limit cycles are self-sustained, closed trajectories in phase space representing (un)-stable, periodic behavior in nonlinear dynamical systems. They underpin diverse natural phenomena, from neuronal firing patterns to engineering oscillations. The presence of multiple concentric limit cycles reflects distinct behavioral symmetries within a system. In this work, we investigate the hierarchical dynamical transitions from one limit cycle to another, driven by oscillatory excitation while preserving other system properties. We demonstrate that controlling multirhythmicity through hierarchical, stepwise periodic modulation enables reliable switching between rhythmic states. This hierarchical control framework is crucial for applications in neuro-engineering and synthetic biology, where precise, robust modulation of complex rhythmic behaviors enhances system functionality and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Dynamic mode decomposition for detecting transient activity via sparsity and smoothness regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is a data-driven modal decomposition technique that extracts coherent spatio-temporal structures from high-dimensional time-series data. By decomposing the dynamics into a set of modes, each associated with a single frequency and a growth rate, DMD enables a natural modal decomposition and dimensionality reduction of complex dynamical systems. However, when DMD is applied to transient dynamics, even if a large number of modes are used, it remains difficult to interpret how these modes contribute to the transient behavior. In this study, we propose a simple extension of DMD to overcome this limitation by introducing time-varying amplitudes for the DMD modes based on sparsity and smoothness regularization. This approach enables identification of dynamically significant modes and extraction of their transient activities, providing a more interpretable and faithful representation of non-steady dynamics. We apply the proposed method to fluid flow data exhibiting transient behavior and demonstrate that it can capture the temporal structure of mode activations that are not accessible with the standard DMD method.</description>

      <title>Memorisation and forgetting in a learning Hopfield neural network: bifurcation mechanisms, attractors and basins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite explosive expansion of artificial intelligence based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), these are employed as "black boxes'', as it is unclear how, during learning, they form memories or develop unwanted features, including spurious memories and catastrophic forgetting. Much research is available on isolated aspects of learning ANNs, but due to their high dimensionality and non-linearity, their comprehensive analysis remains a challenge. In ANNs, knowledge is thought to reside in connection weights or in attractor basins, but these two paradigms are not linked explicitly. Here we comprehensively analyse mechanisms of memory formation in an 81-neuron Hopfield network undergoing Hebbian learning by revealing bifurcations leading to formation and destruction of attractors and their basin boundaries. We show that, by affecting evolution of connection weights, the applied stimuli induce a pitchfork and then a cascade of saddle-node bifurcations creating new attractors with their basins that can code true or spurious memories, and an abrupt disappearance of old memories (catastrophic forgetting). With successful learning, new categories are represented by the basins of newly born point attractors, and their boundaries by the stable manifolds of new saddles. With this, memorisation and forgetting represent two manifestations of the same mechanism. Our strategy to analyse high-dimensional learning ANNs is universal and applicable to recurrent ANNs of any form. The demonstrated mechanisms of memory formation and of catastrophic forgetting shed light on the operation of a wider class of recurrent ANNs and could aid the development of approaches to mitigate their flaws.</description>

      <title>Rhythmic sharing: A bio-inspired paradigm for zero-shot adaptive learning in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08644v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The brain rapidly adapts to new contexts and learns from limited data, a coveted characteristic that artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms struggle to mimic. Inspired by the mechanical oscillatory rhythms of neural cells, we developed a learning paradigm utilizing link strength oscillations, where learning is associated with the coordination of these oscillations. Link oscillations can rapidly change coordination, allowing the network to sense and adapt to subtle contextual changes without supervision. The network becomes a generalist AI architecture, capable of predicting dynamics of multiple contexts including unseen ones. These results make our paradigm a powerful starting point for novel models of cognition. Because our paradigm is agnostic to specifics of the neural network, our study opens doors for introducing rapid adaptive learning into leading AI models.</description>
