      <title>TRMAC: A Time-Reversal-based MAC Protocol for Wireless Networks within Computing Packages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As chiplet-based integration and many-core architectures become the norm in high-performance computing, on-chip wireless communication has emerged as a compelling alternative to traditional interconnects. However, scalable Medium Access Control (MAC) remains a fundamental challenge, particularly under dense traffic and limited spectral resources. This paper presents TRMAC, a novel cross-layer MAC protocol that exploits the spatial focusing capability of Time Reversal (TR) to enable multiple parallel transmissions over a shared frequency channel. By leveraging the quasi-deterministic nature of on-chip wireless channels, TRMAC pre-characterizes channel impulse responses to coordinate access using energy-based thresholds, eliminating the need for orthogonal resource allocation or centralized arbitration. Through detailed physical-layer simulation and system-level evaluation on diverse traffic, TRMAC demonstrates comparable or superior performance to existing multi-channel MAC protocols, achieving low latency, high throughput, and strong scalability across hundreds of cores. TRMAC provides a low-complexity, high-efficiency solution for future Wireless Networks-on-Chip (WNoCs), particularly in chiplet-based systems where spatial reuse and modularity are critical. With simulations we prove that TRMAC can be utilized for parallel transmissions with a single frequency channel with a similar throughput and latency as in using multiple frequency bands omitting the need for complex transceivers. This work establishes a new design direction for MAC protocols that are tightly integrated with the underlying channel physics to meet the demands of next-generation computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Experimental Assessment of Neural 3D Reconstruction for Small UAV-based Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing miniaturization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has expanded their deployment potential to indoor and hard-to-reach areas. However, this trend introduces distinct challenges, particularly in terms of flight dynamics and power consumption, which limit the UAVs' autonomy and mission capabilities. This paper presents a novel approach to overcoming these limitations by integrating Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) with small UAV systems for fine-grained 3-Dimensional (3D) digital reconstruction of small static objects. Specifically, we design, implement, and evaluate an N3DR-based pipeline that leverages advanced models, i.e., Instant-ngp, Nerfacto, and Splatfacto, to improve the quality of 3D reconstructions using images of the object captured by a fleet of small UAVs. We assess the performance of the considered models using various imagery and pointcloud metrics, comparing them against the baseline Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the N3DR-enhanced pipeline significantly improves reconstruction quality, making it feasible for small UAVs to support high-precision 3D mapping and anomaly detection in constrained environments. In more general terms, our results highlight the potential of N3DR in advancing the capabilities of miniaturized UAV systems.</description>

      <title>The receptron is a nonlinear threshold logic gate with intrinsic multi-dimensional selective capabilities for analog inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Threshold logic gates (TLGs) have been proposed as artificial counterparts of biological neurons with classification capabilities based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector. The linearity of TLGs limits their classification capabilities requiring the use of networks for the accomplishment of complex tasks. A generalization of the TLG model called receptron, characterized by input-dependent weight functions allows for a significant enhancement of classification performances even with the use of a single unit. Here we formally demonstrate that a receptron, characterized by nonlinear input-dependent weight functions, exhibit intrinsic selective activation properties for analog inputs, when the input vector is within cubic domains in a 3D space. The proposed model can be extended to the n-dimensional case for multidimensional applications. Our results suggest that receptron-based networks can represent a new class of devices capable to manage a large number of analog inputs, for edge applications requiring high selectivity and classification capabilities without the burden of complex training.</description>

      <title>Can AI support student engagement in classroom activities in higher education?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lucrative career prospects and creative opportunities often attract students to enroll in computer science majors and pursue advanced studies in the field. Consequently, there has been a significant surge in enrollment in computer science courses, resulting in large class sizes that can range from hundreds to even thousands of students. A common challenge in such large classrooms is the lack of engagement between students and both the instructor and the learning material. However, with advancements in technology and improvements in large language models (LLMs), there is a considerable opportunity to utilize LLM-based AI models, such as conversational artificial intelligence (CAI), to enhance student engagement with learning content in large classes. To explore the potential of CAI to support engagement, especially with learning content, we designed an activity in a software Engineering course (with a large class size) where students used CAI for an in-class activity. We conducted a within-subject investigation in a large classroom at a US university where we compared student engagement during an in-class activity that used CAI tool vs. one without CAI tool. The CAI tool we used was ChatGPT due to its widespread popularity and familiarity. Our results indicate that CAI (ChatGPT) has the potential to support engagement with learning content during in-class activities, especially in large class sizes. We further discuss the implications of our findings.</description>

      <title>Local Learning Rules for Out-of-Equilibrium Physical Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol of score-based generative models (SGMs) can be learned via a local learning rule. The gradient with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol are computed directly from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration, we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a network of 10x10 oscillators to sample images of 0s and 1s from the MNIST dataset.</description>

      <title>HARPT: A Corpus for Analyzing Consumers' Trust and Privacy Concerns in Mobile Health Apps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present HARPT, a large-scale annotated corpus of mobile health app store reviews aimed at advancing research in user privacy and trust. The dataset comprises over 480,000 user reviews labeled into seven categories that capture critical aspects of trust in applications, trust in providers and privacy concerns. Creating HARPT required addressing multiple complexities, such as defining a nuanced label schema, isolating relevant content from large volumes of noisy data, and designing an annotation strategy that balanced scalability with accuracy. This strategy integrated rule-based filtering, iterative manual labeling with review, targeted data augmentation, and weak supervision using transformer-based classifiers to accelerate coverage. In parallel, a carefully curated subset of 7,000 reviews was manually annotated to support model development and evaluation. We benchmark a broad range of classification models, demonstrating that strong performance is achievable and providing a baseline for future research. HARPT is released as a public resource to support work in health informatics, cybersecurity, and natural language processing.</description>

      <title>The Autonomy of the Lightning Network: A Mathematical and Economic Proof of Structural Decoupling from BTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a formal analysis of the Lightning Network as a monetary system structurally diverging from Bitcoin's base-layer settlement model. We demonstrate that under increasing transaction demand, BTC transaction fees rise superlinearly due to throughput constraints, while Lightning Network routing costs approach a bounded asymptote. Using mathematical modeling, game-theoretic proofs, and complexity analysis, we show that Lightning enables indefinite off-chain operation via the emergence of liquidity hub oligopolies. These hubs exhibit properties of unregulated financial intermediaries, including rent extraction, opacity, and systemic fragility. Strategic agent models show that channel closure becomes economically infeasible, and routing problems approach hardness limits in P-Space complexity. We conclude that Lightning does not merely extend Bitcoin, but constitutes a synthetic financial system with shadowbank characteristics, lacking reserve discipline, transparency, or enforceable settlement guarantees.</description>

      <title>Robotics Under Construction: Challenges on Job Sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As labor shortages and productivity stagnation increasingly challenge the construction industry, automation has become essential for sustainable infrastructure development. This paper presents an autonomous payload transportation system as an initial step toward fully unmanned construction sites. Our system, based on the CD110R-3 crawler carrier, integrates autonomous navigation, fleet management, and GNSS-based localization to facilitate material transport in construction site environments. While the current system does not yet incorporate dynamic environment adaptation algorithms, we have begun fundamental investigations into external-sensor based perception and mapping system. Preliminary results highlight the potential challenges, including navigation in evolving terrain, environmental perception under construction-specific conditions, and sensor placement optimization for improving autonomy and efficiency. Looking forward, we envision a construction ecosystem where collaborative autonomous agents dynamically adapt to site conditions, optimizing workflow and reducing human intervention. This paper provides foundational insights into the future of robotics-driven construction automation and identifies critical areas for further technological development.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Machine Learning in Mental Health: A Survey of Data, Algorithms, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal machine learning (MML) is rapidly reshaping the way mental-health disorders are detected, characterized, and longitudinally monitored. Whereas early studies relied on isolated data streams -- such as speech, text, or wearable signals -- recent research has converged on architectures that integrate heterogeneous modalities to capture the rich, complex signatures of psychiatric conditions. This survey provides the first comprehensive, clinically grounded synthesis of MML for mental health. We (i) catalog 26 public datasets spanning audio, visual, physiological signals, and text modalities; (ii) systematically compare transformer, graph, and hybrid-based fusion strategies across 28 models, highlighting trends in representation learning and cross-modal alignment. Beyond summarizing current capabilities, we interrogate open challenges: data governance and privacy, demographic and intersectional fairness, evaluation explainability, and the complexity of mental health disorders in multimodal settings. By bridging methodological innovation with psychiatric utility, this survey aims to orient both ML researchers and mental-health practitioners toward the next generation of trustworthy, multimodal decision-support systems.</description>

      <title>Contactless Cardiac Pulse Monitoring Using Event Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time event cameras are a novel technology for recording scene information at extremely low latency and with low power consumption. Event cameras output a stream of events that encapsulate pixel-level light intensity changes within the scene, capturing information with a higher dynamic range and temporal resolution than traditional cameras. This study investigates the contact-free reconstruction of an individual's cardiac pulse signal from time event recording of their face using a supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) model. An end-to-end model is trained to extract the cardiac signal from a two-dimensional representation of the event stream, with model performance evaluated based on the accuracy of the calculated heart rate. The experimental results confirm that physiological cardiac information in the facial region is effectively preserved within the event stream, showcasing the potential of this novel sensor for remote heart rate monitoring. The model trained on event frames achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.32 beats per minute (bpm) compared to the RMSE of 2.92 bpm achieved by the baseline model trained on standard camera frames. Furthermore, models trained on event frames generated at 60 and 120 FPS outperformed the 30 FPS standard camera results, achieving an RMSE of 2.54 and 2.13 bpm, respectively.</description>

      <title>Understanding Human-AI Trust in Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated in education, students are turning to these systems for guidance, feedback, and information. However, the anthropomorphic characteristics of these chatbots create ambiguity regarding whether students develop trust toward them as they would a human peer or instructor, based in interpersonal trust, or as they would any other piece of technology, based in technology trust. This ambiguity presents theoretical challenges, as interpersonal trust models may inappropriately ascribe human intentionality and morality to AI, while technology trust models were developed for non-social technologies, leaving their applicability to anthropomorphic systems unclear. To address this gap, we investigate how human-like and system-like trusting beliefs comparatively influence students' perceived enjoyment, trusting intention, behavioral intention to use, and perceived usefulness of an AI chatbot - factors associated with students' engagement and learning outcomes. Through partial least squares structural equation modeling, we found that human-like and system-like trust significantly influenced student perceptions, with varied effects. Human-like trust more strongly predicted trusting intention, while system-like trust better predicted behavioral intention and perceived usefulness. Both had similar effects on perceived enjoyment. Given the partial explanatory power of each type of trust, we propose that students develop a distinct form of trust with AI chatbots (human-AI trust) that differs from human-human and human-technology models of trust. Our findings highlight the need for new theoretical frameworks specific to human-AI trust and offer practical insights for fostering appropriately calibrated trust, which is critical for the effective adoption and pedagogical impact of AI in education.</description>
