      <title>Beyond-mean-field analysis of the Townes soliton and its breathing mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using the Bogoliubov perturbation theory we describe the self-bound ground state and excited breathing states of $N$ two-dimensional bosons with zero-range attractive interactions. Our results for the ground state energy $B_N$ and size $R_N$ improve previously known large-$N$ asymptotes and we better understand the crossover to the few-body regime. The oscillatory breathing motion results from the quantum-mechanical breaking of the mean-field scaling symmetry. The breathing-mode frequency scales as $\Omega\propto |B_N|/\sqrt{N}$ at large $N$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stage of modulational instability in repulsive two-component Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modulational instability (MI) is a fundamental phenomenon in the study of nonlinear dynamics, spanning diverse areas such as shallow water waves, optics, and ultracold atomic gases. In particular, the nonlinear stage of MI has recently been a topic of intense exploration, and has been shown to manifest, in many cases, in the generation of dispersive shock waves (DSWs). In this work, we experimentally probe the MI dynamics in an immiscible two-component ultracold atomic gas with exclusively repulsive interactions, catalyzed by a hard-wall-like boundary produced by a repulsive optical barrier. We analytically describe the expansion rate of the DSWs in this system, generalized to arbitrary inter-component interaction strengths and species ratios. We observe excellent agreement among the analytical results, an effective 1D numerical model, full 3D numerical simulations, and experimental data. Additionally, we extend this scenario to the interaction between two counterpropagating DSWs, which leads to the production of Peregrine soliton structures. These results further demonstrate the versatility of atomic platforms towards the controlled realization of DSWs and rogue waves.</description>

      <title>Scattering halos in strongly interacting Feshbach molecular Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the scattering halos resulting from collisions between discrete momentum components in the time-of-flight expansion of interaction-tunable $^6\rm Li_2$ molecular Bose-Einstein condensates. A key highlight of this study is the observation of the influence of interactions on the collisional scattering process. We measure the production of scattering halos at different interaction levels by varying the number of particles and the scattering length, and quantitatively assess the applicability of perturbation theory. To delve into a general theory of scattering halos, we introduce a scattering factor and obtain a universal relation between it and the halo ratio. Furthermore, we simulate the formation of scattering halos under non-perturbative conditions and analyze the discrepancies between simulation results and experiments through a return pulse experiment. This study enhances our understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying scattering processes in many-body systems and provides new perspectives for further theoretical research.</description>

      <title>Emergence of nonequilibrium Lieb excitations in periodically driven strongly interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the exact nonequilibrium spectral function of a gas of strongly correlated Tonks-Girardeau bosons subjected to a strong periodic drive. Utilizing the theory of Floquet spectral function in conjunction with the Bose-Fermi mapping theorem, we show that nonequilibrium Lieb modes emerge if the underlying mapped fermions form a Floquet-Fermi sea. In the low-frequency regime, the exact analysis reveals the emergence of characteristic linear Lieb excitations for the bosonic system, while the underlying mapped fermions displays the wide Dirac-like linear dispersion.</description>

      <title>Third-Order Exceptional Point in Non-Hermitian Spin-Orbit-Coupled cold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) has seen substantial advances in both experiment and theory. However, in quantum systems, higher-order exceptional points remain of great interest and possess numerous intriguing properties yet to be fully explored. Here, we describe a \emph{PT} symmetry-protected three-level non-Hermitian system with the dissipative spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) fermions in which a third-order exceptional point (EP3) emerges when both the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the system collapse into one. The band structure and its spin dynamics are explored for $^{173}$Yb fermions. We highlight the enhanced sensitivity to the external perturbation of EP3 with cubic-root energy dispersion. Additionally, we investigate the second-order exceptional point (EP2) with square-root energy dispersion in a three-level quantum system with the absence of parity symmetry, which proves that the enhanced sensitivity closely relates to the symmetries of the NH system. Furthermore, we analyze the encircling behavior of EP3 in terms of the adiabatic limit and the nonadiabatic dynamics and discover some different results from that of EP2.</description>

      <title>Light-enhanced dipolar interactions between exciton polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the scenario of excitons in a semiconductor bilayer that are strongly coupled to cavity photons, leading to the formation of dipolar exciton polaritons (dipolaritons). Using a realistic pseudopotential for the dipolar interactions, we exactly determine the scattering between dipolaritons, accounting for the hybridization between interlayer and intralayer excitons. We show that the light-matter coupling enhances the interactions between dipolaritons by forcing excitons to scatter at energies that would otherwise be forbidden in ordinary exciton-exciton collisions. Furthermore, we show that this light enhancement is sensitive to the dipole moment and is larger for long-range dipolar interactions than for short-range intralayer interactions. Our results reveal the role of dark exciton states in dipolariton interactions as well as the optimal bilayer properties for achieving strong interactions.</description>

      <title>A tensor network formulation of Lattice Gauge Theories based only on symmetric tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lattice Gauge Theory Hilbert space is divided into gauge-invariant sectors selected by the background charges. Such a projector can be directly embedded in a tensor network ansatz for gauge-invariant states as originally discussed in [Phys. Rev. B 83, 115127 (2011)] and in [Phys. Rev. X 4, 041024 (2014)] in the context of PEPS. The original ansatz is based on sparse tensors, though parts of them are not explicitly symmetric, and thus their actual implementation in numerical simulations has been hindered by the complexity of developing ad hoc libraries. Here we provide a new PEPS tensor network formulation of gauge-invariant theories purely based on symmetric elementary tensors. The new formulation can be implemented in numerical simulation using available state-of-the-art tensor network libraries but also holds interest from a purely theoretical perspective since it requires embedding the original gauge theory with gauge symmetry G into an enlarged globally symmetric theory with symmetry GxG. By revisiting the original ansatz in the modern landscape of i) duality transformations between gauge and spin systems, ii) finite depth quantum circuits followed by measurements that allow generating topologically ordered states, and iii) Clifford enhanced tensor networks, we show that such a new formulation provides a novel duality transformation between lattice gauge theories and specific sectors of globally invariant systems.</description>

      <title>Probing the magnetic origin of the pseudogap using a Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In strongly correlated materials, interacting electrons are entangled and form collective quantum states, resulting in rich low-temperature phase diagrams. Notable examples include cuprate superconductors, in which superconductivity emerges at low doping out of an unusual ``pseudogap'' metallic state above the critical temperature. The Fermi-Hubbard model, describing a wide range of phenomena associated with strong electron correlations, still offers major computational challenges despite its simple formulation. In this context, ultracold atoms quantum simulators have provided invaluable insights into the microscopic nature of correlated quantum states. Here, we use a quantum gas microscope Fermi-Hubbard simulator to explore a wide range of doping levels and temperatures in a regime where a pseudogap is known to develop. By measuring multi-point correlation functions up to fifth order, we uncover a novel universal behaviour in magnetic and higher-order spin-charge correlations. This behaviour is characterized by a doping-dependent energy scale that governs the exponential growth of the magnetic correlation length upon cooling. Accurate comparisons with determinant Quantum Monte Carlo and Minimally Entangled Typical Thermal States simulations confirm that this energy scale agrees well with the pseudogap temperature $T^{*}$. Our findings establish a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the magnetic origin and physical nature of the pseudogap and pave the way towards the exploration of pairing and collective phenomena among charge carriers expected to emerge at lower temperatures.</description>

      <title>Many-body effects in a composite bosonic Josephson junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In standard bosonic Josephson junctions (BJJs), particles tunnel between two single-well potentials linked by a finite barrier. The dynamics of standard BJJs have been extensively studied, both at the many-body and mean-field levels of theory. In the present work, we introduce the concept of a composite BJJ. In a composite BJJ, particles tunnel between two double-well potentials linked by a finite potential barrier between them. We focus on many-body facets of quantum dynamics and investigate how the complex structure of the junction influences tunneling. Employing the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons method, highly-accurate many-boson wave-functions are obtained from which properties are computed. We analyze the dynamics using the survival probability, the degree of fragmentation of the junction, and the fluctuations of observables, and discuss how many-boson tunneling behaves, and how it may be controlled, using the composite nature of the junction. A central result of this work relates to the degree of fragmentation of composite BJJs with different numbers of bosons. We provide strong evidence that a universal degree of fragmentation into multiple time-dependent modes takes place. Further applications are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced topological phase transition at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of topological phase transitions in interacting, symmetry-protected quantum matter at finite temperatures. Using a combined numerical and analytical approach, we study a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with added Hubbard interactions, where no thermodynamic phase transition occurs at finite temperatures. The transition is signalled by a quantized, non-local bulk topological order parameter. It is driven by defects, which are enabled by the combination of interaction and thermal activation, with no counterpart in the non-interacting limit. The defects localize topological zero modes, which, when sufficiently abundant, cause the order parameter to vanish. This phenomenon, interpreted via bulk-boundary correspondence, reflects the loss of a topological edge mode at a well-defined critical temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Unlike zero-temperature topological transitions, these finite-temperature transitions lack thermodynamic signatures but remain observable in controlled quantum systems, such as ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Emergent Spacetime Supersymmetry with Rydberg Atom Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the zoo of emergent symmetries in quantum many-body physics, the previously unrealized emergent spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) is particularly intriguing. Although it was known that spacetime SUSY could emerge at the (1+1)d tricritical Ising transition, an experimental realization is still absent. In this work, we propose to realize emergent spacetime SUSY using reconfigurable Rydberg atom arrays featuring two distinct sets of Rydberg excitations, tailored for implementation on dual-species platforms. In such systems, the spacetime SUSY manifests itself in the respective correlation functions of a bosonic mode and its fermionic partner. However, the correlation function of the fermionic mode inevitably involves a string operator, making direct measurement challenging in the conventional setting. Here, we leverage the hybrid analog-digital nature of the Rydberg atom arrays, which allows for the simulation of a physical Hamiltonian and the execution of a digital quantum circuit on the same platform. This hybrid protocol offers a new perspective for uncovering the hidden structure of emergent spacetime SUSY.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the gauge field is an everlasting topic in modern physics. Spin-orbit coupling is a powerful tool in ultracold atomic systems, resulting in an artificial gauge field that can be easily manipulated and observed in a tabletop environment. Combining optical Raman lattices and atom-atom interaction, the artificial gauge field can be made density-dependent. In this work, we propose a straightforward way to engineer one-dimensional density-dependent gauge field in a Bose-Hubbard model in spin-orbit coupled Raman lattices. Next, we study the model from two perspectives: few-body quantum walk dynamics and many-body ground state. In the first perspective, we show that large spin-flipped tunneling can lead to a deep two-body bound state. In the second perspective, mean-field and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations consistently reveal three different phases, i.e. the Mott insulator phase, the superfluid phase, and the magnetic superfluid phase. Finally, we discuss the experimental protocol with Raman lattices based on existing experimental platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19036v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Double sine-Gordon class of universal coarsening dynamics in a spin-1 Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Far from equilibrium, universal dynamics prevails in many different situations, from pattern coarsening to turbulence, while the understanding of its microscopic laws and classification has remained unsatisfactory. Here, universal scaling evolution reflected by coarsening in a multi-component Bose gas is traced back to a low-energy effective theory given by a double sine-Gordon (DSG) model for a single real scalar field. Our experimental observations of a rubidium spinor BEC support the applicability of this model. Evaluating the scaling evolution according to the low-energy effective model demonstrates the universal aspects of the scaling characteristics as compared with that of the spinor gas. The difference between diffusion-type and sub-diffusive scaling is shown to be connected to the occupation of minima within the DSG potential. Our results point to a path towards a microscopic description and classification of pattern coarsening in many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: Excitons drive the optoelectronic properties of organic semiconductors which underpin devices including solar cells and light-emitting diodes. We demonstrate that excitons can exhibit topologically non-trivial states protected by inversion symmetry and identify a family of organic semiconductors realising the predicted excitonic topological phases. We also show that the topological phase can be controlled through experimentally realisable strains and chemical functionalisation of the material. Appealing to quantum Riemannian geometry, we predict that topologically non-trivial excitons have a lower bound on their centre-of-mass spatial spread, which can significantly exceed the size of a unit cell. Furthermore, we show that the dielectric environment allows to control the excitonic quantum geometry. The discovery of excitonic topology and excitonic Riemannian geometry in organic materials brings together two mature fields and suggests many new possibilities for a range of future optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Transporting, splitting, and connecting spin singlet pairs in a topological pump</title>

Abstract: Transporting and connecting quantum states are key capabilities for larger-scale quantum information processing. Concrete challenges are the coherent shuttling and the manipulation of distant quantum states in an optical lattice. Here, we create spin singlet pairs of two magnetic states of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in an optical lattice and use a bi-directional topological Thouless pump to transport, coherently split, and separate the pairs, as well as to demonstrate interaction between them via tuneable $($swap$)^\alpha$-gate operations. We achieve pair pumping with a single-shift fidelity of 99.78(3)% over 50 lattice sites and split the pairs within a decoherence-free subspace. Gates are implemented by superexchange interaction, allowing us to produce interwoven spin singlets. For read-out, we apply a magnetic field gradient, resulting in single- and multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Our work shows avenues to create complex patterns of entanglement and new approaches to quantum processing, sensing, and atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>Pair size and quantum geometry in a multiband Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the size of two-body bound states and Cooper pairs within a multiband Hubbard model that features time-reversal symmetry and uniform pairing on a generic lattice. Our analysis involves (i) an exact calculation of the localization tensor to determine the size of lowest-lying two-body bound state in vacuum, and (ii) an evaluation of the analogous tensor to estimate the average size of Cooper pairs within the mean-field BCS-BEC crossover theory at zero temperature. Beyond the conventional intraband contribution that depends on Bloch bands, we show that pair size also has a geometric contribution governed by the quantum-metric tensor of the Bloch states and their band-resolved quantum-metric tensors. As a concrete example, we investigate the pyrochlore-Hubbard model numerically and demonstrate that, while the pair size diverges in the weakly interacting BCS regime of dispersive bands, it remains finite and relatively small in the flat-band regime, even for infinitesimal interaction, perfectly matching the exact two-body result in the dilute limit.</description>

      <title>Topological edge states at Floquet quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15395v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topologically protected edge states exactly at topological phase boundaries challenge the conventional belief that topological states must be associated with a bulk energy gap. Because periodically driven (Floquet) systems host unusually intricate topological phase boundaries, topological edge states can be prolific at such Floquet quantum criticality. Working on a class of chiral-symmetric, Floquet-driven Majorana fermion chains, we analytically and computationally show that the precise boundaries between different Floquet topological gapped phases can accommodate topological edge modes, including the so-called Majorana $\pi$ modes. We also identify a general bulk-edge correspondence formula to predict and understand the emergence of topological edge modes at Floquet quantum criticality. Of direct interest to quantum simulation experiments, our results break new grounds for studies of nonequilibrium topological phases of matter undergoing topological phase transitions.</description>
