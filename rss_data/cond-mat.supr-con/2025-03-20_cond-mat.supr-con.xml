      <title>Schmid-Higgs Mode in the Presence of Pair-Breaking Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective modes in superconductors provided the first realization of the Higgs mechanism. The transverse Goldstone mode acquires a gap (i.e. a mass) when it hybridizes with the electromagnetic gauge field. The longitudinal Schmid-Higgs mode, on the other hand, is always massive. In conventional BCS theory, its gap is exactly $2\Delta$, coinciding with the excitation threshold for quasiparticles. Being situated right at the edge of the continuum spectrum it gives rise to peculiar dynamics for the Schmid-Higgs mode. For instance, when suddenly excited at $t=0$, it exhibits algebraically decaying oscillations of the form $\sim \sin(2\Delta t)/{t}^{1/2}$. In this study, we explore the behavior of Schmid-Higgs oscillations in the presence of pair-breaking mechanisms, such as magnetic impurities or in-plane magnetic fields. These processes suppress the quasiparticle excitation threshold down to $2\varepsilon_g &lt; 2\Delta$, potentially placing the longitudinal mode within the continuum spectrum. Despite this, we show that the algebraically decaying oscillations persist, taking the form $\sim \sin(2\varepsilon_g t)/t^2$. The Schmid-Higgs mode becomes truly overdamped and exponentially decaying only in the gapless superconductors with $\varepsilon_g=0$.</description>

      <title>Planckian dissipation, anomalous high temperature THz non-linear response and energy relaxation in the strange metal state of the cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the nonlinear THz 2D coherent spectroscopic response of superconducting La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (LSCO) thin films as a function of $T$ across a wide range of doping levels from mildly underdoped through extremely overdoped ($T_c &lt; 5$ K). In addition to the large nonlinearities expected in the superconducting state, we find an extended regime of large normal state THz nonlinearity. This is in sharp contrast to the conventional superconductor NbN where the strong nonlinear response promptly disappears at $T_c$. The size of the nonlinear susceptibility in LSCO is $|\chi^{(3)}|\approx 2.2\times10^{-9} m^2/V^2$, which is one of the largest THz range nonlinearities ever measured. The 2DCS measurement shows that the dominant normal state nonlinearities arise from pump-probe processes, of which there are various possible origins. These may be related to the unconventional interactions that lead to the strange metal or the persistence of superconducting correlations to high temperatures. Irrespective of its origin, the large normal state nonlinearity provides an opportunity to measure the energy relaxation rate ($\Gamma_E$) to temperatures where the momentum relaxation rate is linear in T and close to its ``Planckian" form ($\Gamma_M \approx 2kT/h$). We find $\Gamma_E$ to be $10 - 40$ times smaller than the momentum relaxation. This shows that the scattering that causes momentum loss (and $T$-linear) resistivity do not remove appreciable energy from the electrons. Although the $T$-dependence of the momentum relaxation is consistent with quasi-elastic scattering off bosonic collective modes at temperatures above their characteristic energy (the Bloch-Gruneisen temperature for acoustic phonons) it is inconsistent with $\Gamma_E$'s temperature dependence. $\Gamma_E$ is an increasing function of $T$, which is indicative of {\it inelastic} scattering to the phonon bath.</description>

      <title>Theory of Two-level Tunneling Systems in Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a field theory formulation for the interaction of an ensemble of two-level tunneling systems (TLS) with the electronic states of a superconductor. Predictions for the impact of two-level tunneling systems on superconductivity are presented, including $T_c$ and spectrum of quasiparticle states for conventional BCS superconductors. We show that non-magnetic TLS impurities in conventional s-wave superconductors can act as pair-breaking or pair-enhancing defects depending on the level population of the distribution of TLS impurities. We present calculations of the enhancement of superconductivity, both $T_c$ and the order parameter, for TLS defects in thermal equilibrium with the electrons and lattice. The scattering of quasiparticles by TLS impurities leads to sub-gap states below the bulk excitation gap, $\Delta$, as well as resonances in the continuum above $\Delta$. The energies and spectral weights of these states depend on the distribution of tunnel splittings, while the spectral weights are particularly sensitive to the level occupation of the TLS impurities. Under microwave excitation, or decoupling from the thermal bath, a nonequilibrium level population of the TLS distribution generates subgap quasiparticle states near the Fermi level which contribute to dissipation and thus degrade the performance of superconducting devices at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Tunneling density of states in exotic superconductors and spatial patterns of particle-hole interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunneling spectroscopy of superconductors provides valuable insights into gap symmetry, quasiparticle dynamics, and pairing mechanisms. This paper explores spatial patterns of quasiparticle interference in the tunneling density of states (TDOS) near localized impurities. These patterns emerge because Bogoliubov quasiparticles, as coherent superpositions of electrons and holes, drive reversible particle-to-hole conversion within the superconductor. Impurities act as beam splitters, generating interference between particle and hole states, forming spatial fringes reminiscent of Young's double-slit experiment. In topological superconductors, these interference patterns are further modulated by nodal lines that encode the nodal structure and phase of the gap function, $\Delta(\vec p)$. Notably, the patterns directly reveal the winding number of $\Delta(\vec p)$ phase, offering a unique probe of exotic, non-BCS pairing and a powerful tool for detecting topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Upper critical fields in high-$ T_{\rm{c}} $ superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates, understanding the unconventional pairing mechanism has remained one of the most significant challenges. The upper critical field ($H_{\rm{c2}}$) is an essential parameter for obtaining information on the pair-breaking mechanism, coherence length $\xi$, and pairing symmetry, all of which are crucial for understanding unconventional superconducting mechanisms. Here, we provide a brief review of studies on $ H_{\rm{c2}} $ in several representative series of cuprate, iron-based, and nickelate superconductors. By comparing the behavior of $ H_{\rm{c2}} $ as a function of temperature, doping concentration, and anisotropy across these three major classes of superconductors, we hope to contribute to a better understanding of the complex pairing interactions in high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous vortex-antivortex lattice and Majorana fermions in rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconducting states in multilayer rhombohedral graphene with spin and valley polarization has raised an interesting question: how does superconductivity cope with time-reversal symmetry breaking? %In the normal state, spin and valley polarization break time-reversal symmetry, while trigonal warping enforces $C_{3z}$. Below the critical temperature, the superconducting phase displays signatures of chiral behavior and is stabilized by out-of-plane fields as large as $\sim 0.5\,\text{T}$. In this work, using Ginzburg-Landau theory and microscopic calculation, we predict the existence of a new superconducting state at low electron density, which exhibits a spontaneously formed lattice of vortices and antivortices hosting Majorana zero-modes in their cores. We further identify this vortex-antivortex lattice (VAL) state in the experimental phase diagram and describe its experimental manifestations.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic superconducting diode effect and nonreciprocal superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhombohedral tetralayer graphene has recently emerged as an exciting platform for a possible chiral superconducting state. Here, we theoretically demonstrate and study the emergence of nonreciprocal superconductivity and an intrinsic superconducting diode effect in this system. Our results are based on a fully self-consistent framework for determining the superconducting order parameter from a Kohn-Luttinger mechanism to superconductivity and show that large diode efficiencies, $\sim$ 60%, are achievable and highly tunable by an external displacement field. Moreover, we also find that the diodicity shows a characteristic angular dependence with multiple enhanced lobes, which depend on the Fermi surface structure of the underlying normal state. Hence, our results suggest that the intrinsic superconducting diode effect could provide insights into the type of Fermi surface topology from which superconductivity arises.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous transport and tunneling spectroscopy of moir\'e graphene: Distinct observation of the superconducting gap and signatures of nodal superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of superconductivity in magic-angle graphene remains challenging. A key difficulty lies in discerning the different energy scales in this strongly interacting system, particularly the superconducting gap. Here, we report the first simultaneous tunneling spectroscopy and transport measurements of magic-angle graphene, providing a novel approach to probe the superconducting state. This approach allows us to identify two coexisting V-shaped tunneling gaps with different energy scales: a distinct low-energy superconducting gap that vanishes at the superconducting critical temperature and magnetic field, and a higher-energy pseudogap. The superconducting tunneling spectra display a linear gap-filling behavior with temperature and magnetic field and exhibit the Volovik effect, consistent with a nodal order parameter. Our work reveals the unconventional nature of the superconducting gap in magic-angle graphene and establishes an experimental framework for multidimensional investigation of tunable quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Josephson effect in strongly disordered metallic wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study localization effects in Josephson junctions with two superconductors connected by a strongly disordered metallic wire of length $L$. The conventional description of the Josephson effect in such systems, based on the quasiclassical Usadel equation, neglects electron interference and is only applicable when $L$ is shorter than the localization length $\xi$ in the wire. We develop a more general theory for the Josephson effect using the non-linear sigma model that fully accounts for electron interference, and hence localization. We show that for $L \gg \xi$, three qualitatively different regimes of the Josephson current arise depending on the ratio of the superconducting order parameter $\Delta$ and the mean level spacing in the localization volume $\Delta_\xi$. We derive the average supercurrent as a function of the phase difference for all three regimes. Quite unexpectedly, we observe that the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation between the average critical current and the normal-state conductance still holds in the strongly localized state when $\Delta_\xi \gg \Delta$ and $\xi \ll L \ll (\xi/\pi^2) \ln^2(\Delta_\xi/\Delta)$.</description>

      <title>Angular Interplay of Nematicity, Superconductivity, and Strange Metallicity in a Moir\'e Flat Band</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems frequently exhibits broken rotational symmetry, raising fundamental questions about the underlying order parameter symmetry. In this work, we demonstrate that electronic nematicity--driven by Coulomb-mediated rotational symmetry breaking--serves as a crucial link to understanding the nature of superconductivity. Utilizing a novel framework of angle-resolved measurement, we reveal an interring angular interplay among nematicity, superconductivity, and strange metallicity in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene. By establishing a direct correlation between the preferred superconducting transport direction and the principal axis of the metallic phase, our findings place strong constrains on the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter. This work introduces a new paradigm for probing the microscopic mechanisms governing superconductivity in strongly interacting two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Photonic Negative Differential Thermal Conductance Enabled by NIS Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing to their sensitivity to temperature fluctuations, normal metal-insulator-superconductor (NIS) junctions are leveraged in various thermal devices. This study illustrates that two NISIN reservoirs can achieve a measurable negative differential thermal conductance (NDTC). This phenomenon is enabled by photon-mediated heat exchange, which is profoundly affected by the temperature-dependent impedance matching between the reservoirs. Under appropriate configurations, the heat current is suppressed for increasingly large temperature gradients, leading to NDTC. We also propose experimental configurations where it is possible to discriminate this effect unambiguously. We employ superconducting aluminum in conjunction with either silver or epitaxial InAs to facilitate the experimental observation of NDTC at low temperatures over significant sub-Kelvin ranges. This advances the development of devices that exploit NDTC to enhance heat and temperature regulation in cryogenic environments, such as thermal switches, transistors, and amplifiers.</description>

      <title>Finite-Momentum Pairing State in Unconventional Rashba Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In systems with unconventional Rashba bands, we propose that a finite-momentum pairing state can emerge without the need for an external magnetic field. We analyze the phase transition from a zero-momentum Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state to a finite-momentum pairing state using a microscopic interaction model. We demonstrate that the coexistence of zero-momentum and Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO)-type pairings in different channels provides a well understanding of recent experimental observations of pair-density-wave (PDW) states. Furthermore, we propose that an s-wave BCS superconductor-unconventional Rashba metal (SC-URM) junction can generate an LO-type pairing state via an orbital-selective proximity effect. This nontrivial state can be detected by measuring the Josephson current in an SC-URM-SC junction or through Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy/spectrosscopy (JSTM/S). Our results reveal that the internal multi-orbital degrees of freedom play a crucial role in facilitating finite-momentum pairing states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Fig. 4c, under the section titled "Pinning and thermally activated motion of vortices" in arXiv:2206.14108 and Nat Phys. 19, 1293 (2023) [1], Minkov and co-workers presented the time dependence of the magnetic moment of sulfur hydride (H$_{3}$S) under high pressure and argued that they had observed magnetic flux creep at 165 K, 180 K and 185 K. Flux creep is a phenomenon observed under the assumption that the material under study can trap magnetic flux, and thus, Fig. 4c serves as evidence that H$_{3}$S traps magnetic flux and is a high-temperature superconductor. The claim remains unchanged even in the recently published Author Correction [2] to Ref. [1]. However, Ref. [2] discloses an experimental protocol they used to collect the time-dependent magnetic moment data. In this Matters Arising, we point out that the protocol is not applicable to H$_{3}$S under high pressure and propose an alternative protocol. The correct protocol demonstrates that the claim in Refs. [1,2] -- that their time-dependent magnetic moment data serve as evidence of "pinning and thermally activated motion of vortices" -- is invalid.</description>

      <title>In-situ tunable interaction with an invertible sign between a fluxonium and a post cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation with bosonic modes presents a powerful paradigm for harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics to perform complex information processing tasks. In constructing a bosonic qubit with superconducting circuits, nonlinearity is typically introduced to a cavity mode through an ancillary two-level qubit. However, the ancilla's spurious heating has impeded progress towards fully fault-tolerant bosonic qubits. The ability to in situ decouple the ancilla when not in use would be beneficial but has so far only been realized with tunable couplers or additional parametric drives. This work presents a novel architecture for quantum information processing, comprising a 3D post cavity coupled to a fluxonium ancilla via a readout resonator. This system's intricate energy level structure results in a complex landscape of interactions whose sign can be tuned in situ by the magnetic field threading the fluxonium loop without the need of additional elements. Our results could significantly advance the lifetime and controllability of bosonic qubits.</description>
