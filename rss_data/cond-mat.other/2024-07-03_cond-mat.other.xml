      <title>Spectral evidence for NiPS3 as a Mott-Hubbard insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The layered van der Waals trichalcogenide NiPS3 has attracted widespread attention due to its unique optical, magnetic, and electronic properties. The complexity of NiPS3 itself, however, has also led to ongoing debates regarding its characteristics such as the existence of self-doped ligand holes. In this study, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering have been applied to investigate the electronic structure of NiPS3. With the aid of theoretical calculations using the charge-transfer multiplet model, we provide experimental evidence for NiPS3 being a Mott-Hubbard insulator rather than a charge-transfer insulator. Moreover, we explain why some previous XAS studies have concluded that NiPS3 is a charge-transfer insulator by comparing surface and bulk sensitive spectra.</description>

      <title>Sub-millisecond electric field sensing with an individual rare-earth doped ferroelectric nanocrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of electrical signals within neuronal assemblies is crucial to unraveling complex brain function. Despite recent advances in employing optically active nanostructures in transmembrane potential sensing, there remains room for improvement in terms of response time and sensitivity. Here, we report the development of such a nanosensor capable of detecting electric fields with a submillisecond response time at the single particle level. We achieve this by using ferroelectric nanocrystals doped with rare earth ions producing upconversion (UC). When such a nanocrystal experiences a variation of surrounding electric potential, its surface charge density changes, inducing electric polarization modifications that vary, via converse piezoelectric effect, the crystal field around the ions. The latter variation is finally converted into UC spectral changes, enabling optical detection of electric potential. To develop such a sensor, we synthesized erbium and ytterbium-doped barium titanate crystals of size $\approx160$ nm. We observed distinct changes in the UC spectrum when individual nanocrystals were subjected to an external field via a conductive AFM tip, with a response time of 100 $\mu$s. Furthermore, our sensor exhibits a sensitivity to electric fields of only 4.8 kV/cm/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$, making possible the time-resolved detection of a neuron action potential.</description>

      <title>Study of ion induced Inner Shell Ionization cross section through electron capture mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron Capture (EC) cross-section from K, L and M shells of the target atoms to the vacant K, L and M shells of the projectile ions have been calculated by deriving the accurate momentum transfer to the captured electrons for different charge states. Several correction factors like polarization correction, relativistic effects (R) of the target wave function, Coulomb-deflection factor (C) due to the effect of the repulsion between the projectile and the target nucleus, correction for projectile energy loss have been introduced. The mean charge state of the projectiles inside the target material has been estimated using suitable empirical models and the fractional charge state distribution has been calculated considering Lorentz distribution. Fractional distribution of charge state of the projectile ions is used to obtain the charge state contributions of the electron capture cross-sections. The effect of Simultaneous Multiple Ionization (SMI) has been considered in the theory of Direct Coulomb Ionization (DCI). The theoretically obtained total cross-sections have been compared with the experimental findings obtained from various literature. The computation scheme has been depicted through sample calculations of ionization cross-sections through electron capture mechanism.</description>

      <title>Quantum Electron Dynamics in Helium Ion Injection onto Tungsten Surfaces by Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutralization process of an ion particle on a surface is key issue of the plasma-wall interaction (PWI). We investigated helium (He) ion injection onto a tungsten surface using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) simulation. We developed the TDDFT code QUMASUN for this study, simulating the process of electron transfer from the surface to the He nucleus by solving the time evolution of electron wave function and the classical motion of nuclei simultaneously. Our results show that the probabilities of injected $\text{He}^{2+}$ changing into $\text{He}^{1+}$ and $\text{He}^{0}$ on the surface are approximately 40 percent and 13 percent, respectively. The captured electrons by $\text{He}^{1+}$ and $\text{He}^{0}$ predominantly occupy the 2s and 2p orbitals, corresponding to excited states. In addition, we stated some challenges for applying TDDFT to plasma-wall interactions.</description>
