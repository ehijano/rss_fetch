      <title>Memory effects in repeated uses of quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Information Processing (QIP) tasks can be efficiently formulated in terms of quantum dynamical maps, whose formalism is able to provide the appropriate mathematical representation of the evolution of open quantum systems. A key QIP task is quantum state transfer (QST) aimed at sharing quantum information between distant nodes of a quantum network, enabling, e.g. quantum key distribution and distributed quantum computing. QST has primarily been addressed insofar by resetting the quantum channel after each use, thus giving rise to memoryless channels. Here we consider the case where the quantum channel is continuously used, without implementing time- and resource- consuming resetting operations. We derive a general, analytical expression for the $n^{\mathrm{th}}$-use average QST fidelity for $U(1)$-symmetric channels and apply our formalism to a perfect QST channel in the presence of imperfect readout timing. We show that even relatively small readout timing errors give rise to memory effects which have a highly detrimental impact on subsequent QST tasks.</description>

      <title>Semi-device-independent randomness certification on discretized continuous-variable platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomness is fundamental for secure communication and information processing. While continuous-variable optical systems offer an attractive platform for this task, certifying genuine quantum randomness in such setups remains challenging. We present a semi-device-independent scheme for randomness certification tailored to continuous-variable implementations, where the dimension assumption is operationally implemented by restricting state preparations to the two-level Fock subspace. Using standard homodyne and displacement-based measurements, we show that simple optical setups can achieve dimension-witness violations that certify positive min-entropy, even in the presence of realistic losses and misaligned reference frames. These results demonstrate that practical and scalable quantum randomness generation is achievable with minimal experimental complexity on continuous-variable platforms.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic state preparation from general initial states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variety of quantum computing algorithms exist for the preparation of approximate Hamiltonian ground states. A natural and important question is how these ground-state approximations can be further improved using adiabatic state preparation. Here, we present a heuristic method to carry out adiabatic state preparation starting from a generic initial wavefunction. Given a quantum circuit that prepares the initial wavefunction, and a target Hamiltonian for which one wishes to prepare the ground state, we present an algorithm to construct an adiabatic path between these two states. This method works by approximating a parent Hamiltonian for the initial wavefunction, and the quality of this approximation can be can be checked prior to running the ASP algorithm. We apply this technique to simulate the ground state of water and the lowest-lying multireference singlet state of methylene, using various initial wavefunctions as the starting point of the adiabatic path.</description>

      <title>Color code thresholds under circuit-level noise beyond the Pauli framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum error correction code is assessed over its ability to correct errors in noisy quantum circuits. This task requires extensive simulations of faulty quantum circuits, which are often made tractable by considering stochastic Pauli noise models, as they are compatible with efficient classical simulation techniques. However, such noise models do not fully capture the variety of physical error mechanisms encountered in realistic quantum platforms. In this work, we extend circuit-level noise modeling beyond the Pauli framework by estimating the threshold of the color code under more general noise models. Specifically, we consider two representative non-Pauli error channels: a systematic $X$-rotation model that introduces coherent over-rotations, and an amplitude damping channel that captures relaxation processes. These models are incorporated at the circuit level into color code circuits using a Tree Tensor Network ansatz. Our simulations demonstrate that tensor network simulations enable accurate threshold estimation under non-Pauli noise for color codes up to distance $d=7$ (73 qubits). Comparing our results with the Pauli twirling approximations of the noise models, we find that coherent over-rotations yield systematically higher error rates, deviating from the Pauli twirling approximation as the code distance increases.</description>

      <title>Quantum Nanophotonic Interface for Tin-Vacancy Centers in Thin-Film Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The negatively charged tin-vacancy center in diamond (SnV-) is an excellent solid state qubit with optically-addressable transitions and a long electron spin coherence time at elevated temperatures. However, implementing scalable quantum nodes with high-fidelity optical readout of the electron spin state requires efficient photon emission and collection from the system. In this manuscript, we report a quantum photonic interface for SnV- centers based on one-dimensional photonic crystal cavities fabricated in diamond thin films. Furthermore, we develop a model describing the spontaneous emission dynamics of our system, allowing for rigorous determination of Purcell factors and the C/D branching ratio from cavity enhancement of the C and D transitions of the SnV- zero phonon line. We observe quality factors up to ~6000 across this sample, and measure up to a 12-fold lifetime reduction. By considering the lifetime reduction of both the C and D transitions independently, we determine the C/D branching ratio to be {\eta}BR=0.7815, in line with previous theoretical and experimental findings. Finally from our analysis, we extract a Purcell factor of up to Fc=26.21(0.01) for a single SnV- transition.</description>

      <title>Contrasting GHZ and W-state Entanglement Dynamics due to Correlated Markov Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to preserve multipartite entanglement in noisy environments is central to advancing quantum information processing. In this work, we develop a semiclassical theoretical model of three entangled qubits exposed to local Markov noise environments with tunable statistical correlations between noise sources. We show that such correlations can significantly influence the dynamics of multipartite entanglement, in some cases slowing its decay and, under ideal conditions, even enabling full preservation. Using tripartite negativity as an entanglement measure, we derive analytical results for the GHZ and W states, demonstrating their contrasting responses to correlated and anticorrelated noise. Our analysis identifies regimes in which multipartite entanglement can be sustained despite environmental interactions, offering new insight into how noise correlations may serve as a resource for protecting quantum coherence in multi-qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Self-induced manipulation of biphoton entanglement in topologically distinct modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biphoton states have shown promising applications in quantum information processing, including quantum communications, quantum metrology, and quantum imaging. The generation and manipulation of biphoton entanglement in topologically distinct modes paves the way in this direction. Here we present a comprehensive method for regulating the topological properties of the system by combining the nonlinearity in waveguides, i.e., nonlinearity in the waveguide coupling materials, and the waveguide lattice structure. Our method enables the generation of topological biphoton states with injected pump activation on the topologically trivial modes. This is realized through self-induced manipulation on pump-dependent nonlinear couplings on the defects, which is unable to be realized while there are no such nonlinear couplings. Specifically, by including the nonlinear gain/loss mechanism in the coupling between the nearest-neighbor waveguides and the third-order Kerr nonlinearity effect along the waveguides, the injected pump power will be the controllable parameter for the manipulation of the topology in the defect states and the generation of biphoton entanglement states. We also present an experimental proposal to realize our scheme and its generalization in the contemporaneous "active" topological photonics time-bin platforms. Our method can be used in other Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models with various defect configurations. Our method enables the reusability and versatility of SSH lattice chips and their application for fault-tolerant quantum information processing, promoting the industrialization process of quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the charging of quantum batteries via shortcuts to adiabaticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although implementing shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) in open quantum systems remains challenging due to the complex control schemes required for such systems, their powerful ability to rapidly steer the system toward target states and their widespread applicability in quantum technologies have motivated us to explore their potential in quantum energy storage. In this work, we employ STA techniques to charge an open quantum battery and demonstrate that the extractable work (Ergotropy) from such a battery can be significantly enhanced by several times compared to the case where the battery is charged using a time independent driving field. Our results pave the way for accelerating the dynamics of open quantum systems and suggest promising applications in the development of high-performance, stable quantum batteries.</description>

      <title>Tractable Infinite-Horizon Stochastic Model Predictive Control for Quantum Filtering via Eigenstate Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control has shown potential to enhance the robustness of quantum control systems. propose a tractable Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) framework for finite-dimensional quantum systems under continuous-time measurement and quantum filtering. Using the almost-sure eigenstate reduction of quantum trajectories, we prove that the infinite-horizon stochastic objective collapses to a fidelity term that is computable in closed form from the one-step averaged state. Consequently, the online SMPC step requires only deterministic propagation of the filter and a terminal fidelity evaluation. An advantage of this method is that it eliminates per-horizon Monte Carlo scenario sampling and significantly reduces computational load while retaining the essential stochastic dynamics. We establish equivalence and mean-square stability guarantees, and validate the approach on multi-level and Ising-type systems, demonstrating favorable scalability compared to sampling-based SMPC.</description>

      <title>Efficient integrated quantum memory for light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable implementation of quantum networks and photonic processors require integrated photonic memories with high efficiency, yet current integrated systems have been limited to storage efficiencies below 27.8%. Here, we demonstrate highly efficient integrated quantum memories based on rare-earth-iondoped crystals coupled with impedance-matched microcavities, realized in two novel architectures: 200-micrometer-thin membranes of Eu3+:Y2SiO5 integrated with fiber-based microcavities, and waveguide-based cavities fabricated using femtosecond lasers. Our approach achieves reliable integrated quantum storage with record efficiencies of 80.3(7)% for weak coherent pulses and 69.8(1.6)% for telecom-heralded single photons, alongside the storage of 20 temporal modes with an average efficiency of 51.3(2)%. Moreover, the thin-membrane Eu3+:Y2SiO5 architecture enables spectrally tunable efficient quantum storage via variable strain, providing a flexible interface for quantum networks. By combining high efficiency, large multimode capacity, and tunability, our devices establish a versatile hardware foundation for scalable quantum repeaters and chip-scale photonic processors.</description>

      <title>Wave-Particle-Mixedness Relationships Based on lp-norm Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationships among the wave property, particle property and mixedness of quantum states based on the lp-norm coherence. By conforming that the lp-norm coherence is an appropriate measure of wave property and introducing a measure of particle property based on the differences between the maximal l2-norm coherence and the general l2-norm coherence, we present tradeoff relationships among the wave, particle and mixedness of quantum states. For 1&lt;= p &lt;2, we establish two kinds of tradeoffs of the wave, particle and mixedness with respect to the upper and lower bounds of the lp-norm coherence given by the l2-norm coherence. These trade relations give rise to compressive understanding of the intrinsic connections among the wave, particle and mixedness of quantum states, and cover some existing results as particular ones.</description>

      <title>Recovery of optical losses with the Petz recovery map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical systems are a main platform for quantum information processing, while a hidden challenge in these systems is information loss due to scattering into unmonitored modes, typically modeled as state-independent beam-splitter interactions. While such losses simply erase information encoded across modes, they directly degrade information encoded in the quantum state of a mode. Perfect correction of these Gaussian lossy channels with Gaussian operations alone is known to be impossible. In this work, we investigate the Petz recovery map as an approximate recovery. We construct the Petz recovery of single mode losses and its implementations. In particular, we show that the recovery performance of Petz recovery map is better than the recovery protocol that replaces the noisy state with the belief state. Also, when the reference state is far from the true state, it is better not to use the Petz recovery map but to leave the noisy state instead. We discuss the physical intuition of Petz recovery map and finally shows that it is near-optimal among the considered recovery protocols.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum speed limit sets a fundamental restriction on the evolution time of quantum systems. We explore the relationship between quantum imaginarity and the quantum speed limit by utilizing measures such as relative entropy, trace distance, and geometric imaginarity. These speed limits define the fundamental constraints on the minimum time necessary for quantum systems to evolve under various dynamical processes. As applications the dephasing dynamics and dissipative dynamics are analyzed in detail. The quantum speed limit in stochastic-approximate transformations is also investigated. Our quantum speed limits provide lower bounds on how fast a physical system evolves to attain or lose certain imaginarity, with potential applications in efficient quantum computation designs, quantum control and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Photodiode quantum efficiency for 2-{\mu}m light in the signal band of gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technologies with quantum correlated light require photodiodes with near-perfect `true' quantum efficiency, the definition of which adequately accounts for the photodiode dark noise. Future squeezed-light-enhanced gravitational wave detectors could in principle achieve higher sensitivities with a longer laser wavelength around 2 {\mu}m. Photodiodes made of extended InGaAs are available for this range, but the true quantum efficiency at room temperature and the low frequency band of gravitational waves is strongly reduced by dark noise. Here we characterize the change in performance of a commercial extended-InGaAs photodiode versus temperature. While the dark noise decreases as expected with decreasing temperature, the detection efficiency unfortunately also decreases monotonically. Our results indicate the need for a dedicated new design of photodiodes for gravitational wave detectors using 2-{\mu}m laser light.</description>

      <title>Tagged vector space, Part II: function space index and the implied functional integration measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The definition of quantum states in terms of tagged vector spaces is generalized to incorporate the spatiotemporal and spin degrees of freedom. Considering a tagged vector space where the index space is a function space, representing the additional degrees of freedom, we obtained axioms for the tags that include a completeness condition expressed in terms of a functional integral with an abstract functional integration measure. Using these axioms, we derive a generating functional for the moments of this functional integration measure. These moments are then used to evaluate the functional integrals of Gaussian functionals, leading to expressions in accordance with those obtained as generalizations of equivalent integrals over a finite number of integration variables. For a Gaussian functional used as a probability distributions, we show that its moments, obtained with this functional integration measure, satisfy Carleman's condition, indicating that the measure is unique.</description>

      <title>Beyond Penrose tensor diagrams with the ZX calculus: Applications to quantum computing, quantum machine learning, condensed matter physics, and quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Spin-ZX calculus as an elevation of Penrose's diagrams and associated binor calculus to the level of a formal diagrammatic language. The power of doing so is illustrated by the variety of scientific areas we apply it to: permutational quantum computing, quantum machine learning, condensed matter physics, and quantum gravity. Respectively, we analyse permutational computing transition amplitudes, evaluate barren plateaus for SU(2) symmetric ans\"atze, study properties of AKLT states, and derive the minimum quantised volume in loop quantum gravity.
  Our starting point is the mixed-dimensional ZX calculus, a purely diagrammatic language that has been proven to be complete for finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. That is, any equation that can be derived in the Hilbert space formalism, can also be derived in the mixed-dimensional ZX calculus. We embed the Spin-ZX calculus inside the mixed-dimensional ZX calculus, rendering it a quantum information flavoured diagrammatic language for the quantum theory of angular momentum, i.e. SU(2) representation theory. We diagrammatically derive the fundamental spin coupling objects - such as Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, symmetrising mappings between qubits and spin spaces, and spin Hamiltonians - under this embedding.
  Our results establish the Spin-ZX calculus as a powerful tool for representing and computing with SU(2) systems graphically, offering new insights into foundational relationships and paving the way for new diagrammatic algorithms for theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Like Correlations from Local Hidden-Variable Theories Under Conservation Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precision with which we can measure operators that do not commute with conserved quantities is limited by the need to preserve the associated global symmetries. We show how to construct a local hidden-variable model that violates Bell inequalities by interpreting this measurement error as altering the measure space of the hidden variables. This provides a physically-motivated example of a supermeasured model, where the statistical independence assumption used to form Bell inequalities is violated without there being a causal dependence of the measurement settings on the hidden variables (superdeterminism) or a causal dependence of the hidden variables on the measurement settings (retrocausality). The model also gives subtly different predictions to quantum mechanics, that could be tested experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat engines convert thermal energy into mechanical work. We here report the experimental realization of a fully quantum engine that converts quantum coherence into work. A single solid-state spin in diamond is fueled by a coherent bath and cyclically stores energy in a spin quantum battery. We establish quantum-enhanced performance by showing that almost 200$\%$ more work is produced after a few cycle compared to the corresponding classical engine. We obtain concrete criteria for successful coherence-to-work conversion, and highlight the importance of a coherent motor-battery interaction. This device harnesses nonclassical features during all stages of its cycle, and demonstrates the functionality of a nanomachine whose parts are all quantum coherent.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optimal Control of a Lambda System in the Density Matrix Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In various physical implementations of quantum information processing, qubits are realized in a Lambda type system configuration as two stable lower energy levels coupled indirectly via an unstable higher energy level, that is, in comparison, a lot more susceptible to decoherence. We consider the quantum control problem of optimal state transfer between two isospectral density matrices, over an arbitrary finite time horizon, for the quantum Lambda system. The cost considered is a compromise between the energy of the control field and the average occupancy in the highest energy level. We apply a geometric approach that combines the use of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, a symmetry reduction technique to reduce the number of parameters in the resulting optimization problem, and several auxiliary techniques to bound the parameter space in the search for the optimal solution. We prove several properties of the optimal control and trajectories for this problem, including their normality and smoothness. We obtain a system of differential equations that must be satisfied by the optimal pair of control and trajectory we treat in detail, with numerical simulations, and solve a case study involving a Hadamard-like transformation. Our techniques can be adapted to other contexts and promise to push to a more consequential level, the application of geometric control in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Squeezed-vacuum bosonic codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a family of bosonic quantum error-correcting codes built as a rotation-symmetric superposition of squeezed vacuum states, which promise protection against both loss and dephasing noise channels. The robustness of these "squeezed-vacuum codes" arises from being arranged at evenly spaced angles in phase-space, and simultaneously in evenly spaced photon-number support $n \equiv {2k} \! \pmod {2m}$. We present simple preparation circuits: a two-legged code using a Hadamard-conditional-squeezing-Hadamard sequence on an ancilla qubit, and for general "$m$-legged" codewords using sequences of conditional rotations. The performance of these codes is evaluated against loss and dephasing noises using the Knill-Laflamme violation function and benchmarked against cat codes. As the number $m$ of squeezed-vacuum states in a code increases, the code exhibits improved loss tolerance at the cost of higher dephasing sensitivity. We outline implementations in circuit QED and trapped-ion platforms, where high-fidelity Gaussian operations and conditional controls are available or under active development. These results help establish squeezed-vacuum codes as practical, hardware-ready, members of the bosonic codes class.</description>

      <title>Addressable gate-based logical computation with quantum LDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing relies on quantum error correction for high-fidelity logical operations, but scaling to achieve near-term quantum utility is highly resource-intensive. High-rate quantum LDPC codes can reduce error correction overhead, yet realizing high-rate fault-tolerant computation with these codes remains a central challenge. Apart of the lattice surgery approach, standard schemes for realizing logical gates have so far been restricted to performing global operations on all logical qubits at the same time. Another approach relies on low-rate code switching methods. In this work, we introduce a gate-based protocol for addressable single- and multi-qubit Clifford operations on individual logical qubits encoded within one or more quantum LDPC codes. Our scheme leverages logical transversal operations via an auxiliary Bacon-Shor code to perform logical operations with constant time overhead enabled by teleportation. We demonstrate the implementation of an overcomplete logical Clifford gate set and perform numerical simulations to evaluate the error-correction performance of our protocol. Finally, we observe that our scheme can be integrated with magic state cultivation protocols to achieve universal, gate-based, and fully addressable quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Simulating Clifford Circuits with Gaussian Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuits are considered more powerful than classical circuits and require exponential resources to simulate classically. Clifford circuits are a special class of quantum circuits that can be simulated in polynomial time but still show important quantum effects such as entanglement. In this work, we present an algorithm that simulates Clifford circuits by performing Gaussian elimination on a modified adjacency matrix derived from the circuit structure. Our work builds on an ZX-calculus tensor network representation of Clifford circuits that reduces to quantum graph states. We give a concise formula of amplitudes of graph states based on the LDL decomposition of matrices over GF(2), and use it to get efficient algorithms for strong and weak simulation of Clifford circuits using tree-decomposition-based fast LDL algorithm. The complexity of our algorithm matches the state of art for weak graph state simulation and improves the state of art for strong graph state simulation by taking advantage of Strassen-like fast matrix multiplication. Our algorithm is also efficient when computing many amplitudes or samples of a Clifford circuit. Further, our amplitudes formula provides a new characterization of locally Clifford equivalent graph states as well as an efficient protocol to learn graph states with low-rank adjacency matrices.</description>

      <title>Quantum optical neural networks using atom-cavity interactions to provide all-optical nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical neural networks (ONNs) have been developed to enhance processing speed and energy efficiency in machine learning by leveraging optical devices for nonlinear activation and establishing connections among neurons. In this work, we propose a quantum optical neural network (QONN) that utilizes atom-cavity neurons with controllable photon absorption and emission. These quantum neurons are designed to replace the electronic components in ONNs, which typically introduce delays and substantial energy consumption during nonlinear activation. To evaluate the performance of the QONN, we apply it to the MNIST digit classification task, considering the effects of photon absorption duration, random atom-cavity detuning, and stochastic photon loss. Additionally, we introduce a convolutional QONN to facilitate a real-world satellite image classification (SAT-6) task. Due to its compact hardware and low power consumption, the QONN offers a promising solution for real-time satellite sensing, reducing communication bandwidth with ground stations and thereby enhancing data security.</description>

      <title>Ultranarrow Bright Single-Photon Emitters in Diamond with Strong Broadband Phonon Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon emitters are fundamental building blocks for quantum information processing, communication and sensing. However, unwanted interactions with bulk phonons in their host environment strongly limit their coherence and controllability. We report single color centers in nanodiamonds that are strongly and comprehensively decoupled from the bulk phononic environment. The color centers feature record-narrow linewidths down to 0.3 nm at room temperature and stable, bright emission, exceeding 10 Mcps in saturation. Notably, the bulk phonon sideband is almost entirely suppressed, revealing the presence of a single localized vibrational mode outside the diamond phonon band. Our observations and simulations point towards a unique mechanism for phonon decoupling in common wide-gap materials, based on a strongly radiative orbital transition coupled to a localized vibrational mode. The new color center enables qualitatively higher performance for applications in quantum networks and nanoscale sensing, and the exploration of new physical resources associated with vibrational states.</description>

      <title>Finite-sample deviations and convergence in the statistics of Bohmian trajectory ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze finite-sample statistics of Bohmian trajectories for single spinless and spin-1/2 particles. Equivariance ensures agreement with $|\psi|^2$ in the quantum equilibrium limit, yet experiments and simulations necessarily use finite ensembles. We show that in regular flows (e.g., wavepackets or low-mode superpositions of eigenstates of harmonic oscillators) sample means and/or variances over modest $N$ are consistent with Born-rule moments. In contrast, degenerate superpositions of 3D oscillators with nodal barriers and chaotic Bohmian dynamics exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions and complex flow partitioning, which can yield noticeable finite-sample deviations in the mean and variance. For the spin-1/2 particle, both convective and Pauli currents conserve $|\psi|^2$, but they are associated with different velocity fields and thus might yield different finite-sample trajectory statistics. These findings calibrate the interpretation of trajectory-based uncertainty and provide practical guidance for numerical Bohmian simulations of spin and transport, without challenging the equivalence to orthodox quantum mechanics in the quantum equilibrium ensemble.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Real-Imaginary Time Evolution for Low-Depth Hamiltonian Simulation in Quantum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterdiabatic (CD) driving is a powerful technique for accelerating adiabatic quantum computing. However, it becomes self-limiting in complex optimizations like the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model: long evolution times $T$ needed to traverse crossings force the CD strength to scale as $1/T$, causing it to vanish before convergence and wasting the quantum resources invested in its implementation. We break this trade-off with a Hybrid adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (HAVQDS). HAVQDS combines adaptive real-time evolution for circuit compression with imaginary-time steps that suppress excitations at no extra gate cost. For the SK model (6--14 qubits), HAVQDS achieves higher approximation ratios than adiabatic or CD approaches, while reducing CNOT counts by 1--2 orders of magnitude, enabling high-fidelity quantum optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamical and spectral characteristics of a quantum three-level ladder system, interacting with a continuous electromagnetic field in one-dimensional open waveguide. Common realization of such systems is a waveguide QED setup ~ -- a superconducting artificial atom (transmon), coupled to an open microwave transmission line. We derive an analytical solution for spontaneous emission of initially excited atom, and use it to study the probability of state detection and spectral density of output photon states. We find that for strong coupling of transmon to a waveguide emitted photons show correlation in frequency and can have the same energies, even if the three-level system is anharmonic.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum coherence in a hybrid cavity magnomechanical system incorporating a squeezed-magnon drive. By analyzing the Gaussian quantum coherence of the cavity, magnonic, and mechanical subsystems, as well as the total system coherence, we identify the critical roles of phase control, coupling strength, drive power, and thermal noise. We show that the squeezing amplitude and phase precisely modulate the effective magnon frequency and damping, enabling phase-dependent enhancement and nonreciprocal transfer of coherence. Our systematic parameter analysis indicates that increasing driving power and photon-magnon coupling enhances quantum coherence, while thermal decoherence leads to its degradation. However, this effect is partially suppressed by the presence of magnon squeezing. The results show that squeezed magnons are a robust and tunable resource for controlling, stabilizing, and optimizing quantum coherence in cavity magnomechanical platforms, offering potential applications in hybrid magnonic systems and coherent quantum information processing.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity two-logical-qubit gates are essential for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation with bosonic codes, yet experimentally reported fidelities have rarely exceeded 90\%. Here, we propose a geometric phase engineering approach for implementing controlled-phase gates for binomially encoded logical qubits. This method leverages the structural simplicity of geometric drives to reduce the numerical optimization dimensionality while fully incorporating system nonlinearities, enabling fast and high-fidelity logical operations. As an example, we experimentally demonstrate a process fidelity of 97.4$\pm$0.8\% for a controlled-Z gate between two binomial codes, surpassing all previously reported two-logical-qubit gates in bosonic codes. This work demonstrates that geometric phase engineering provides an effective and experimentally feasible route to fast, high-fidelity logical operations in bosonic quantum processors.</description>

Abstract: Imaginary-time evolution (ITE) is one of the most widely used numerical techniques for obtaining ground states of many-body Hamiltonians. In this work, we compare ITE with gradient descent (GD) within the framework of Gaussian wavefunction ansatze. We show that while ITE and GD are formally equivalent for fermionic systems, GD exhibits consistently faster convergence for bosonic systems, challenging the common assumption of their complete equivalence.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a tunable framework for generalized quantum state discrimination (GSD) and apply it to quantum key distribution (QKD) through a protocol we call phiQKD. Building upon the two-state B92 protocol, phiQKD replaces the traditional unambiguous state discrimination (IDP) measurement with a one-parameter family of hybrid POVMs characterized by a tilting angle $\phi$. This allows for continuous control over the trade-off among correct, incorrect, and inconclusive outcomes. While the asymptotic key rate improvement over B92 is modest, phiQKD offers a practical advantage by enabling adaptability to noise and channel imperfections via measurement tunability. By evaluating the protocol under asymptotic, finite-key, and composable security models, we show that, treating quantum measurement as a tunable design parameter, rather than a fixed operation, enables flexible protocol optimization and improved performance under realistic constraints.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monads in Phase Space and Related Toeplitz Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In earlier work, we introduced quantum blobs as minimum-uncertainty symplectic ellipsoids in phase space. These objects may be viewed as geometric monads in the Leibnizian sense, representing the elementary units of phase-space structure consistent with the uncertainty principle. We establish a one-to-one correspondence between such monads and generalized coherent states, represented by arbitrary non-degenerate Gaussian wave functions in configuration space. To each of these states, we associate a classs of Toeplitz operators that extends the standard anti-Wick quantization scheme. The mathematical and physical properties of these operators are analyzed, allowing for a generalized definition of density matrices within the phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Flux-modulated tunable interaction regimes in two strongly nonlinear oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to efficiently simulate a variety of interacting quantum systems on a single device is an overarching goal for digital and analog quantum simulators. In circuit quantum electrodynamical systems, strongly nonlinear superconducting oscillators are typically realized using transmon qubits, featuring a wide range of tunable couplings that are mainly achieved via flux-dependent inductive elements. Such controllability is highly desirable both for digital quantum information processing and for analog quantum simulations of various physical phenomena, such as arbitrary spin-spin interactions. Furthermore, broad tunability facilitates the study of driven-dissipative oscillator dynamics in previously unexplored parameter regimes. In this work, we demonstrate the ability to selectively activate different dynamical regimes between two strongly nonlinear oscillators using parametric modulation. In particular, our scheme enables access to regimes that are dominated by photon-hopping, two-mode squeezing, or cross-Kerr interactions. Finally, we observe level repulsion and attraction between Kerr-nonlinear oscillators in regimes where the nonlinearities exceed the coupling strengths and decay rates of the system. Our results could be used for realizing purely analog quantum simulators to study arbitrary spin systems as well as for exploring strongly nonlinear oscillator dynamics in previously unexplored interaction regimes.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Encoding of Logical Qudits in Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The universal quantum computer will enable the simulation of arbitrary quantum states governed by arbitrary Hamiltonians. In this context, it is essential to equip future quantum processors with fault-tolerant logical qudits, since qudits naturally align with the simulation of multi-level physical systems. In this study, we present a general framework and working examples of fault-tolerant logical qudit encoding using spin systems, which are among the most coherent and robust finite multi-level physical platforms. The d-dimensional logical qudit encoding with distance-3 (or 5) codewords can be designed within a 12d (or 40d)-dimensional Hilbert space, and the design can be further generalized to 2t+1-distance codes and to encodings exploiting multiple physical qudits. A quantitative comparison shows that the logical qudit encoding proposed here offers an exponential resource advantage over multi-level mappings from logical qubits, and therefore we believe this strategy can pave the way for realizing logical qudit encodings in finite multi-level physical systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for one quasi-particle excitations in the thermodynamic limit via cluster-additive block-diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum algorithm for computing one quasi-particle excitation energies in the thermodynamic limit by combining numerical linked-cluster expansions (NLCEs) and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Our approach uses VQE to block-diagonalize the cluster Hamiltonian through a single-unitary transformation. This unitary is then post-processed using the projective cluster-additive transformation (PCAT) to ensure cluster additivity, a key requirement for NLCE convergence. We benchmark our method on the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) in one and two dimensions, and with longitudinal field, computing one quasi-particle dispersions in the high-field polarized phase. We compare two cost function classes, trace minimization and variance-based, demonstrating their effectiveness with the Hamiltonian variational ansatz (HVA). For pure TFIM, $\lceil N/2 \rceil$ layers suffice: NLCE+VQE matches exact diagonalization. For TFIM with longitudinal field, where parity symmetry breaks and PCAT becomes essential, both $\lceil N/2 \rceil$ and $N$ layers converge with increasing cluster size, with $N$ layers providing improved accuracy. Our results establish PCAT as a cluster-additive framework that extends variational quantum algorithms to excited-state calculations in the thermodynamic limit via NLCE. While demonstrated with VQE, the PCAT post-processing approach, which requires only low-energy eigenspace information, applies to any quantum eigenstate preparation method.</description>

      <title>No-signalling-projection-invariant Bell inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we highlight how any Bell inequality for a configuration involving $n$ parties each performing one of $m$ binary-outcome measurements has a canonical form that is no-signalling-projection invariant. Specifically, the $L^2$-projection of weakly signalling data onto the no-signalling polytope leaves the violation of this canonical Bell inequality unchanged. Our methods allow us to derive a general closed formula for the projection and present a substantially more computationally simple procedure for its evaluation. We also show this can be generalised to non-standard projections of potential interest for certain applications. No-signalling projections serve as a preliminary step before undertaking any device-independent application involving Bell experiment data, such as hypothesis testing against local realism, random number generation and entanglement detection.</description>

      <title>Comparing Schemes for Creating Qudit Graph States from 16- &amp; 128-dimensional Hilbert Space using Donors in Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we compare two schemes for generating arbitrary qudit graph states using spin qudits in silicon. The first scheme proposes the creation of qudit linear graph states from a single emitter - a silicon spin qudit. By employing fusion - a destructive and non-deterministic measurement technique - these linear graphs can then be combined to form more complex resource states (multi-photon entangled states), such as ring or ladder structures, which are used to carry out the computation. The second scheme employs two spin qudits. Instead of relying on fusion, the two emitters are directly coupled via CZ to generate the same resource states, thereby eliminating the need for fusion. We compare the two schemes in terms of their ability to produce equivalent resource states and discuss their respective advantages and limitations for building scalable architectures.</description>

      <title>GCAMPS: A Scalable Classical Simulator for Qudit Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical simulations of quantum systems are notoriously difficult computational problems, with conventional state vector and tensor network methods restricted to quantum systems that feature only a small number of qudits. The recently introduced Clifford Augmented Matrix Product State (CAMPS) method offer scalability and efficiency by combining both tensor network and stabilizer simulation techniques and leveraging their complementary advantages. This hybrid simulation method has indeed demonstrated significant improvements in simulation performance for qubit circuits. Our work generalises the CAMPS method to higher quantum degrees of freedom -- qudit simulation, resulting in a generalised CAMPS (GCAMPS). Benchmarking this extended simulator on quantum systems with three degrees of freedom, i.e. qutrits, we show that similar to the case of qubits, qutrit systems also benefit from a comparable speedup using these techniques. Indeed, we see a greater improvement with qutrit simulation compared to qubit simulation on the same $T$-doped random Clifford benchmarking circuit as a result of the increased difficulty of conventional qutrit simulation using tensor networks. This extension allows for the classical simulation of problems that were previously intractable without access to a quantum device and will open new avenues to study complex many-body physics and to develop efficient methods for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Saturating the Quantum Cram\'er--Rao Bound in Prioritised Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement incompatibility is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. In the context of estimating multiple parameters of a quantum system, this manifests as a fundamental trade-off between the precisions with which different parameters can be estimated. Often, a parameter can be optimally measured, but at the cost of gaining no information about incompatible parameters. Here, we report that there are systems where one parameter's information can be maximised while not completely losing information about the other parameters. In doing so, we find attainable trade-off relations for quantum parameter estimation with a structure that is different to typical Heisenberg-type trade-offs. We demonstrate our findings by implementing an optimal entangling measurement on a Quantinuum trapped-ion quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of number entropy for free fermionic systems in presence of defects and stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of number entropy in a chain of free fermions subjected to both defects and stochastic processes. For a special class of defects, namely conformal defects, we present analytical and numerical results for the temporal growth of number entropy, the time evolution of the number distribution, and the eigenvalue profile of the associated correlation matrix within a subsystem. We show that the number entropy exhibits logarithmic growth in time, originating from the Gaussian structure of the number distribution. We find that the eigenvalue dynamics reveal a profound connection to the reflection and transmission coefficients of the associated scattering problem for a broad range of defects. When stochastic processes are introduced, specifically Stochastic Unitary Processes (SUP) and Quantum State Diffusion (QSD), the number entropy scales as $\ln(t)$ in the SUP case and shows strong hints of $\ln [\ln(t)]$ scaling in the QSD case. These findings establish compelling evidence that number entropy grows logarithmically slower than the corresponding von Neumann entanglement entropy across a wide class of systems.</description>

      <title>ReQISC: A Reconfigurable Quantum Computer Microarchitecture and Compiler Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of current quantum hardware is severely limited. While expanding the quantum ISA with high-fidelity, expressive basis gates is a key path forward, it imposes significant gate calibration overhead and complicates compiler optimization. As a result, even though more powerful ISAs have been designed, their use remains largely conceptual rather than practical.
  To move beyond these hurdles, we introduce the concept of "reconfigurable quantum instruction set computers" (ReQISC), which incorporates: (1) a unified microarchitecture capable of directly implementing arbitrary 2Q gates equivalently, i.e., SU(4) modulo 1Q rotations, with theoretically optimal gate durations given any 2Q coupling Hamiltonians; (2) a compilation framework tailored to ReQISC primitives for end-to-end synthesis and optimization, comprising a program-aware pass that refines high-level representations, a program-agnostic pass for aggressive circuit-level optimization, and an SU(4)-aware routing pass that minimizes hardware mapping overhead.
  We detail the hardware implementation to demonstrate the feasibility, in terms of both pulse control and calibration of this superior gate scheme on realistic hardware. By leveraging the expressivity of SU(4) and the time minimality realized by the underlying microarchitecture, the SU(4)-based ISA achieves remarkable performance, with a 4.97-fold reduction in average pulse duration to implement arbitrary 2Q gates, compared to the usual CNOT/CZ scheme on mainstream flux-tunable transmons. Supported by the end-to-end compiler, ReQISC outperforms the conventional CNOT-ISA, SOTA compiler, and pulse implementation counterparts, in significantly reducing 2Q gate counts, circuit depth, pulse duration, qubit mapping overhead, and program fidelity losses. For the first time, ReQISC makes the theoretical benefits of continuous ISAs practically feasible.</description>

Moreover, the correlations relative to various channels including the von Neumann measurements, the unitary channels and the twirling channels are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Dense packing of the surface code: code deformation procedures and hook-error-avoiding gate scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface code is one of the leading quantum error correction codes for realizing large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). One major challenge in realizing surface-code-based FTQC is the extremely large number of qubits required. To mitigate this problem, fusing multiple codewords of the surface code into a densely packed configuration has been proposed. It is known that by using dense packing, the number of physical qubits required per logical qubit can be reduced to approximately three-fourths compared to simply placing surface-code patches side by side. Despite its potential, concrete deformation procedures and quantitative error-rate analyses have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we present a detailed code-deformation procedure that transforms multiple standard surface code patches into a densely packed, connected configuration, along with a conceptual microarchitecture to utilize this dense packing. We also propose a CNOT gate-scheduling for stabilizer measurement circuits that suppresses hook errors in the densely packed surface code. We performed circuit-level Monte Carlo noise simulation of densely packed surface codes using this gate scheduling. The numerical results demonstrate that as the code distance of the densely packed surface code increases and the physical error rate decreases, the logical error rate of the densely packed surface code becomes lower than that of the standard surface code. Furthermore, we find that only when employing hook-error-avoiding syndrome extraction can the densely packed surface code achieve a lower logical error rate than the standard surface code, while simultaneously reducing the space overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of which resources drive the advantages in quantum algorithms has long been a fundamental challenge. While entanglement and coherence are critical to many quantum algorithms, our results indicate that they do not fully explain the quantum advantage achieved by the Grover search algorithm. By introducing a generalized Grover search algorithm, we demonstrate that the success probability depends not only on the querying number of oracles but also on the coherence fraction, which quantifies the fidelity between an arbitrary initial quantum state and the equal superposition state. Additionally, we explore the role of the coherence fraction in the quantum minimization algorithm, which offers a framework for solving complex problems in quantum machine learning. These findings offer insights into the origins of quantum advantage and open pathways for the development of new quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Observation of Non-Hermitian Spectral Deformation in Complex Momentum Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open systems feature a variety of phenomena that arise from non-Hermitian physics. Recent theoretical studies have offered much insights into these phenomena through the non-Bloch band theory, though many of the theory's key features are experimentally elusive. For instance, the correspondence between complex momenta and non-Hermitian bands, while central to non-Bloch band theory, has so far defied direct experimental observation. Here we experimentally study the non-Hermitian spectral deformation in complex-momentum space, by implementing a non-Hermitian lattice with long-range couplings in the synthetic orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) dimension of photons inside a degenerate cavity. Encoding the complex momenta in the phase and amplitude modulations of the OAM modes, and devising a complex-momentum-resolved projective detection, we reconstruct the spectral deformation in momentum space, where the eigenspectrum on the complex plane morphs through distinct geometries. This enables us to experimentally extract key information of the system under the non-Bloch band theory, including exceptional points in the complex-momentum space, the open-boundary spectra, and the generalized Brillouin zone. Our work demonstrates a versatile platform for exploring non-Hermitian physics and non-Bloch band theory, and opens the avenue for direct experimental investigation of non-Bloch features in the complex-momentum space.</description>

      <title>Static and dynamic coherence fraction in the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement and coherence are crucial resources in quantum information theory. In some scenarios, however, it is not necessary to directly estimate entanglement or coherence measures to quantify the capabilities of a state in quantum information processing. Instead, fully entangled fraction and coherence fraction are two alternatives for entanglement and coherence in specific quantum tasks. Here, we establish a link between the coherence fraction and the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, which has several potential applications including cryptography and database search. We show that the success probability of the generalized Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm depends only on the coherence fraction of the initial state rather than its entanglement or coherence. Moreover, we discuss the coherence fraction dynamics and establish a relation between the operator's coherence fraction and the algorithm's success probability.

      <title>Decoding Quantum Search Advantage: The Critical Role of State Properties in Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms have demonstrated provable speedups over classical counterparts, yet establishing a comprehensive theoretical framework to understand the quantum advantage remains a core challenge. In this work, we decode the quantum search advantage by investigating the critical role of quantum state properties in random-walk-based algorithms. We propose three distinct variants of quantum random-walk search algorithms and derive exact analytical expressions for their success probabilities. These probabilities are fundamentally determined by specific initial state properties: the coherence fraction governs the first algorithm's performance, while entanglement and coherence dominate the outcomes of the second and third algorithms, respectively. We show that increased coherence fraction enhances success probability, but greater entanglement and coherence reduce it in the latter two cases. These findings reveal fundamental insights into harnessing quantum properties for advantage and guide algorithm design. Our searches achieve Grover-like speedups and show significant potential for quantum-enhanced machine learning.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional Lie algebras in bosonic quantum dynamics: The single-mode case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study, classify, and explore the mathematical properties of finite-dimensional Lie algebras occurring in the quantum dynamics of single-mode and self-interacting bosonic systems. These Lie algebras are contained in the real skew-hermitian Weyl algebra $\hat{A}_1$, defined as the real subalgebra of the Weyl algebra $A_1$ consisting of all skew-hermitian polynomials. A central aspect of our analysis is the choice of basis for $\hat{A}_1$, which is composed of skew-symmetric combinations of two elements of the Weyl algebra called monomials, namely strings of creation and annihilation operators combined with their hermitian conjugate. Motivated by the quest for analytical solutions in quantum optimal control and dynamics, we aim at answering the following three fundamental questions: (i) What are the finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras in $\hat{A}_1$ generated by monomials alone? (ii)~What are the finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras in $\hat{A}_1$ that contain the free Hamiltonian? (iii) What are the non-abelian and finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras that can be faithfully realized in $\hat{A}_1$? We answer the first question by providing all possible realizations of all finite-dimensional non-abelian Lie algebras that are generated by monomials alone. We answer the second question by proving that any non-abelian and finite-dimensional subalgebra of $\hat{A}_1$ that contains a free Hamiltonian term must be a subalgebra of the Schr\"odinger algebra. We partially answer the third question by classifying all nilpotent and non-solvable Lie algebras that can be realized in $\hat{A}_1$, and comment on the remaining cases. Finally, we also discuss the implications of our results for quantum control theory. Our work constitutes an important stepping stone to understanding quantum dynamics of bosonic systems in full generality.</description>

      <title>Achieving fast and robust perfect entangling gates via reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers hold the promise of tackling complex and otherwise intractable computational challenges through the massive parallelism offered by qubits. Central to realizing the potential of quantum computing are perfect entangling (PE) two-qubit gates, which serve as a critical building block for universal quantum computation. In the context of quantum optimal control, shaping electromagnetic pulses to drive quantum gates is crucial for pushing gate performance toward theoretical limits. In this work, we leverage reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to discover near-optimal pulse shapes that yield PE gates. A collection of RL agents is trained within robust simulation environments, enabling the identification of effective control strategies even under noisy conditions. Selected agents are then validated on higher-fidelity simulations, illustrating how RL-based methods can reduce calibration overhead when compared to quantum optimal control techniques. Furthermore, the RL approach is hardware agnostic with the potential for broad applicability across various quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Sample-efficient quantum error mitigation via classical learning surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of practical quantum utility on near-term quantum processors is critically challenged by their inherent noise. Quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques are leading solutions to improve computation fidelity with relatively low qubit-overhead, while full-scale quantum error correction remains a distant goal. However, QEM techniques incur substantial measurement overheads, especially when applied to families of quantum circuits parameterized by classical inputs. Focusing on zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), a widely adopted QEM technique, here we devise the surrogate-enabled ZNE (S-ZNE), which leverages classical learning surrogates to perform ZNE entirely on the classical side. Unlike conventional ZNE, whose measurement cost scales linearly with the number of circuits, S-ZNE requires only constant measurement overhead for an entire family of quantum circuits, offering superior scalability. Theoretical analysis indicates that S-ZNE achieves accuracy comparable to conventional ZNE in many practical scenarios, and numerical experiments on up to 100-qubit ground-state energy and quantum metrology tasks confirm its effectiveness. Our approach provides a template that can be effectively extended to other quantum error mitigation protocols, opening a promising path toward scalable error mitigation.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances on Nonadiabatic Geometric Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric phase stands as a foundational concept in quantum physics, revealing deep connections between geometric structures and quantum dynamical evolution. Unlike dynamical phases, geometric phases exhibit intrinsic resilience to certain types of perturbation, making them particularly valuable for quantum information processing, where maintaining coherent quantum operations is essential. This article provides a review of geometric phases in the context of universal quantum gate construction, i.e., the geometric quantum computation (GQC), with special attention to recent progress in nonadiabatic implementations that enhance gate fidelity and/or operational robustness. We first review a unified theoretical framework that can encompass all existing nonadiabatic GQC approaches, then systematically examine the design principles of nonadiabatic geometric gates with a particular focus on how optimal control techniques can be leveraged to improve the accuracy and noise resistance. In addition, we conducted detailed numerical comparisons of various nonadiabatic GQC protocols, offering a quantitative assessment of their respective performance characteristics and practical limitations. Through this focused investigation, our aim is to provide researchers with both fundamental insights and practical guidance for advancing geometric approaches in quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Biphoton state generation and engineering with bright hybrid III-V/Silicon photonic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid photonic circuits, harnessing the complementary strengths of multiple materials, represent a key resource to enable compact, scalable platforms for quantum technologies. In particular, the availability of bright sources of tunable biphoton states is eagerly awaited to meet the variety of applications currently under development. In this work we demonstrate a heterogeneously integrated device that merges biphoton generation and on-chip quantum state engineering, combining an AlGaAs photon-pair source with a CMOS-compatible silicon-on-insulator (SOI) circuit. Photon pairs are generated in the C telecom band via spontaneous parametric down-conversion and transferred to the SOI chip through a multimode evanescent coupling scheme. This design achieves a pair generation rate above 10$^{6}$ s$^{-1}$mW$^{-1}$ and a coincidence-to-accidental ratio up to 600. Crucially, the coupling design induces strong and predictable transformations of the biphoton joint spectral amplitude, enabling complex quantum state engineering entirely on-chip in a compact device compliant with electrical pumping.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Enhanced Driven-Dissipative Quantum Batteries in Waveguide-QED Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum batteries (QBs), acting as energy storage devices, have potential applications in future quantum science and technology. However, the QBs inevitably losses energy due to their interaction with environment. How to enhance the performance of the QBs in the open-system case remains an important challenge. Here we propose a scheme to realize the driven-dissipative QBs in atom-waveguide-QED systems and demonstrate significant improvements in both the stored energy and extractable work (ergotropy) of the QBs via feedback control. For a single-atom QB, we show that combining the measurement and coherent feedback controls enables nearly perfect stable charging under the weak coherent driving. For the QB array, the measurement-based feedback allows us to control different dynamical phases in the thermodynamic limit: (i) a continuous boundary time-crystal phase, where persistent periodic energy charge-discharge oscillations emerge despite the presence of the dissipation into the waveguide, and (ii) two stationary phases -- one reaches full charge while the other maintains only small energy storage. This work broadens the scope of driven-dissipative QBs and provides practical strategies for enhancing their performance.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Approach to Finite-Bath Open Quantum Systems: Exact Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we develop the exact dynamics of the central spin model, modeling a finite-bath open quantum system. Particularly, two different types of interactions are investigated between the system and the bath: Heisenberg interaction with constant interaction strength, and a stochastic time-dependent interaction. In the former case, a new quantum channel is characterized, while the latter elucidates the microscopic understanding of a very well-known non-Markovian quantum channel. Exact master equations are provided in both scenarios. This is achieved by developing a new technique for obtaining a master equation from the map, making use of the concept of a minimal dissipator. This paves the way for a foundational understanding of finite-bath open quantum systems and a number of novel applications in the vast domain of quantum physics, one of which, implemented here, is in quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic time dilation implies that an accelerating excited atom would have its lifetime prolonged in the lab frame. In this paper, we demonstrate a complementary effect: Longer-lived excited atoms turn out to have been accelerated. We propose the following experiment. An excited atom is prepared in a superposition of momenta. Due to relativistic time dilation, in the lab frame, the decay rate of components with higher momentum is diminished. As time passes without the atom emitting a photon, higher-momentum components become more probable. This results in a time-dependent shift of the expectation value of momentum. Taking into account first-order relativistic corrections, we calculate the force and acceleration undergone by the atom due to the fact that it did not emit a photon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate optimal metrological protocols for phase estimation in the presence of correlated dephasing noise, including spin-squeezed states sensing strategies as well as parallel and adaptive protocols optimized using tensor-network based numerical methods. The results are benchmarked against fundamental bounds obtained either via a latest quantum comb extension method or an optimized classical simulation method. We find that the spin-squeezed offer practically optimal performance in the regime where phase fluctuations are positively correlated, but can be outperformed by tensor-network optimized strategies for negatively correlated fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Matrix-product state skeletons in Onsager-integrable quantum chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix-product state (MPS) skeletons are connected networks of Hamiltonians with exact MPS ground states that underlie a phase diagram. Such skeletons have previously been found in classes of free-fermion models. For the translation-invariant BDI and AIII free-fermion classes, it has been shown that the underlying skeleton is dense, giving an analytic approach to MPS approximation of ground states anywhere in the class. In this paper, we partially expose the skeleton in certain interacting spin chains: the $N$-state Onsager-integrable chiral clock families. We construct MPS that form a dense MPS skeleton in the gapped regions surrounding a sequence of fixed-point Hamiltonians (the generators of the Onsager algebra). Outside these gapped regions, these MPS remain eigenstates, but no longer give the many-body ground state. Rather, they are ground states in particular sectors of the spectrum. Our methods also allow us to find further MPS eigenstates; these correspond to low-lying excited states within the aforementioned gapped regions. This set of MPS excited states goes beyond the previous analysis of ground states on the $N=2$ free-fermion MPS skeleton. As an application of our results, we find a closed form for the disorder parameter in a family of interacting models. Finally, we remark that many of our results use only the Onsager algebra and are not specific to the chiral clock model representation.</description>

      <title>A Classical-Quantum Hybrid Architecture for Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Quantum-Classical Hybrid Physics-Informed Neural Network with Multiplicative and Additive Couplings (QPINN-MAC): a novel hybrid architecture that integrates the framework of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with that of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs). Specifically, we prove that through strategic couplings between classical and quantum components, the QPINN-MAC retains the universal approximation property, ensuring its theoretical capacity to represent complex solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Simultaneously, we demonstrate that the hybrid QPINN-MAC architecture actively mitigates the barren plateau problem, regions in parameter space where cost-function gradients decay exponentially with circuit depth, a fundamental obstacle in QNNs that hinders optimization during training. Furthermore, we prove that these couplings prevent gradient collapse, ensuring trainability even in high-dimensional regimes. Thus, our results establish a new pathway for constructing quantum-classical hybrid models with theoretical convergence guarantees, which are essential for the practical application of QPINNs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spin precessing in a magnetic field is often used as a quantum clock, for example in tunneling-time measurements. We show that such a clock can exist in a coherent superposition of opposite temporal orientations, treating the arrow of time as a quantum two-level system. A Mach-Zehnder interferometer with equal and opposite magnetic fields provides a simple implementation, enabling interference between forward and backward evolution and Bell-type tests of temporal coherence. Extending the framework to relativistic dynamics reveals that the Dirac Hamiltonian describes an intrinsic coupling between a spin qubit and a time qubit, with matter and antimatter corresponding to opposite poles on the temporal Bloch sphere.</description>

      <title>Bridging the daemonic gap en route to charge multi-mode batteries via a single auxiliary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that harnessing daemonic advantage is possible while charging a quantum battery by first time-evolving the battery collectively with an auxiliary charger, followed by an energy extraction via tracing out the charger. We define the difference between the minimum daemonic ergotropy and the maximum ergotropy of the battery as the daemonic gap at the time where the ergotropy of the battery is maximum. Considering a harmonic mode as the battery and a qubit as the auxiliary charger interacting via Jaynes-Cummings interaction, we show that the daemonic gap can be closed for specific initial passive states of the battery, including the ground state, truncated mixtures of low-lying states, and canonical thermal states. We further define the daemonic band as the difference between the maximum and the minimum daemonic ergotropy, and show that starting from the ground state of the single-mode battery, the daemonic band collapses. We also show that achieving a complete charging, along with accessing the full daemonic band, is possible for the single-mode battery using all of the other initial states by repeating the charging cycle and maximizing ergotropy in every round. We extend the battery-charger design to a multi-mode resonator battery and a qudit charger, and demonstrate, for a double-mode battery and a qutrit charger, that repeating the charging cycle is vital for simultaneously charging individual modes of the collective battery.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that a quantum walk in an ordered medium exhibits ballistic propagation. A related process is the driven quantum walk, in which the number of walkers varies over time. In this work, we show that a driven quantum walk in an array of nonlinear waveguides does not propagate ballistically, but instead exhibits two distinct transport regimes: superballistic and superdiffusive. Moreover, we study the effects of off-diagonal and diagonal disorder. In addition to the observation of Anderson localization, both types of disorder lead to the disappearance of the superballistic regime.</description>

      <title>Efficient certification of intractable quantum states with few Pauli measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verification of quantum computations is crucial as experiments advance toward fault-tolerant quantum computing. Yet, no efficient protocol exists for certifying states generated in the Magic-State Injection model -- the foundation of several fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures. Here, we introduce an efficient protocol for certifying Clifford-enhanced Product States, a large class of quantum states obtained by applying an arbitrary Clifford circuit to a product of single-qubit, possibly magic, states. Our protocol only requires single-qubit Pauli measurements together with efficient classical post-processing, and has efficient sample complexity in both the independent (i.i.d.) and adversarial (non-i.i.d.) settings. This fills a key gap between Pauli-based certification schemes for stabilizer or (hyper)graph states and general protocols demanding non-Pauli measurements or classically intractable information about the target state. Our work provides the first efficient, Pauli-only certification protocol for the Magic-State Injection model, leading to practical verification of universal quantum computation under minimal experimental assumptions.</description>

      <title>Classical gravity cannot mediate entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Nature, 646, 813 (2025), Aziz and Howl claim that classical (unquantised) gravity produces entanglement. We show that their model does not produce entanglement. Even if the model produced entanglement, it would be mediated by the quantised matter interaction, and not gravity. Hence entanglement mediated by gravity remains an unambiguous witness of gravity's quantum features.</description>

      <title>Decoherence from universal tomographic measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decoherence phenomenon arising from an environmental monitoring of the state of a quantum system, as opposed to monitoring of a preferred observable, is worked out in detail using two equivalent formulations, namely, repeated applications of universal tomographic measurements using positive operator-valued measures, and its continuous time unravelling from the Lindblad equation. The effect of decoherence is analysed by studying the evolution of Stratonovich-Weyl quasiprobability distributions on the state-space of the system. It is shown that decoherence makes an arbitrary-given quasiprobability distribution manifestly positive, thus modelling the emergence of classicality in some sense. The decoherence timescale, the minimum time that quasiprobability distributions of every initial state of the system become nonnegative, is shown to decrease in Hilbert-space dimension, and hence larger quantum systems decohere faster.</description>

      <title>Extending QAOA-GPT to Higher-Order Quantum Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently proposed QAOA-GPT framework demonstrated that generative pre-trained transformers can learn mappings between problem graphs and optimized quantum circuits for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). In this work, we extend QAOA-GPT to Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) problems, focusing on spin-glass Hamiltonians that include cubic interaction terms. Using FEATHER graph embeddings to encode topological information, we train the model on graph-circuit pairs generated via ADAPT-QAOA and evaluate its performance on 8- and 16-qubit instances embedded on heavy-hex lattices. The generative model produces adaptive QAOA-like circuits and corresponding variational parameters in a single forward pass, bypassing the iterative classical optimization loop. The generated circuits achieve average approximation ratios exceeding 0.95, closely matching classically optimized ADAPT-QAOA results, while maintaining consistent parameter distributions across circuit depths. These results demonstrate that QAOA-GPT generalizes effectively to higher-order cost Hamiltonians and complex energy landscapes, establishing generative modeling as a scalable pathway toward autonomous variational circuit design and quantum algorithm discovery in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Loss Tomography for Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With steady progress in the development of quantum networks, the question on how to best provide end-to-end characterization of such networks (Quantum Network Tomography) is quickly becoming more pressing. Initial results demonstrated how we can utilize multipartite entanglement distribution to determine error probabilities of single-Pauli channels and depolarizing channels. In this work, we show how the analysis of quantum capacity regions can be used as a powerful new tool in quantum network tomography. As a first application of the proposed method, we demonstrate how we can characterize the loss on quantum channels in the network directly from quantum capacity region diagrams, even in the presence of bit-flip errors. Our results indicate that quantum capacity regions are not only valuable for network design, resource allocation, and protocol benchmarking, but also show promise for applications in quantum network tomography, particularly in loss tomography.</description>

      <title>Contemporary Perspectivism as a Framework of Scientific Inquiry in Quantum Mechanics and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary perspectivism is viewed as a framework of scientific inquiry concerning the origin, generation and systematization of scientific knowledge of nature by focusing on the conditions under which such knowledge may arise in perspectivist terms and investigating the essential ramifications of these conditions. To this end, we develop the conceptual, methodological and semantic framework of contemporary perspectivism according to the norms of the proposed endo-theoretic approach. Implementation of the preceding three-fold scheme in quantum mechanics implies that the global structure of a quantum algebra of events can be consistently comprehended through a multilevel structure of locally variable Boolean perspectives, interconnected in a category-theoretic environment, yielding jointly all the information encoded in the former. In this respect, the proposed approach validates the perspectivist/contextual nature of quantum mechanics at a fundamental level of discourse. Furthermore, due to its general character, it may acquire the form of a theoretical pattern of scientific inquiry in the natural sciences, especially when dealing with complex trans-perspectival phenomena, the analysis of which requires the use of information resulting from more than one perspective. Finally, in the appendix, we provide a concise comparative assessment between our perspectivist framework of quantum theory and Rovelli's relational interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Delay Time Characterization on FPGA: A Low Nonlinearity, Picosecond Resolution Time-to-Digital Converter on 16-nm FPGA using Bin Sequence Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) implemented on a 16 nm Xilinx UltraScale Plus FPGA that achieves a resolution of 1.15 ps, RMS precision of 3.38 ps, a differential nonlinearity (DNL) of [-0.43, 0.24] LSB, and an integral nonlinearity (INL) of [-2.67, 0.15] LSB. This work introduces two novel hardware-independent post-processing techniques - Partial Order Reconstruction (POR) and Iterative Time-bin Interleaving (ITI) - that significantly enhance the performance of FPGA-based TDCs. POR addresses the missing code problem by inferring the partial order of each time bin through code density test data and directed acyclic graph (DAG) analysis, enabling near-complete recovery of usable bins. ITI further improves fine time resolution by merging multiple calibrated tapped delay lines (TDLs) into a single unified delay chain, achieving scalable resolution without resorting to averaging. Compared to state-of-the-art FPGA-based TDC architectures, the proposed methods deliver competitive or superior performance with reduced hardware overhead. These techniques are broadly applicable to high-resolution time measurement and precise delay calibration in programmable logic platforms.</description>

      <title>Controlled generation of 3D vortices in driven atomic Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an ac-driven atomic Josephson junction as a clean and tunable source of three dimensional (3D) solitary waves in quantum fluids. Depending on the height of the junction barrier, the emitted excitations appear as vortex rings at low velocity or vorticity-free rarefaction pulses near the sound velocity, thus spanning the complete Jones-Roberts family of solitons. The Shapiro-step phenomenon renders the emission deterministic: on the first, second, third Shapiro steps, the junction ejects one, two, and three solitary excitations per drive cycle. This enables controlled generation of single- and multi-excitation configurations, allowing detailed studies of the full crossover between vortex rings and rarefaction pulses and their interaction dynamics. In particular, deterministic multi-ring emission provides insights into leapfrogging dynamics of two and three coaxial rings and their decay via boundary-assisted, sound-mediated processes. This ac-driven protocol establishes a compact and reproducible platform for generating, classifying, and controlling 3D solitonic excitations, paving the way for precision studies of nonlinear vortex dynamics, dissipation, and quantum turbulence in trapped superfluids.</description>

      <title>Quantum vortices in entanglement: a novel idea for large vortex filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a new approach to describing certain macroscopic objects
  that can arise in a quantum fluid. These objects are formed by means of quantum entanglement from the circular-shaped mesoscale and microscale vortices, and can be interpreted as a vortex filaments with any shape and size. The method is based on a quantization scheme for classical closed vortex filaments that was proposed by the author early \cite{Tal18,Tal22_1,Tal_Chaos25J}. The model we consider examines the instantaneous picture of the locations in space $\mathbb R_3$ of such filaments with a small, but non-zero, core diameter.
  Both energy and circulation of the studied filaments are calculated using the proposed approach. We demonstrate that the adopted concept leads to the emergence of secondary vortices around these investigated filament-like objects.
  We also study the specific mechanisms by which large vortex loops can disconnect and create the filament fragments . From our point of view, the proposed approach to describing vortex filaments within a vortex tangle can be seen as an important step toward understanding the appearance of quantum turbulence.</description>

      <title>Strain-Tunable Spin Filtering and Valley Splitting Coexisting with Anomalous Hall Effect in 2D Half-Metallic VSe2/VN Heterostructure: Toward a Unified Spintronic-Valleytronic Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid progress in valleytronics and spintronics is limited by the scarcity of two-dimensional materials that simultaneously provide robust valley splitting and strong spin selectivity. Here we showed that a van der Waals heterostructure (VSe2/VN) built from hexagonal VSe2 and hexagonal VN addressed this gap. Using first-principles density functional theory, phonon, ab initio molecular dynamics stability tests, Bader charge analysis, and Wannier-based Berry-curvature calculations, we demonstrated an energetically and dynamically stable heterostructure that exhibited interlayer charge transfer and a work function intermediate between the constituent monolayers. The electronic structure showed small indirect PBE gap (108.9 meV), with HSE06 indicating a half-metallic tendency; a sizable conduction-band valley splitting (\Delta CKK' = 22.9 meV for spin-up and \Delta CKK' = 61.3 meV for spin-down); and pronounced spin asymmetry, where the spin-down channel showed a wide semiconducting gap (0.64 eV) while the spin-up channel was nearly gapless. These features yielded a high zero-strain spin-filter efficiency P = 75.4%, tunable to 82.5% under +4% biaxial tensile strain. The heterostructure also supported non-zero, valley-contrasting Berry curvature, and a large anomalous Hall conductivity (peak sigmaxy = 568.33 S/cm). Importantly, mean-field estimation placed the ferromagnetic Curie temperature near room temperature at zero strain (Tc = 284.04 K), while Tc decreased to 183.9 K at +4% strain, the magnetic order remained robust to cryogenic temperatures, providing a beneficial tuning knob to balance spin-filter performance with thermal stability in device-relevant regimes. These results identified VSe2/VN as a practical, strain-tunable platform for integrated valleytronic, spintronic devices, and for exploring anomalous Hall and valley-dependent transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution with Fourier measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resolving sources beyond the diffraction limit is important in imaging, communications, and metrology. Current image-based methods of super-resolution require phase information (either of the source points or an added filter) and perfect alignment with the centroid of the object. Both inhibit the practical application of these methods, as uniform motion and/or relative jitter destroy their assumptions. Here, we show that measuring intensity in the Fourier plane enables super-resolution without any of the issues of image-based methods. We start with the shift-invariance of the Fourier transform and the observation that the two-point position problem ${x_1,x_2}$ in the near field corresponds to the single-point wavenumber problem $k\ =2\pi/(x_2-x_1)$ in the far field. We consider the full range of mutual coherence and show that for fully coherent sources, the Fourier method saturates the quantum limit, i.e. it gives the best possible measurement. Similar results hold for sub-Rayleigh constellations of N sources, which can act collectively as a spatially averaged metasurface and/or individually as elements of a phased-array antenna. The theory paves the way to merge Fourier optics with super-resolution techniques, enabling experimental devices that are both simpler and more robust than previous designs.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and structural properties of epitaxial Er-substituted yttrium iron garnet films grown by pulsed laser deposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Er-substituted yttrium iron garnet (Er:YIG) holds the potential of combining the low magnetic damping of YIG with the telecom-band optical transitions of $\text{Er}^{3+}$ ions, making it a suitable material for hybrid optomagnonic devices and microwave-to-optical quantum transduction. We report the epitaxial growth of $\text{Er}_{x}\text{Y}_{3-x}\text{Fe}_{5}\text{O}_{12}$ films with $x=0.008-0.20$ on (111)-oriented gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates using pulsed laser deposition. X-ray diffraction, reciprocal space mapping, and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirm single-phase, fully coherent growth with atomically sharp interfaces across the entire substitution range. Magnetometry reveals a gradual decrease in saturation magnetization with increasing Er content, consistent with antiparallel coupling between Er$^{3+}$ spins and the net Fe$^{3+}$ moments, along with the emergence of an in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. The ferromagnetic resonance broadens with Er concentration due to increased Gilbert damping and inhomogeneous linewidth broadening. Films with low Er content ($x=0.008$), most relevant for optomagnonic applications, retain nearly isotropic magnetization and exhibit a damping parameter only slightly higher than that of undoped YIG. These results identify growth and substitution conditions that preserve YIG's low-loss magnetic properties while introducing optical functionality, establishing Er:YIG as a viable platform for hybrid quantum magnonics and microwave-to-optical transduction.</description>

      <title>Metabolic quantum limit and holographic bound to the information capacity of magnetoencephalography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetoencephalography, the noninvasive measurement of magnetic fields produced by brain activity, utilizes quantum sensors like superconducting quantum interference devices or atomic magnetometers. Here we derive a fundamental, technology-independent bound on the information that such measurements can convey. Using the energy resolution limit of magnetic sensing together with the brain's metabolic power, we obtain a universal expression for the maximum information rate, which depends only on geometry, metabolism, and Planck's constant, and the numerical value of which is 2.6 Mbit/s. At the high bandwidth limit we arrive at a bound scaling linearly with the area of the current source boundary. We thus demonstrate a biophysical holographic bound for metabolically powered information conveyed by the magnetic field. For the geometry and metabolic power of the human brain the geometric bound is 6.6 Gbit/s.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Validation of Replica Symmetry Breaking via Quantum Annealing: From Ground States to Topological Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Giorgio Parisi's exact solution of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass, recognized with the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics, revealed revolutionary hierarchical organization in disordered systems, yet systematic validation has remained computationally intractable beyond $N \sim 100$ spins, and the topological limits of this complexity remain unexplored. Here we leverage quantum annealing to extend ground-state computations to 4000 spins and systematically probe both the emergence and breakdown of replica symmetry breaking. Three independent measurements validate core RSB predictions: ground-state energies converge to Parisi's value $E_\infty/N = -0.7633$ with predicted $N^{-2/3}$ finite-size corrections; chaos exponent $\theta = 0.51 \pm 0.02$ confirms mean-field square-root scaling ($R^2 = 0.989$); and state-space overlap distribution exhibits broad continuous structure ($\sigma_q = 0.19$) characteristic of hierarchical landscape organization. We then investigate RSB robustness by introducing controlled network dilution via the Blume-Capel model with vacancy formation. Remarkably, hierarchical complexity remains invariant under 36\% dilution, proving RSB is a topological property of network connectivity rather than spin density. Beyond a critical threshold in the range $0.8 &lt; D_c &lt; 0.9$, the hierarchy collapses discontinuously as the system undergoes complete conversion to the all-vacancy state within a narrow parameter window an abrupt avalanche-driven transition where independent-vacancy mean-field theory correctly predicts the energy scale but fails to capture the cooperative dynamics. This comprehensive validation across thermodynamics, universality, landscape geometry, and topological limits establishes quantum advantage for probing fundamental statistical mechanics in complex systems relevant to neural networks, optimization, and materials science.</description>

      <title>Metamagnetic Transition in Low-Dimensional Site-Decorated Quantum Heisenberg Ferrimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prohibition of finite-temperature phase transition in one-dimensional (1D) Ising models and 1D/2D quantum Heisenberg models with short-range interactions fundamentally constrains the application potentials of low-dimensional magnetic materials. Recently, ultranarrow phase crossover (UNPC), which can approach a transition at a desirable finite temperature $T_0$ arbitrarily closely, was discovered in 1D decorated Ising chains and ladders. Here we present a theoretical study of similarly decorated, yet much more challenging, quantum Heisenberg ferrimagnets in a magnetic field, which features ferromagnetic backbone exchange $J$, antiferromagnetic site-decoration coupling $J_{AF}$, and different magnetic moments for the backbone and decorating spins $\mu_aS_a&lt;\mu_bS_b$. We exactly solved the model in the large $J$ limit -- as a central-macrospin model -- and found two finite-temperature second-order transitions; just above $T_{c2}$ a ``half-ice, half-fire'' regime appears. Finite-$J$ weak-field results follow from an effective-field mapping, suggesting the emergence of UNPC at finite $T_0$ in 2D square lattices thanks to its exponentially strong initial magnetic susceptibility $\chi_0\propto e^{4\pi S_a^2 J/T_0}$, though less likely in 1D chains where $\chi_0\propto J/T_0$. These results may shed light on new technological applications of low-dimensional quantum spin systems and attract experimental and computational tests.</description>

      <title>Resonating valence bond pairing energy in graphene by quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the resonating-valence-bond (RVB) state in graphene using real-space quantum Monte Carlo with correlated variational wave functions. Variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations with Jastrow-Slater-determinant and Jastrow-antisymmetrized-geminal-power ansatze are employed to evaluate the RVB pairing energy. Using a rectangular graphene sample that lacks $\pi/3$ rotational symmetry, we found that the single-particle energy gap near the Fermi level depends on the system size along the $x$-direction. The gap vanishes when the length satisfies $L_x=3n\sqrt{3}d$, where $n$ is an integer and $d$ is the carbon-carbon bond length, otherwise, the system, exhibits a finite gap. Our DMC results show no stable RVB pairing in the zero-gap case, whereas the opening of a finite gap near the Fermi level stabilizes the electron pairing. The DMC predicted absolute value of pairing energy at the thermodynamic limit for a finite-gap system is $\sim 0.48(1)$ mHa/atom. Our results reveal a feometry-driven electron pairing mechanism in the confined graphene nanostructure.</description>

      <title>A passive atomtronics filter for Fermi gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design an atomtronic filter device that spatially separates the components of a two-component Fermi gas with repulsive contact interactions in a two-dimensional geometry. With the aid of density--potential functional theory (DPFT), which can accurately simulate Fermi gases in realistic settings, we propose and characterize a barbell-shaped trapping potential, where a bridge-shaped potential connects two ring-shaped potentials. In the strongly repulsive regime, each of the ring traps eventually stores one of the fermion species. Our simulations are a guide to designing component filters for initially mixed, weakly repulsive spin components. We demonstrate that the functioning of this barbell design is robust against variations in experimental settings, for example, across particle numbers, for small deformations of the trap geometry, or if interatomic interactions differ from the bare contact repulsion. Our investigation marks the first step in establishing DPFT as a comprehensive simulation framework for fermionic atomtronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a transport phenomenon in certain coined quantum walks where a subspace of states localized at a vertex gets transferred to another vertex. We first develop characterizations for perfect and pretty good subspace state transfer using the spectral properties of a Hermitian weighted digraph obtained from the underlying graph. We then provide a polynomial-time algorithm that tests whether perfect pointwise subspace state transfer occurs at an integer step, given that the subspace and coins are rational. Finally, we construct several infinite families of examples that admit perfect pointwise $d$-dimensional subspace state transfer where $d\ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Rejection of wavefront aberrations in an atomic gradiometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main residual limitations of inertial sensors based on atom interferometry stems from laser beam distortions, which cause parasitic phase shifts and non-homogeneous matter-light couplings. Here we present numerical simulations, accompanied by analytical calculations, which quantify the impact of these effects in a cold atom gradiometer. We demonstrate that the propagation of interferometric laser beam aberrations, combined with initial asymmetry and significant time-of-flight expansion of the the two atomic sources, limit the common-mode rejection of phase noise in a differential configuration. The resulting deviations in gravitational acceleration and its gradient are within reach of current experimental devices. Our study allows us to evaluate the surface quality requirements for retroreflective optics in cold-atom gradiometers of various baselines, and can be extended to other sensors based on different interferometer geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-sustained oscillators play a central role in the stabilization and synchronization of complex dynamical systems. A number of different physical systems are currently being investigated to clarify the importance of such active components in the quantum realm. Here we explore the properties of a driven dissipative electron-photon hybrid system based on superconducting microwave resonators coupled resonantly to a voltage-biased double quantum dot (DQD). First, we establish a Hopf bifurcation at a critical value of the electron-photon coupling, beyond which an effective negative friction sustains steady limit-cycle oscillations of individual resonators. Second, we show that two such limit-cycle resonators coupled via the same voltage-biased DQD synchronize for small enough frequency detuning. A nonlinear photon Keldysh action is derived by perturbation theory in the effective circuit fine-structure constant, and the limit-cycle dynamics is analyzed in terms of resulting saddle-point, and Fokker-Planck equations. In the Markovian limit of infinite bias voltage, these results are shown to agree well with the solution of a corresponding Lindblad master equation for the DQD resonator system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the planar Dirac equation with the most general time-independent contact (singular) potential supported on a circumference. Taking advantage of the radial symmetry, the problem is effectively reduced to a one-dimensional one (the radial), and the contact potential is addressed in a mathematically rigorous way using a distributional approach that was originally developed to treat point interactions in one dimension, providing a physical interpretation for the interaction parameters. The most general contact interaction for this system is obtained in terms of four physical parameters: the strengths of a scalar and the three components of a singular Lorentz vector potential supported on the circumference. We then investigate the bound and scattering solutions for several choices of the physical parameters, and analyze the confinement properties of the corresponding potentials.</description>

      <title>Direct imaging of magnetotransport at graphene-metal interfaces with a single-spin quantum sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetotransport underlines many important phenomena in condensed matter physics, such as the Hall effect and magnetoresistance (MR) effect. Thus far, most magnetotransport studies are based on bulk resistance measurements without direct access to microscopic details of the spatial transport pattern. Here, we report nanoscale imaging of magnetotransport using a scanning single-spin quantum magnetometer, which is demonstrated in a graphene-metal hybrid device at room temperature. By visualizing the current flow at elevated magnetic fields (~0.5 T), we directly observe the Lorentz deflection of current near the graphene-metal interface, which is a hallmark of magnetotransport. Combining the local current distribution with global resistance measurements, we reveal that transport properties of the hybrid are governed by a complex interplay of intrinsic MR around the Dirac cone, carrier hydrodynamics, interface resistance, and the nanoscale device geometry. Furthermore, accessing the local transport pattern across the interface enables quantitative mapping of spatial variations in contact resistance, which is commonly present in electronic devices made from two-dimensional materials yet non-trivial to characterize. Our work demonstrates the potential of nanoscale current imaging techniques for studying complex electronic transport phenomena that are difficult to probe by resistance-based measurements.</description>

      <title>A Graphical Calculus for Quantum Computing with Multiple Qudits using Generalized Clifford Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.16081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a graphical calculus for multi-qudit computations with generalized Clifford algebras, building off the algebraic framework developed in our prior work. We build our graphical calculus out of a fixed set of graphical primitives defined by algebraic expressions constructed out of elements of a given generalized Clifford algebra, a graphical primitive corresponding to the ground state, and also graphical primitives corresponding to projections onto the ground state of each qudit. We establish many properties of the graphical calculus using purely algebraic methods, including a novel algebraic proof of a Yang-Baxter equation and a construction of a corresponding braid group representation. Our algebraic proof, which applies to arbitrary qudit dimension, also enables a resolution of an open problem of Cobanera and Ortiz on the construction of self-dual braid group representations for even qudit dimension. We also derive several new identities for the braid elements, which are key to our proofs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in many cases, the verification of involved vector identities can be reduced to the combinatorial application of two basic vector identities. Additionally, in terms of quantum computation, we demonstrate that it is feasible to envision implementing the braid operators for quantum computation, by showing that they are 2-local operators. In fact, these braid elements are almost Clifford gates, for they normalize the generalized Pauli group up to an extra factor $\zeta$, which is an appropriate square root of a primitive root of unity.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) are respectively the state-of-the-art quantum and classical computing methods for understanding many-body quantum systems. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that integrates these two methods, inheriting their distinct features in efficient representation and manipulation of quantum states and overcoming their limitations. We first introduce non-stoquasticity indicators (NSIs) and their upper bounds, which measure the sign problem, the most notable limitation of QMC. We show that our algorithm could greatly mitigate the sign problem, which decreases NSIs with the assistance of quantum computing. Meanwhile, the use of quantum Monte Carlo also increases the expressivity of shallow quantum circuits, allowing more accurate computation that is conventionally achievable only with much deeper circuits. We numerically test and verify the method for the N$_2$ molecule (12 qubits) and the Hubbard model (16 qubits). Our work paves the way to solving practical problems with intermediate-scale and early-fault tolerant quantum computers, with potential applications in chemistry, condensed matter physics, materials, high energy physics, etc.</description>

Abstract: The spectral variant of the quantum marginal problem asks: Given prescribed spectra for a set of overlapping quantum marginals, does there exist a compatible joint state? The main idea of this work is a symmetry-reduced semidefinite programming hierarchy that detects when no such joint state exists. The hierarchy is complete, in the sense that it detects every incompatible set of spectra. The refutations it provides are dimension-free, certifying incompatibility in all local dimensions. The hierarchy also applies to the sums of Hermitian matrices problem, the compatibility of local unitary invariants, for certifying vanishing Kronecker coefficients, and to optimize over equivariant state polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01465v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random ensembles of pure states have proven to be extremely important in various aspects of quantum physics such as benchmarking the performance of quantum circuits, testing for quantum advantage, providing novel insights for many-body thermalization and studying the black hole information paradox. Although generating a fully random ensemble is experimentally challenging, approximations of it are just as useful and are known to emerge naturally in a variety of physical models, including Rydberg setups. These are referred to as approximate quantum state designs, and verifying their degree of randomness can be an expensive task, similar to performing full quantum state tomography on many-body systems. In this theoretical work, we efficiently validate the character of approximate quantum designs with respect to data size acquisition when compared to the conventional frequentist approach. This is achieved by translating the information residing in the complex many-body state into a succinct representation of classical data using a random projective measurement basis, which is then processed using methods of statistical inference such as maximum likelihood estimation and neural networks and benchmarked against the predictions of shadow tomography. Our scheme of combining machine learning methods for postprocessing the data obtained from randomized measurements for efficient characterisation of (approximate) quantum state k designs is applicable to any noisy quantum platform that can generate quantum designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum random-access memory (QRAM) is a mechanism to access data (quantum or classical) based on addresses which are themselves a quantum state. QRAM has a long and controversial history, and here we survey and expand arguments and constructions for and against.
  We use two primary categories of QRAM from the literature: (1) active, which requires external intervention and control for each QRAM query (e.g. the error-corrected circuit model), and (2) passive, which requires no external input or energy once the query is initiated. In the active model, there is a powerful opportunity cost argument: in many applications, one could repurpose the control hardware for the qubits in the QRAM (or the qubits themselves) to run an extremely parallel classical algorithm to achieve the same results just as fast. We apply these arguments in detail to quantum linear algebra and prove that most asymptotic quantum advantage disappears with active QRAM systems, with some nuance related to the architectural assumptions.
  Escaping the constraints of active QRAM requires ballistic computation with passive memory, which creates an array of dubious physical assumptions, which we examine in detail. Considering these details, in everything we could find, all non-circuit QRAM proposals fall short in one aspect or another.
  In summary, we conclude that cheap, asymptotically scalable passive QRAM is unlikely with existing proposals, due to fundamental obstacles that we highlight. These obstacles are deeply rooted in the requirements of QRAM, but are not provably inevitable; we hope that our results will help guide research into QRAM technologies that circumvent or mitigate these obstacles. Finally, circuit-based QRAM still helps in many applications, and so we additionally provide a survey of state-of-the-art techniques as a resource for algorithm designers using QRAM.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Entanglement Distribution in Quantum Networks using Subgraph Complementations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13700v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum networks are important for quantum communication, enabling tasks such as quantum teleportation, quantum key distribution, quantum sensing, and quantum error correction, often utilizing graph states, a specific class of multipartite entangled states that can be represented by graphs. We propose a novel approach for distributing graph states across a quantum network. We show that the distribution of graph states can be characterized by a system of subgraph complementations, which we also relate to the minimum rank of the underlying graph and the degree of entanglement quantified by the Schmidt-rank of the quantum state. We analyze resource usage for our algorithm and show that it improves on the number of qubits, bits for classical communication, and EPR pairs utilized, as compared to prior work. In fact, the number of local operations and resource consumption for our approach scales linearly in the number of vertices. This produces a quadratic improvement in completion time for several classes of graph states represented by dense graphs, which translates into an exponential improvement by allowing parallelization of gate operations. This leads to improved fidelities in the presence of noisy operations, as we show through simulation in the presence of noisy operations. We classify common classes of graph states, along with their optimal distribution time using subgraph complementations. We find a sequence of subgraph complementation operations to distribute an arbitrary graph state which we conjecture is close to the optimal sequence, and establish upper bounds on distribution time along with providing approximate greedy algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Consider an open quantum system with (discrete-time) Markovian dynamics. Our task is to store information in the system in such a way that it can be retrieved perfectly, even after the system is left to evolve for an arbitrarily long time. We show that this is impossible for classical (resp. quantum) information precisely when the dynamics is mixing (resp. asymptotically entanglement breaking). Furthermore, we provide tight universal upper bounds on the minimum time after which any such dynamics 'scrambles' the encoded information beyond the point of perfect retrieval. On the other hand, for dynamics that are not of this kind, we show that information must be encoded inside the peripheral space associated with the dynamics in order for it to be perfectly recoverable at any time in the future. This allows us to derive explicit formulas for the maximum amount of information that can be protected from noise in terms of the structure of the peripheral space of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Topologically protected negative entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03259v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy encodes fundamental characteristics of quantum many-body systems, and is particularly subtle in non-Hermitian settings where eigenstates generically become non-orthogonal. In this work, we find that negative biorthogonal entanglement generically arises from topologically protected non-orthogonal edge states in free fermion systems, especially for flat-band edge states. Departing from previous literature which associated negative entanglement with exceptional gapless points, we show that robustly negative entanglement can still occur in gapped systems.
  Gapless 2D flat-band edge states, however, exhibit novel $S_A\sim -\frac{1}{2}L_y^2\log L$ entanglement behavior which scales quadratically with the transverse dimension $L_y$, independent of system parameters. This dramatically negative scaling can be traced to a new mechanism known as non-Hermitian critical skin compression (nHCSC), where topological and skin localization in one direction produces a hierarchy of extensively many probability non-conserving entanglement eigenstates across a cut in another direction. Our discovery sheds light on new avenues where topology interplays with criticality and non-Hermitian localization, unrelated to traditional notions of topological entanglement entropy. This topologically protected negative entanglement also manifests in the second R\'enyi entropy, which can be measured through SWAP operator expectation values.</description>

      <title>Cauchy-Schwarz and Bell Inequality Violations in Coupled Optomechanical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Destructive interference-based photon-phonon antibunching can lead to violations of classical inequalities in optomechanical cavity systems. In this paper, we explore the violation of the classical Cauchy-Schwarz inequality by examining second-order auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions, as well as Bell's nonlocality, to analyze the quantum correlations of single photon-phonon excitations when the system is driven by two weak probe fields. We propose that the violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality can serve as an indicator for the stronger nonclassical tests associated with Bell's theorem. Our system reveals strong quantum correlations of photon-phonon pairs with distinctive antidiagonal patterns of photon filtering. For numerical analysis, we consider a weak effective optomechanical coupling strength and various optical-to-mechanical field amplitude ratios that enable unconventional photon (phonon) blockades at resonance. The findings are significant for producing sub-Poissonian signals under optimal conditions and have potential applications in hybrid systems for generating on-demand single photon-phonon pairs.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) harnesses quantum systems to tackle intricate computational problems with exceptional efficiency and minimized energy usage. This paper presents a QRC framework that utilizes a minimalistic quantum reservoir, consisting of only a few two-level atoms within an optical cavity. The system is inherently scalable, as newly added atoms automatically couple with the existing ones through the shared cavity field. We demonstrate that the quantum reservoir outperforms traditional classical reservoir computing in both memory retention and nonlinear data processing through two tasks, namely the prediction of time-series data using the Mackey-Glass task and the classification of sine-square waveforms. Our results show significant performance improvements with an increasing number of atoms, facilitated by non-destructive, continuous quantum measurements and polynomial regression techniques. These findings confirm the potential of QRC as a practical and efficient solution to addressing complex computational challenges in quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Activation of post-quantum steering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10570v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are possible physical theories that give greater violations of Bell's inequalities than the corresponding Tsirelson bound, termed post-quantum non-locality. Such theories do not violate special relativity, but could give an advantage in certain information processing tasks. There is another way in which entangled quantum states exhibit non-classical phenomena, with one notable example being Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering; a violation of a bipartite Bell inequality implies EPR steering, but the converse is not necessarily true. The study of post-quantum EPR steering is more intricate, but it has been shown that it does not always imply post-quantum non-locality in a conventional Bell test. In this work we show how to distribute resources in a larger network that individually do not demonstrate post-quantum non-locality but violate a Tsirelson bound for the network. That is, we show how to activate post-quantum steering so that it can now be witnessed as post-quantum correlations in a Bell scenario. One element of our work that may be of independent interest is we show how to self-test a bipartite quantum assemblage in a network, even assuming post-quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Coherent Control of Photon Correlations in Trapped Ion Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the spontaneous emission from independent emitters provides spatially uncorrelated photons - a typical manifestation of quantum randomness, the interference of the coherent scattering leads to a well-defined intensity pattern - a feature described by linear optics. We here demonstrate experimentally how the interplay between the two mechanisms in large systems of quantum emitters leads to spatial variations of photon correlations. The implementation with trapped ion crystals in free space allows us to observe the anti-correlation between photon rates and variance of the photon number distributions in chains of up to 18 ions. For smaller crystals of four ions, the transition from a sub-Poissonian to a super-Poissonian variance of the photon number in the scattered light is reported. For higher numbers of scatterers, the photon statistics still display a strong deviation from the fully incoherent scattering case. Our results illustrate how the interference of coherent scattering, combined with spontaneous emission, provides a control mechanism for the light statistics.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for bidirectional teleportation of a single qubit using quantum walks on two independent one dimensional lattices and two independent cycles with four vertices, employing nearest neighbor jumps with coin outcomes. In addition, we discuss two different methods for two qubit teleportation by employing nearest neighbor jumps and next nearest neighbor jumps with a single coin and two coins, respectively. Finally, we show that the two qubit single jump quantum walk and the two jump quantum walk teleportation schemes yield the same results.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) leverages quantum systems to perform complex computational tasks with exceptional efficiency and reduced energy consumption. We introduce a minimalistic QRC framework utilizing as few as five atoms in a single-mode optical cavity, combined with continuous quantum measurement. The system is conveniently scalable, as newly added atoms naturally couple with existing ones via the shared cavity field. To achieve high computational expressivity with a minimal reservoir, we include two critical elements: reservoir feedback and polynomial regression. Reservoir feedback modifies the reservoir's dynamics without altering its internal quantum hardware, while polynomial regression nonlinearly enhances output resolution. We demonstrate significant QRC performance in memory retention and nonlinear data processing through two tasks: predicting chaotic time-series data via the Mackey-Glass task and classifying sine-square waveforms. This framework fulfills QRC's objectives to minimize hardware size and energy consumption, marking a significant advancement in integrating quantum physics with machine learning technology.</description>

Abstract: The quantum uncertainty principle stands as a cornerstone and a distinctive feature of quantum mechanics, setting it apart from classical mechanics. We introduce a tripartite quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relation, and extend the relation to encompass multiple measurements conducted within multipartite systems. The related lower bounds are shown to be tighter than those formulated by Zhang et al. [Phys. Rev. A 108, 012211 (2023)]. Additionally, we present generalized quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relations (QMA-EURs) tailored for arbitrary positive-operator-valued measures (POVMs). Finally, we demonstrate the applications of our results to both the relative entropy of unilateral coherence and the quantum key distribution protocols.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant syndrome extraction in [[n,1,3]] non-CSS code family generated using measurements on graph states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reliability of quantum computation critically depends on the performance of quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs), which can be severely degraded by hook errors that reduce the effective code distance. In this work, we construct a family of $[[n,1,3]]$ non-CSS QECCs to achieve fault-tolerant (FT) syndrome measurement, where $ 6 \leq n \leq 10$. We employ the bare-ancilla method of Muyuan Li \emph{et al.} to demonstrate fault tolerance in the presence of hook errors during syndrome extraction.
  We present a systematic protocol for generating these QECCs using graph codes.
  Using a custom lookup-table decoder, we simulate the code's performance under both anisotropic and circuit-level depolarizing noise. Our results reveal a trade-off in performance with respect to the code rate and identify optimized codes under these noise models. We benchmark our results against the infamous flag-qubit method of Chao \emph{et al.}. Notably, we introduce a code with improved code rate while maintaining the same distance as the work of Muyuan Li \emph{et al.} Our approach facilitates the identification and construction of a family of distance three FT non-CSS QECCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preparing quantum states is a fundamental task in various quantum algorithms. In particular, state preparation in quantum harmonic oscillators (HOs) is crucial for the creation of qudits and the implementation of high-dimensional algorithms. In this work, we develop a methodology for preparing quantum states in HOs. The HO is coupled to an auxiliary qubit to ensure that any state can be prepared in the oscillator [J. Math. Phys. 59, 072101]. By applying a sequence of square pulses to both the qubit and the HO, we drive the system from an initial state to a target state. To determine the required pulses, we use a neural network that predicts the pulse parameters needed for state preparation. Specifically, we present results for preparing qubit and qutrit states in the HO, achieving average fidelities of 99.9% and 97.0%, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fault-tolerant Bell-pair distillation scheme achieving constant overhead through high-rate quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes. Our approach maintains a constant distillation rate equal to the code rate while requiring no additional overhead beyond the physical qubits of the code. Full circuit-level analysis demonstrates fault-tolerance for input Bell pair infidelities below a threshold $\sim 10\%$, readily achievable with near-term capabilities. Unlike previous proposals, our scheme keeps the output Bell pairs encoded in qLDPC codes at each node, eliminating un-encoding overhead and enabling direct use in distributed quantum applications through recent advances in qLDPC computation. These results establish qLDPC-based distillation as a practical route toward resource-efficient quantum networks and distributed quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ontological models, as used in the generalised contextuality literature, play a central role in current research on quantum foundations, providing a framework for defining classicality, constructing classical analogues of key quantum phenomena, and examining the ontology of quantum states. In this work, we show that a counterfactual account of L\"uders' rule -- which we argue is naturally implied by the mathematical structure of the rule itself -- renders such models inherently incompatible with the quantum formalism. This incompatibility arises because the counterfactual update requires ontological models to update their states according to conditional probability, which in turn which in turn renders predictions of sequential measurements order-independent. This implies that ontological models, even contextual ones, must either act differently to what we would expect given (this, typically implicitly-assumed account of) quantum state update rule, or cannot model quantum behaviour.</description>

      <title>Co-Designing Spectral Transformation Oracles with Hybrid Oscillator-Qubit Quantum Processors: From Algorithms to Compilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16029v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We co-design a family of quantum eigenvalue transformation oracles that can be efficiently implemented on hybrid discrete/continuous-variable (qubit/qumode) hardware. To illustrate the oracle's representation-theoretic power and near-term experimental accessibility, we encode a Gaussian imaginary time evolution spectral filter. As a result, we define a continuous linear combination of unitaries block-encoding. Due to the ancillary qumode's infinite-dimensional nature, continuous variable qumodes constitute a powerful compilation tool for encoding continuous spectral functions without discretization errors while minimizing resource requirements. We then focus on the ubiquitous task of preparing eigenstates in quantum spin models. For completeness, we provide an end-to-end compilation which expresses high-level oracles in terms of an experimentally realizable instruction set architecture in both 1D and 2D. Finally, we examine the leading-order effects of physical errors and highlight open research directions. Our algorithms scale linearly with the spatial extent of the target system and are applicable to both near-term and large-scale quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct both nonlinear and linear entanglement witnesses, by tensoring and partial tracing existing states and witnesses. We show that little shared quantum resources allow to employ decomposable witnesses to obtain larger ones detecting locally undistillable states, and find analytic witnesses for multipartite entangled states that are undistillable across all bipartitions. Crucially, we show how to efficiently optimize multicopy witnesses to desired states, which is a current challenge. As an example of both theoretical and experimental interest, existing trace polynomial witnesses are significantly improved while preserving their symmetries and implementability with randomized measurements. Besides detecting entanglement, we also find new witnesses detecting $k$-copy distillability. A recipe for the single-copy case is shown to be effective for generic and Werner states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seismic inversion-including post-stack, pre-stack, and full waveform inversion is compute and memory-intensive. Recently, several approaches, including physics-informed machine learning, have been developed to address some of these limitations. Motivated by the potential of quantum computing, we report on our attempt to map one such classical physics-informed algorithm to a quantum framework. The primary goal is to investigate the technical challenges of this mapping, given that quantum algorithms rely on computing principles fundamentally different from those in classical computing. Quantum computers operate using qubits, which exploit superposition and entanglement, offering the potential to solve classically intractable problems. While current quantum hardware is limited, hybrid quantum-classical algorithms-particularly in quantum machine learning (QML)-demonstrate potential for near-term applications and can be readily simulated. We apply QML to subsurface imaging through the development of a hybrid quantum physics-informed neural network (HQ-PINN) for post-stack and pre-stack seismic inversion. The HQ-PINN architecture adopts an encoder-decoder structure: a hybrid quantum neural network encoder estimates P- and S-impedances from seismic data, while the decoder reconstructs seismic responses using geophysical relationships. Training is guided by minimizing the misfit between the input and reconstructed seismic traces. We systematically assess the impact of quantum layer design, differentiation strategies, and simulator backends on inversion performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through the inversion of both synthetic and the Sleipner field datasets. The HQ-PINN framework consistently yields accurate results, showcasing quantum computing's promise for geosciences and paving the way for future quantum-enhanced geophysical workflows.</description>

      <title>New perspectives on quantum kernels through the lens of entangled tensor kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum kernel methods are one of the most explored approaches to quantum machine learning. However, the structural properties and inductive bias of quantum kernels are not fully understood. In this work, we introduce the notion of entangled tensor kernels - a generalization of product kernels from classical kernel theory - and show that all embedding quantum kernels can be understood as an entangled tensor kernel. We discuss how this perspective allows one to gain novel insights into both the unique inductive bias of quantum kernels, and potential methods for their dequantization.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Evaluation of Quantum/Classical Neural Network Using a Game Solver Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To evaluate the performance of quantum computing systems relative to classical counterparts and explore the potential, we propose a game-solving benchmark based on Elo ratings in the game of tic-tac-toe. We compare classical convolutional neural networks (CCNNs), quantum or quantum convolutional neural networks (QNNs, QCNNs), and hybrid classical-quantum neural networks (Hybrid NNs) by assessing their performance based on round-robin matches. Our results show that the Hybrid NNs engines achieve Elo ratings comparable to those of CCNNs engines, while the quantum engines underperform under current hardware constraints. Additionally, we implement a QNN integrated with quantum communication and evaluate its performance to quantify the overhead introduced by noisy quantum channels, and the communication overhead was found to be modest. These results demonstrate the viability of using game-based benchmarks for evaluating quantum computing systems and suggest that quantum communication can be incorporated with limited impact on performance, providing a foundation for future hybrid quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient Two Photon Generation from an Emitter in a Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08511v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-photon states are essential for quantum technologies such as metrology, lithography, and communication. One of the primary methods of two-photon generation is based on parametric down-conversion, but this suffers from low efficiency and a large footprint. This work presents a detailed theoretical investigation of an alternative approach: two-photon generation from an emitter in a doubly resonant cavity. The system is modeled by the Lindblad master Equation, and an approximate analytical solution is derived to determine the experimentally achievable limits on efficiency and brightness. Additionally, the optimal cavity parameters for achieving these limits are also identified. For experimentally feasible parameters, the maximum efficiency is approximately 35%, which is significantly higher than that of parametric down-conversion-based methods. The optimal rate and efficiency for two-photon generation are achieved when the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the two-photon emission frequency matches the single-photon atom-field coupling strength. Moreover, the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the one-photon emission frequency for single photons should be minimized. The cavity field properties are also examined by studying the second-order correlation function at zero time delay and the Mandel Q parameter, revealing highly bunched two-photon emission and super-Poissonian statistics. The quantum-jump framework, combined with Monte Carlo simulations, is used to characterize the mechanism of two-photon emission and the emission spectra of the cavity. Two-photon emission is demonstrated to be a rapid cascade process of quantum jumps, and its spectrum consists of three prominent peaks corresponding to transitions between the dressed states of the system.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced spectral diffusion of T centers in silicon nanophotonic devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Color centers in silicon are emerging as spin-photon interfaces operating at telecommunication wavelengths. The nanophotonic device integration of silicon color centers via ion implantation leads to significant optical linewidth broadening, which makes indistinguishable photon generation challenging. Here, we study the optical spectral diffusion of T centers in a silicon photonic crystal cavity. We investigate the linewidth broadening timescales and origins by measuring the temporal correlations of the resonance frequency under different conditions. Spectral hole burning measurements reveal no spectral broadening at short timescales from 102 ns to 725 ns. We probe broadening at longer timescales using a check pulse to herald the T center frequency and a probe pulse to measure frequency after a wait time. The optical resonance frequency is stable up to 3 ms in the dark. Laser pulses below the silicon band gap applied during the wait time leads to linewidth broadening. Our observations establish laser-induced processes as the dominant spectral diffusion mechanism for T centers in devices, and inform materials and feedback strategies for indistinguishable photon generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum technologies promise information processing and communication technology advancements, including random number generation (RNG). Using Bell inequalities, a user of a quantum RNG hardware can certify that the values provided by an untrusted device are truly random. This problem has been extensively studied for von Neumann and min-entropy as a measure of randomness. However, in this paper, we analyze the feasibility of such verification for Shannon entropy. We investigate how the usability of various Bell inequalities differs depending on the presence of noise. Moreover, we present the benefit of certification for Shannon compared to min-entropy, as well as the tight analytical lower bound for Shannon entropy in randomness certification.</description>

      <title>Collective light shifts of many longitudinal cavity modes induced by coupling to a cold-atom ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally study the interaction between a cold atom cloud and many longitudinal modes of a high quality Fabry-Perot cavity, by measuring signatures of collective light shifts in the cavity transmission spectrum of an optical frequency comb probe. Using a resonator coupled to more than $10^5$ intracavity atoms, we detect significant shifts of $\sim 100$ cavity modes simultaneously, which is a direct manifestation of physics beyond the hitherto explored regime of cavity-cold atom interaction with only single or few longitudinal modes at a time. For the cavity mode closest to the atomic resonance, we demonstrate a bistability in the transmission spectrum, arising due to a combined coupling of the cloud to an external pump laser and a cavity mode probed by the optical frequency comb. These results establish a platform for deeper exploration of multifrequency cavity quantum electrodynamics, where ultrashort pulsed sources can be used for optical manipulation, cooling and entanglement of cold atoms in a resonator.</description>

      <title>Unlocking early fault-tolerant quantum computing with mitigated magic dilution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10513v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum computing progresses towards the early fault-tolerant regime, quantum error correction will play a crucial role in protecting qubits and enabling logical Clifford operations. However, the number of logical qubits will initially remain limited, posing challenges for resource-intensive tasks like magic state distillation. It is therefore essential to develop efficient methods for implementing non-Clifford operations, such as small-angle rotations, to maximise the computational capabilities of devices within these constraints. In this work, we introduce mitigated magic dilution (MMD) as an approach to synthesise small-angle rotations by employing quantum error mitigation techniques to sample logical Clifford circuits given noisy encoded magic states. We explore the utility of our approach for the simulation of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model. We identify evolution time regimes where MMD outperforms state-of-the-art synthesis techniques in the number of noisy encoded magic states required for square lattices up to size $8 \times 8$. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method can provide a practical advantage that is quantified by a better-than-quadratic improvement in the resource requirements for small-angle rotations over classical simulators. This work paves the way for early fault-tolerant demonstrations on devices supporting millions of quantum operations, the so-called MegaQuOp regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These notes present a review of the status of quantum computing with arrays of neutral atom qubits, an approach which has demonstrated remarkable progress in the last few years. Scaling digital quantum computing to qubit counts and control fidelities that will enable solving outstanding scientific questions, and provide commercial value, is an outstanding challenge, not least because of the requirement of connecting and entangling distant qubits. Long-range Rydberg gates and physical motion outfit atomic qubit arrays with tools for establishing connectivity. These tools operate on different timescales and with distinct levels of parallelization. We analyze several prototypical architectures from the perspective of achieving fast connectivity for circuits with large scale entanglement, as well as fast cycle times for measurement based quantum error correcting codes. Extending Rydberg interactions to multiple atomic species has emerged as a promising route to achieving this latter requirement.</description>

Abstract: The advent of hybrid computing platforms consisting of quantum processing units integrated with conventional high-performance computing brings new opportunities for algorithm design. By strategically offloading select portions of the workload to classical hardware where tractable, we may broaden the applicability of quantum computation in the near term. In this perspective, we review techniques that facilitate the study of subdomains of chemical systems with quantum computers and present a proof-of-concept demonstration of quantum-selected configuration interaction deployed within a multiscale/multiphysics simulation workflow leveraging classical molecular dynamics, projection-based embedding and qubit subspace tools. This allows the technology to be utilised for simulating systems of real scientific and industrial interest, which not only brings true quantum utility closer to realisation but is also relevant as we look forward to the fault-tolerant regime.</description>

      <title>Fast and High Excitation Transport in Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11885v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) with underlying collective and long-range atom-atom interactions has led to many distinct dynamical phenomena, including modified collective radiations and intriguing quantum correlations. It stands out as a unique platform to illustrate correlated photon transport, as well as to promise applications in quantum information processing. Here we manifest a fast and high atomic excitation transport by employing two separated chirally-coupled atomic arrays. This enhanced waveguide-mediated transport of excitations emerges due to the dominance of few subradiant right eigenstates that are spectrally isolated and spatially localized in the system's dynamics. Contrary to the instinct of applying the cascaded systems with unidirectional couplings to expedite direct and high excitation transport, the optimal system configurations in open wQED systems demand slight or finite nonreciprocal decay channels to facilitate energy transport by exploiting waveguide-mediated couplings. We also investigate the effect of the couplings' directionality and the scaling of atom number on the transport properties. Our results showcase the wide applicability in wQED platforms and provide insights into quantum engineering and quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>Bending Hyperplanes, Nonlinear Entanglement Witnesses via Envelopes of Linear Witnesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement witnesses (EWs) are fundamental tools for detecting entanglement. However traditional linear witnesses often fail to identify most of the entangled states. In this work, we construct a family of nonlinear entanglement witnesses by taking the envelope of linear witnesses defined over continuous families of pure bipartite states with fixed Schmidt bases. This procedure effectively "bends" the hyperplanes associated with linear witnesses into curved hypersurfaces, thereby extending the region of detectable entangled states. The resulting conditions can be expressed in terms of the positive semi-definiteness of a family of matrices, whose principal minors define a hierarchy of increasingly sensitive detection criteria. We show that this construction is not limited to the transposition map and generalizes naturally to arbitrary Positive but not Completely Positive (PnCP) maps, leading to nonlinear analogues of general entanglement witnesses. We emphasize that the required measurements remain experimentally accessible, as the nonlinear criteria are still formulated in terms of expectation values over local operator bases. Through both analytical and numerical examples, we demonstrate that the proposed nonlinear witnesses outperform their linear counterparts in detecting entangled states which may evade individual linear EWs in the construction. This approach offers a practical and conceptually elegant enhancement to entanglement detection in finite-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Testing Distinguishability and Determinism in Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01203v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze experiments to test distinguishability and determinism in atoms. As a first step, we consider experiments to test if atoms are distinguishable from each other due to small differences in the nuclear magnetic moment. The idea is to measure the hyperfine splitting for stable isotopes that are confined to ion traps, by accumulating statistics over time with different atoms. The three cases analyzed are strontium-87 with an odd number of neutrons, lutetium-175 with an odd number of protons, and lutetium-176 with an odd number of protons and neutrons. We then consider the possibility of performing the same tests on newly created stable isotopes. We also propose that a time-dependent nuclear magnetic moment may enable deterministic tracking of the life cycle of an isotope, and prediction of age since creation and time until decay of radioisotopes. The case of thulium-170 is considered, it is particularly interesting as a radioisotope with an odd number of protons and neutrons. More generally, we argue that any atomic transition could change in time, either due to the atomic nucleus or to the electron charge distribution. The latter could be tested in a dual atomic clock in a ladder configuration to search for the aging of an electronic transition.</description>

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate background-free, hyperfine-level-selective measurements of individual Cs atoms by simultaneous cooling to $5.3~\mu\rm K$ and imaging on the $6s_{1/2}\rightarrow 5d_{5/2}$ electric-quadrupole transition. We achieve hyperfine resolved detection with fidelity 0.9993(4) and atom retention of 0.9954(5), limited primarily by vacuum lifetime. Performing state measurements in a 3D cooling configuration enables repeated low loss measurements. A theoretical analysis of an extension of the demonstrated approach based on quenching of the excited state with an auxiliary field, identifies parameters for hyperfine-resolved measurements with a projected fidelity of $\sim 0.9995 $ in $\sim 60~\mu\rm s$.</description>

Abstract: We present a detailed study of an adiabatic state preparation in an effective three-level quantum system. States can be prepared with high speed and fidelity by adding a counterdiabatic (CD) quantum control protocol. As a second step, we invert the preparation protocol to get back to the initial state. This describes an overall cyclic evolution in state space. Using counterdiabatic terms, the resulting composed fast evolution can be repeated many times. We then analyze the control of Berry's phase along the adiabatic cyclic path and show that Berry's phase can act as a sensitive detector of non-perfect state transfer.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Support Vector Machines face scalability challenges due to high-dimensional quantum states and hardware limitations. We propose an embedding-aware quantum-classical pipeline combining class-balanced k-means distillation with pretrained Vision Transformer embeddings. Our key finding: ViT embeddings uniquely enable quantum advantage, achieving up to 8.02% accuracy improvements over classical SVMs on Fashion-MNIST and 4.42% on MNIST, while CNN features show performance degradation. Using 16-qubit tensor network simulation via cuTensorNet, we provide the first systematic evidence that quantum kernel advantage depends critically on embedding choice, revealing fundamental synergy between transformer attention and quantum feature spaces. This provides a practical pathway for scalable quantum machine learning that leverages modern neural architectures.</description>

Utilizing bright two-mode squeezed states (bTMSS), which offer high photon numbers and strong bipartite quantum correlations, we propose a novel configuration that leverages continuous-variable entanglement across multiple spatially separated optical gyroscopes. Unlike traditional quantum sensing that enhances a single sensor, our approach focuses on estimating a global phase shift corresponding to the average angular rotation across distributed optical gyroscopes with quantum-enhanced sensitivity. We analyze the phase sensitivities of different bTMSS configurations, including M mode-entangled bTMSS and separable M-bTMSS, and evaluate their performance through the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound. The analysis shows that, with 5% photon loss in every channel in the system, the proposed scheme shows a sensitivity enhancement of ~9.3 dB beyond the shot-noise limit, with an initial squeezing of ~9.8 dB. The present scheme has potential applications in quantum-enhanced inertial navigation and precision metrology within emerging quantum networks.</description>

      <title>On the Design of Expressive and Trainable Pulse-based Quantum Machine Learning Models</title>

Abstract: Pulse-based Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has emerged as a novel paradigm in quantum artificial intelligence due to its exceptional hardware efficiency. For practical applications, pulse-based models must be both expressive and trainable. Previous studies suggest that pulse-based models under dynamic symmetry can be effectively trained, thanks to a favorable loss landscape that avoids barren plateaus. However, the resulting uncontrollability may compromise expressivity when the model is inadequately designed. This paper investigates the requirements for pulse-based QML models to be expressive while preserving trainability. We establish a necessary condition pertaining to the system's initial state, the measurement observable, and the underlying dynamical symmetry Lie algebra, supported by numerical simulations. Our findings provide a framework for designing practical pulse-based QML models that balance expressivity and trainability.</description>

      <title>Mutually equi-biased bases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), a measurement in one basis gives \emph{no information} about the outcomes of measurements in another basis. Here, we relax the no-information condition by allowing the $d$ outcomes to be predicted according to a predefined probability distribution $q=(q_0,\ldots,q_{d-1})$. The notion of mutual unbiasedness, however, is preserved by requiring that the extracted information is the same for any preparation and any measurement; regardless of which state from which basis is chosen to prepare the system, the outcomes of measuring the system with respect to the other basis generate the same probability distribution. In the light of this, we define the notion of \emph{mutually equi-biased bases} (MEBs) such that within each basis the states are equi-biased with respect to the states of the other basis and that the bases are mutually equi-biased with respect to each other. For $d=2,3$, we derive a complete set of $d+1$ MEBs. The mutual equi-biasedness imposes nontrivial constraints on the distribution $q$, leading for $d=3$ to the restriction $1/3\le\mu \le 1/2$ where $\mu=\sum_{k=0}^{2}q_k^2$. To capture the incompatibility of the measurements in MEBs, we derive an inequality for the probabilities of projective measurements in a qudit system, which yields an associated entropic uncertainty inequality. Finally, we construct a class of positive maps and their associated entanglement witnesses based on MEBs. While an entanglement witness constructed from MUBs is generally finer than one based on MEBs when both use the same number of bases, for certain values of the index $\mu$, employing a larger set of MEBs can yield a finer witness. We illustrate this behavior using isotropic states of a $3\times 3$ system. Our results reveal that not all bases in a set of $L$ MEBs can have contribution for the entanglement detection. ...</description>

      <title>Secure authentication via Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions: a review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions (QPUFs) offer a physically grounded approach to secure authentication, extending the capabilities of classical PUFs. This review covers their theoretical foundations and key implementation challenges - such as quantum memories and Haar-randomness -, and distinguishes QPUFs from Quantum Readout PUFs (QR-PUFs), more experimentally accessible yet less robust against quantum-capable adversaries. A co-citation-based selection method is employed to trace the evolution of QPUF architectures, from early QR-PUFs to more recent Hybrid PUFs (HPUFs). This method further supports a discussion on the role of information-theoretic analysis in mitigating inconsistencies in QPUF responses, underscoring the deep connection between secret-key generation and authentication. Despite notable advances, achieving practical and robust QPUF-based authentication remains an open challenge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Operating superconducting qubits at elevated temperatures offers increased cooling power and thus system scalability, but requires suppression of thermal photons to preserve coherence and readout fidelity. This motivates migration to higher operation frequencies, which demands high-frequency amplification with near-quantum-limited noise characteristics for qubit readout. Here, we report the design and experimental realization of a wireless Josephson parametric amplifier (WJPA) operating above 20~GHz. The wireless design eliminates losses and impedance mismatches that become problematic at high frequencies. The WJPA achieves more than 20~dB of gain across a tunable frequency range of 21--23.5~GHz, with a typical dynamic bandwidth of 3~MHz. Through Y-factor measurements and a qubit-based photon number calibration, we show that the amplifier exhibits an added noise of approximately two photons.</description>

      <title>Error exponents of quantum state discrimination with composite correlated hypotheses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the error exponents in quantum hypothesis testing between two sets of quantum states, extending the analysis beyond the independent and identically distributed case to encompass composite correlated hypotheses. In particular, we introduce and compare two natural extensions of the quantum Hoeffding divergence and anti-divergence to sets of quantum states, establishing their equivalence or quantitative relations. In the error exponent regime, we generalize the quantum Hoeffding bound to stable sequences of convex, compact sets of quantum states, demonstrating that the optimal Type-I error exponent, under an exponential constraint on the Type-II error, is precisely characterized by the regularized quantum Hoeffding divergence between the sets. In the strong converse exponent regime, we provide a general lower bound on the exponent in terms of the regularized quantum Hoeffding anti-divergence and a matching upper bound when the null hypothesis is a singleton. The generality of these results enables applications in various contexts, including (i) refining the generalized quantum Stein's lemma by [Fang, Fawzi &amp; Fawzi, 2024]; (ii) exhibiting counterexamples to the continuity of the regularized Petz R\'enyi divergence and Hoeffding divergence; (iii) obtaining error exponents for adversarial channel discrimination and resource detection problems.</description>

      <title>Control of molecular rotation in helium nanodroplets with an optical centrifuge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate that the rotation of molecules embedded in helium nanodroplets can be controlled with an optical centrifuge, allowing for the study of molecular dynamics inside the strongly interacting many-body environment of superfluid helium at variable levels of rotational excitation. By doping the droplets with dimers of nitric oxide, (NO)$_2$, and measuring the degree of their centrifuge-induced alignment as a function of time, we show both the forced in-field rotation of molecules in a continuous range of frequencies, as well as the field-free resonant rotation with a long nanosecond-scale decay. The ability to control and monitor the rotational dynamics of molecular rotors inside the superfluid medium may shed new light on superfluidity and the interaction of superfluids with defects at the atomic level.</description>

      <title>-Continuum limit of bipartite lattices - The SSH model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a continuous non-local model that faithfully replicates the rich topological and spectral features of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Remarkably, our model shares the SSH models bulk energy spectrum, eigenstates, and Zak phase, hallmarks of its topological character, while introducing a tunable length-scale a quantifying non-locality. This parameter allows for a controlled interpolation between non-local and local regimes. Furthermore, for a specific value of a the exact spectral equivalence to the discrete SSH model is established. Distinct from previous continuous analogues based on Schr\"odinger or Dirac-type Hamiltonians, our approach maintains chiral symmetry, does not require an external potential and features periodic energy bands. On finite domains, the model supports a flat band with zero energy formed by a countable infinite set of exponentially localized zero-energy edge states of topological origin. Beyond SSH, our method lays the foundation for constructing non-local, continuous analogues of a wide class of bipartite and multipartite lattices, opening new paths for theoretical exploration and new challenges for experimental realization in topological quantum matter.</description>

Abstract: For a century, quantum theorists have been reading the mathematical entrails of quantum mechanics (QM) to divine the nature of quantum reality. But to little avail. In this paper a different approach is taken, namely to identify and explain the basic intuitive ideas involved in QM. This does not tell one how those basic `gears' all mesh together in the beautiful mathematics of QM. But this does give one some intuitive (\textit{anschaulich})) ideas about the quantum reality described in the seemingly hard-to-interpret mathematical framework.</description>

      <title>Going beyond Landauer: Information-cost relations from inference based on the maximum entropy principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Landauer's principle, a cornerstone of information thermodynamics, provides a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of information erasure in terms of the information content change. However, its traditional formulation is largely confined to systems exchanging solely energy with an ideal thermal bath. In this work, we derive general information-cost trade-off relations that go beyond the scope of Landauer's principle by developing a thermodynamic inference approach based on the maximum entropy principle. These relations require only information about the system and are applicable to complex quantum scenarios involving multiple conserved charges and non-thermal environments. Specifically, we present two key results: (i) In scenarios where only the mean values of observables are accessible, we derive an information-content-informed upper bound on the thermodynamic cost which complements an existing generalized Landauer lower bound. (ii) When second-order fluctuations can also be measured, we obtain an information-content-informed lower bound on the change in variances of observables, thereby extending the Landauer's principle to constrain higher-order fluctuation costs. We numerically validate our information-cost trade-off relations using a coupled-qubit system exchanging energy and excitations, a driven qubit implementing an information erasure process, and a driven double quantum dot system that can operate as an inelastic heat engine. Our results underscore the broad utility of maximum-entropy inference in constraining thermodynamic costs for generic finite-time quantum processes, with direct relevance to quantum information processing and quantum thermodynamic applications.</description>

      <title>Linear-Size QAC0 Channels: Learning, Testing and Hardness</title>

Abstract: Shallow quantum circuits have attracted increasing attention in recent years, due to the fact that current noisy quantum hardware can only perform faithful quantum computation for a short amount of time. The constant-depth quantum circuits $\mathbf{QAC}^0$, a quantum counterpart of $\mathbf{AC}^0$ circuits, are the polynomial-size and constant-depth quantum circuits composed of only single-qubit unitaries and polynomial-size generalized Toffoli gates. The computational power of $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ has been extensively investigated in recent years. In this paper, we are concerned with $\mathbf{QLC}^0$ circuits, which are linear-size $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ circuits, a quantum counterpart of $\mathbf{LC}^0$.
  * We show that depth-$d$ $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ circuits working on $n$ input qubits and $a$ ancilla qubits have approximate degree at most $\tilde{O}((n+a)^{1-2^{-d}})$, improving the $\tilde{O}((n+a)^{1-3^{-d}})$ degree upper bound of previous works. Consequently, this directly implies that to compute the parity function, $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ circuits need at least $\tilde{O}(n^{1+2^{-d}})$ circuit size.
  * We present the first agnostic learning algorithm for $\mathbf{QLC}^0$ channels using subexponential running time and queries. Moreover, we also establish exponential lower bounds on the query complexity of learning $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ channels under both the spectral norm distance of the Choi matrix and the diamond norm distance.
  * We present a tolerant testing algorithm which determines whether an unknown quantum channel is a $\mathbf{QLC}^0$ channel. This tolerant testing algorithm is based on our agnostic learning algorithm.
  Our approach leverages low-degree approximations of $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ circuits and Pauli analysis as key technical tools. Collectively, these results advance our understanding of agnostic learning for shallow quantum circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problems of state preparation, ground state preparation and quantum state preparation. We propose an analytic approach to a stochastic quantum algorithm which prepares the ground state for $n$-qubit Hamiltonian that is represented by $\text{poly}(n)$ Pauli operators and has an inverse-polynomial gap, requiring only $\text{poly}(n)$ Pauli rotations, measurements, and classical time complexity when $n$ exceeds a threshold, to inverse-polynomial precision given the initial overlap being lower bounded by $\frac{1}{2^n}$. Extending this result, we prove that any $n$-qubit quantum state can be prepared in two regimes: (1) with a constant number of Pauli rotations to constant precision, or (2) with a polynomial number of rotations to inverse-polynomial precision. Our results improve over previous approaches to quantum state preparation in terms of gate complexity, thereby yielding quantum space advantage. As an application, we identify a practical condition under which quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems can be solved with exponential quantum speedups.</description>

      <title>On Cryptography and Distribution Verification, with Applications to Quantum Advantage</title>

Abstract: One of the most fundamental problems in the field of hypothesis testing is the identity testing problem: whether samples from some unknown distribution $\mathcal{G}$ are actually from some explicit distribution $\mathcal{D}$. It is known that when the distribution $\mathcal{D}$ has support $[N]$, the optimal sample complexity for the identity testing problem is roughly $O(\sqrt{N})$. However, many distributions of interest, including those which can be sampled efficiently, have exponential support size, and therefore the optimal identity tester also requires exponential samples. In this paper, we bypass this lower bound by considering restricted settings. The above $O(\sqrt{N})$ sample complexity identity tester is constructed so that it is not fooled by any (even inefficiently-sampled) distributions. However, in most applications, the distributions under consideration are efficiently samplable, and therefore it is enough to consider only identity testers that are not fooled by efficiently-sampled distributions. In this setting we can hope to construct efficient identity testers. We investigate relations between efficient verification of classical/quantum distributions with classical/quantum cryptography, showing the following results:
  (1). Classically efficiently samplable distributions are verifiable if and only if one-way functions do not exist. (2). Quantumly efficiently samplable distributions are verifiable by $\mathbf{P}^\mathbf{PP}$ with a polynomial number of samples. (3). Sampling-based quantum advantage can be verified quantumly (with a polynomial number of samples) if one-way puzzles do not exist. (4). If QEFID pairs exist, then some quantumly efficiently samplable distributions are not verifiable.</description>

Abstract: The reliable distribution of high-dimensional entangled quantum states, an important resource in quantum technologies, through optical fibre networks is challenging due to the need to maintain coherence across multiple modes. Here we demonstrate the distribution of four-dimensional path-encoded entangled quantum states between photonic chips, enabled by a novel multimode phase stabilisation algorithm. The algorithm utilises the reconfigurability of the integrated photonic circuits to complete one iteration of phase stabilisation in just two measurement rounds for an arbitrary number of modes, and requires no additional hardware to the quantum measurements it enables. As a result, we are able to perform complete quantum state tomography across two chips using the minimum number of local projective measurements to verify the fidelity of the distributed entangled state to be 86% (compared to 8.1% without the phase stabilisation) with an entanglement entropy of 0.995+/-0.002.</description>

      <title>On Encoding Matrices using Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over a decade ago, it was demonstrated that quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize numerical linear algebra by enabling algorithms with complexity superior to what is classically achievable, e.g., the seminal HHL algorithm for solving linear systems. Efficient execution of such algorithms critically depends on representing inputs (matrices and vectors) as quantum circuits that encode or implement these inputs. For that task, two common circuit representations emerged in the literature: block encodings and state preparation circuits. In this paper, we systematically study encodings matrices in the form of block encodings and state preparation circuits. We examine methods for constructing these representations from matrices given in classical form, as well as quantum two-way conversions between circuit representations. Two key results we establish (among others) are: (a) a general method for efficiently constructing a block encoding of an arbitrary matrix given in classical form (entries stored in classical random access memory); and (b) low-overhead, bidirectional conversion algorithms between block encodings and state preparation circuits, showing that these models are essentially equivalent. From a technical perspective, two central components of our constructions are: (i) a special constant-depth multiplexer that simultaneously multiplexes all higher-order Pauli matrices of a given size, and (ii) an algorithm for performing a quantum conversion between a matrix's expansion in the standard basis and its expansion in the basis of higher-order Pauli matrices.</description>

      <title>Scrambling Without Chaos in Random Free-Fermionic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the role of randomness in the scrambling of quantum information within integrable free-fermionic systems. Considering quadratic Hamiltonians with varying degrees of randomness, we analyze entanglement-based measures to characterize the scrambling structure. We show that the memory effect in the entanglement of disjoint subsystems of Gaussian states vanishes when the local couplings are random, indicating information delocalization. The tripartite mutual information exhibits negative saturation values similar to those in chaotic systems, albeit with a smaller magnitude, revealing weaker scrambling under integrable quadratic dynamics. Despite integrability, spectral analyses reveal that local random models display a spectral-form-factor ramp and a partial crossover in the single-particle level-spacing ratio from Poisson-like to Wigner--Dyson-like behavior within a certain range of random couplings. These results demonstrate that randomness can act as a minimal ingredient for inducing information scrambling in integrable quadratic fermionic models.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity and Mixed-State Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a unified framework connecting decoherence and quantum complexity. By vectorizing the density matrix into a pure state in a double Hilbert space, a decoherence process is mapped to an imaginary-time evolution. Expanding this evolution in the Krylov space, we find that the $n$-th Krylov basis corresponds to an $n$-error state generated by the decoherence, providing a natural bridge between error proliferation and complexity growth. Using two dephasing quantum channels as concrete examples, we show that the Krylov complexity remains nonsingular for strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SWSSB) crossovers, while it exhibits a singular area-to-volume-law transition for genuine SWSSB phase transitions, intrinsic to mixed states.</description>

      <title>A No-Go Theorem for Shaping Quantum Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to engineer non-Gaussian quantum resources underlies quantum technologies from communication and metrology to universal computation. However, while a number of canonical works have set no-go limits for attaining such resources from Gaussian operations, it is widely assumed that such resources can be tuned freely by non-Gaussian Hamiltonian dynamics. Here we prove a general no-go theorem for such resource shaping: no smooth Hamiltonian dynamics can modify higher-order statistical moments of a continuous-variable state without simultaneously changing its mean and covariance. This analytic constraint implies a rigidity theorem for Hamiltonian quantum control-only quadratic (symplectic) generators preserve the Gaussian moment hierarchy, while every non-quadratic term necessarily couples the Gaussian and non-Gaussian sectors. The theorem identifies the symplectic algebra as the unique invariant subalgebra whose differential representations terminate at finite (second) order within the otherwise infinite Hamiltonian algebra. It thereby defines the analytic boundary between classically simulable Gaussian dynamics and the fully universal non-Gaussian regime-the continuous-variable analogue of the Gottesman-Knill frontier.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity all-microwave CZ gate with partial erasure-error detection via a transmon coupler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entangling gates between neighboring physical qubits are essential for quantum error correction. Implementing them in an all-microwave manner simplifies signal routing and control apparatus of superconducting quantum processors. We propose and experimentally demonstrate an all-microwave controlled-Z (CZ) gate that achieves high fidelity while suppressing residual ZZ interactions. Our approach utilizes a fixed-frequency transmon coupler and multi-path coupling, thereby sufficiently reducing the net transverse interaction between data transmons to suppress residual ZZ interactions. The controlled phase arises from the dispersive frequency shift of the $|gf\rangle$$\unicode{x2013}$$|eg\rangle$ transition between the coupler and one of the data transmons conditioned on the state of the other data transmon. Driving the transitions at the midpoint of two dispersively shifted resonance frequencies induces state-dependent geometric phases to achieve the CZ gate. Crucially, with this scheme, we can maintain a small net transverse interaction between two data transmons while increasing the coupling between the data and coupler transmons to accelerate the CZ-gate speed. Additionally, we measure the coupler state after the gate to detect a subset of decoherence-induced failures that occur during the gate operation. These events constitute erasure errors with known locations, enabling erasure-aware quantum error-correcting codes to improve future logical qubit performance.</description>

      <title>Qubit Mapping and Routing tailored to Advanced Quantum ISAs: Not as Costly as You Think</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Qubit mapping/routing is a critical stage in compilation for both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computers, yet existing scalable methods typically impose several times the routing overhead in terms of circuit depth or duration. This inefficiency stems from a fundamental disconnect: compilers rely on an abstract routing model (e.g., three-CX-unrolled SWAP insertion) that completely ignores the idiosyncrasies of native gates supported by physical devices.
  Recent hardware breakthroughs have enabled high-precision implementations of diverse instruction set architectures (ISAs) beyond standard CX-based gates. Advanced ISAs involving gates such as SQiSW and ZZ({\theta}) gates offer superior circuit synthesis capabilities and can be realized with higher fidelities. However, systematic compiler optimization strategies tailored to these advanced ISAs are lacking.
  To address this, we propose Canopus, a unified qubit mapping/routing framework applicable to diverse quantum ISAs. Built upon the canonical representation of two-qubit gates, Canopus centers on qubit routing to perform deep co-optimization in an ISA-aware approach. Canopus leverages the two-qubit canonical representation and the monodromy polytope to model the synthesis cost for more intelligent SWAP insertion during the routing stage. We also formalize the commutation relations between two-qubit gates through the canonical form, providing a generalized approach to commutativity-based optimizations. Experiments show that Canopus consistently reduces routing overhead by 15%-35% compared to state-of-the-art methods across different ISAs and topologies. Our work also presents a coherent method for co-exploration of program patterns, quantum ISAs, and hardware topologies.</description>

      <title>Hybrid action Reinforcement Learning for quantum architecture search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing expressive yet trainable quantum circuit architectures remains a major challenge for variational quantum algorithms, as manual or heuristic designs often yield suboptimal performance. We propose HyRLQAS (Hybrid-Action Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Architecture Search), a unified framework that integrates discrete gate placement and continuous parameter generation within a hybrid action space. Unlike existing approaches that optimize circuit structure and parameters separately, HyRLQAS jointly learns both topology and initialization while dynamically refining previously placed gates through reinforcement learning. Trained in a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) environment, the agent autonomously constructs circuits that minimize molecular ground-state energy. Experimental results demonstrate that HyRLQAS achieves consistently lower energy errors and more compact circuit structures compared with discrete-only and continuous-only baselines. Furthermore, the hybrid action space yields superior parameter initializations, producing post-optimization energy distributions with consistently lower minima. These findings suggest that hybrid-action reinforcement learning offers a principled pathway toward automated and hardware-efficient quantum circuit design.</description>

      <title>Revocation and Reconstruction of Shared Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of revocation of quantum states after sharing is interesting and we ask: Is it possible for a dealer to revoke the state once shared, before the reconstruction process? Additional resources like bell states are used to help the dealer to get back the state. In a three-party scenario, we show an independent way to revoke, if, for any reason, the dealer is not sure about the intention of the/any reconstructor. In general, the classical outcomes of the dealer in sharing phase are needed, to be able to reconstruct the state perfectly. When both the shareholders are dishonest, and without the dealer's knowledge, collude to reconstruct, they always have some chance of succeeding. This is addressed by giving more control to the dealer by making him/her) to have a quantum share as well. We give a sharing and revocation protocol with a four-qubit entangled resource shared among three parties (two qubits with the dealer and one each with the shareholders). We further consider a class of four qubit pure entangled states as resource and explicitly find the range of parameters for which the protocol will be successful.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy and Coherence of an Excited-State Transition in $\text{Tm}^{3+}$:$\text{YAlO}_{3}$ at Telecommunication Wavelength</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the spectroscopic and coherence properties of the 1451.37 nm excited-state zero-phonon line (ZPL) between the $^{3}F_{4}$ and the $^{3}H_{4}$ manifolds of a thulium-doped yttrium aluminum perovskite ($\text{Tm}^{3+}$:$\text{YAlO}_{3}$) crystal at temperatures around 1.5 K. We measure the absorption spectrum between the $^{3}H_{6}$ - $^{3}F_{4}$ and $^{3}F_{4}$ - $^{3}H_{4}$ manifolds, the inhomogeneous broadening of the $^{3}F_{4}$ - $^{3}H_{4}$ (excited-state) ZPL, and the lifetimes of the higher-lying and lower-lying excited states. We also investigate spectral hole-burning spectra with varying magnetic fields, which provides insight into hyperfine and superhyperfine interactions. Using again spectral holes but also optical free induction decays (FIDs), we assess optical coherence times, finding a maximum of 1.1 $\mu s$ when a 2T magnetic field is applied. Our results -- the first to demonstrate coherence of an excited-state transition in a rare-earth crystal -- suggest the possibility of exploiting such transitions for quantum technology.</description>

      <title>On the success probability of the quantum algorithm for the short DLP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eker{\aa} and H{\aa}stad have introduced a variation of Shor's algorithm for the discrete logarithm problem (DLP). Unlike Shor's original algorithm, Eker{\aa}-H{\aa}stad's algorithm solves the short DLP in groups of unknown order. In this work, we prove a lower bound on the probability of Eker{\aa}-H{\aa}stad's algorithm recovering the short logarithm $d$ in a single run. By our bound, the success probability can easily be pushed as high as $1 - 10^{-10}$ for any short $d$. A key to achieving such a high success probability is to efficiently perform a limited search in the classical post-processing by leveraging meet-in-the-middle techniques. Asymptotically, in the limit as the bit length $m$ of $d$ tends to infinity, the success probability tends to one if the limits on the search space are parameterized in $m$. Our results are directly applicable to Diffie-Hellman in safe-prime groups with short exponents, and to RSA via a reduction from the RSA integer factoring problem (IFP) to the short DLP.</description>

Abstract: Point-gap topological phases of non-Hermitian systems exhibit exotic boundary states that have no counterparts in Hermitian systems. Here, we develop classification of second-order point-gap topological phases protected by reflection symmetry. Based on this classification, we propose exceptional second-order topological insulators, exhibiting second-order boundary states stabilized by point-gap topology. As an illustrative example, we uncover a two-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator with point-gapless corner states. Furthermore, we identify a three-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator that features hinge states with isolated exceptional points, representing second-order topological phases intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Our work enlarges the family of point-gap topological phases in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first results from the Quantum Resolution-Optimized Cryogenic Observatory for Dark matter Incident at Low Energy (QROCODILE). The QROCODILE experiment uses a microwire-based superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) as a target and sensor for dark matter scattering and absorption, and is sensitive to energy deposits as low as 0.11 eV. We introduce the experimental configuration and report new world-leading constraints on the interactions of sub-MeV dark matter particles with masses as low as 30 keV. The thin-layer geometry of the system provides anisotropy in the interaction rate, enabling directional sensitivity. In addition, we leverage the coupling between phonons and quasiparticles in the detector to simultaneously constrain interactions with both electrons and nucleons. We discuss the potential for improvements to both the energy threshold and effective volume of the experiment in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent tensor network method for correlated super-moir\'e matter beyond one billion sites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e and super-moir\'e materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moir\'e systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moir\'e materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moir\'e systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moir\'e quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian topological insulators are characterized by matrix-valued, non-commuting topological charges with regard to more than one energy gap. Their descriptions go beyond the conventional topological band theory, in which an additive integer is endowed separately with each (degenerate group of) energy band(s). In this work, we reveal that Floquet (time-periodic) driving could not only enrich the topology and phase transitions of non-Abelian topological matter, but also induce bulk-edge correspondence unique to nonequilibrium setups. Using a one-dimensional (1D), three-band model as an illustrative example, we demonstrate that Floquet driving could reshuffle the phase diagram of the non-driven system, yielding both gapped and gapless Floquet band structures with non-Abelian topological charges. Moreover, by dynamically tuning the anomalous Floquet $\pi$-quasienergy gap, non-Abelian topological transitions inaccessible to static systems could arise, leading to much more complicated relations between non-Abelian topological charges and Floquet edge states. These discoveries put forth the periodic driving as a powerful scheme of engineering non-Abelian topological phases (NATPs) and incubating unique non-Abelian band topology beyond equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a driven atomic Josephson junction that we propose as a parametric amplifier. By periodically modulating the position of the barrier, we induce a small current across the junction, serving as our input signal. The pump field is implemented by modulating the barrier height at twice the Josephson plasma frequency. The resulting dynamics exhibit parametric amplification of the signal through nonlinear mixing between the signal and pump fields, which is encoded in a specific microscopic pattern of density waves and phase excitations that can be addressed within the experimental cold atoms capabilities. This work paves the way for tunable amplifiers in atomtronic circuits, with potential applications in several fields including precision measurements and quantum information processing. At the same time, our analysis provides the microscopic explanation of the general notion of parametric amplification occurring in nonlinear coherent devices.</description>

      <title>Engineering the Kondo impurity problem with alkaline-earth atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose quantum simulation experiments of the Kondo impurity problem using cold alkaline-earth(-like) atoms (AEAs) in a combination of optical lattice and optical tweezer potentials. Within an ab initio model for atomic interactions in the optical potentials, we analyze hallmark signatures of the Kondo effect in a variety of observables accessible in cold-atom quantum simulators. We identify additional terms not part of the textbook Kondo problem, mostly ignored in previous works and giving rise to a direct competition between spin and charge correlations - strongly suppressing Kondo physics. We show that the Kondo effect can be restored by locally adjusting the chemical potential on the impurity site, and we identify realistic parameter regimes and preparation protocols suited to current experiments with AEA arrays. Our work paves the way for novel quantum simulations of the Kondo problem and offers new insights into Kondo physics in unconventional regimes.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in Lifshitz-type Dirac Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Krylov complexity in Lifshitz-type Dirac field theories with a generic dynamical critical exponent $z$. By computing the Lanczos coefficients for massless and massive cases, we analyze the growth and saturation behavior of Krylov complexity in different regimes. We incorporate a hard UV cutoff and investigate the effects of lattice discretization, revealing fundamental differences between continuum and lattice models. In the presence of a UV cutoff, Krylov complexity exhibits an initial exponential growth followed by a linear regime, with saturation values of the Lanczos coefficients dictated by the cutoff scale. For the lattice model, we find a fundamental departure from the continuum case: due to the finite Krylov basis, Krylov complexity saturates rather than growing indefinitely. Our findings suggest that Lifshitz scaling influences operator growth and information spreading in quantum systems. We further find that increasing the Lifshitz exponent $z$ suppresses Krylov complexity, entropy, and Lanczos growth in both massless and massive cases, while enhancing K-variance. This trend reverses under a hard UV cutoff, where complexity and entropy increase with $z$. In lattice models, early-time complexity and $b_n$ decay shift with $z$, echoing the continuum behavior of massive and massless regimes.</description>

      <title>General Signal Model and Capacity Limit for Rydberg Quantum Information System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic receivers represent a transformative approach to achieving high-sensitivity, broadband, and miniaturized radio frequency (RF) reception. However, existing static signal models for Rydberg atomic receivers rely on the steady-state assumption of atomic quantum states, which cannot fully describe the signal reception process of dynamic signals. To fill in this gap, in this paper, we present a general model to compute the dynamic signal response of Rydberg atomic receivers in closed form. Specifically, by applying small-signal perturbation techniques to the quantum master equation, we derive closed-form Laplace domain transfer functions that characterize the receiver's dynamic responses to time-varying signal fields. To gain more insights into the quantum-based RF-photocurrent conversion process, we further introduce the concept of quantum transconductance that describes the quantum system as an equivalent classical system. By applying quantum transconductance, we quantify the influence of in-band blackbody radiation (BBR) noise on the atomic receiver sensitivity. Extensive simulations for Rydberg atomic receivers validate the proposed signal model, and demonstrate the possibility of quantum receivers to outperform classical electronic receivers through the improvement of quantum transconductance.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Suppression Due to Black Hole Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23729v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the evolution of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional conformal field theory with a holographic dual. Specifically, we are interested in a class of excited states produced by a combination of pure-state (local operator) and mixed-state local quenches. We employ a method that allows us to determine the full time evolution analytically. While a single insertion of a local operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the presence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant bump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the quenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the quenches. This work sheds light on the interesting properties of gravitational scattering involving black holes.</description>

      <title>Probing spin-motion coupling of two Rydberg atoms by a Stern-Gerlach-like experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and implement a protocol to measure the state-dependent motion of Rydberg atoms induced by dipole-dipole interactions. Our setup enables simultaneous readout of both the atomic internal state and position on a one-dimensional array of optical tweezers. We benchmark the protocol using two atoms in the same Rydberg state, which experience van der Waals repulsion, and measure velocities in agreement with theoretical predictions. When preparing the atoms in a different pair state, we observe an oscillatory dynamics that we attribute to the proximity of a macrodimer bound state. Finally, we perform a Stern-Gerlach-like experiment in which a superposition of the two previous pair states results in the separation of the atomic wavepacket into two macroscopically distinct trajectories, thereby demonstrating spin-motion coupling mediated by the interactions.</description>

Abstract: We study the beyond-mean-field Josephson dynamics of the relative phase between two coupled macroscopic quantum systems. Using a covariant background field method, we derive the one-loop only-phase quantum effective action and the corresponding equation of motion for the quantum average of the phase. These analytical results are benchmarked against the exact quantum dynamics of the two-site Bose-Hubbard model, demonstrating a relevant improvement over the standard mean-field predictions across a wide range of interaction strengths.</description>

      <title>Topological characterization of phase transitions and critical edge states in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems with sublattice symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Critical edge states appear at the bulk gap closing points of topological transitions. Their emergence signify the existence of topologically nontrivial critical points, whose descriptions fall outside the scope of gapped topological matter. In this work, we reveal and characterize topological critical points and critical edge states in non-Hermitian systems. By applying the Cauchy's argument principle to two characteristic functions of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we obtain a pair of winding numbers, whose combination yields a complete description of gapped and gapless topological phases in one-dimensional, two-band non-Hermitian systems with sublattice symmetry. Focusing on a broad class of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, we demonstrate the applicability of our theory for characterizing gapless symmetry-protected topological phases, topologically distinct critical points, phase transitions along non-Hermitian phase boundaries and their associated topological edge modes. Our findings not only generalize the concepts of topologically nontrivial critical points and critical edge modes to non-Hermitian setups, but also yield additional insights for analyzing topological transitions and bulk-edge correspondence in open systems.</description>

      <title>State-Selective Ionization and Trapping of Single H$_2^+$ Ions with (2+1) Multiphoton Ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on efficient rovibrational state-selective loading of single H$_2^+$ molecular ions into a cryogenic linear Paul trap using (2+1) resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionization (REMPI). The H$_2^+$ ions are created by resonant two-photon excitation of H$_2$ molecules from the $X\;^1\Sigma_g^+$ state to the $E,F\;^1\Sigma_g^+$ state, followed by non-resonant one-photon ionization. The H$_2^+$ ions are produced from residual gas and sympathetically cooled by a co-trapped, laser-cooled $^9$Be$^+$ ion. By tuning the wavelength of the REMPI laser, we observe the loading of single H$_2^+$ ions via the ($\nu' = 0$, $L' = 0, 1, 2, 3$) rovibrational levels of the $E,F\;^1\Sigma_g^+$ intermediate state. We measure the success probability for the production of H$_2^+$ in the ($\nu^+ = 0$, $L^+ = 1$) state via the ($\nu' = 0$, $L' = 1$) level to be 85(6)% by quantum logic spectroscopy (QLS) of the hyperfine structure of this rovibrational state. Furthermore, we load an H$_2^+$ ion via the ($\nu' = 0$, $L' = 2$) level and confirm its rovibrational state to be ($\nu^+ = 0$, $L^+ = 2$) by QLS. We perform QLS probes on the ion over 19 h and observe no decay of the rotationally excited state. Our work demonstrates an efficient state-selective loading mechanism for single-ion, high-precision spectroscopy of hydrogen molecular ions.</description>

      <title>Radio-frequency charge detection on graphene electron-hole double quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity detection of charge transitions in quantum dots (QDs) is a key ingredient in solid state quantum computation. We demonstrate high-bandwidth radio-frequency charge detection in bilayer graphene quantum dots (QDs) using a capacitively coupled quantum point contact (QPC). The device design suppresses screening effects and enables sensitive QPC-based charge readout. The QPC is arranged to maximize the readout contrast between two neighboring, coupled electron and hole QDs. We apply the readout scheme to a single-particle electron-hole double QD and demonstrate time-resolved detection of charge states as well as magnetic field dependent tunneling rates. This promises a high-fidelity readout scheme for individual spin and valley states, which is important for the operation of spin, valley or spin-valley qubits in bilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Bell-State Quantum Holography with Metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces composed of subwavelength nanostructures enable simultaneous control of polarization and wavefront, greatly enhancing holographic information capacity. Building on this capability, we extend holography into the quantum domain by experimentally realizing Bell-state holograms-distinct holographic images encoded in polarization-entangled Bell states of photon pairs. A polarization-multiplexed dielectric metasurface generates spatial modes conditioned on both input and output polarizations, entangling the holographic pattern with the two-photon state. To characterize these quantum holograms, we further develop quantum hologram tomography, reconstructing the full density matrix of the holographic state pixel by pixel. The reconstructed density-matrix hologram reveals tailor-made holographic symbols attached to individual Bell states through the metasurface, with contrast built up among the different Bell components as theory shows. This framework unifies metasurface photonics with quantum-state reconstruction and provides a scalable route toward high-dimensional quantum communication, encryption and information processing based on holographically encoded quantum light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that when a Brownian bridge is physically constrained to satisfy a canonical condition, its time evolution exactly coincides with an m-geodesic on the statistical manifold of Gaussian distributions. This identification provides a direct physical realization of a geometric concept in information geometry. It implies that purely random processes evolve along informationally straight trajectories, analogous to geodesics in general relativity. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry of informational ``distance" (divergence) plays a fundamental physical role, offering a concrete step toward an equivalence principle for information.</description>

      <title>Low-Gap Hf-HfOx-Hf Josephson Junctions for meV-Scale Particle Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25203v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits have motivated the exploration of Josephson-junction technologies beyond quantum computing, with emerging applications in low-energy photon and phonon detection for astrophysics and dark matter searches. Achieving sensitivity at the THz (meV) scale requires materials with smaller superconducting gaps than those of conventional aluminum or niobium-based devices. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of hafnium (Hf)-based Josephson junctions (Hf-HfOx-Hf), demonstrating Hf as a promising low-Tc material platform for ultra-low threshold single THz photon and single-phonon detection. Structural and chemical analyses reveal crystalline films and well-defined oxide barriers, while electrical transport measurements at both room and cryogenic temperatures exhibit clear Josephson behavior, enabling extraction of key junction parameters such as critical current, superconducting gap and normal-state resistance. This work presents the first comprehensive study of Hf-based junctions and their potential for next-generation superconducting detectors and qubit architectures leveraging low superconducting gap energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise control over rotational angular momentum is at the heart of recent advances in quantum chemistry, quantum simulation, and quantum computation with ultracold bialkali molecules. Each rotational state comprises a rich manifold of hyperfine states arising from combinations of rotation and nuclear spins; this often yields hundreds of transitions available between a given pair of rotational states, and the efficient navigation of this complex space is a current challenge for experiments. Here, we describe a general approach based on a simple heuristic and graph theory to quickly identify optimal sets of states in ultracold bialkali molecules. We explain how to find pathways through the many available transitions to prepare the molecule in a specific state with maximum speed for any desired fidelity. We then examine networks of states where multiple couplings are present at the same time. As example applications, we first identify a closed loop of four states in the RbCs molecule where there is minimal population leakage out of the loop during simultaneous microwave coupling; we then extend the optimisation procedure to account for decoherence induced by magnetic-field noise and obtain an optimal set of 3 states for quantum computation applications.</description>

      <title>Emergent Dynamical Translational Symmetry Breaking as an Order Principle for Localization and Topological Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Localization transitions represent a fundamental class of continuous phase transitions, yet they occur without any accompanying symmetry breaking. We resolve this by introducing the concept of dynamical translational symmetry (DTS), which is defined not by the Hamiltonian but by the long-time dynamics of local observables. Its order parameter, the time-averaged local translational contrast (TLTC), quantitatively diagnoses whether evolution restores or breaks translational equivalence. We demonstrate that the TLTC universally captures the Anderson localization transition, the many-body localization transition, and topological phase transitions, revealing that these disparate phenomena are unified by the emergent breaking of DTS. This work establishes a unified dynamical-symmetry framework for phases transitions beyond the equilibrium paradigm.</description>

Abstract: We construct exact strong zero mode operators (ESZM) in integrable quantum circuits and the spin-1/2 XXZ chain for general open boundary conditions, which break the bulk U(1) symmetry of the time evolution operators. We show that the ESZM is localized around one of the boundaries and induces infinite boundary coherence times. Finally, we prove that the ESZM becomes spatially non-local under the map that relates the spin-1/2 XXZ chain to the asymmetric simple exclusion process, which suggests that it does not play a significant role in the dynamics of the latter.</description>
