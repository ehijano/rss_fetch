      <title>Mechanics and thermodynamics: A link between the two theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we analyze the relationships that should govern the use of thermodynamics in fluid mechanics in a way that we believe is understandable to mathematicians. We also aim to better define the reasons why mechanics and thermodynamics must be correctly linked by showing that the principle of virtual work expressed using a specific internal energy is perfectly suited to fluid mechanics problems, provided that a well-chosen internal energy is proposed.</description>

      <title>Deep squeezing or cooling the fluctuations of a parametric resonator using feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we analyze ways to achieve deep subthreshold parametric squeezing or cooling of a single degree-of-freedom parametric resonator enhanced by a lock-in amplifier feedback loop. Due to the feedback, the dynamics of the parametric resonator becomes more complex and a Hopf bifurcation at the instability threshold can occur. Initially, we calculate the phase-dependent gain of parametric amplification with feedback of an added ac signal. In one approach, we obtain the amplification gain approximately using two independent approaches: the averaging method and the harmonic balance method. We also obtain this gain more exactly using Floquet theory and Green's functions methods. The Hopf bifurcation was predicted by the harmonic balance method and by Floquet theory, but not by the averaging method. In our analysis of fluctuations, we Fourier analyze the response of the parametric resonator with feedback to an added white noise. We were able to calculate, in addition to the noise spectral density, the squeezing of fluctuations in this resonator with feedback. Very strong squeezing or cooling can occur. Deamplification and cooling occur near the Hopf bifurcation, whereas squeezing occurs near a saddle-node bifurcation.</description>

      <title>Radiation-Reaction on the Straight-Line Motion of a Point Charge accelerated by a constant applied Electric Field in an Electromagnetic Bopp-Land\'e-Thomas-Podolsky vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radiation-reaction problem of standard Lorentz electrodynamics with point charges is pathological, standing in contrast to Bopp--Land\'e--Thomas--Podolsky (BLTP) electrodynamics where it is in fact well-defined and calculable, as reported in a previous publication. To demonstrate the viability of BLTP electrodynamics, we consider the BLTP analogue of the radiation reaction of a classical point charge accelerated from rest by a static homogeneous capacitor plate field, and calculate it up to $O(\varkappa^4)$ in a formal expansion about $\varkappa=0$ in powers of $\varkappa$, Bopp's reciprocal length, a new electrodynamics parameter introduced by BLTP theory. In a paper by Carley and Kiessling (arXiv:2303.01720 [physics.class-ph]) the radiation-reaction corrections to test-particle motion were explicitly computed to $O(\varkappa^3)$, the first non-vanishing order. In this article a crucial question regarding this ``small-$\varkappa$'' expansion, raised by Carley and Kiessling, is answered as follows: The motions computed with terms $O(\varkappa^3)$ included are mathematically accurate approximations to {physically reasonable} solutions of the actual BLTP initial value problem for short times $t$, viz. when $\varkappa c t \ll 1$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuo, but their unphysical behavior over {much} longer times does not accurately approximate the actual BLTP solutions even when the dimensionless parameter $\varkappa e^2 / |m_b| c^2 \ll 1$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_b$ the bare rest mass of the electron. This has the important implication that BLTP electrodynamics remains a viable contender for an accurate classical electrodynamics with point charges that does not suffer from the infinite self-interaction problems of textbook Lorentz electrodynamics with point charges.</description>

      <title>Hermitian and non-Hermitian topology in active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-propulsion is a quintessential aspect of biological systems, which can induce nonequilibrium phenomena that have no counterparts in passive systems. Motivated by biophysical interest together with recent advances in experimental techniques, active matter has been a rapidly developing field in physics. Meanwhile, over the past few decades, topology has played a crucial role to understand certain robust properties appearing in condensed matter systems. For instance, the nontrivial topology of band structures leads to the notion of topological insulators, where one can find robust gapless edge modes protected by the bulk band topology. We here review recent progress in an interdisciplinary area of research at the intersection of these two fields. Specifically, we give brief introductions to active matter and band topology in Hermitian systems, and then explain how the notion of band topology can be extended to nonequilibrium (and thus non-Hermitian) systems including active matter. We review recent studies that have demonstrated the intimate connections between active matter and topological materials, where exotic topological phenomena that are unfeasible in passive systems have been found. A possible extension of the band topology to nonlinear systems is also briefly discussed. Active matter can thus provide an ideal playground to explore topological phenomena in qualitatively new realms beyond conservative linear systems.</description>
