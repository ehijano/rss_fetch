      <title>Reactive capacitance of flat patches of arbitrary shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the capacity of a flat partially reactive patch of arbitrary shape to trap independent particles that undergo steady-state diffusion in the three-dimensional space. We focus on the total flux of particles onto the patch that determines its reactive capacitance. To disentangle the respective roles of the reactivity and the shape of the patch, we employ a spectral expansion of the reactive capacitance over a suitable Steklov eigenvalue problem. We derive several bounds on the reactive capacitance to reveal its monotonicity with respect to the reactivity and the shape. Two probabilistic interpretations are presented as well. An efficient numerical tool is developed for solving the associated Steklov spectral problem for patches of arbitrary shape. We propose and validate, both theoretically and numerically, a simple, fully explicit approximation for the reactive capacitance that depends only on the surface area and the electrostatic capacitance of the patch. This approximation opens promising ways to access various characteristics of diffusion-controlled reactions in general domains with multiple small well-separated patches. Direct applications of these results in statistical physics and physical chemistry are discussed.</description>

      <title>Topological index formula in physical waves: spectral flow, Chern index and topological contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a family of pseudodifferential operators (quantum Hamiltonians) on $L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n};\mathbb{C}^{d})$ whose spectrum exhibits two energy bands exchanging a finite number of eigenvalues. We show that this number coincides with the Chern index of a vector bundle associated to the principal symbol (the classical Hamiltonian). This result provides a simple yet illustrative instance of the Atiyah Singer index formula, with applications in areas such as molecular physics, plasma physics or geophysics. We also discuss the phenomenon of topological contact without exchange between energy bands, a feature that cannot be detected by the Chern index or K theory, but rather reflects subtle torsion effects in the homotopy groups of spheres.</description>

      <title>Perturbation Bounds for Low-Rank Inverse Approximations under Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-rank pseudoinverses are widely used to approximate matrix inverses in scalable machine learning, optimization, and scientific computing. However, real-world matrices are often observed with noise, arising from sampling, sketching, and quantization. The spectral-norm robustness of low-rank inverse approximations remains poorly understood. We systematically study the spectral-norm error $\| (\tilde{A}^{-1})_p - A_p^{-1} \|$ for an $n\times n$ symmetric matrix $A$, where $A_p^{-1}$ denotes the best rank-\(p\) approximation of $A^{-1}$, and $\tilde{A} = A + E$ is a noisy observation. Under mild assumptions on the noise, we derive sharp non-asymptotic perturbation bounds that reveal how the error scales with the eigengap, spectral decay, and noise alignment with low-curvature directions of $A$. Our analysis introduces a novel application of contour integral techniques to the \emph{non-entire} function $f(z) = 1/z$, yielding bounds that improve over naive adaptations of classical full-inverse bounds by up to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$. Empirically, our bounds closely track the true perturbation error across a variety of real-world and synthetic matrices, while estimates based on classical results tend to significantly overpredict. These findings offer practical, spectrum-aware guarantees for low-rank inverse approximations in noisy computational environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dynamical Bounds for Quasi-Periodic Operators with Liouville Frequencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish quantum dynamical upper bounds for quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger operators with Liouville frequencies. Our approach combines semi-algebraic discrepancy estimates for the Kronecker sequence $\{n\alpha\}$ with quantitative Green's function estimates adapted to the Liouville setting.</description>

      <title>Spectral Perturbation Bounds for Low-Rank Approximation with Applications to Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in machine learning is to understand how noise or measurement errors affect low-rank approximations, particularly in the spectral norm. This question is especially important in differentially private low-rank approximation, where one aims to preserve the top-$p$ structure of a data-derived matrix while ensuring privacy. Prior work often analyzes Frobenius norm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or under-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast, captures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility guarantees. We establish new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds for symmetric matrices that refine the classical Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem and explicitly capture interactions between a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and an arbitrary symmetric perturbation $E$. Under mild eigengap and norm conditions, our bounds yield sharp estimates for $\|(A + E)_p - A_p\|$, where $A_p$ is the best rank-$p$ approximation of $A$, with improvements of up to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$. As an application, we derive improved utility guarantees for differentially private PCA, resolving an open problem in the literature. Our analysis relies on a novel contour bootstrapping method from complex analysis and extends it to a broad class of spectral functionals, including polynomials and matrix exponentials. Empirical results on real-world datasets confirm that our bounds closely track the actual spectral error under diverse perturbation regimes.</description>

      <title>Solutions to the discrete Pompeiu problem and to the finite Steinhaus tiling problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a nonempty finite subset of the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^k$ $(k\ge 2)$. We prove that if a function $f\colon \mathbb{R}^k\to \mathbb{C}$ is such that the sum of $f$ on every congruent copy of $K$ is zero, then $f$ vanishes everywhere. In fact, a stronger, weighted version is proved. As a corollary we find that every finite subset $K$ of $\mathbb{R}^k$ having at least two elements is a Jackson set; that is, no subset of $\mathbb{R}^k$ intersects every congruent copy of $K$ in exactly one point.</description>

      <title>Crystallization of discrete $N$-particle systems at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the second paper in a series studying the global asymptotics of discrete $N$-particle systems with inverse temperature parameter $\theta$ in the high temperature regime. In the first paper, we established necessary and sufficient conditions for the Law of Large Numbers at high temperature in terms of Jack generating functions. In this paper, we derive a functional equation for the moment generating function of the limiting measure, which enables its analysis using analytic tools. We apply this functional equation to compute the densities of the high temperature limits of the pure Jack measures. As a special case, we obtain the high temperature limit of the large fixed-time distribution of the discrete-space $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion of Gorin-Shkolnikov.
  Two special cases of our densities are the high temperature limits of discrete versions of the G$\beta$E, computed by Allez-Bouchaud-Guionnet in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109 (2012), 094102; arXiv:1205.3598], and L$\beta$E, computed by Allez-Bouchaud-Majumdar-Vivo in [J. Phys. A, vol. 46, no. 1 (2013), 015001; arXiv:1209.6171]. Moreover, we prove the following crystallization phenomenon of the particles in the high temperature limit: the limiting measures are uniformly supported on disjoint intervals with unit gaps and their locations correspond to the zeros of explicit special functions with all roots located in the real line. We also show that these zeros correspond to the spectra of certain unbounded Jacobi operators.</description>
