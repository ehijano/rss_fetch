      <title>Forcing Axioms for Proper Posets Preserving a Topological Property: Consistency Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forcing axioms are generalizations of Baire category principles that allow one to intersect more dense open sets and to do so in a wider variety of circumstances. In this paper we introduce two new forcing axioms related to posets which preserve topological properties of various spaces, specifically the properties of Lindel{\"o}f and countably tight. The focus in this paper is on using Neeman's side conditions iteration schema to prove the consistency of these two forcing axioms. In later work, we will discuss applications of these forcing axioms.</description>

      <title>Nairian Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a hierarchy of models of the Axiom of Determinacy called \emph{Nairian models}. Forcing over the simplest Nairian model, we obtain a model of ${\sf{ZFC}}+{\sf{MM^{++}}}(c)+\neg\square_{\omega_3}+\neg\square(\omega_3)$. Then, fixing $n\in [3, \omega)$, we design a Nairian model and force over it to produce a model of ${\sf{ZFC}}+{\sf{MM^{++}}}(c)+\forall i\in [2, n]\, \neg\square(\omega_i)$. We also build a Nairian model that satisfies ${\sf{ZF}}+"\omega_1$ is a supercompact cardinal."
  We obtain as corollaries of these constructions
  (1) the consistent failure of the Iterability Conjecture for the Mitchell-Schindler $\sf{K}^{c}$ construction,
  (2) the consistent failure of the Iterability Conjecture for the $\sf{K}^{c}$ construction using $2^{2^{\dots 2^{\omega}}}$-complete (for any finite stack of exponents) background extenders, answering a strong version of a question asked by Steel, and
  (3) a negative answer to Trang's question whether ${\sf{ZF}}+"\omega_1$ is a supercompact cardinal" is equiconsistent with ${\sf{ZFC}}+"$there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals that are limits of Woodin cardinals."
  These corollaries identify obstructions to extending the methods of (descriptive) inner model theory past a Woodin cardinal which is a limit of Woodin cardinals.</description>

      <title>Rank stability in quadratic extensions and Hilbert's tenth problem for the ring of integers of a number field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for any quadratic extension of number fields $K/F$, there exists an abelian variety $A/F$ of positive rank whose rank does not grow upon base change to $K$. This result implies that Hilbert's tenth problem over the ring of integers of any number field has a negative solution. That is, for the ring $\mathcal{O}_K$ of integers of any number field $K$, there does not exist an algorithm that answers the question of whether a polynomial equation in several variables over $\mathcal{O}_K$ has solutions in $\mathcal{O}_K$.</description>

      <title>The Largest Suslin Axiom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.04396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the basic fine structure theory of the minimal model of the Largest Suslin Axiom. In particular, we prove that that the minimal model of the Largest Suslin Axiom satisfies the Mouse Set Conjecture, and that the Proper Forcing Axiom implies the minimal model of the Largest Suslin Axiom exists.</description>

      <title>Conditional algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drawing on the classic paper by Chellas "Basic conditional logic" (1975), we propose a general algebraic framework for studying a binary operation of conditional that models universal features of the "if..., then..." connective as strictly related to the unary modal necessity operator. To this end, we introduce a variety of conditional algebras, and we develop its duality and canonical extensions theory.</description>

      <title>Coding is hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central topic in mathematical logic is the classification of theorems from mathematics in hierarchies according to their logical strength. Ideally, the place of a theorem in a hierarchy does not depend on the representation (aka coding) used. In this paper, we show that the standard representation of compact metric spaces in second-order arithmetic has a profound effect. To this end, we study basic theorems for such spaces like a continuous function has a supremum and a countable set has measure zero. We show that these and similar third-order statements imply at least Feferman's highly non-constructive projection principle, and even full second-order arithmetic or countable choice in some cases. When formulated with representations (aka codes), the associated second-order theorems are provable in rather weak fragments of second-order arithmetic. Thus, we arrive at the slogan that coding compact metric spaces in the language of second-order arithmetic can be as hard as second-order arithmetic or countable choice. We believe every mathematician should be aware of this slogan, as central foundational topics in mathematics make use of the standard second-order representation of compact metric spaces. In the process of collecting evidence for the above slogan, we establish a number of equivalences involving Feferman's projection principle and countable choice. We also study generalisations to fourth-order arithmetic and beyond with similar-but-stronger results.</description>

      <title>Pantograph: A Machine-to-Machine Interaction Interface for Advanced Theorem Proving, High Level Reasoning, and Data Extraction in Lean 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine-assisted theorem proving refers to the process of conducting structured reasoning to automatically generate proofs for mathematical theorems. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in using machine learning models in conjunction with proof assistants to perform this task. In this paper, we introduce Pantograph, a tool that provides a versatile interface to the Lean 4 proof assistant and enables efficient proof search via powerful search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search. In addition, Pantograph enables high-level reasoning by enabling a more robust handling of Lean 4's inference steps. We provide an overview of Pantograph's architecture and features. We also report on an illustrative use case: using machine learning models and proof sketches to prove Lean 4 theorems. Pantograph's innovative features pave the way for more advanced machine learning models to perform complex proof searches and high-level reasoning, equipping future researchers to design more versatile and powerful theorem provers.</description>

      <title>The Alternation Hierarchy of First-Order Logic on Words is Decidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for any $i &gt; 0$, it is decidable, given a regular language, whether it is expressible in the $\Sigma_i[&lt;]$ fragment of first-order logic FO[&lt;]. This settles a question open since 1971.
  Our main technical result relies on the notion of polynomial closure of a class of languages $\mathcal{V}$, that is, finite unions of languages of the form $L_0a_1L_1\cdots a_nL_n$ where each $a_i$ is a letter and each $L_i$ a language of $\mathcal{V}$. We show that if a class $\mathcal{V}$ of regular languages with some closure properties (namely, a positive variety) has a decidable separation problem, then so does its polynomial closure Pol($\mathcal{V}$). The resulting algorithm for Pol($\mathcal{V}$) has time complexity that is exponential in the time complexity for $\mathcal{V}$ and we propose a natural conjecture that would lead to a polynomial time blowup instead.
  Corollaries include the decidability of half levels of the dot-depth hierarchy and the group-based concatenation hierarchy.</description>
