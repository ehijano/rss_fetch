      <title>Developable Ruled Surfaces Generated by the Curvature Axis of a Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruled surfaces play an important role in various types of design, architecture, manufacturing, art, and sculpture. They can be created in a variety of ways, which is a topic that has been the subject of much discussion in mathematics and engineering journals. In geometric modelling, ideas are successful if they are not too complex for engineers and practitioners to understand and not too difficult to implement, because these specialists put mathematical theories into practice by implementing them in CAD/CAM systems. Some of these popular systems such as AutoCAD, Solidworks, CATIA, Rhinoceros 3D, and others are based on simple polynomial or rational splines and many other beautiful mathematical theories that have not yet been implemented due to their complexity. Based on this philosophy, in the present work, we investigate a simple way to generate ruled surfaces whose generators are the curvature axes of curves. We show that this type of ruled surface is a developable surface and that there is at least one curve whose curvature axis is a line on the given developable surface. In addition, we discuss the classifications of developable surfaces corresponding to space curves with singularities, while these curves and surfaces are most often avoided in practical design. Our research also contributes to the understanding of the singularities of developable surfaces and, in their visualisation, proposes the use of environmental maps with a circular pattern that creates flower-like structures around the singularities.</description>

      <title>Global Geometry within an SPDE Well-Posedness Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a closed Riemannian manifold, we construct a family of intrinsic Gaussian noises indexed by a regularity parameter $\alpha\geq0$ to study the well-posedness of the Parabolic Anderson model. We show that with rough initial conditions, the equation is well-posed assuming non-positive curvature with a condition on $\alpha$ similar to that of Riesz kernel-correlated noise in Euclidean space. The argument was made in direct mode, showing that it is possible to bypass Fourier analysis, which was used in all previous work with rough initial conditions. Non-positive curvature was used to overcome a new difficulty introduced by non-uniqueness of geodesics in this setting, which required exploration of global geometry. The well-posedness argument also produces exponentially growing in time upper bounds for the moments. Using the good structure of our noise, we obtain new exponentially growing in time second moment lower bounds for our solutions with bounded initial condition.</description>

      <title>A bialgebra theory of post-Lie algebras via Manin triples and generalized Hessian Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a bialgebra theory of post-Lie algebras that can be characterized by Manin triples of post-Lie algebras associated to a bilinear form satisfying certain invariant conditions. In the absence of dual representations for adjoint representations of post-Lie algebras, we utilize the geometric interpretation of post-Lie algebras to find the desired invariant condition, by generalizing pseudo-Hessian Lie groups to allow constant torsion for the flat connection. The resulting notion is a generalized pseudo-Hessian post-Lie algebra, which is a post-Lie algebra equipped with a nondegenerate symmetric invariant bilinear form. Moreover, generalized pseudo-Hessian post-Lie algebras are also naturally obtained from quadratic Rota-Baxter Lie algebras of weight one. On the other hand, the notion of partial-pre-post-Lie algebra (pp-post-Lie algebras) is introduced as the algebraic structure underlying generalized pseudo-Hessian post-Lie algebras, by splitting one of the two binary operations of post-Lie algebras. The notion of pp-post-Lie bialgebras is introduced as the equivalent structure of Manin triples of post-Lie algebras associated to a nondegenerate symmetric invariant bilinear form, thereby establishing a bialgebra theory for post-Lie algebras via the Manin triple approach. We also study the related analogs of the classical Yang-Baxter equation, $\mathcal O$-operators and successors for pp-post-Lie algebras. In particular, there is a construction of pp-post-Lie bialgebras from the successors of pp-post-Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>$A_\infty$-Algebras from Lie Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.16769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an inclusion $A\hookrightarrow L$ of Lie algebroids sharing the same base manifold $M$, i.e. a Lie pair, we prove that the space $\Gamma(\Lambda^\bullet A^\vee)\otimes_{R} \frac{U(L)}{U(L)\cdot\Gamma(A)}$, where $R=C^\infty(M)$, admits an $A_\infty$-algebra structure, unique up to $A_\infty$-isomorphisms. As a consequence, the Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology $H^\bullet_{CE} \big( A, \frac{U(L)}{U(L)\cdot\Gamma(A)} \big)$ admits a canonical associative algebra structure. This $A_\infty$-algebra can be considered as the universal enveloping algebra of the $L_\infty$-algebroid $A[1]\times_M L/A$. Our construction is based on the homotopy equivalence of the $L_\infty$-algebroid $A[1]\times_M L/A$ and the dg Lie algebroid corresponding to the comma double Lie algebroid of Jotz-Mackenzie.</description>

      <title>A conformal Hopf-Rinow theorem for semi-Riemannian spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08682v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The famous Hopf-Rinow Theorem states, amongst others, that a Riemannian manifold is metrically complete if and only if it is geodesically complete. The Clifton-Pohl torus fails to be geodesically complete proving that this theorem cannot be generalized to compact Lorentzian manifolds. On the other hand, Hopf and Rinow characterized metric completeness also by properness. Garc\'ia-Heveling and the author recently obtained a Lorentzian completeness-compactness result for open manifolds with a similar flavor. In this manuscript, we extend the null distance used in this approach and our theorem to proper cone structures and to a new class of semi-Riemannian manifolds, dubbed $(n-\nu,\nu)$-spacetimes. Moreover, we demonstrate that our result implies, and hence generalizes, the metric part of the Hopf-Rinow Theorem.</description>

Abstract: We show the non-compactness of moduli space of solutions of the monopole equations for $3/2$-spinors on a closed 3-manifold is equivalent to the existence of `3/2-Fueter sections' that are solutions of an overdetermined non-linear elliptic differential equation. These are sections of a fiber bundle whose fiber is a special 4-dimensional submanifold of the hyperk\"ahler manifold of center-framed charged one $SU(2)$-instantons on $\mathbf{R}^4$. This fiber bundle does not inherit a hyperk\"ahler structure.</description>

      <title>Inverse mean curvature flow with outer obstacle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new boundary condition for the weak inverse mean curvature flow, which gives canonical and non-trivial solutions in bounded domains. Roughly speaking, the boundary of the domain serves as an outer obstacle, and the evolving hypersurfaces are assumed to stick tangentially to the boundary upon contact. In smooth bounded domains, we prove an existence and uniqueness theorem for weak solutions, and establish $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity of the level sets up to the obstacle. The proof combines various techniques, including elliptic regularization, blow-up analysis, and certain parabolic estimates. As an analytic application, we address the well-posedness problem for the usual weak inverse mean curvature flow, showing that the initial value problem always admits a unique maximal (or innermost) weak solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify nilpotent Lie algebras with complex structures of weakly non-nilpotent type in real dimension eight, which is the lowest dimension where they arise. Our study, together with previous results on strongly non-nilpotent structures, completes the classification of 8-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebras admitting complex structures of non-nilpotent type. As an application, we identify those that support a pseudo-K\"ahler metric, thus providing new counterexamples to a previous conjecture and an infinite family of (Ricci-flat) non-flat neutral Calabi-Yau structures. Moreover, we arrive at the topological restriction $b_1(X)\geq 3$ for every pseudo-K\"ahler nilmanifold $X$ with invariant complex structure, up to complex dimension four.</description>

      <title>Connections on a principal Lie groupoid bundle and representations up to homotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Lie groupoid principal $\mbbX$ bundle is a surjective submersion $\pi\colon P\to M$ with an action of $\mathbb{X}$ on $P$ with certain additional conditions. This paper offers a suitable definition for the notion of a connection on such bundles. Although every Lie groupoid $\mathbb{X}$ has its associated Lie algebroid $A:=1^*\ker ds\to X_0$, it does not admit a natural action on its Lie algebroid. There is no natural action of $\mathbb{X}$ on $TP$ either. Choosing a connection $\mathbb{H}\subset TX_1$ on the Lie groupoid $\mathbb{X},$ and considering its induced action up to homotopy of $\mathbb{X}$ on graded vector bundle $TX_0\oplus A,$ we prove the existence of a short exact sequence of diffeological groupoids over the discrete category $M$ (with appropriate vector space structures on the fibres) for the $\mbbX$ bundle $\pi\colon P\to M.$ We introduce a notion of connection on $\mbbX$ bundle $\pi\colon P\to M,$ and show that such a connection $\omega$ splits the sequence. Finally, we show that a connection pair $(\omega, \mathbb{H})$ on $\mbbX$ bundle $\pi\colon P\to M$ is isomorphic to any other connection pair.}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.07942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of supersymmetric quantum mechanics we formulate new supersymmetric localization principle, with application to trace formulas for a full thermal partition function. Unlike the standard localization principle, this new principle allows to compute the supertrace of non-supersymmetric observables, and is based on the existence of fermionic zero modes. We describe corresponding new invariant supersymmetric deformations of the path integral; they differ from the standard deformations arising from the circle action and require higher derivatives terms. Consequently, we prove that the path integral localizes to periodic orbits and not not only on constant ones. We illustrate the principle by deriving bosonic trace formulas on compact Lie groups, including classical Jacobi inversion formula.</description>

Abstract: We prove a central limit theorem for smooth linear statistics associated with zero divisors of standard Gaussian holomorphic sections in a sequence of holomorphic line bundles with Hermitian metrics of class $\mathscr{C}^{3}$ over a compact K\"{a}hler manifold. In the course of our analysis, we derive first-order asymptotics and upper decay estimates for near and off-diagonal Bergman kernels, respectively. These results are essential for determining the statistical properties of the zeros of random holomorphic sections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use conformal geometry methods and the construction of Friedrich's cylinder at spatial infinity to study the propagation of spin-$0$ fields (solutions to the wave equation) on $n$-dimensional Minkowski spacetimes in a neighbourhood of spatial and null infinity. We obtain formal solutions written in terms of series expansions close to spatial and null infinity and use them to compute non-trivial asymptotic spin-$0$ charges. It is shown that if one considers the most general initial data within the class considered in this paper, the expansion is poly-homogeneous and hence of restricted regularity at null infinity. Furthermore, we derive the conditions on the initial data needed to obtain regular solutions and well-defined limits for the asymptotic charges at the critical sets where null infinity and spatial infinity meet. In even dimensions, we find that there are infinitely many well-defined asymptotic charges at the critical sets, while for odd higher dimensions there exists no non-trivial asymptotic charges that remain regular at the critical sets.</description>

      <title>Supervised Quadratic Feature Analysis: An Information Geometry Approach to Dimensionality Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supervised dimensionality reduction aims to map labeled data to a low-dimensional feature space while maximizing class discriminability. Despite the availability of methods for learning complex non-linear features (e.g. Deep Learning), there is an enduring demand for dimensionality reduction methods that learn linear features due to their interpretability, low computational cost, and broad applicability. However, there is a gap between methods that optimize linear separability (e.g. LDA), and more flexible but computationally expensive methods that optimize over arbitrary class boundaries (e.g. metric-learning methods). Here, we present Supervised Quadratic Feature Analysis (SQFA), a dimensionality reduction method for learning linear features that maximize the differences between class-conditional first- and second-order statistics, which allow for quadratic discrimination. SQFA exploits the information geometry of second-order statistics in the symmetric positive definite manifold. We show that SQFA features support quadratic discriminability in real-world problems. We also provide a theoretical link, based on information geometry, between SQFA and the Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) classifier.</description>
