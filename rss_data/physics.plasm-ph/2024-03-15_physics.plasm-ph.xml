      <title>Stable high-transformer ratio beam-wakefield acceleration in cusp plasma channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wakefield excitation by structured electron bunches in hollow gaps between plasma wedges is studied using three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. The main part of the electron bunch has a triangular current distribution in the longitudinal direction with a smooth head and short tail. These bunches propagate stably in the hollow gap while being attached to cusps of the plasma wedges. The excited wakefield profile may have a very high transformer ratio and allows to accelerate witness bunches to energies much higher than that of the driver bunch. Unlike round hollow channels, where asymmetric wakefields are difficult to avoid, no deleterious transverse beam break-up (BBU) is observed in the gap between cusp-shaped plasma layers.</description>

      <title>Flat-top plasma operational space of the STEP power plant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: STEP is a spherical tokamak prototype power plant that is being designed to demonstrate net electric power. The design phase involves the exploitation of plasma models to optimise fusion performance subject to satisfying various physics and engineering constraints. A modelling workflow, including integrated core plasma modelling, MHD stability analysis, SOL and pedestal modelling, coil set and free boundary equilibrium solvers, and whole plant design, has been developed to specify the design parameters and to develop viable scenarios. The integrated core plasma model JETTO is used to develop individual flat-top operating points that satisfy imposed criteria for fusion power performance within operational constraints. Key plasma parameters such as normalised beta, Greenwald density fraction, auxiliary power and radiated power have been scanned to scope the operational space and to derive a collection of candidate non-inductive flat-top points. The assumed auxiliary heating and current drive is either from electron cyclotron systems only or a combination of electron cyclotron and electron Bernstein waves. At present stages of transport modelling, there is a large uncertainty in overall confinement for relevant parameter regimes. For each of the two auxiliary heating and current drive systems scenarios, two candidate flat-top points have been developed based on different confinement assumptions, totalling to four operating points. A lower confinement assumption generally suggests operating points in high-density, high auxiliary power regimes, whereas higher confinement would allow access to a broader parameter regime in density and power while maintaining target fusion power performance.</description>

      <title>Hyperelasticity of Blood Clots: Bridging the Gap between Microscopic and Continuum Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The biomechanical properties of blood clots, which are dictated by their compositions and micro-structures, play a critical role in determining their fates, occlusion, persistency, or embolization in the human circulatory system. While numerous constitutive models have emerged to describe the biomechanics of blood clots, the majority of these models have primarily focused on the macroscopic deformation of the clots and the resultant strain-stress correlations without depicting the microscopic contributions from their structural components, such as fibrin fibers, fibrin network and red blood cells. This work addresses the gap in current scientific understanding by quantifying how changes in the microstructure of blood clots affect its mechanical responses under different external stresses. We leverage our previous published work to develop a hyperelastic potential model for blood clots, which incorporates six distinct strain-energy components to describe the alignment of fibers, the entropic and enthalpic stretching of fibrin fibers, the buckling of these fibers, clot densification, and clot jamming.These strain-energy components are represented by a combination of simple harmonic oscillators, one-sided harmonic potentials, and a Gaussian potential. The proposed model, which is C0, C1, and C2 continuous with a total of 13 parameters, has been validated against three data sets: fibrin clot in tension, blood clot in compression, and blood clots in shear, demonstrating its robustness. Subsequent simulations of a microscopic blood clot model are performed to uncover mechanistic correlations for a majority of the hyperelastic potential's stiffness/strain parameters. Our results show that only one proposed term concerning fiber buckling needs further refinement, while the remaining five strain-energy terms appear to describe precisely what they were intended to.</description>

      <title>Energy-dependent implementation of secondary electron emission models in continuum kinetic sheath simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The plasma-material interactions present in multiple fusion and propulsion concepts between the flow of plasma through a channel and a material wall drive the emission of secondary electrons. This emission is capable of altering the fundamental structure of the sheath region, significantly changing the expected particle fluxes to the wall. The emission spectrum is separated into two major energy regimes, a peak of elastically backscattered primary electrons at the incoming energy, and cold secondary electrons inelastically emitted directly from the material. The ability of continuum kinetic simulations to accurately represent the secondary electron emission is limited by relevant models being formulated in terms of monoenergetic particle interactions which cannot be applied directly to the discrete distribution function. As a result, rigorous implementation of energy-dependent physics is often neglected in favor of simplified, constant models. We present here a novel implementation of semi-empirical models in the boundary of continuum kinetic simulations which allows the full range of this emission to be accurately captured in physically-relevant regimes.</description>

      <title>Design and Analysis of Pseudospin-Polarized Ultra-Wideband Waveguide Supporting Hybrid Spoof Surface Plasmon Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, novel low-loss waveguides and power dividers for ultra-broadband surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are introduced. This article uses complementary metasurfaces in place of traditional SPP, which are typically produced as metasurface unit cells on the dielectric sublayer. It has been demonstrated that the use of complementary metasurfaces considerably improves wave confinement and inhibits wave propagation. Because of this, it is anticipated that waveguides and power dividers made from these complimentary unit cells will have significantly lower losses and greater bandwidth than SPP used in traditional devices. In the frequency range of 0 GHz to 100 GHz, waveguides and bent waveguides with complementary metasurface unit cells exhibit insertion loss greater than 0.5 dB. Utilizing complementary metasurfaces, symmetric and asymmetric power dividers have been created and researched. The results of the simulation have shown that using this type of unit cell in the construction of microwave devices is advantageous.</description>
