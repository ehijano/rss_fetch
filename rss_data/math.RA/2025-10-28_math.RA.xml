      <title>Rings Such That $u-1$ Lies In $J^{\#}(R)$ For Each Unit $u$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the so-called {\it $UJ^{\#}$ rings}, a new type of rings in which every unit can be written as $1+j$ with $j\in J^{\#}(R)$. These rings were defined and studied by Saini-Udar in Czechoslovak Math. J. (2025) under the name {\it $\sqrt{J}U$ rings}. (See \cite{SU}.)
  This class extends both the classes of UU and UJ rings, but also has its own special properties. In this study, we present some additional results about $UJ^{\#}$ rings that supply those from \cite{SU} explaining their connections with Dedekind-finite, semi-potent and Boolean rings, respectively, as well as we give several characterizations in this direction. We also examine how these rings behave under common ring constructions and find conditions for group rings to be $UJ^{\#}$. Moreover, our establishments shed a clearer picture of how unit elements interact with radical-like parts of a ring.</description>

      <title>Trusses, ditrusses, weak trusses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we extend to left skew trusses $(T,+,\circ,\sigma)$ previous work on left skew rings. We had presented a left skew ring as a group $(N,+)$ with two binary operations $\circ$ and $\cdot$ with $\circ$ associative, $\cdot$ left distributive over the addition $+$ of the group, and such that the difference of the two operations $\circ$ and $\cdot$ is the binary operation $\pi_1\colon N\times N\to N$. Here we extend this idea to the left skew trusses introduced in 2019 by Brzezi\'nski, replacing the operation $\pi_1$ with the binary operation $\sigma\pi_1\colon T\times T\to T$. The case where the semigroup morphism $\lambda^T\colon T\to \End_\Gp(T,+)$ is constant turns out to be particular interesting. We get several canonical category isomorphisms. For instance, we get a category isomorphism between the category of all left skew trusses $(T,+,\circ,\sigma)$ with $\lambda^T\colon (T,\circ)\to \End_\Gp(T,+)$ a constant semigroup morphism and $\sigma,\lambda^T_0$ image-commuting idempotent endomorphisms and the category of all associative interchange near-rings. Interchange near-rings were introduced by Edmunds in 2016. When $\sigma$ is an idempotent group endomorphism of the group $(T,+)$ and $\lambda^T\colon (T,\circ)\to \End_\Gp(T,+)$ is a semigroup morphism constantly equal to a group endomorphism $\tau$, we also get a sort of duality exchanging the mappings $\sigma$ and $\tau$.</description>

      <title>Associative ternary algebras and ternary Lie algebras at cube roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an approach to extending the concept of a Lie algebra to ternary structures based on $\omega$-symmetry, where $\omega$ is a primitive cube root of unity. We give a definition of a corresponding structure, called a ternary Lie algebra at cube roots of unity, or a ternary $\omega$-Lie algebra. A method for constructing ternary associative algebras has been developed. For ternary algebras, the notions of the ternary $\omega$-associator and the ternary $\omega$-commutator are introduced. It is shown that if a ternary algebra possesses the property of associativity of the first or second kind, then the ternary $\omega$-commutator on this algebra determines the structure of a ternary $\omega$-Lie algebra. Ternary algebras of cubic matrices with associative ternary multiplication of the second kind are considered. The structure of the 8-dimensional ternary $\omega$-Lie algebra of cubic matrices of the second order is studied, and all its subalgebras of dimensions 2 and 3 are determined.</description>

Abstract: It is proved that the roots of the derivative of a polynomial with quaternionic coefficients belong to the union of the intersections of sets defined in terms of certain projections of a polynomial. The result strengthens the quaternion version of Gauss-Lucas theorem, proved by Ghiloni and Perotti in 2018.</description>

      <title>Coalgebraic models of Omega-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate models of algebraic theories in the category of cocommutative coalgebras over a field. We establish some of their categorical properties, similar to those of algebraic varieties. We introduce a class of categories of coalgebraic models of algebraic theories endowed with an underlying structure of cocommutative Hopf algebra, and show that these categories are semi-abelian. We call them ``categories of Omega-Hopf algebras'', since it is possible to characterize them as coalgebraic models of algebraic theories of Omega-groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an elementary proof of the statement that if an idempotent complete additive category has weak kernels and weak cokernels, then it has $n$-kernels if and only if it has $n$-cokernels, where $n$ is a nonnegative integer. As a consequence, elementary proofs of two results concerning the equality between the global dimensions of certain right and left module categories are obtained.</description>

      <title>On generalized inverses of matrices associated with certain graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate generalized inverses of matrices associated with two classes of digraphs: double star digraphs and D-linked stars digraphs. For double star digraphs, we determine the Drazin index and derive explicit formulas for the Drazin inverse. We also provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the Moore-Penrose inverse and give its explicit expression whenever it exists. For D-linked stars digraphs, we characterize when the group inverse exists and obtain its explicit form. In the singular case where BC = 0, we express the Drazin index of the matrix in terms of the Drazin index of the base digraph matrix. Additionally, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for Moore--Penrose invertibility and derive explicit formulas in that case. Our results reveal a clear connection between the algebraic structure of generalized inverses and the combinatorial properties of these graph classes, providing a unified framework for group, Drazin, and Moore-Penrose invertibility.</description>

Abstract: Flat modules play an important role in the study of the category of modules over rings and in the characterization of some classes of rings. We study the e-flatness for semimodules introduced by the first author using his new notion of exact sequences of semimodules and its relationships with other notions of flatness for semimodules over semirings. We also prove that a subtractive semiring over which every right (left) semimodule is e-flat is a von Neumann regular semiring.</description>

      <title>Menichetti's nonassociative $G$-crossed product algebras and Menichetti codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of nonassociative algebras in code design and consider codes with nonassociative ambient algebras other than the well-known skew polycyclic codes. We define and investigate Menichetti algebras and identify them as important elements in the semiassociative Brauer monoid. Menichetti algebras can be viewed as generalisations of $G$-crossed product algebras; they are $n^2$-dimensional algebras with an $n$-dimensional Galois field extension $K/F$ with Galois group $G$ in their nucleus. We then extend the class of linear error-correcting codes obtained from left principal ideals in their ambient algebra using the opposite algebras of Menichetti algebras as ambient algebra. With the right choice of algebra they display symmetric and cyclic properties which promise efficient decoding algorithms. Well-known examples of such Menichetti codes are those skew constacyclic codes which have a nonassociative $G$-crossed product algebra (a nonassociative cyclic algebra) as their ambient algebra.</description>

      <title>On semigroups that are prime in the sense of Tarski, and groups prime in the senses of Tarski and of Rhodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $\mathcal{C}$ is a category of algebras closed under finite direct products, and $M_\mathcal{C}$ the commutative monoid of isomorphism classes of members of $\mathcal{C},$ with operation induced by direct product, A.Tarski defined a nonidentity element $p$ of $M_\mathcal{C}$ to be prime if, whenever it divides a product of two elements in that monoid, it divides one of them, and called an object of $\mathcal{C}$ prime if its isomorphism class has this property.
  McKenzie, McNulty and Taylor ask whether the category of nonempty semigroups has any prime objects. We show in section 2 that it does not. However, for the category of monoids, and some other subcategories of semigroups, we obtain examples of prime objects in sections 3-4. In section 5, two related questions open so far as I know, are recalled.
  In section 6, which can be read independently of the rest of this note, we recall two related conditions that are called primeness by semigroup theorists, and obtain results and examples on the relationships among those two conditions and Tarski's, in categories of groups. Section 7 notes an interesting characterization of one of those conditions when applied to finite algebras in an arbitrary variety.
  Various questions are raised.</description>

      <title>Pointed Hopf algebras, the Dixmier-Moeglin Equivalence and Noetherian group algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the interactions between three properties that a group algebra or more generally a pointed Hopf algebra may possess: being noetherian, having finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension, and satisfying the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence. First it is shown that the second and third of these properties are equivalent for group algebras $kG$ of polycyclic-by-finite groups, and are, in turn, equivalent to $G$ being nilpotent-by-finite. In characteristic $0$, this enables us to extend this equivalence to certain cocommutative Hopf algebras.
  In sections 3 and 4 of the paper finiteness conditions for group algebras are studied. Thus in $\S$3 we examine when a group algebra satisfies the Goldie conditions, while in the final section we discuss what can be said about a minimal counterexample to the conjecture that if $kG$ is noetherian then $G$ is polycyclic-by-finite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the rationality problem for multinorm one tori, a natural generalization of norm one tori. For multinorm one tori that split over finite Galois extensions with nilpotent Galois group, we prove that stable rationality and retract rationality are equivalent, and give a criterion for the validity of the above two conditions. This generalizes the result of Endo (2011) on the rationality problem for norm one tori. To accomplish it, we introduce a generalization of character groups of multinorm one tori. Moreover, we establish systematic reduction methods originating in work of Endo (2001) for an investigation of the rationality problem for arbitrary multinorm one tori. In addition, we provide a new example for which the multinorm principle holds.</description>

      <title>Tilting theory for hypersurface singularities of dimension one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any $\mathbb{N}$-graded commutative Gorenstein ring $R$ of Krull dimension one with $R_0$ a field admits a standard silting object $V$ in the stable category $\underline{\mathrm{CM}}_0^{\mathbb{Z}}R$, and the object $V$ is tilting if and only if the $a$-invariant $a$ is non-negative, as shown by Buchweitz, the first author, and Yamaura. In this article, under the additional assumption that $R$ is a hypersurface singularity, we prove that endomorphism algebra of $V$ is Iwanaga-Gorenstein of self-injective dimension at most $2$, and we give its explicit presentation in terms of a quiver with relation. In the case of where $a$ is negative, we prove that the dg endomorphism algebra of $V$ is Gorenstein, and we give its explicit presentation in terms of a dg path algebra. We explain our results by several examples including numerical semigroup algebras generated by two elements. Moreover, for each finite and countable Cohen-Macaulay representation type, we include the Auslander-Reiten quiver of the category $\mathrm{CM}_0^{\mathbb{Z}}R$ with the position of the standard silting object. As a step of the proof of our results, we give a characterization of Gorensteinness of homologically finite dg algebras in terms of Serre functors.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study Clifford algebra construction from the perspective of adjunctions motivated by the general framework of Krashen and Lieblich. We introduce a category of weighted polynomial laws whose associated Clifford algebra functor is a left adjoint on this category. We introduce a notion of lifting weighted polynomial laws generalizing explicit constructions of Krashen and Lieblich. As another application, we construct derived Clifford algebras of derived homogeneous polynomial forms of arbitrary degree with noncommutative coefficients.</description>
