      <title>Modeling social interaction dynamics using temporal graph networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating intelligent systems, such as robots, into dynamic group settings poses challenges due to the mutual influence of human behaviors and internal states. A robust representation of social interaction dynamics is essential for effective human-robot collaboration. Existing approaches often narrow their focus to facial expressions or speech, overlooking the broader context. We propose employing an adapted Temporal Graph Networks to comprehensively represent social interaction dynamics while enabling its practical implementation. Our method incorporates temporal multi-modal behavioral data including gaze interaction, voice activity and environmental context. This representation of social interaction dynamics is trained as a link prediction problem using annotated gaze interaction data. The F1-score outperformed the baseline model by 37.0%. This improvement is consistent for a secondary task of next speaker prediction which achieves an improvement of 29.0%. Our contributions are two-fold, including a model to representing social interaction dynamics which can be used for many downstream human-robot interaction tasks like human state inference and next speaker prediction. More importantly, this is achieved using a more concise yet efficient message passing method, significantly reducing it from 768 to 14 elements, while outperforming the baseline model.</description>

      <title>Incremental XAI: Memorable Understanding of AI with Incremental Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many explainable AI (XAI) techniques strive for interpretability by providing concise salient information, such as sparse linear factors. However, users either only see inaccurate global explanations, or highly-varying local explanations. We propose to provide more detailed explanations by leveraging the human cognitive capacity to accumulate knowledge by incrementally receiving more details. Focusing on linear factor explanations (factors $\times$ values = outcome), we introduce Incremental XAI to automatically partition explanations for general and atypical instances by providing Base + Incremental factors to help users read and remember more faithful explanations. Memorability is improved by reusing base factors and reducing the number of factors shown in atypical cases. In modeling, formative, and summative user studies, we evaluated the faithfulness, memorability and understandability of Incremental XAI against baseline explanation methods. This work contributes towards more usable explanation that users can better ingrain to facilitate intuitive engagement with AI.</description>

      <title>SARA: Smart AI Reading Assistant for Reading Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SARA integrates Eye Tracking and state-of-the-art large language models in a mixed reality framework to enhance the reading experience by providing personalized assistance in real-time. By tracking eye movements, SARA identifies the text segments that attract the user's attention the most and potentially indicate uncertain areas and comprehension issues. The process involves these key steps: text detection and extraction, gaze tracking and alignment, and assessment of detected reading difficulty. The results are customized solutions presented directly within the user's field of view as virtual overlays on identified difficult text areas. This support enables users to overcome challenges like unfamiliar vocabulary and complex sentences by offering additional context, rephrased solutions, and multilingual help. SARA's innovative approach demonstrates it has the potential to transform the reading experience and improve reading proficiency.</description>

      <title>ChildCIdbLong: Longitudinal Child-Computer Interaction Database and Quantitative Analysis for Child Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides a comprehensive overview of recent research in the area of Child-Computer Interaction (CCI). The main contributions of the present article are two-fold. First, we present a novel longitudinal CCI database named ChildCIdbLong, which comprises over 600 children aged 18 months to 8 years old, acquired continuously over 4 academic years (2019-2023). As a result, ChildCIdbLong comprises over 12K test acquisitions over a tablet device. Different tests are considered in ChildCIdbLong, requiring different touch and stylus gestures, enabling evaluation of skills like hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills, planning, and visual tracking, among others. In addition to the ChildCIdbLong database, we propose a novel quantitative metric called Test Quality (Q), designed to measure the motor and cognitive development of children through their interaction with a tablet device. In order to provide a better comprehension of the proposed Q metric, popular percentile-based growth representations are introduced for each test, providing a two-dimensional space to compare children's development with respect to the typical age skills of the population.
  The results achieved in the present article highlight the potential of the novel ChildCIdbLong database in conjunction with the proposed Q metric to measure the motor and cognitive development of children as they grow up. The proposed framework could be very useful as an automatic tool to support child experts (e.g., paediatricians, educators, or neurologists) for early detection of potential physical/cognitive impairments during children's development.</description>

      <title>Untangling Critical Interaction with AI in Students Written Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a ubiquitous part of society, but a key challenge exists in ensuring that humans are equipped with the required critical thinking and AI literacy skills to interact with machines effectively by understanding their capabilities and limitations. These skills are particularly important for learners to develop in the age of generative AI where AI tools can demonstrate complex knowledge and ability previously thought to be uniquely human. To activate effective human-AI partnerships in writing, this paper provides a first step toward conceptualizing the notion of critical learner interaction with AI. Using both theoretical models and empirical data, our preliminary findings suggest a general lack of Deep interaction with AI during the writing process. We believe that the outcomes can lead to better task and tool design in the future for learners to develop deep, critical thinking when interacting with AI.</description>

      <title>WordDecipher: Enhancing Digital Workspace Communication with Explainable AI for Non-native English Speakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-native English speakers (NNES) face challenges in digital workspace communication (e.g., emails, Slack messages), often inadvertently translating expressions from their native languages, which can lead to awkward or incorrect usage. Current AI-assisted writing tools are equipped with fluency enhancement and rewriting suggestions; however, NNES may struggle to grasp the subtleties among various expressions, making it challenging to choose the one that accurately reflects their intent. Such challenges are exacerbated in high-stake text-based communications, where the absence of non-verbal cues heightens the risk of misinterpretation. By leveraging the latest advancements in large language models (LLM) and word embeddings, we propose WordDecipher, an explainable AI-assisted writing tool to enhance digital workspace communication for NNES. WordDecipher not only identifies the perceived social intentions detected in users' writing, but also generates rewriting suggestions aligned with users' intended messages, either numerically or by inferring from users' writing in their native language. Then, WordDecipher provides an overview of nuances to help NNES make selections. Through a usage scenario, we demonstrate how WordDecipher can significantly enhance an NNES's ability to communicate her request, showcasing its potential to transform workspace communication for NNES.</description>

      <title>"My toxic trait is thinking I'll remember this": gaps in the learner experience of video tutorials for feature-rich software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video tutorials are a popular medium for informal and formal learning. However, when learners attempt to view and follow along with these tutorials, they encounter what we call gaps, that is, issues that can prevent learning. We examine the gaps encountered by users of video tutorials for feature-rich software, such as spreadsheets. We develop a theory and taxonomy of such gaps, identifying how they act as barriers to learning, by collecting and analyzing 360 viewer comments from 90 Microsoft Excel video tutorials published by 43 creators across YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. We conducted contextual interviews with 8 highly influential tutorial creators to investigate the gaps their viewers experience and how they address them. Further, we obtain insights into their creative process and frustrations when creating video tutorials. Finally, we present creators with two designs that aim to address gaps identified in the comment analysis for feedback and alternative design ideas.</description>

      <title>Exploring Physiological Responses in Virtual Reality-based Interventions for Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Data-Driven Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a promising tool for enhancing social skills and emotional well-being in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Through a technical exploration, this study employs a multiplayer serious gaming environment within VR, engaging 34 individuals diagnosed with ASD and employing high-precision biosensors for a comprehensive view of the participants' arousal and responses during the VR sessions. Participants were subjected to a series of 3 virtual scenarios designed in collaboration with stakeholders and clinical experts to promote socio-cognitive skills and emotional regulation in a controlled and structured virtual environment. We combined the framework with wearable non-invasive sensors for bio-signal acquisition, focusing on the collection of heart rate variability, and respiratory patterns to monitor participants behaviors. Further, behavioral assessments were conducted using observation and semi-structured interviews, with the data analyzed in conjunction with physiological measures to identify correlations and explore digital-intervention efficacy. Preliminary analysis revealed significant correlations between physiological responses and behavioral outcomes, indicating the potential of physiological feedback to enhance VR-based interventions for ASD. The study demonstrated the feasibility of using real-time data to adapt virtual scenarios, suggesting a promising avenue to support personalized therapy. The integration of quantitative physiological feedback into digital platforms represents a forward step in the personalized intervention for ASD. By leveraging real-time data to adjust therapeutic content, this approach promises to enhance the efficacy and engagement of digital-based therapies.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Navigation and Comparison Performance of Computational Notebooks on Desktop and in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational notebook serves as a versatile tool for data analysis. However, its conventional user interface falls short of keeping pace with the ever-growing data-related tasks, signaling the need for novel approaches. With the rapid development of interaction techniques and computing environments, there is a growing interest in integrating emerging technologies in data-driven workflows. Virtual reality, in particular, has demonstrated its potential in interactive data visualizations. In this work, we aimed to experiment with adapting computational notebooks into VR and verify the potential benefits VR can bring. We focus on the navigation and comparison aspects as they are primitive components in analysts' workflow. To further improve comparison, we have designed and implemented a Branching&amp;Merging functionality. We tested computational notebooks on the desktop and in VR, both with and without the added Branching&amp;Merging capability. We found VR significantly facilitated navigation compared to desktop, and the ability to create branches enhanced comparison.</description>

      <title>CulturalTeaming: AI-Assisted Interactive Red-Teaming for Challenging LLMs' (Lack of) Multicultural Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frontier large language models (LLMs) are developed by researchers and practitioners with skewed cultural backgrounds and on datasets with skewed sources. However, LLMs' (lack of) multicultural knowledge cannot be effectively assessed with current methods for developing benchmarks. Existing multicultural evaluations primarily rely on expensive and restricted human annotations or potentially outdated internet resources. Thus, they struggle to capture the intricacy, dynamics, and diversity of cultural norms. LLM-generated benchmarks are promising, yet risk propagating the same biases they are meant to measure. To synergize the creativity and expert cultural knowledge of human annotators and the scalability and standardizability of LLM-based automation, we introduce CulturalTeaming, an interactive red-teaming system that leverages human-AI collaboration to build truly challenging evaluation dataset for assessing the multicultural knowledge of LLMs, while improving annotators' capabilities and experiences. Our study reveals that CulturalTeaming's various modes of AI assistance support annotators in creating cultural questions, that modern LLMs fail at, in a gamified manner. Importantly, the increased level of AI assistance (e.g., LLM-generated revision hints) empowers users to create more difficult questions with enhanced perceived creativity of themselves, shedding light on the promises of involving heavier AI assistance in modern evaluation dataset creation procedures. Through a series of 1-hour workshop sessions, we gather CULTURALBENCH-V0.1, a compact yet high-quality evaluation dataset with users' red-teaming attempts, that different families of modern LLMs perform with accuracy ranging from 37.7% to 72.2%, revealing a notable gap in LLMs' multicultural proficiency.</description>

      <title>MathVC: An LLM-Simulated Multi-Character Virtual Classroom for Mathematics Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical modeling (MM) is considered a fundamental skill for students in STEM disciplines. Practicing the MM skill is often the most effective when students can engage in group discussion and collaborative problem-solving. However, due to unevenly distributed teachers and educational resources needed to monitor such group activities, students do not always receive equal opportunities for this practice. Excitingly, large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capability in both modeling mathematical problems and simulating characters with different traits and properties. Drawing inspiration from the advancement of LLMs, in this work, we present MATHVC, the very first LLM-powered virtual classroom containing multiple LLM-simulated student characters, with whom a human student can practice their MM skill. To encourage each LLM character's behaviors to be aligned with their specified math-relevant properties (termed "characteristics alignment") and the overall conversational procedure to be close to an authentic student MM discussion (termed "conversational procedural alignment"), we proposed three innovations: integrating MM domain knowledge into the simulation, defining a symbolic schema as the ground for character simulation, and designing a meta planner at the platform level to drive the conversational procedure. Through experiments and ablation studies, we confirmed the effectiveness of our simulation approach and showed the promise for MATHVC to benefit real-life students in the future.</description>

      <title>Personality-aware Student Simulation for Conversational Intelligent Tutoring Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) can provide personalized and self-paced learning experience. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) further enables better human-machine interaction, and facilitates the development of conversational ITSs in various disciplines such as math and language learning. In dialogic teaching, recognizing and adapting to individual characteristics can significantly enhance student engagement and learning efficiency. However, characterizing and simulating student's persona remain challenging in training and evaluating conversational ITSs. In this work, we propose a framework to construct profiles of different student groups by refining and integrating both cognitive and noncognitive aspects, and leverage LLMs for personality-aware student simulation in a language learning scenario. We further enhance the framework with multi-aspect validation, and conduct extensive analysis from both teacher and student perspectives. Our experimental results show that state-of-the-art LLMs can produce diverse student responses according to the given language ability and personality traits, and trigger teacher's adaptive scaffolding strategies.</description>

      <title>Impact of Extensions on Browser Performance: An Empirical Study on Google Chrome</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Web browsers have been used widely by users to conduct various online activities, such as information seeking or online shopping. To improve user experience and extend the functionality of browsers, practitioners provide mechanisms to allow users to install third-party-provided plugins (i.e., extensions) on their browsers. However, little is known about the performance implications caused by such extensions. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to understand the impact of extensions on the user-perceived performance (i.e., energy consumption and page load time) of Google Chrome, the most popular browser. We study a total of 72 representative extensions from 11 categories (e.g., Developer Tools and Sports). We observe that browser performance can be negatively impacted by the use of extensions, even when the extensions are used in unintended circumstances (e.g., when logging into an extension is not granted but required, or when an extension is not used for designated websites). We also identify a set of factors that significantly influence the performance impact of extensions, such as code complexity and privacy practices (i.e., collection of user data) adopted by the extensions. Based on our empirical observations, we provide recommendations for developers and users to mitigate the performance impact of browser extensions, such as conducting performance testing and optimization for unintended usage scenarios of extensions, or adhering to proper usage practices of extensions (e.g., logging into an extension when required).</description>

      <title>VLLMs Provide Better Context for Emotion Understanding Through Common Sense Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recognising emotions in context involves identifying the apparent emotions of an individual, taking into account contextual cues from the surrounding scene. Previous approaches to this task have involved the design of explicit scene-encoding architectures or the incorporation of external scene-related information, such as captions. However, these methods often utilise limited contextual information or rely on intricate training pipelines. In this work, we leverage the groundbreaking capabilities of Vision-and-Large-Language Models (VLLMs) to enhance in-context emotion classification without introducing complexity to the training process in a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we propose prompting VLLMs to generate descriptions in natural language of the subject's apparent emotion relative to the visual context. In the second stage, the descriptions are used as contextual information and, along with the image input, are used to train a transformer-based architecture that fuses text and visual features before the final classification task. Our experimental results show that the text and image features have complementary information, and our fused architecture significantly outperforms the individual modalities without any complex training methods. We evaluate our approach on three different datasets, namely, EMOTIC, CAER-S, and BoLD, and achieve state-of-the-art or comparable accuracy across all datasets and metrics compared to much more complex approaches. The code will be made publicly available on github: https://github.com/NickyFot/EmoCommonSense.git</description>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach to generate treatment policies for sepsis patients in intensive care. While retrospective evaluation metrics show decreased mortality when these policies are followed, studies with clinicians suggest their recommendations are often spurious. We propose that these shortcomings may be due to lack of diversity in observed actions and outcomes in the training data, and we construct experiments to investigate the feasibility of predicting sepsis disease severity changes due to clinician actions. Preliminary results suggest incorporating action information does not significantly improve model performance, indicating that clinician actions may not be sufficiently variable to yield measurable effects on disease progression. We discuss the implications of these findings for optimizing sepsis treatment.</description>

      <title>HealthPrism: A Visual Analytics System for Exploring Children's Physical and Mental Health Profiles with Multimodal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12242</link>

Abstract: The correlation between children's personal and family characteristics (e.g., demographics and socioeconomic status) and their physical and mental health status has been extensively studied across various research domains, such as public health, medicine, and data science. Such studies can provide insights into the underlying factors affecting children's health and aid in the development of targeted interventions to improve their health outcomes. However, with the availability of multiple data sources, including context data (i.e., the background information of children) and motion data (i.e., sensor data measuring activities of children), new challenges have arisen due to the large-scale, heterogeneous, and multimodal nature of the data. Existing statistical hypothesis-based and learning model-based approaches have been inadequate for comprehensively analyzing the complex correlation between multimodal features and multi-dimensional health outcomes due to the limited information revealed. In this work, we first distill a set of design requirements from multiple levels through conducting a literature review and iteratively interviewing 11 experts from multiple domains (e.g., public health and medicine). Then, we propose HealthPrism, an interactive visual and analytics system for assisting researchers in exploring the importance and influence of various context and motion features on children's health status from multi-level perspectives. Within HealthPrism, a multimodal learning model with a gate mechanism is proposed for health profiling and cross-modality feature importance comparison. A set of visualization components is designed for experts to explore and understand multimodal data freely. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of HealthPrism through quantitative evaluation of the model performance, case studies, and expert interviews in associated domains.</description>

      <title>VIVID: Human-AI Collaborative Authoring of Vicarious Dialogues from Lecture Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lengthy monologue-style online lectures cause learners to lose engagement easily. Designing lectures in a "vicarious dialogue" format can foster learners' cognitive activities more than monologue-style. However, designing online lectures in a dialogue style catered to the diverse needs of learners is laborious for instructors. We conducted a design workshop with eight educational experts and seven instructors to present key guidelines and the potential use of large language models (LLM) to transform a monologue lecture script into pedagogically meaningful dialogue. Applying these design guidelines, we created VIVID which allows instructors to collaborate with LLMs to design, evaluate, and modify pedagogical dialogues. In a within-subjects study with instructors (N=12), we show that VIVID helped instructors select and revise dialogues efficiently, thereby supporting the authoring of quality dialogues. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to assist instructors with creating high-quality educational dialogues across various learning stages.</description>

      <title>AGILE3D: Attention Guided Interactive Multi-object 3D Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00977v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During interactive segmentation, a model and a user work together to delineate objects of interest in a 3D point cloud. In an iterative process, the model assigns each data point to an object (or the background), while the user corrects errors in the resulting segmentation and feeds them back into the model. The current best practice formulates the problem as binary classification and segments objects one at a time. The model expects the user to provide positive clicks to indicate regions wrongly assigned to the background and negative clicks on regions wrongly assigned to the object. Sequentially visiting objects is wasteful since it disregards synergies between objects: a positive click for a given object can, by definition, serve as a negative click for nearby objects. Moreover, a direct competition between adjacent objects can speed up the identification of their common boundary. We introduce AGILE3D, an efficient, attention-based model that (1) supports simultaneous segmentation of multiple 3D objects, (2) yields more accurate segmentation masks with fewer user clicks, and (3) offers faster inference. Our core idea is to encode user clicks as spatial-temporal queries and enable explicit interactions between click queries as well as between them and the 3D scene through a click attention module. Every time new clicks are added, we only need to run a lightweight decoder that produces updated segmentation masks. In experiments with four different 3D point cloud datasets, AGILE3D sets a new state-of-the-art. Moreover, we also verify its practicality in real-world setups with real user studies.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Recommender Systems to Reduce Content Gaps on Peer Production Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08669v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Peer production platforms like Wikipedia commonly suffer from content gaps. Prior research suggests recommender systems can help solve this problem, by guiding editors towards underrepresented topics. However, it remains unclear whether this approach would result in less relevant recommendations, leading to reduced overall engagement with recommended items. To answer this question, we first conducted offline analyses (Study 1) on SuggestBot, a task-routing recommender system for Wikipedia, then did a three-month controlled experiment (Study 2). Our results show that presenting users with articles from underrepresented topics increased the proportion of work done on those articles without significantly reducing overall recommendation uptake. We discuss the implications of our results, including how ignoring the article discovery process can artificially narrow recommendations on peer production platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the significant impact of AI-based medical devices, including wearables, telemedicine, large language models, and digital twins, on clinical decision support systems. It emphasizes the importance of producing outcomes that are not only accurate but also interpretable and understandable to clinicians, addressing the risk that lack of interpretability poses in terms of mistrust and reluctance to adopt these technologies in healthcare. The paper reviews interpretable AI processes, methods, applications, and the challenges of implementation in healthcare, focusing on quality control to facilitate responsible communication between AI systems and clinicians. It breaks down the interpretability process into data pre-processing, model selection, and post-processing, aiming to foster a comprehensive understanding of the crucial role of a robust interpretability approach in healthcare and to guide future research in this area. with insights for creating responsible clinician-AI tools for healthcare, as well as to offer a deeper understanding of the challenges they might face. Our research questions, eligibility criteria and primary goals were identified using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline and PICO method; PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases were systematically searched using sensitive and specific search strings. In the end, 52 publications were selected for data extraction which included 8 existing reviews and 44 related experimental studies. The paper offers general concepts of interpretable AI in healthcare and discuss three-levels interpretability process. Additionally, it provides a comprehensive discussion of evaluating robust interpretability AI in healthcare. Moreover, this survey introduces a step-by-step roadmap for implementing responsible AI in healthcare.</description>

      <title>What AIs are not Learning (and Why): Bio-Inspired Foundation Models for Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What applications is AI ready for? Advances in deep learning and generative approaches have produced AIs that learn from massive online data and outperform manually built AIs. Some of these AIs outperform people. It is easy (but misleading) to conclude that today's AI technologies are learning to do anything and everything. Conversely, it is striking that big data, deep learning, and generative AI have had so little impact on robotics. For example, today's autonomous robots do not learn to provide home care or to be nursing assistants. Current robot applications are created using manual programming, mathematical models, planning frameworks, and reinforcement learning. These methods do not lead to the leaps in performance and generality seen with deep learning and generative AI. Better approaches to train robots for service applications would greatly expand their social roles and economic impact. AI research is now extending "big data" approaches to train robots by combining multimodal sensing and effector technology from robotics with deep learning technology adapted for embodied systems. These approaches create robotic (or "experiential") foundation models (FMs) for AIs that perceive and act in the world. Robotic FM approaches differ in their expectations, sources, and timing of training data. Like mainstream FM approaches, some robotic FM approaches use vast data to create adult expert-level robots. In contrast, developmental robotic approaches would create progressive FMs that learn continuously and experientially. Aspirationally, these would progress from child-level to student-level, apprentice-level, and expert levels. They would acquire self-developed and socially developed competences. These AIs would model the goals of people around them. Like people, they would learn to coordinate, communicate, and collaborate.</description>
