      <title>Doublons Bloch oscillations in the mass-imbalanced extended Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions between particles normally induce the decay of the particles Bloch oscillations (BOs) in a periodic lattice. In the large on-site interactions region, spin-$1/2$ fermions may form into doublon bound state and undergoes doublon BOs in the present of tilted potential. Here we investigate the impact of nearest-neighbor interaction $V$ on the multi-doublon BOs in a mass-imbalanced extended Fermi-Hubbard model. We derive a doublons effective Hamiltonian, and show that a minor change of $V$ can alter the dynamic behaviors of doublons qualitatively. Notably, at a resonance point, the doublons act like free hard-core bosons. Under a tilted potential, the system may exhibit different types of multi-doublon BOs at or deviation from the resonance point with different initial states. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate our conclusions in the one- and two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Probing hydrodynamic crossovers with dissipation-assisted operator evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using artificial dissipation to tame entanglement growth, we chart the emergence of diffusion in a generic interacting lattice model for varying U(1) charge densities. We follow the crossover from ballistic to diffusive transport above a scale set by the scattering length, finding the intuitive result that the diffusion constant scales as $D \propto 1/\rho$ at low densities $\rho$. Our numerical approach generalizes the Dissipation-Assisted Operator Evolution (DAOE) algorithm: in the spirit of the BBGKY hierarchy, we effectively approximate non-local operators by their ensemble averages, rather than discarding them entirely. This greatly reduces the operator entanglement entropy, while still giving accurate predictions for diffusion constants across all density scales. We further construct a minimal model for the transport crossover, yielding charge correlation functions which agree well with our numerical data. Our results clarify the dominant contributions to hydrodynamic correlation functions of conserved densities, and serve as a guide for generalizations to low temperature transport.</description>

      <title>Josephson oscillations of two weakly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A numerical experiment based on a particle number-conserving quantum field theory is performed for two initially independent Bose-Einstein condensates that are coherently coupled at two temperatures. The present model illustrates ab initio that the initial phase of each of the two condensates doesn't remain random at the Boltzmann equilibrium, but is distributed around integer multiple values of $2\pi$ from the interference and thermalization of forward and backward propagating matter waves. The thermalization inside the atomic vapors can be understood as an intrinsic measurement process that defines a temperature for the two condensates and projects the quantum states to an average wave field with zero (relative) phases. Following this approach, focus is put on the original thought experiment of Anderson on whether a Josephson current between two initially separated Bose-Einstein condensates occurs in a deterministic way or not, depending on the initial phase distribution.</description>

      <title>Gaussian state approximation of quantum many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are atypical, highly nonthermal eigenstates embedded in a sea of thermal eigenstates that have been observed in, for example, kinetically constrained quantum many-body models. These special eigenstates are characterized by a bipartite entanglement entropy that scales as most logarithmically with the subsystem size. We use numerical optimization techniques to investigate if quantum many-body scars of the experimentally relevant PXP model can be well approximated by Gaussian states. Gaussian states are described by a number of parameters that scales quadratically with system size, thereby having a much lower complexity than generic quantum many-body states, for which this number scales exponentially. We find that while quantum many-body scars can typically be well approximated by (symmetrized) Gaussian states, this is not the case for ergodic (thermal) eigenstates. This observation suggests that the non-ergodic part of the PXP Hamiltonian is related to certain quadratic parent Hamiltonians, thereby hinting on the origin of the quantum many-body scars.</description>

      <title>A spectrum-based shortcut method for topological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The need for fast and robust quantum state transfer is an essential element in scalable quantum information processing, leading to widespread interest in shortcuts to adiabaticity for speeding up adiabatic quantum protocols. However, shortcuts to adiabaticity for systems with more than a few levels is occasionally challenging to compute in theory and frequently difficult to implement in experiments. In this work, we develop a protocol for constructing shortcuts to adiabaticity through the multi-state Landau-Zener approach and a stricter adiabatic condition. Importantly, our protocol only requires a few pieces of information about the energy spectrum and just adjusts the evolutionary rate of the system. It means that our protocol has broad applicability to theoretical models and does not require increasing the difficulty of the experiment. As examples, we apply our protocol to state transfer in the two-level Landau-Zener model, the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and the topological Thouless pump model and find that it can speed up the manipulation speed while remaining robust to Hamiltonian errors. Furthermore, based on the experimental friendliness of our findings, it can potentially be extended to many-body systems, dissipation cases, or Floquet processes. Overall, the proposed shortcut protocol offers a promising avenue for enhancing the efficiency and reliability of quantum state transfer protocols.</description>
