      <title>Efficiency, Envy, and Incentives in Combinatorial Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring efficiency and envy-freeness in allocating indivisible goods without money often requires randomization. However, existing combinatorial assignment mechanisms (for applications such as course allocation, food banks, and refugee resettlement) guarantee these properties either ex ante or ex post, but not both. We propose a new class of mechanisms based on Competitive Equilibrium from Random Incomes (CERI): Agents receive random token budgets and select optimal lotteries at competitive prices that clear markets in expectation. Our main insight is to let the CERI price vector guide all ex-post allocations. We show that all ordinally efficient allocations are CERI allocations, which can be implemented as lotteries over near-feasible Pareto-efficient outcomes. With identical budget distributions, CERI allocations are ordinally envy-free; with budget distributions on small supports, ex-post allocations are envy-free up to one good. Moreover, we design an asymptotically efficient implementation of CERI that satisfies a strong new non-manipulability property in large markets.</description>

      <title>Robust Regulation of Labour Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04841v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the robust regulation of contracts in moral hazard problems. A firm offers a contract to incentivise a worker protected by limited liability. A regulator restricts the set of permissible contracts to (i) improve efficiency and (ii) protect the worker. The regulator faces uncertainty about both the worker's actions and the firm's production cost, and evaluates regulations based on their worst-case regret. The regret-minimising regulation mandates a minimum piece rate compensation for the worker. This rule simultaneously guarantees a fair share for the worker and preserves enough contractual flexibility to provide incentives.</description>

      <title>Robust Contracting for Sequential Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A principal contracts with an agent who sequentially searches over projects to generate a prize. The principal initially knows only one of the agent's available projects and evaluates a contract by its worst-case performance. We characterize the principal's robustly optimal contracts, which are all debt-like: the agent is only paid when the prize exceeds a threshold. Debt is optimal because it preserves the option value of continued exploration. Our characterization encompasses several common contract forms, including pure debt, debt-plus-equity, and capped-earnout debt. We identify settings in which each of these contracts is uniquely optimal.</description>

      <title>Efficient Defection: Overage-Proportional Rationing Attains the Cooperative Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a noncooperative $n$-player game of slack allocation in which each player $j$ has entitlement $L_j&gt;0$ and chooses a claim $C_j\ge0$. Let $v_j=(C_j-L_j)_+$ (overage) and $s_j=(L_j-C_j)_+$ (slack); set $X=\sum_j v_j$ and $I=\sum_j s_j$. At the end of the period an overage-proportional clearing rule allocates cooperative surplus $I$ to defectors in proportion to $v_j$; cooperators receive $C_j$. We show: (i) the selfish outcome reproduces the cooperative payoff vector $(L_1,\dots,L_n)$; (ii) with bounded actions, defection is a weakly dominant strategy; (iii) within the $\alpha$-power family, the linear rule ($\alpha=1$) is the unique boundary-continuous member; and (iv) the dominant-strategy outcome is Strong Nash under transferable utility and hence coalition-proof (Bernheim et al., 1987). We give a policy interpretation for carbon rationing with a penalty collar.</description>
