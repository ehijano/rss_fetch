      <title>Reprocessing the NEAT Dataset: Preliminary Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have created a new image analysis pipeline to reprocess images taken by the Near Earth Asteroid Tracking survey and have applied it to ten nights of observations. This work is the first large-scale reprocessing of images from an asteroid discovery survey in which thousands of archived images are re-calibrated, searched for minor planets, and resulting observations are reported to the Minor Planet Center. We describe the software used to extract, calibrate, and clean sources from the images, including specific techniques that accommodate the unique features of these archival images. This pipeline is able to find fainter asteroids than the original pipeline.</description>

      <title>Saturnian Irregular Satellites as a Probe of Kuiper Belt Surface Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the JWST NIRSpec PRISM 0.7-5.3 micron spectra of Albiorix and Siarnaq and the NIRSpec G235H/G395M 1.7-5.3 micron spectra of Phoebe, the three largest Saturnian irregular satellites. The irregular satellites of the giant planets are thought to be captured planetesimals from the same population as Kuiper belt objects. They are emplaced inside Saturn's Hill sphere during the giant-planet instability described by the Nice Model, and are thus valuable tracers of Kuiper belt surface evolution. Phoebe's JWST spectrum matches the global average from Cassini VIMS, and by comparing the spectrum to the library of Kuiper belt object spectra from JWST, we demonstrate Phoebe's compositional similarity to water-rich KBOs. On the smaller Albiorix and Siarnaq, we observe a broad 3 micron O-H band but do not see a Fresnel peak or the 1.5/2.0 micron features characteristic of H$_2$O ice. We posit that after capture, the frequent high-velocity collisions between smaller irregular satellites sublimate the water ice, while the much larger Phoebe is resistant to disruption and retains its water ice. We suggest that the presence of CO$_2$ on the smaller satellites, despite the lack of water ice, indicates later formation of CO$_2$ on these surfaces through irradiation of organic compounds.</description>

      <title>TOI-2005b: An Eccentric Warm Jupiter in Spin-Orbit Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery and characterization of TOI-2005b, a warm Jupiter on an eccentric (e~0.59), 17.3-day orbit around a V_mag = 9.867 rapidly rotating F-star. The object was detected as a candidate by TESS and the planetary nature of TOI-2005b was then confirmed via a series of ground-based photometric, spectroscopic, and diffraction-limited imaging observations. The planet was found to reside in a low sky-projected stellar obliquity orbit (lambda = 4.8 degrees) via a transit spectroscopic observation using the Magellan MIKE spectrograph.TOI-2005b is one of a few planets known to have a low-obliquity, high-eccentricity orbit, which may be the result of high-eccentricity coplanar migration. The planet has a periastron equilibrium temperature of ~ 2100 K, similar to some highly irradiated hot Jupiters where atomic metal species have been detected in transmission spectroscopy, and varies by almost 1000 K during its orbit. Future observations of the atmosphere of TOI-2005b can inform us about its radiative timescales thanks to the rapid heating and cooling of the planet.</description>

      <title>Optimising Radial Velocity Detection Limits for Southern Habitable Worlds Observatory Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The planned NASA Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) flagship mission aims to image and spectroscopically characterise 25 Earth-size planets in the habitable zones of their stars. However, one giant planet in the habitable zone can ruin your whole day. Recent work has examined the current state of our knowledge on the presence or absence of such objects in samples of likely HWO targets, and that knowledge has been found wanting; even Saturn-mass planets remain undetectable in many of these systems. In this work, we present simulations assessing the degree to which new campaigns of high-cadence radial velocity observations can ameliorate this woeful state of affairs. In particular, we highlight the value of moderate-precision but highly flexibly-scheduled RV facilities in aiding this necessary HWO precursor science. We find that for a subset of Southern HWO stars, 6 years of new RVs from the Minerva-Australis telescope array in Australia can improve the median detection sensitivity in the habitable zones of 13 likely HWO targets to $\sim$50 Earth masses, an improvement of $\sim$44%.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRCam Coronagraphic Search for Hidden Planets in the HD~163296 Protoplanetary Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HD~163296 is a Herbig Ae/Be star with multiple signposts of on-going planet formation on its disk, such as prominent rings and gaps, as well as kinematic features as identified by previous ALMA observations. We carried out JWST/NIRCam coronagraphic imaging using the F410M and F200W NIRCam filters, with the goal of detecting the emission from the putative young planets in this system. Our F410M observations did not detect the putative planets at the predicted locations of the ALMA velocity kinks, but detected a point-like source candidate at a separation of $\approx0\farcs75$ and a position angle of $\approx231\fdg4$ that is unlikely a background star because of the measured flux in the F410M filter and the detection limit in the F200W filter. These data achieved unprecedented contrast levels at $\sim4~\micron$ at stellocentric separations $\rho\gtrsim0\farcs8$. This allowed us to derive stringent constraints at the outer velocity kink ($\Delta {\rm F410M}=15.2~{\rm mag}$) on the mass of the putative planet with or without a circumplanetary disk, and considering different possible initial entropies for the planet.</description>

      <title>Infrared Emission of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Molecules in Titan: Cyanonaphthalenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the only moon in the solar system with a thick atmosphere, Titan is a compelling and enigmatic world containing a complex organic haze. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules are believed to play an essential role in the formation of Titan's aerosols and haze layers. The existence of PAHs in Titan's upper atmosphere has been revealed by the detection of the 3.28-micron emission band with Cassini's Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS). However, there is little knowledge about the identity, composition, size and abundance of PAH molecules in Titan's atmosphere. Due to its unprecedented sensitivity and spectral coverage and resolution, the advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) could possibly enable a full characterization of the chemical makeups of Titan's aerosols. In particular, with a much better spectral resolution than Cassini's VIMS, JWST's Near Infrared Spectrograph (and Mid Infrared Instrument) could enable the spectral bands to be better resolved, potentially providing crucial information about which PAHs are really present in Titan's upper atmosphere. To facilitate JWST to search for and identify Titan's PAH molecules, we are performing a systematic study of the photophysics of PAHs in Titan's upper atmosphere. As a pilot study, here we report the infrared emission spectra of vibrationally excited cyanonapthalenes and their ions which are composed of two fused benzene rings and one nitrile (-CN) group. The calculated emission spectra will help JWST to quantitatively determine or place an upper limit on the abundances of cyanonapthalenes in Titan's upper atmosphere.</description>

      <title>The influence of stellar activity on detecting Earth-like planets via nulling interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direct imaging of Earth-like planets in solar neighbors is challenging. Both transit and radial velocity (RV) methods suffer from noise due to stellar activity. By choosing a typical configuration of an X array interferometer, we used theoretical formulas to calculate the intrinsic Poisson noise and the noise of stellar activities. Assuming a fixed array with no rotation and ignoring other systematic and astrophysical noises, we considered a single active region on a stellar disk, including both spots and flares with different parameters, for instance, the position, size, and temperature of the active regions. Then we simulated the S/N of Earth-like planets in HZ around G dwarf stars (solar-like) and M dwarfs (Proxima-like), with different stellar activities in the mid-infrared (MIR) band ( 7-12 $\mu$m). The noise attributed to stellar activity has much less influence than the Transit and RV method when detecting Earth-like planets around both G and M dwarfs. I.e. Stellar activity can hardly influence the detection of Earth-like planets around G dwarf stars. However, detecting Earth-like planets around M dwarfs, which are usually more active, can be significantly hindered. We also analyzed the uncertainty of the planet's location due to the deduced S/N. Consequently, we have determined the possibility of mistaking a planet in the HZ as being outside the HZ based on an erroneous S/N measurement. Selecting quiescent target stars or monitoring the light curves of stars would be a helpful way to get rid of contaminates associated with violent stellar activities.</description>

      <title>RV-exoplanet eccentricities: Good, Beta, and Best</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the eccentricity distribution(s) of radial velocity detected exoplanets. Previously, the eccentricity distribution was found to be described well by a Beta distribution with shape parameters $a=0.867, b=3.03$. Increasing the sample size by a factor of 2.25, we find that the CDF regression method now prefers a mixture model of Rayleigh + Exponential distributions over the Beta distribution, with an increase in Bayesian evidence of $\Delta\ln{Z}\sim 77$ ($12.6\,\sigma$). Using PDF regression, the eccentricity distribution is best described by a Gamma distribution, with a Rayleigh + Exponential mixture a close second. The mixture model parameters, $\alpha = 0.68\pm0.05, \lambda=3.32\pm0.25, \sigma =0.11\pm0.01$, are consistent between methods. We corroborate findings that exoplanet eccentricities are drawn from independent parent distributions when splitting the sample by period, mass, and multiplicity. Systems with a known outer massive companion provide no positive evidence for an eccentricity distribution distinct from those without. We quantitatively show M-dwarf hosted planets share a common eccentricity distribution with those orbiting FGK-type stars. We release our python code, eccentriciPy, which allows bespoke tailoring of the input archive to create more relevant priors for particular problems in RV planet discovery and characterisation. We re-characterised example planets using either traditional Beta, or updated priors, finding differences for recovery of low-amplitude multi-signal systems. We explore the effects of a variety of prior choices. The accurate determination of small but non-zero eccentricity values has wide-ranging implications for modelling the structure and evolution of planets and their atmospheres due to the energy dissipated by tidal flexing.</description>

      <title>Synchronized Eruptions on Io: Evidence of Interconnected Subsurface Magma Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On December 27, 2024, Juno's JIRAM infrared experiment observed an unprecedented volcanic event on Io's southern hemisphere, covering a vast region of ~ 65,000 square km, near 73{\deg}S, 140{\deg}E. The total power output is estimated between 140 and 260 TW, potentially the most intense ever recorded, surpassing the brightest eruption at Surt in 2001 (~80 TW). Within that region, only one hot spot was previously known (Pfd454). This feature was earlier estimated to cover an area of 300 square km with a total power output of 34 GW. JIRAM results show that the region produces a power output of 140-260 TW, over 1,000 times higher than earlier estimates. Three adjacent hot spots also exhibited dramatic power increases: P139, PV18, and an unnamed feature south of the main one that surged to ~1 TW, placing all of them among the top 10 most powerful hot spots observed on Io. A temperature analysis of the features supports a simultaneous onset of these brightenings and suggests a single eruptive event propagating beneath the surface across hundreds of kilometers, the first time this has been observed on Io. This implies a connection among the hotspots' magma reservoirs, while other nearby hotspots that have been known to be active in the recent past, such as Kurdalagon Patera, appear unaffected. The simultaneity supports models of massive, interconnected magma reservoirs. The global scale of this event involving multiple hotspots and covering several hundred thousand square km should be considered in the future models of the lithosphere and interior of Io.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Trace Elements in Volcanic Materials: Consequences for the Cretaceous-Tertiary Mass Extinction, Geoneutrinos and the Origin of the Hawaii's Archipelago</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seventeen representative samples of volcanic origin were collected from Ecuador (Pichincha Volcano), Iceland (Eyjafjallaj\"okull Volcano), India (Deccan Traps), Hawaii, Kilimanjaro, Mt. Etna, Rwanda (Virunga Mountains), and Uganda (Virunga Mountains). Neutron activation analysis (NAA) was performed to determine the concentration of 33 chemical elements, including 21 trace elements, 20 heavy metals, and 9 rare earth elements: Al, As, Ba, Ca, Ce, Cl, Co, Cr, Cs, Dy, Eu, Fe, Hf, K, La, Lu, Mg, Mn, Na, Nd, Rb, Sb, Sc, Sm, Sr, Ta, Tb, Th, Ti, U, Yb, Zn, and Zr.
  Correlation analysis of the abundance of samples from different islands in the Hawaii archipelago (Kauai, Kilauea, Mauna Loa, and Haleakala) confirmed that the islands were likely formed by two different lava sources. Additionally, the upper limit of iridium was determined in 11 of these samples using Bayesian analysis, which does not support the hypothesis that volcanic activity caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.
  We also discuss how the abundance of thorium and uranium in lava from different geological formations and depths can contribute to building a better map of natural radioisotope occurrences on Earth, which is important for geoneutrino experiments. A high abundance of rare elements was reported in some of the analyzed locations, indicating potential commercial interest and the possibility of exploring volcanoes as sources of chemical elements used in electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Exozodiacal dust as a limitation to exoplanet imaging and spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In addition to planets and other small bodies, stellar systems will likely also host exozodiacal dust, or exozodi. This warm dust primarily resides in or near the habitable zone of a star, and scatters stellar light in visible to NIR wavelengths, possibly acting as a spatially inhomogeneous fog that can impede our ability to detect and characterize Earth-like exoplanets. By improving our knowledge of exozodi in the near term with strategic precursor observations and model development, we may be able to mitigate these effects to support a future search for signs of habitability and life with a direct imaging mission. This white paper introduces exozodi, summarizes its impact on directly imaging Earth-like exoplanets, and outlines several key knowledge gaps and near-term solutions to maximize the science return of future observations.</description>

      <title>Kozai Lidov Cycles = Simple Pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quadrupole Kozai mechanism, which describes the hierarchical three-body problem in the leading order, is shown to be equivalent to a simple pendulum where the change in the eccentricity squared equals the height of the pendulum from its lowest point: $e_{\text{max}}^2-e^2=h=l\left(1-\cos{\theta}\right)$. In particular, this results in useful expressions for the KLC period, and the maximal and minimal eccentricities in terms of orbital constants. We derive the equivalence using the vector coordinates $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=\textbf{j}+\textbf{e}, \boldsymbol{\beta}=\textbf{j}-\textbf{e}$ for the inner Keplerian orbit, where $\textbf{j}$ is the normalized specific angular momentum, and $\textbf{e}$ is the eccentricity vector. The equations of motion for $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ simplify to $\dot{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}=2\partial_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}} \phi \times \boldsymbol{\alpha}$ and $\dot{\boldsymbol{\beta}}=2\partial_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \phi \times \boldsymbol{\beta}$, where $\phi$ is the normalized averaged interaction potential and are symmetric to replacing $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ for the KLC quadratic potential. Their constraints simplify to $\boldsymbol{\alpha}^2=\boldsymbol{\beta}^2=1$, and they are distributed uniformly and independently on the unit sphere for a uniform distribution in phase space (with a fixed energy).</description>

      <title>A Radio Science Experiment for the Ramses Mission to Apophis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper outlines the Radio Science Experiment (RSE) proposed for the RAMSES mission to asteroid (99942) Apophis, which will undergo a close Earth encounter in April 2029. This event provides a unique opportunity to study the asteroid's physical and dynamical changes under strong tidal forces. The experiment leverages a combination of Earth-based radiometric measurements, optical imaging, and inter-satellite links between the RAMSES mothercraft and deployable subcraft in proximity to Apophis. Using high-precision Doppler and optical navigation data, the RSE aims to estimate the asteroid's mass, gravity field, and spin state with unparalleled accuracy, furthering our understanding of near-Earth asteroid evolution and internal structure. Simulation results show the robustness of the proposed mission scenario, highlighting the critical role of multi-probe configurations and novel inter-satellite link technologies in achieving accurate gravity science results.</description>

      <title>A Unified, Physical Framework for Mean Motion Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The traditional approach to analyzing mean motion resonances is through canonical perturbation theory. While this is a powerful method, its generality leads to complicated combinations of variables that are challenging to interpret and require looking up numerical coefficients particular to every different resonance. In this paper we develop simpler scaling relations in the limit where orbits are closely spaced (period ratios $\lesssim 2$) and interplanetary interactions can be approximated by only considering the close-approaches each time the inner planet overtakes the outer at conjunction. We develop geometric arguments for several powerful results: (i) that $p$:$p-q$ MMRs of the same order $q$ are all rescaled versions of one another (ii) that the general case of two massive planets on closely spaced, eccentric, co-planar orbits can be approximately mapped onto the much simpler case of an eccentric test particle perturbed by a massive planet on a co-planar circular orbit and (iii) that while the effects of consecutive conjunctions add up coherently for first-order ($p$:$p-1$) MMRs, they partially cancel for $p$:$p-q$ MMRs with order $q&gt;1$, providing a physical explanation for why these higher order MMRs are weaker and can often be ignored. Finally, we provide simple expressions for the widths of MMRs and their associated oscillation frequencies that are universal to all closely spaced MMRs of a given order $q$, in the pendulum approximation.</description>

      <title>Results of numerical integrations of the orbits of fictive asteroids in vicinity of 2:1, 3:1 and 3:2 resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present our results of numerical integrations of orbits of fictive massless particle in vicinity of resonance. Our goal is to study the dependences of period (frequency) of resonance perturbations and the width of the resonance on mass and orbital eccentricity of perturbing planet and on the initial difference of longitude between test particle and perturbing planet. The main attention is paid to planar restricted three body problem, but some computations are done for a spatial case.</description>

      <title>Characterising the Atmosphere of 55 Cancri e: 1D Forward Model Grid for Current and Future JWST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations with NIRCam and MIRI of the ultra-short-period super-Earth 55 Cancri e indicate a possible volatile atmosphere surrounding the planet. Previous analysis of the NIRCam spectra suggested potential absorption features from CO2 or CO and significant sub-weekly variability. The MIRI low-resolution spectrum does not contain substantial features but was found to be consistent with effective heat redistribution models. In this work, we computed a grid of over 25000 self-consistent 1D forward models incorporating H-N-O-C-S-P-Si-Ti equilibrium chemistry and assessed plausible atmospheric compositions based on the current JWST data. Despite exhaustive analysis, the composition and properties of the atmosphere remain elusive. While our results statistically favour a global, hydrogen-free, nitrogen-dominated atmosphere enriched in PO and CO2, various alternative compositions, including H2O-,CO-, PH3-, or Si-bearing remain viable explanations. Unconstrained heat redistribution efficiency and absolute NIRCam flux are among the largest sources of uncertainty in our analysis. We also find that the heat redistribution factor and surface pressure are highly degenerate with atmospheric composition, and that these parameters cannot be independently constrained using current JWST observations. Furthermore, we show that the observed variability may arise from dynamic interactions between the atmosphere and an underlying magma ocean, driving rapid shifts in atmospheric chemistry and thermal emission. Our results highlight the importance of using self-consistent forward models when analysing novel JWST spectra with limited signal-to-noise ratios -- such as those of 55 Cancri e -- as it allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of potential atmospheric scenarios while also being less sensitive to subtle spectral differences than retrievals...</description>

      <title>Investigating the relationship between bolide entry angle and apparent direction of infrasound signal arrivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infrasound sensing offers critical capabilities for detecting and geolocating bolide events globally. However, the observed back azimuths, directions from which infrasound signals arrive at stations, often differ from the theoretical expectations based on the bolide's peak brightness location. For objects with shallow entry angles, which traverse longer atmospheric paths, acoustic energy may be emitted from multiple points along the trajectory, leading to substantial variability in back azimuth residuals. This study investigates how the entry angle of energetic bolides affects the back azimuth deviations, independent of extrinsic factors such as atmospheric propagation, station noise, and signal processing methodologies. A theoretical framework, the Bolide Infrasound Back-Azimuth EXplorer Model (BIBEX-M), was developed to compute predicted back azimuths solely from geometric considerations. The model quantifies how these residuals vary as a function of source-to-receiver distance, revealing that bolides entering at shallow angles of 10 degrees can experience average residuals of 20 degrees, with deviations reaching up to 46 degrees at distances below 1000 km, and remaining significant even at 10,000 km. In contrast, bolides with steeper entry angles (greater than 60 degrees) show much smaller deviations, typically under 5 degrees at 1000 km and diminishing to less than 1 deg beyond 5000 km. These findings attest to the need for careful interpretation when evaluating signal detections and estimating bolide locations. This work is not only pertinent to bolides but also to other high-energy, extended-duration atmospheric phenomena such as space debris and reentry events, where similar geometric considerations can influence infrasound arrival directions.</description>
