      <title>Quantum features of the transport through ion channels in the soft knock-on model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ion channels are protein structures that facilitate the selective passage of ions across the membrane cells of living organisms. They are known for their high conductance and high selectivity. The precise mechanism between these two seemingly contradicting features is not yet firmly established. One possible candidate is the quantum coherence. In this work we study the quantum model of the soft knock-on conduction using the Lindblad equation taking into account the non-hermiticity of the model. We show that the model exhibits a regime in which high conductance coexists with high coherence. Our findings second the role of quantum effects in the transport properties of the ion channels.</description>

      <title>The central role of metabolism in vascular morphogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.04657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As nutrients travel through microcirculation and are absorbed, their availability continuously decreases. However, a uniform nutrient distribution is critical, as it prevents tissue death in poorly supplied areas. How, then, do vascular networks achieve equi-perfusion? Given the extensive number of vessels in animal vascular systems, the structure of smaller vessels cannot be fully genetically predetermined and thus relies on a self-organizing developmental mechanism. We propose a simple, optimization-based adaptation rule to control vessel radii, aiming to equalize perfusion while minimizing flow resistance and material cost. This adaptation balances three competing factors: perfusion efficiency, energy dissipation, and material expenditure, which together drive complex network morphologies. These morphologies range from hierarchical architectures optimized for minimal resistance and material cost to dense networks that achieve efficient perfusion. Notably, metabolic demand is the primary factor modulating the transition between these contrasting structures. By applying our adaptation rule to networks in the rat mesentery and comparing the resulting optimal perfusion architectures with the experimental data, we can estimate the biologically relevant parameters, such as the oxygen absorption rate, for which the optimization and experimental networks align the most. Surprisingly, the optimal absorption rate we derive matches independent in vivo measurements. This suggests that reduced-order models like ours can provide valuable insights into the development and function of real vascular networks.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale Laplacian community detection in heterogeneous networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04514v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous and complex networks represent intertwined interactions between real-world elements or agents. Determining the multi-scale mesoscopic organization of clusters and intertwined structures is still a fundamental and open problem of complex network theory. By taking advantage of the recent Laplacian Renormalization Group, we scrutinize information diffusion pathways throughout networks to shed further light on this issue. Based on inter-node communicability, our definition provides a clear-cut framework for resolving the multi-scale mesh of structures in complex networks, disentangling their intrinsic arboreal architecture. As it does not consider any topological null-model assumption, the LRG naturally permits the introduction of scale-dependent optimal partitions. Moreover, we demonstrate the existence of a particular class of nodes, called 'metastable' nodes, that switching regions to which they belong at different scales, likely playing a pivotal role in cross-regional communication and, therefore, in managing macroscopic effects of the whole network.</description>

      <title>Mechanics and thermodynamics of contractile entropic biopolymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contractile biopolymer networks, such as the actomyosin meshwork of animal cells, are ubiquitous in living organisms. The active gel theory, which provides the thermodynamic framework for these materials, has been mostly used in conjunction with the assumption that the microstructure of the biopolymer network is based on rigid rods. However, experimentally, crosslinked actin network exhibits entropic elasticity. Here we combine an entropic elasticity kinetic theory, in the spirit of the Green and Tobolsky model of transiently crosslinked networks, with an active flux modelling biological activity. We determine this active flux using Onsager reciprocal relations and interpret the corresponding microscopic dynamics. We obtain a closed-form model of the macroscopic mechanical behaviour. We show how this model can be written using the framework of multiplicative strain gradient decomposition, which is convenient for the resolution of such problems.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Brain's Dynamic Response to Targeted Stimulation using Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models of brain activity have been instrumental in testing hypothesized mechanisms underlying brain dynamics against experimental datasets. Beyond capturing the key mechanisms underlying spontaneous brain dynamics, these models hold an exciting potential for understanding the mechanisms underlying the dynamics evoked by targeted brain-stimulation techniques. This paper delves into this emerging application, using concepts from dynamical systems theory to argue that the stimulus-evoked dynamics in such experiments may be shaped by new types of mechanisms distinct from those that dominate spontaneous dynamics. We review and discuss: (i) the targeted experimental techniques across spatial scales that can both perturb the brain to novel states and resolve its relaxation trajectory back to spontaneous dynamics; and (ii) how we can understand these dynamics in terms of mechanisms using physiological, phenomenological, and data-driven models. A tight integration of targeted stimulation experiments with generative quantitative modeling provides an important opportunity to uncover novel mechanisms of brain dynamics that are difficult to detect in spontaneous settings.</description>
