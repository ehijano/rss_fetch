      <title>Guerra interpolation for inverse freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these short notes, we adapt and systematically apply Guerra's interpolation techniques on a class of disordered mean-field spin glasses equipped with crystal fields and multi-value spin variables. These models undergo the phenomenon of inverse melting or inverse freezing. In particular, we focus on the Ghatak-Sherrington model, its extension provided by Katayama and Horiguchi, and the disordered Blume-Emery-Griffiths-Capel model in the mean-field limit, deepened by Crisanti and Leuzzi and by Schupper and Shnerb. Once shown how all these models can be retrieved as particular limits of a unique broader Hamiltonian, we study their free energies. We provide explicit expressions of their annealed and quenched expectations, inspecting the cases of replica symmetry and (first-step) broken replica symmetry. We recover several results previously obtained via heuristic approaches (mainly the replica trick) to prove full agreement with the existing literature. As a sideline, we also inspect the onset of replica symmetry breaking by providing analytically the expression of the de Almeida-Thouless instability line for a replica symmetric description: in this general setting, the latter is new also from a physical viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised machine learning for detecting mutual independence among eigenstate regimes in interacting quasiperiodic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-body eigenstates that are neither thermal nor many-body-localized (MBL) were numerically found in certain interacting chains with moderate quasiperiodic potentials. The energy regime consisting of these non-ergodic but extended (NEE) eigenstates has been extensively studied for being a possible many-body mobility edge between the energy-resolved MBL and thermal phases. Recently, the NEE regime was further proposed to be a prethermal phenomenon that generally occurs when different operators spread at sizably different timescales. Here, we numerically examine the mutual independence among the NEE, MBL, and thermal regimes in the lens of eigenstate entanglement spectra (ES). Given the complexity and rich information embedded in ES, we develop an unsupervised learning approach that is designed to quantify the mutual independence among general phases. Our method is first demonstrated on an illustrative toy example that uses RGB color data to represent phases, then applied to the ES of an interacting generalized Aubry Andre model from weak to strong potential strength. We find that while the MBL and thermal regimes are mutually independent, the NEE regime is dependent on the former two and smoothly appears as the potential strength decreases. We attribute our numerically finding to the fact that the ES data in the NEE regime exhibits both an MBL-like fast decay and a thermal-like long tail.</description>

      <title>Anderson localization: A disorder-induced quantum bound state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02353v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrons at the Fermi energy may lose their ability to propagate to long distances in certain random media. We use Green functions and solve parquet equations for the non-local electron-hole vertex in high spatial dimensions to describe the vanishing of diffusion in Anderson localization. It is caused by forming a quantum bound state between the diffusing particle and the hole left behind. Divergence in a new time scale proportional to the electrical polarizability signals the Anderson localization transition. Consequently, the height of the peak of the dynamical conductivity at zero frequency, the static diffusion constant, is not pushed to zero at the localization transition but rather its width. Spatially localized quantum bound states in the localized phase cannot be described by the continuity and wave equations in the Hilbert space of Bloch waves.</description>

      <title>Subwavelength Localisation in Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13954v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We elucidate the different mechanisms of wave localisation in disordered finite systems of subwavelength resonators, where the disorder is in the spatial arrangement of the resonators. To do so, we employ the capacitance matrix formalism and develop a variety of tools to understand localisation in this setting. Namely, we adapt the Thouless criterion of localisation to quantify the various mechanisms of localisation. We also employ a propagation matrix approach to prove a Saxon-Hutner type theorem ensuring the existence of band gaps for disordered systems and to predict the corresponding Lyapunov exponents. We further investigate the stabilities of bandgaps and localised eigenmodes with respect to fluctuations in the system by introducing a method of defect mode prediction based on the discrete Green function and illuminating the phenomena of Anderson localisation and level repulsion under global disorder.</description>

      <title>Witnessing Disorder in Quantum Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are no clean samples in nature. Therefore, when we come to discuss the entanglement properties of quantum materials, the effects of disorder must be taken into account. This question is of particular interest for high-entangled phases, such as quantum spin liquids, which lie outside the Landau paradigm for classifying phases of matter. In this work, we explore what experimentally-accessible measures, in the form of concurrence, residual tangle and quantum Fisher information, can teach us about the entanglement in the presence of disorder. As a representative example, we consider the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLL) and disorder-driven random singlet (RS) phases found in antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains. Using quantum Fisher information and residual tangle, we demonstrate that both TLL and RS phases exhibit multi-partite entanglement. In the case of the RS phase, we attribute this to entanglement localized below a crossover length scale. We further show that the order of disorder average matters in calculating measures like concurrence, and that this can lead to false inferences when interpreting experiment. Nonetheless, correctly interpreted, these witnesses provide useful information about the effects of disorder. We explore how information about the central charge of the TLL can be extracted from the low-temperature behavior of concurrence, and conjecture that this analysis can be extended to the effective central charge of the RS phase. Finally, we establish how RS and TLL phases can be distinguished through the growth of multi-partite entanglement, as witnessed by the equal-time structure factor. These results establish that, used carefully, experiments based on entanglement witnesses can provide important information about quantum spin systems in the presence of disorder.</description>

      <title>Ensemble inequivalence and phase transitions in unlabeled networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discover a first-order phase transition in the canonical ensemble of random unlabeled networks with a prescribed average number of links. The transition is caused by the nonconcavity of microcanonical entropy. Above the critical point coinciding with the graph symmetry phase transition, the canonical and microcanonical ensembles are equivalent and have a well-behaved thermodynamic limit. Below the critical point, the ensemble equivalence is broken, and the canonical ensemble is a mixture of phases: empty networks and networks with average degrees diverging logarithmically with the network size. As a consequence, networks with bounded average degrees do not survive in the thermodynamic limit, decaying into the empty phase. The celebrated percolation transition in labeled networks is thus absent in unlabeled networks. In view of these differences between labeled and unlabeled ensembles, the question of which one should be used as a null model of different real-world networks cannot be ignored.</description>
