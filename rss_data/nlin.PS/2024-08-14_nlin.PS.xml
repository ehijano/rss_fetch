      <title>Thermal Decay of Planar Jones-Roberts Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homogeneous planar superfluids exhibit a range of low-energy excitations that also appear in highly excited states like superfluid turbulence. In dilute gas Bose-Einstein condensates, the Jones- Roberts soliton family includes vortex dipoles and rarefaction pulses in the low and high velocity regimes, respectively. These excitations carry both energy and linear momentum, making their decay characteristics crucial for understanding superfluid dynamics. In this work, we develop the theory of planar soliton decay due to thermal effects, as described by the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii theory of reservoir interactions. We analyze two distinct damping terms involving transfer between the condensate and the non-condensate reservoir: particle transfer that also involves energy and usually drives condensate growth, and number-conserving energy transfer. We provide analytical treatments for both the low and high velocity regimes and identify conditions under which either mechanism dominates. Our findings indicate that energy damping prevails at high phase space density. These theoretical results are supported by numerical studies covering the entire velocity range from vortex dipole to rarefaction pulse. We use interaction energy to characterize rarefaction pulses, analogous to the distance between vortices in vortex dipoles, offering an experimentally accessible test for finite temperature theory in Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>The role of the inverse Cherenkov effect in the formation of ultrashort Raman solitons in silica microspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate a new regime of the formation of ultrashort optical solitons in spherical silica microresonators with whispering gallery modes.The solitons are driven by a coherent CW pump at the frequency in the range of normal dispersion, and the energy is transferred from this pump to the solitons via two channels: Raman amplification and the inverse Cherenkov effect. We discuss three different regimes of soliton propagation and we also show that these Raman solitons can be controlled by weak coherent CW signals.</description>

      <title>Multi-soliton solutions and data-driven discovery of higher-order Burgers' hierarchy equations with physics informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Burgers hierarchy consists of nonlinear evolutionary PDEs with increasingly higher-order dispersive and nonlinear terms, resulting in a rich variety of soliton solutions. Notable members include the Burgers equation and the Sharma-Tasso-Olver equation, which are applied in plasma physics, fluid mechanics, optics, and biophysics to describe nonlinear waves in inhomogeneous media. Various soliton and multi-soliton solutions have been identified, and the fission and fusion of solitons have been explored through analytical and numerical techniques. Recently, deep learning methods, particularly Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), have emerged as powerful tools for solving PDEs. These methods use deep neural networks to minimize PDE residuals and satisfy boundary and initial conditions while fitting relevant data. Although PINNs have been applied to equations like Burgers' and Korteweg-de Vries, higher-order members of the Burgers hierarchy remain unexplored. In this study, we employ a PINN algorithm to approximate multi-soliton solutions of linear combinations of equations within the Burgers hierarchy. This semi-supervised approach encodes the PDE and relevant data, determining PDE parameters and resolving the linear combination to discover the PDE that best describes the data. Additionally, we employ gradient-enhanced PINNs (gPINNs) and a conservation law specific to the generic Burgers' hierarchy to improve training accuracy. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of PINNs in describing multi-soliton solutions within the generic Burgers' hierarchy. They also verify the potential for training refinement and accuracy improvement using enhanced approaches in certain cases, while enabling the inference of the PDE model that best describes the observed solitary structures.</description>

      <title>Phase reduction explains chimera shape: when multi-body interaction matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05366v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an extension of the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model for networks, deriving the second-order phase approximation for a paradigmatic model of oscillatory networks - an ensemble of non-identical Stuart-Landau oscillators coupled pairwisely via an arbitrary coupling matrix. We explicitly demonstrate how this matrix translates into the coupling structure in the phase equations. To illustrate the power of our approach and the crucial importance of high-order phase reduction, we tackle a trendy setup of non-locally coupled oscillators exhibiting a chimera state. We reveal that our second-order phase model reproduces the dependence of the chimera shape on the coupling strength that is not captured by the typically used first-order Kuramoto-like model. Our derivation contributes to a better understanding of complex networks' dynamics, establishing a relation between the coupling matrix and multi-body interaction terms in the high-order phase model.</description>
