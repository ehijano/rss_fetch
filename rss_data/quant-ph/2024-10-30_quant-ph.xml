      <title>Improved phase sensitivity of an SU(1,1) interferometer based on the internal single-path local squeezing operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to passive interferometers, SU(1,1) interferometers exhibit superior phase sensitivity due to the incorporation of nonlinear elements that enhance their ability to detect phase shifts. However, the precision of these interferometers is significantly affected by photon losses, especially internal losses, which can limit the overall measurement accuracy. Addressing these issues is essential to fully realize the advantages of SU(1,1) interferometers in practical applications. We propose a theoretical scheme to improve the precision of phase measurement using homodyne detection by implementing the single-path local squeezing operation (LSO) inside the SU(1,1) interferometer, with the coherent state and the vacuum state as the input states. We not only analyze the effects of the single-path LSO scheme on the phase sensitivity and the quantum Fisher information (QFI) under both ideal and photon-loss cases but also compare the effects of different squeezing parameters $r$ on the system performance. Our findings reveal that the internal single-path LSO scheme can enhance the phase sensitivity and the QFI, effectively improving the robustness of the SU(1,1) interferometer against internal and external photon losses. Additionally, a larger squeezing parameter $r$ leads to a better performance of the interferometer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of quantum computing has opened new possibilities in data science, offering unique capabilities for addressing complex, data-intensive problems. Traditional machine learning algorithms often face challenges in high-dimensional or limited-quality datasets, which are common in healthcare. Quantum Machine Learning leverages quantum properties, such as superposition and entanglement, to enhance pattern recognition and classification, potentially surpassing classical approaches. This paper explores QML's application in healthcare, focusing on quantum kernel methods and hybrid quantum-classical networks for heart disease prediction and COVID-19 detection, assessing their feasibility and performance.</description>

      <title>Extendibility limits quantum-secured communication and key distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secret-key distillation from quantum states and channels is a central task of interest in quantum information theory, as it facilitates private communication over a quantum network. Here, we study the task of secret-key distillation from bipartite states and point-to-point quantum channels using local operations and one-way classical communication (one-way LOCC). We employ the resource theory of unextendible entanglement to study the transformation of a bipartite state under one-way LOCC, and we obtain several efficiently computable upper bounds on the number of secret bits that can be distilled from a bipartite state using one-way LOCC channels; these findings apply not only in the one-shot setting but also in some restricted asymptotic settings. We extend our formalism to private communication over a quantum channel assisted by forward classical communication. We obtain efficiently computable upper bounds on the one-shot forward-assisted private capacity of a channel, thus addressing a question in the theory of quantum-secured communication that has been open for some time now. Our formalism also provides upper bounds on the rate of private communication when using a large number of channels in such a way that the error in the transmitted private data decreases exponentially with the number of channel uses. Moreover, our bounds can be computed using semidefinite programs, thus providing a computationally feasible method to understand the limits of private communication over a quantum network.</description>

      <title>Observable-projected ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements in many-body quantum systems can generate non-trivial phenomena, such as preparation of long-range entangled states, dynamical phase transitions, or measurement-altered criticality. Here, we introduce a new measurement scheme that produces an ensemble of mixed states in a subsystem, obtained by measuring a local Hermitian observable on part of its complement. We refer to this as the observable-projected ensemble. Unlike standard projected ensembles-where pure states are generated by projective measurements on the complement-our approach involves projective partial measurements of specific observables. This setup has two main advantages: theoretically, it is amenable to analytical computations, especially within conformal field theories. Experimentally, it requires only a linear number of measurements, rather than an exponential one, to probe the properties of the ensemble. As a first step in exploring the observable-projected ensemble, we investigate its entanglement properties in conformal field theory and perform a detailed analysis of the free compact boson.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Non-Abelian Topological Order against Heralded Noise via Local Lindbladian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important open question for the current generation of highly controllable quantum devices is understanding which phases can be realized as stable steady-states under local quantum dynamics. In this work, we show how robust steady-state phases with both Abelian and non-Abelian mixed-state topological order can be stabilized against generic ``heralded" noise using active dynamics that incorporate measurement and feedback, modeled as a $\textit{fully local}$ Lindblad master equation. These topologically ordered steady states are two-way connected to pure topologically ordered ground states using local quantum channels, and preserve quantum information for a time that is exponentially large in the system size. Specifically, we present explicit constructions of families of local Lindbladians for both Abelian ($\mathbb{Z}_2$) and non-Abelian ($D_4$) topological order whose steady-states host mixed-state topological order when the noise is below a threshold strength. As the noise strength is increased, these models exhibit first-order transitions to intermediate mixed state phases where they encode robust classical memories, followed by (first-order) transitions to a trivial steady state at high noise rates. When the noise is imperfectly heralded, steady-state order disappears but our active dynamics significantly enhances the lifetime of the encoded logical information. To carry out the numerical simulations for the non-Abelian $D_4$ case, we introduce a generalized stabilizer tableau formalism that permits efficient simulation of the non-Abelian Lindbladian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Approaches to Simultaneously Solving Variational Quantum Eigensolver Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), a type of variational quantum algorithm, is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to find the lowest-energy eigenstate of a particular Hamiltonian. We investigate ways to optimize the VQE solving process on multiple instances of the same problem, by observing the process on one instance of the problem to inform initialization for other processes. We aim to take advantage of the VQE solution process to obtain useful information while disregarding information which we can predict to not be very useful. In particular, we find that the solution process produces lots of data with very little new information. Therefore, we can safely disregard much of this repetitive information with little effect on the outcome of the solution process.</description>

      <title>Nearly tight bounds for testing tree tensor network states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree tensor network states (TTNS) generalize the notion of having low Schmidt-rank to multipartite quantum states, through a parameter known as the bond dimension. This leads to succinct representations of quantum many-body systems with a tree-like entanglement structure. In this work, we study the task of testing whether an unknown pure state is a TTNS on $n$ qudits with bond dimension at most $r$, or is far in trace distance from any such state. We first establish that, independent of the physical dimensions, $O(nr^2)$ copies of the state suffice to acccomplish this task with one-sided error, as in the matrix product state (MPS) test of Soleimanifar and Wright. We then prove that $\Omega(n r^2/\log n)$ copies are necessary for any test with one-sided error whenever $r\geq 2 + \log n$. In particular, this closes a quadratic gap in the previous bounds for MPS testing in this setting, up to log factors. On the other hand, when $r=2$ we show that $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ copies are both necessary and sufficient for the related task of testing whether a state is a product of $n$ bipartite states having Schmidt-rank at most $r$, for some choice of physical dimensions.
  We also study the performance of tests using measurements performed on a small number of copies at a time. In the setting of one-sided error, we prove that adaptive measurements offer no improvement over non-adaptive measurements for many properties, including TTNS. We then derive a closed-form solution for the acceptance probability of an $(r+1)$-copy rank test with rank parameter $r$. This leads to nearly tight bounds for testing rank, Schmidt-rank, and TTNS when the tester is restricted to making measurements on $r+1$ copies at a time. For example, when $r=2$ there is an MPS test with one-sided error which uses $O(n^2)$ copies and measurements performed on just three copies at a time.</description>

      <title>Near-field dynamical Casimir effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the dynamical Casimir effect in a time-modulated near-field system. The system consists of two bodies made of polaritonic materials, that are brought in close proximity to each other, and the modulation frequency is approximately twice the relevant resonance frequencies of the system. We develop a rigorous fluctuational electrodynamics formalism to explore the produced Casimir flux, associated with the degenerate as well as non-degenerate two-polariton emission processes. We have identified flux contributions from both quantum and thermal fluctuations at finite temperatures, with a dominant quantum contribution even at room temperature under the presence of a strong near-field effect. We have conducted a nonclassicality test for the total radiative flux at finite temperatures, and shown that nonclasscical states of emitted photons can be obtained for a high temperature up to $\sim 250\,$K. Our findings open an avenue for the exploration of dynamical Casimir effect beyond cryogenic temperatures, and may be useful for creating tunable nanoscale nonclassical light sources.</description>

      <title>Spin-1 Haldane phase in a chain of Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a protocol to implement a spin-1 chain in Rydberg systems using three Rydberg states close to a F\"orster resonance. In addition to dipole-dipole interactions, strong van der Waals interactions naturally appear due to the presence of the F\"orster resonance and give rise to a highly tunable Hamiltonian. The resulting phase diagram is studied using the infinite density-matrix renormalization group and reveals a highly robust Haldane phase -- a prime example of a symmetry protected topological phase. We find experimentally accessible parameters to probe the Haldane phase in current Rydberg systems, and demonstrate an efficient adiabatic preparation scheme. This paves the way to probe the remarkable properties of spin fractionalization in the Haldane phase.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spread-Spectrum CDMA Communication Systems: Mathematical Foundations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the fundamental principles and mathematical foundations of quantum spread spectrum code division multiple access (QCDMA) communication systems. The evolution of quantum signals through the direct-sequence spread spectrum multiple access communication system is carefully characterized by a novel approach called the decomposition of creation operators. In this methodology, the creation operator of the transmitted quantum signal is decomposed into the chip-time interval creation operators each of which is defined over the duration of a chip. These chip-time interval creation operators are the invariant building blocks of the spread spectrum quantum communication systems. With the aid of the proposed chip-time decomposition approach, we can find closed-form relations for quantum signals at the receiver of such a quantum communication system. Further, the paper details the principles of narrow-band filtering of quantum signals required at the receiver, a crucial step in designing and analyzing quantum communication systems. We show that by employing coherent states as the transmitted quantum signals, the inter-user interference appears as an additive term in the magnitude of the output coherent (Glauber) state, and the output of the quantum communication system is a pure quantum signal. On the other hand, if the transmitters utilize particle-like quantum signals (Fock states) such as single photon states, entanglement and a spread spectrum version of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect can arise at the receivers. The important techniques developed in this paper are expected to have far-reaching implications for various applications in the exciting field of quantum communication and signal processing.</description>

      <title>Disentanglement process in dephasing channel with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state classification and entanglement quantification are of significant importance in the fundamental research of quantum information science and various quantum applications. Traditional methods, such as quantum state tomography, face exponential measurement demands with increasing numbers of qubits, necessitating more efficient approaches. Recent work has shown promise in using artificial neural networks (ANNs) for quantum state analysis. However, existing ANNs may falter when confronted with states affected by dephasing noise, especially with limited data and computational resources. In this study, we employ a machine-learning approach to investigate the disentanglement process in two-qubit systems in the presence of dephasing noise. Our findings highlight the limitations of general state-trained ANNs in classifying states under dephasing noise. Specialized ANN algorithms, tailored for classifying states and quantifying entanglement in such noisy environments, demonstrate excellent performance using only a subset of tomographic features.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Estimation without Controlled Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21517v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we demonstrate the use of adapted classical phase retrieval algorithms to perform control-free quantum phase estimation. We eliminate the costly controlled time evolution and Hadamard test commonly required to access the complex time-series needed to reconstruct the spectrum. This significant reduction of the number of coherent controlled-operations lowers the circuit depth and considerably simplifies the implementation of statistical quantum phase estimation in near-term devices. This seemingly impossible task can be achieved by extending the problem that one wishes to solve to one with a larger set of input signals while exploiting natural constraints on the signal and/or the spectrum. We leverage well-established algorithms that are widely used in the context of classical signal processing, demonstrating two complementary methods to do this, vectorial phase retrieval and two-dimensional phase retrieval. We numerically investigate the feasibility of both approaches for estimating the spectrum of the Fermi-Hubbard model and discuss their resilience to inherent statistical noise.</description>

      <title>Entanglement generation using single-photon pulse reflection in realistic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general entanglement generation protocol between remote stationary qubits using single-photon reflection in a photonic network is explored theoretically. The nodes of the network consist of single qubits that are typically represented by the spin of a color center, each localized in a separate optical cavity and linked to other nodes via photonic links such as optical fibers. We derive a model applicable to a wide range of parameters and scenarios to describe the nodes and the local spin-photon interaction accounting for the pulsed (finite bandwidth) nature of flying single photons while optimizing the rate and fidelity. We investigate entanglement generation between remote qubits and tailor protocols to a variety of physical implementations with different properties. Of particular interest is the regime of weak coupling and low cooperativity between spin and cavity which is relevant in the cases of the nitrogen and silicon vacancy centers in diamond. We also take into account the variability of the properties between realistic (stationary) nodes.</description>

      <title>Learning the structure of any Hamiltonian from minimal assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning an unknown quantum many-body Hamiltonian $H$ from black-box queries to its time evolution $e^{-\mathrm{i} H t}$. Prior proposals for solving this task either impose some assumptions on $H$, such as its interaction structure or locality, or otherwise use an exponential amount of computational postprocessing. In this paper, we present efficient algorithms to learn any $n$-qubit Hamiltonian, assuming only a bound on the number of Hamiltonian terms, $m \leq \mathrm{poly}(n)$. Our algorithms do not need to know the terms in advance, nor are they restricted to local interactions. We consider two models of control over the time evolution: the first has access to time reversal ($t &lt; 0$), enabling an algorithm that outputs an $\epsilon$-accurate classical description of $H$ after querying its dynamics for a total of $\widetilde{O}(m/\epsilon)$ evolution time. The second access model is more conventional, allowing only forward-time evolutions; our algorithm requires $\widetilde{O}(\|H\|^3/\epsilon^4)$ evolution time in this setting. Central to our results is the recently introduced concept of a pseudo-Choi state of $H$. We extend the utility of this learning resource by showing how to use it to learn the Fourier spectrum of $H$, how to achieve nearly Heisenberg-limited scaling with it, and how to prepare it even under our more restricted access models.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-enhanced AC magnetometry in the presence of Markovian noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is a resource to improve the sensitivity of quantum sensors. In an ideal case, using an entangled state as a probe to detect target fields, we can beat the standard quantum limit by which all classical sensors are bounded. However, since entanglement is fragile against decoherence, it is unclear whether entanglement-enhanced metrology is useful in a noisy environment. Its benefit is indeed limited when estimating the amplitude of DC magnetic fields under the effect of parallel Markovian decoherence, where the noise operator is parallel to the target field. In this paper, on the contrary, we show an advantage to using an entanglement over the classical strategy under the effect of parallel Markovian decoherence when we try to detect AC magnetic fields. We consider a scenario to induce a Rabi oscillation of the qubits with the target AC magnetic fields. Although we can, in principle, estimate the amplitude of the AC magnetic fields from the Rabi oscillation, the signal becomes weak if the qubit frequency is significantly detuned from the frequency of the AC magnetic field. We show that, by using the GHZ states, we can significantly enhance the signal of the detuned Rabi oscillation even under the effect of parallel Markovian decoherence. Our method is based on the fact that the interaction time between the GHZ states and AC magnetic fields scales as $1/L$ to mitigate the decoherence effect where $L$ is the number of qubits, which contributes to improving the bandwidth of the detectable frequencies of the AC magnetic fields. Our results open up the way for new applications of entanglement-enhanced AC magnetometry.</description>

      <title>Impact of spatial curvature on quantum Otto engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a quantum Otto cycle with a quantum harmonic oscillator on a circle as its working substance. Since the eigen-energies of this oscillator depend on the curvature of the circle, this model, as an analog model, enables us to investigate the curvature effects of the physical space on properties of quantum heat engines. We assume that two classical hot and cold thermal baths are located at places with different curvatures. We calculate the curvature-dependent work and heat in our Otto cycle with a particular emphasis on how curvature affects it's thermal efficiency. By changing the curvature difference between the bath's locations, we find that the efficiency of our heat engine can exceed the Carnot efficiency limit.</description>

      <title>Photonic Quantum Receiver Attaining the Helstrom Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient decomposition scheme for a quantum receiver that attains the Helstrom bound in the low-photon regime for discriminating binary coherent states. Our method, which avoids feedback as used in Dolinar's case, breaks down nonlinear operations into basic gates used in continuous-variable quantum computation. We account for realistic conditions by examining the impact of photon loss and imperfect photon detection, including the presence of dark counts, while presenting squeezing as a technique to mitigate these noise sources and maintain the advantage over SQL. Our scheme motivates testing quantum advantages with cubic-phase gates and designing photonic quantum computers to optimize symbol-by-symbol measurements in optical communication.</description>

Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Arunachalam &amp; Dutt ([AD24]) on the existence of a tolerant stabilizer testing algorithm, and achieve an exponential improvement in the parameters of the tester.

      <title>Classical Algorithms for Constant Approximation of the Ground State Energy of Local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct classical algorithms computing an approximation of the ground state energy of an arbitrary $k$-local Hamiltonian acting on $n$ qubits.
  We first consider the setting where a good ``guiding state'' is available, which is the main setting where quantum algorithms are expected to achieve an exponential speedup over classical methods. We show that a constant approximation of the ground state energy can be computed classically in $\mathrm{poly}\left(1/\chi,n\right)$ time and $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ space, where $\chi$ denotes the overlap between the guiding state and the ground state (as in prior works in dequantization, we assume sample-and-query access to the guiding state). This gives a significant improvement over the recent classical algorithm by Gharibian and Le Gall (SICOMP 2023), and matches (up a to polynomial overhead) both the time and space complexities of quantum algorithms for constant approximation of the ground state energy. We also obtain classical algorithms for higher-precision approximation.
  For the setting where no guided state is given (i.e., the standard version of the local Hamiltonian problem), we obtain a classical algorithm computing a constant approximation of the ground state energy in $2^{O(n)}$ time and $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ space. To our knowledge, before this work it was unknown how to classically achieve these bounds simultaneously, even for constant approximation. We also discuss complexity-theoretic aspects of our results and their implications for the quantum PCP conjecture.</description>

      <title>Metastability-Induced Solid-State Quantum Batteries for Powering Microwave Quantum Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metastability is ubiquitous in diverse complex systems. In open quantum systems, metastability offers protection against dissipation and decoherence, yet its application in quantum batteries remains unexplored. We propose a solid-state open quantum battery where metastable states enable stable superextensive charging without complicated protocols and energy storage with extended lifetime. Using a realistic organic maser platform, we show the controllable manner of the work extraction from the quantum battery, which can be exploited for on-demand coherent microwave emission at room temperature. These results not only demonstrate the usefulness of metastability for developing the quantum batteries robust against energy losses, but also provide a paradigm of the practical quantum device powered up by quantum batteries.</description>

      <title>Adding or Subtracting a single Photon is the same for Pure Squeezed Vacuum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The addition of a single photon to a light field can lead to exactly the same \emph{outcome} as the subtraction of a single photon. We prove that this \cterm is true for pure squeezed vacuum states of light, and in some sense only for those. We show that mixed states can show this \cterm for addition or subtraction of a photon if they are generated from incoherent sums of pure squeezed vacuum states with the same squeezing. We point out that our results give a reinterpretation to the fact that pure squeezed vacuum states, with squeezing $e^{-z}$, are formally annihilated by Bogoliubov-transformed annihilation operators: $\hat a_z = \hat a \cosh(z) - \hat a^\dagger \sinh(z) $.</description>

Abstract: We formulate a precise tradeoff relation between correlation and disturbance in a sequential quantum measurement setup. This relation, examined for qubit case, highlights key symmetry properties useful for the robust estimation and characterization of measurement parameters in the presence of local unitary noise, or in scenarios lacking shared reference frames. In addition, we report on the experimental implementation of the proposal in a neutron optical experiment, which proved particularly valuable for calibrating and optimizing measurement devices as confirmed by the theoretical result.</description>

      <title>A fast hybrid classical-quantum algorithm based on block successive over-relaxation for the heat differential equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) is essential in computational physics. Over the past few decades, various quantum-based methods have been developed to formulate and solve PDEs. Solving PDEs incur high time complexity for real-world problems with high dimensions, and using traditional methods becomes practically inefficient. This paper presents a fast hybrid classical-quantum paradigm based on successive over-relaxation (SOR) to accelerate solving PDEs. Using the discretization method, this approach reduces the PDE solution to solving a system of linear equations, which is then addressed using the block SOR method. Due to limitations in the number of qubits, the block SOR method is employed, where the entire system of linear equations is decomposed into smaller subsystems. These subsystems are iteratively solved block-wise using Advantage quantum computers developed by D-Wave Systems, and the solutions are subsequently combined to obtain the overall solution. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by solving the heat equation for a square plate with fixed boundary temperatures and comparing the results with the best existing method. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accelerate the solution of high-dimensional PDEs by using a limited number of qubits up to 2 times the existing method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being a pillar of quantum mechanics, little attention has been paid to the onset of Fermi's golden rule as a discrete microscopic bath of modes approaches the macroscopic thermodynamic limit and forms a continuum. Motivated by recent experiments in circuit quantum electrodynamics, we tackle this question through the lens of single-photon decay in a finite transmission line coupled to a qubit ("quantum impurity"). We consider a single-photon state, coupled via the nonlinear impurity to several baths formed by multi-photon states with different number of photons, which are inherently discrete due to the finite size of the line. We focus on the late-time dynamics of the single-photon, and uncover the conditions under which the photon's decoherence rate approaches the decay rate predicted by Fermi's golden rule. We show that it is necessary to keep a small but finite escape rate (unrelated to the impurity) for each single-photon mode to obtain a finite long-time decay rate. We analyze the contribution of the baths formed by many-body states with different number of photons, and illustrate how the decay rate induced by some bath of $n$ photon states is enhanced by the presence of other baths of $m \neq n$ photon states, highlighting the contribution of cascade photon decay processes. Our formalism could be used to analyze recent experiments in superconducting circuits.</description>

Abstract: We study consequences of applying formalism of symplectic geometry to quantum mechanics.

      <description>arXiv:2410.21976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully quantum conditional entropies play a central role in quantum information theory and cryptography, where they measure the uncertainty about a quantum system from the perspective of an observer with access to a potentially correlated system. Through a novel construction, we introduce a comprehensive family of conditional entropies that reveals a unified structure underlying all previously studied forms of quantum conditional R\'enyi entropies, organizing them within a cohesive mathematical framework. This new family satisfies a range of desiderata, including data processing inequalities, additivity under tensor products, duality relations, chain rules, concavity or convexity, and various parameter monotonicity relations. Our approach provides unified proofs that streamline and generalize prior, more specialized arguments. We also derive new insights into well-known quantities, such as Petz conditional entropies, particularly in the context of chain rules. We expect this family of entropies, along with our generalized chain rules, to find applications in quantum cryptography and information theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-partite entanglement is fundamental to emerging quantum technologies such as quantum networks, which ultimately require devices with strong light-matter interactions and long coherence times. Here, we introduce nanobeam photonic crystal cavities combining both extreme quality factors ($\sim10^{7}$) with sub-wavelength field confinement to reach unprecedented light-matter interactions. Operating at $780$ nm, our devices are tailored for efficient coupling and entanglement with ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms, a key ingredient in quantum networks due to their hyperfine structure. Our new designs also facilitate the precise optical trapping of atoms, and we demonstrate coherent entanglement generation between them, that is remarkably resilient to atomic displacements. These platforms can be easily scaled-up to extremely large quantum networks, for distributed quantum computing and future light-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Optimal convergence rates in trace distance and relative entropy for the quantum central limit theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum analogue of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), first introduced by Cushen and Hudson (1971), states that the $n$-fold convolution $\rho^{\boxplus n}$ of an $m$-mode quantum state $\rho$ with zero first moments and finite second moments converges weakly, as $n$ increases, to a Gaussian state $\rho_G$ with the same first and second moments. Recently, this result has been extended with estimates of the convergence rate in various distance measures. In this paper, we establish optimal rates of convergence in both the trace distance and quantum relative entropy. Specifically, we show that for a centered $m$-mode quantum state with finite third-order moments, the trace distance between $\rho^{\boxplus n}$ and $\rho_G$ decays at the optimal rate of $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$, consistent with known convergence rates. Furthermore, for states with finite fourth-order moments (plus a small correction $\delta$ for $m&gt;1$), we prove that the relative entropy between $\rho^{\boxplus n}$ and $\rho_G$ decays at the optimal rate of $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1})$. Both of these rates are proven to be optimal, even when assuming the finiteness of all moments of $\rho$. These results relax previous assumptions on higher-order moments, yielding convergence rates that match the best known results in the classical setting. Our proofs draw on techniques from the classical literature, including Edgeworth-type expansions of quantum characteristic functions, adapted to the quantum context. A key technical step in the proof of our entropic CLT is establishing an upper bound on the relative entropy distance between a general quantum state and its Gaussification. As a by-product of this, an upper bound on the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is derived, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting information from quantum many-body systems remains a key challenge in quantum technologies due to experimental limitations. In this work, we employ a single spin qubit to probe a strongly interacting system, creating an environment conducive to qubit decoherence. By focusing on the XXZ spin chain, we observe diverse dynamics in the qubit evolution, reflecting different parameters of the chain. This demonstrates that a spin qubit can probe both quantitative properties of the spin chain and qualitative characteristics, such as the bipartite entanglement entropy, phase transitions, and perturbation propagation velocity within the system. This approach reveals the power of small quantum systems to probe the properties of large, strongly correlated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Complex-Phase Extensions of Szegedy Quantum Walk on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a graph-phased Szegedy's quantum walk, which incorporates link phases and local arbitrary phase rotations (APR), unlocking new possibilities for quantum algorithm efficiency. We demonstrate how to adapt quantum circuits to these advancements, allowing phase patterns that ensure computational practicality. The graph-phased model broadens the known equivalence between coined quantum walks and Szegedy's model, accommodating a wider array of coin operators. Through illustrative examples, we reveal intriguing disparities between classical and quantum interpretations of walk dynamics. Remarkably, local APR phases emerge as powerful tools for marking graph nodes, optimizing quantum searches without altering graph structure. We further explore the surprising nuances between single and double operator approaches, highlighting a greater range of compatible coins with the latter. To facilitate these advancements, we present an improved classical simulation algorithm, which operates with superior efficiency. This study not only refines quantum walk methodologies but also paves the way for future explorations, including potential applications in quantum search and PageRank algorithms. Our findings illuminate the path towards more versatile and powerful quantum computing paradigms.</description>

      <title>Training via quantum superposition circumventing local minima and vanishing gradient of sinusoidal neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have been very successful in applications ranging from computer vision and natural language processing to strategy optimization in games. Recently neural networks with sinusoidal activation functions (SinNN) were found to be ideally suited for representing complex natural signals and their fine spatial and temporal details, which makes them effective representations of images, sound, and video, and good solvers of differential equations. However, training SinNN via gradient descent often results in bad local minima, posing a significant challenge when optimizing their weights. Furthermore, when the weights are discretized for better memory and inference efficiency on small devices, we find that a vanishing gradient problem appears on the resulting discrete SinNN (DSinNN). Brute force search provides an alternative way to find the best weights for DSinNN but is intractable for a large number of parameters. We here provide a qualitatively different training method: an algorithm for quantum training of DSinNNs. The quantum training evolves an initially uniform superposition over weight values to one that is guaranteed to peak on the best weights. We demonstrate the algorithm on toy examples and show that it indeed outperforms gradient descent in optimizing the loss function and outperforms brute force search in the time required.</description>

      <title>From spin squeezing to fast state discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is great interest in generating and controlling entanglement in Bose-Einstein condensates and similar ensembles for use in quantum computation, simulation, and sensing. One class of entangled states useful for enhanced metrology are spin-squeezed states of $N$ two-level atoms. After preparing a spin coherent state of width $1/\sqrt{N}$ centered at coordinates $( \theta, \phi) $ on the Bloch sphere, atomic interactions generate a nonlinear evolution that shears the state's probability density, stretching it to an ellipse and causing squeezing in a direction perpendicular to the major axis. Here we consider the same setup but in the $N \rightarrow \infty $ limit . This shrinks the initial coherent state to zero area. Large $N$ also suppresses two-particle entanglement and squeezing, as required by a monogamy bound. The torsion (1-axis twist) is still present, however, and the center of the large $N$ coherent state evolves as a qubit governed by a two-state Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The resulting nonlinearity is known to be a powerful resource in quantum computation. It can be used to implement single-input quantum state discrimination, an impossibility within linear one-particle quantum mechanics. We obtain a solution to the discrimination problem in terms of a Viviani curve on the Bloch sphere. We also consider an open-system variant containing both Bloch sphere torsion and dissipation. In this case it should be possible to generate two basins of attraction within the Bloch ball, having a shared boundary that can be used for a type of autonomous state discrimination. We explore these and other connections between spin squeezing in the large $N$ limit and nonlinear quantum gates, and argue that a two-component condensate is a promising platform for realizing a nonlinear qubit.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits, Feature Maps, and Expanded Pseudo-Entropy: A Categorical Theoretic Analysis of Encoding Real-World Data into a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscripts proposes a new and novel numerical method to the determine the efficacy of an encoding scheme to map real-world data into a quantum circuit. The method calculates the Shannon entropy of each of the data points from a point-cloud, hence, samples from an embedded manifold, and calculates the expanded concept of pseudo-entropy applied to each respective quantum operator that comes from a given quantum feature map, and not the density operator. In the recent decade, there has been a continuous advancement of translating machine learning into a quantum circuit with many promising results. For quantum machine learning, a major underlying question is how to encode real-world data into a quantum circuit without losing information and adding noise. A few notable methods derived are expressibility, where the distribution of the output of states from the circuit are compared against the Haar probability measure with information theoretic techniques, and expressivity, a method that maps the expectation of a quantum circuit to the space of complex functions via a partial Fourier series, noting that more intricate the function the more expressive, and using the symmetry embedded within the data to derive a quantum feature map. The proposed pseudo-entropy method is discussed to and empirically shown to generalize these methods. Furthermore, this method is argued to also generalize symmetric quantum feature maps. The discussions and arguments are a reasonable basis for understanding the connections but require deeper mathematical analysis.</description>

      <title>A quantum cloning game with applications to quantum position verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum cloning game in which $k$ separate collaborative parties receive a classical input, determining which of them has to share a maximally entangled state with an additional party (referee). We provide the optimal winning probability of such a game for every number of parties $k$, and show that it decays exponentially when the game is played $n$ times in parallel. These results have applications to quantum cryptography, in particular in the topic of quantum position verification, where we show security of the routing protocol (played in parallel), and a variant of it, in the random oracle model.</description>

      <title>Charging a quantum spin network towards Heisenberg-limited precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a cooperative protocol to charge quantum spin networks up to the highest-energy configuration, in terms of the network's magnetization. The charging protocol leverages spin-spin interactions and the crossing of a phase transition's critical point. Exploiting collective dynamics of the spin network, the cooperative protocol guarantees a precision advantage over any local charging protocol and leads to fluctuations (standard deviation) of the magnetization that scale as $1/N$, with $N$ being the number of spins in the network, i.e., the size of the spin battery. These findings mirror the Heisenberg limit for precision for parameter estimation in quantum metrology. We test our protocol on the D-Wave's Advantage quantum processing unit by charging sub-lattices with sizes ranging from $40$ to $5\,612$ spins, achieving the maximum magnetization and reaching a scalable charging precision beyond the standard quantum limit of $1/\sqrt{N}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Spin-1 XXZ-Heisenberg Models and the Haldane Phase with Dysprosium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dysprosium atoms have proven to be a promising platform for quantum simulation due to their strong magnetic moment and high tunability of interactions. In this work, we propose Dysprosium atoms for simulating the one-dimensional spin-1 XXZ-Heisenberg model, which is known to have a rich phase diagram including the famous Haldane phase. To realize the model, we make use of the strong dipolar exchange interactions that naturally occur in the ground state of Dysprosium due to its large electron angular momentum of J=8. To implement spin-1 particles, we encode the spin degree of freedom into three Zeeman sublevels, which are energetically isolated by applying a magnetic field. Using the density-matrix renormalization group, we analyze the ground-state properties of the resulting effective model. We find that a chain of fermionic Dysprosium atoms in a suitable magnetic field can form a Haldane state with the characteristic spin-1/2 edge modes. Furthermore, we discuss the use of AC Stark shifts and Raman-type schemes for bosonic Dysprosium to isolate effective spin-1 systems and to increase the tunability of model parameters.</description>

      <title>A note on polynomial-time tolerant testing stabilizer states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show an improved inverse theorem for the Gowers-$3$ norm of $n$-qubit quantum states $|\psi\rangle$ which states that: for every $\gamma\geq 0$, if the $\textsf{Gowers}(|\psi \rangle,3)^8 \geq \gamma$ then the stabilizer fidelity of $|\psi\rangle$ is at least $\gamma^C$ for some constant $C&gt;1$. This implies a constant-sample polynomial-time tolerant testing algorithm for stabilizer states which accepts if an unknown state is $\varepsilon_1$-close to a stabilizer state in fidelity and rejects when $|\psi\rangle$ is $\varepsilon_2 \leq \varepsilon_1^C$-far from all stabilizer states, promised one of them is the case.</description>

      <title>Automorphism-Assisted Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for efficient graph optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we report on the application of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to solve the unweighted MaxCut problem on tree-structured graphs. Specifically, we utilize the Nauty (No Automorphisms, Yes?) package to identify graph automorphisms, focusing on determining edge equivalence classes. These equivalence classes also correspond to symmetries in the terms of the associated Ising Hamiltonian. By exploiting these symmetries, we achieve a significant reduction in the complexity of the Hamiltonian, thereby facilitating more efficient quantum simulations. We conduct benchmark experiments on graphs with up to 34 nodes on memory and CPU intensive TPU provided by google Colab, applying QAOA with a single layer ($p=1$). The approximation ratios obtained from both the full and symmetry-reduced Hamiltonians are systematically compared. Our results show that using automorphism-based symmetries to reduce the Pauli terms in the Hamiltonian can significantly decrease computational overhead without compromising the quality of the solutions obtained.</description>

      <title>Quantum permutation puzzles with indistinguishable particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permutation puzzles, such as the Rubik's cube and the 15 puzzle, are enjoyed by the general public and mathematicians alike. Here we introduce quantum versions of permutation puzzles where the pieces of the puzzles are replaced with indistinguishable quantum particles. The moves in the puzzle are achieved by swapping or permuting the particles. We show that simply permuting the particles can be mapped to a classical permutation puzzle, even though the identical particles are entangled. However, we obtain a genuine quantum puzzle by adding a quantum move-the square root of SWAP. The resulting puzzle cannot be mapped to a classical permutation puzzle. We focus predominately on the quantization of the $2\times 2$ slide puzzle and briefly treat the $2\times 2 \times 1$ Rubik's cube.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Channel Reshaping for Improved Entanglement Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement sharing across noisy channels is a vital task for quantum information processing. In this work, we introduce two-way classical communication-assisted entanglement distillation protocols that improve rates for Pauli and non-Pauli channels. We achieve these improvements by reshaping several uses of a very noisy channel into a better effective channel, and applying this channel processing in an adaptive and recurrent manner. For the amplitude damping channel, we observe that reshaping the channel into an erasure channel using the dual-rail encoding improves upon the reverse coherent information. We extend this idea to higher-weight encodings and achieve further improvements for the amplitude damping channel. For the depolarizing channel, we introduce the Greedy recurrence protocol with proven performance guarantees, and construct a combined recurrent protocol that can produce rates exceeding that of previous individual protocols.</description>

      <title>Parametric longitudinal coupling of a semiconductor charge qubit and a RF resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we provide a full experimental characterization of the parametric longitudinal coupling between a CMOS charge qubit and an off-chip RF resonator. Following Corrigan et al, Phys. Rev. Applied 20, 064005 (2023), we activate parametric longitudinal coupling by driving the charge qubit at the resonator frequency. Managing the crosstalk between the drive applied to the qubit and the resonator allows for the systematic study of the dependence of the longitudinal and dispersive charge-photon couplings on the qubit-resonator detuning and the applied drive. Our experimental estimations of the charge-photon couplings are perfectly reproduced by theoretical simple formulas, without relying on any fitting parameter. We go further by showing a parametric displacement of the resonator's steady state, conditional on the qubit state, and the insensitivity of the longitudinal coupling constant on the photon population of the resonator. Our results open to the exploration of the photon-mediated longitudinal readout and coupling of multiple and distant spins, with long coherent times, in hybrid CMOS cQED architectures.</description>

      <title>QUBO Formulations for Variation of Domination Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the development of quantum computing, the use of quantum algorithms to solve combinatorial optimization problems on quantum computers has become a major research focus. The Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model serves as a bridge between combinatorial optimization problems and quantum computers, and is a prerequisite for these studies. In combinatorial optimization problems, the Domination Problem (DP) is related to many practical issues in the real world, such as the fire station problem, social network theory, and so on. Additionally, the DP has numerous variants, such as independent DP, total DP, k-domination, and so forth. However, there is a scarcity of quantum computing research on these variant problems. A possible reason for this is the lack of research on QUBO modeling for these issues. This paper investigates the QUBO modeling methods for the classic DP and its variants. Compared to previous studies, the QUBO modeling method we propose for the classic DP can utilize fewer qubits. This will lower the barrier for solving DP on quantum computers. At the same time, for many variants of DP problems, we provide their QUBO modeling methods for the first time. Our work will accelerate the entry of DP into the quantum era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extract the square root of the Minkowski metric using Dirac/Clifford matrices. The resulting $4\times 4$ operator $d{\bf S}$ that represents the square root, can be used to transform four vectors between relatively moving observers. This effects the usual Lorentz transformation. In addition it acts on a Dirac bi-spinor. The operator is essentially a Hamiltonian that can be used to write an equation of motion for a relativistic spinor. This turns out to be the Dirac equation for electrons in standard form. We believe that is is a new approach to familiar results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) that interchanges fermions and bosons is of great theoretical importance but has not yet been revealed experimentally in particle physics. It has also been desired to explore quantum-mechanical SUSY in microscopic lattice models. Inspired by the recent experiments of Floquet engineering of Rydberg atom arrays, we find that quantum mechanical SUSY can be realized in Floquet Rydberg atom arrays. Moreover, we utilize the supercharge dynamics to demonstrate the SUSY property of the model under investigation: the expectation value of supercharge freezes under time evolution for supersymmetric lattice models in contrast to the trivial oscillation for generic nonsupersymmetric lattice models. The proposal is validated on direct simulation of Rydberg atom arrays' dynamics and ready for experiments. This work sheds light on the future experimental exploration of SUSY with the help of Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

Abstract: Embedding materials in optical cavities has emerged as an intriguing perspective for controlling quantum materials, but a key challenge lies in measuring properties of the embedded matter. Here, we propose a framework for probing strongly correlated cavity-embedded materials through direct measurements of cavity photons. We derive general relations between photon and matter observables inside the cavity, and show how these can be measured via the emitted photons. As an example, we demonstrate how the entanglement phase transition of an embedded H$_2$ molecule can be accessed by measuring the cavity photon occupation, and showcase how dynamical spin correlation functions can be accessed by measuring dynamical photon correlation functions. Our framework provides an all-optical method to measure static and dynamic properties of cavity-embedded materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentz violation is a significant phenomenon in the framework of quantum physics, with implications for fundamental symmetries. In this paper, we explore the effects of Lorentz violation on quantum entanglement through a black hole spacetime that is coupled with a Lorentz-violating field. We establish the relationship between the Hartle-Hawking vacuum state and the Boulware number states for this case, and employ the near horizon approximation in an appropriate form to rewrite the black hole metric into a Rindler-like form. Subsequently, using this revised metric, the analytical forms of logarithmic negativity and mutual information are derived and plotted as functions of Rob's distance from the $ r=0 $ point. Based on the results, we find that the coupling between spacetime and the Lorentz-violating vector field alleviates gravity-induced entanglement degradation. At high mode frequencies, the effects of Lorentz violation are negligible, but they become significant at low frequencies. This suggests that investigating Lorentz violation at astrophysical scales requires low-frequency detectors, as the low energy of these fields enhances the significance of the Lorentz-violating field's non-zero vacuum expectation value.</description>

      <title>Antichiral and trap-skin dynamics in a nonreciprocal bosonic two-leg ladder with artificial magnetic flux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity and synthetic gauge fields play two fundamental roles in engineering exotic phases and dynamics in artificial quantum systems. Here we explore the mean-field dynamics of interacting bosons in a two-leg ladder with synthetic magnetic flux and nonreciprocal hopping under the open boundary condition. In the Hermitian limit, we showcase the breakdown of the flux-driven chiral dynamics due to the nonlinear self-trapping effect. We further find that the nonreciprocity can drive the transition between chiral dynamics and antichiral dynamics. The antichiral motion is manifested as the non-Hermitian skin dynamics along the same direction on two legs that are not suppressed by the magnetic flux, while the chiral-antichiral transition is flux-tunable. We also reveal the trap-skin dynamics with the coexistence of the self-tapping and skin dynamics in the ladder. Dynamical phase diagrams with respect to the chiral-antichiral dynamics, skin dynamics, self-trapping dynamics, and trap-skin dynamics are presented. Our results shed light on intriguing dynamical phenomena under the interplay among non-Hermiticity, nonlinearity, and artificial gauge fields.</description>

      <title>N\'eel Spin-Orbit Torque in Antiferromagnetic Quantum Spin and Anomalous Hall Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interplay between magnetic ordering and topological electrons not only enables new topological phases but also underpins electrical control of magnetism. Here we extend the Kane-Mele model to include the exchange coupling to a collinear background antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, which can describe transition metal trichalcogenides. Owing to the spin-orbit coupling and staggered on-site potential, the system could exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall and quantum spin Hall effects in the absence of a net magnetization. Besides the chiral edge states, these topological phases support a staggered Edelstein effect through which an applied electric field can generate opposite non-equilibrium spins on the two AFM sublattices, realizing the N\'eel-type spin-orbit torque (NSOT). Contrary to known NSOTs in AFM metals driven by conduction currents, our NSOT arises from pure adiabatic currents devoid of Joule heating, while being a bulk effect not carried by the edge currents. By virtue of the NSOT, the electric field of a microwave can drive the AFM dynamics with a remarkably high efficiency. Compared to the ordinary AFM resonance driven by the magnetic field, the new mechanism can enhance the resonance amplitude by more than one order of magnitude and the absorption rate of the microwave power by over two orders of magnitude. Our findings unravel an incredible way to exploit AFM topological phases to achieve ultrafast magnetic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unifying recent experiments on spin-valley locking in TMDC quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-valley or Kramers qubit promises significantly enhanced spin-valley lifetimes due to strong coupling of the electrons' spin to their momentum (valley) degrees of freedom. In transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such spin-valley locking is expected to be particularly strong owing to the significant intrinsic spin-orbit coupling strength. Very recently, a small number of experiments on TMDC quantum dots have put forth evidence for spin-valley locking for the first time at the few-electron limit. Employing quantum transport theory, here we numerically simulate their ground- and excited-state transport spectroscopy signatures in a unified theoretical framework. In doing so, we reveal the operating conditions under which spin-valley locking occurs in TMDC quantum dots, thereby weaving the connection between intrinsic material properties and the experimental data under diverse conditions. Our simulations thus provide a predictive modeling tool for TMDC quantum dots at the few-electron limit allowing us to deduce from experiments the degree of spin-valley locking based on the SOC strength, inter-valley mixing, and the spin and valley $g$-factors. Our theoretical analysis provides an important milestone towards the next challenge of experimentally confirming valley-relaxation times using single-shot projective measurements</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21850v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If a neutrino or antineutrino produced in the decay of an unstable particle is not entangled to its accompanying particles, its mass is necessarily correlated with its momentum. In this note, I illustrate this entanglement would destroy the quantum coherence between the neutrino's mass eigenstates in both the momentum and position representations, which was overlooked by other authors in previous investigations of entanglement and coherence associated with neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealing can efficiently obtain solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. Size-reduction methods are used to treat large-scale combinatorial optimization problems that cannot be input directly into a quantum annealer because of its size limitation. Various size-reduction methods using fixing spins have been proposed as quantum-classical hybrid methods to obtain solutions. However, the high performance of these hybrid methods is yet to be clearly elucidated. In this study, we adopted a parameterized fixing spins method to verify the effects of fixing spins. The results revealed that setting the appropriate number of spins of the subproblem is crucial for obtaining a satisfactory solution, and the energy gap expansion is confirmed after fixing spins.</description>

      <title>Optical signatures of dynamical excitonic condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study dynamical excitonic condensates occurring in bilayers with an imposed chemical potential difference and in photodoped semiconductors. We show that optical spectroscopy can experimentally identify phase-trapped and phase-delocalized dynamical regimes of condensation. In the weak-bias regime, the trapped dynamics of the order parameter's phase lead to an in-gap absorption line at a frequency almost independent of the bias voltage, while for larger biases, the frequency of the spectral feature increases approximately linearly with bias. In both cases there is a pronounced second harmonic response. Close to the transition between the trapped and freely oscillating states, we find a strong response upon application of a weak electric probe field and compare the results to those found in a minimal model description for the dynamics of the order parameter's phase and analyze the limitations of the latter.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reconstructions as Stepping Stones toward Psi-Doxastic Interpretations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum foundations, there is growing interest in the program of reconstructing the quantum formalism from clear physical principles. These reconstructions are formulated in an operational framework, deriving the formalism from information-theoretic principles. It has been recognized that this project is in tension with standard Psi-ontic interpretations. This paper presupposes that the quantum reconstruction program (QRP) (i) is a worthwhile project and (ii) puts pressure on Psi-ontic interpretations. Where does this leave us? Prima facie, it seems that Psi-epistemic interpretations perfectly fit the spirit of information-based reconstructions. However, Psi-epistemic interpretations, understood as saying that the wave functions represents one's knowledge about a physical system, recently have been challenged on technical and conceptual grounds. More importantly, for some researchers working on reconstructions, the lesson of successful reconstructions is that the wave function does not represent objective facts about the world. Since knowledge is a factive concept, this speaks against epistemic interpretations. In this paper, I discuss whether Psi-doxastic interpretations constitute a reasonable alternative. My thesis is that if we want to engage QRP with Psi-doxastic interpretations, then we should aim at a reconstruction that is spelled out in non-factive experiential terms.</description>

Abstract: Topologically protected states can be found in physical systems, that show singularities in some energy contour diagram. These singularities can be characterized by winding numbers, defined on a classification surface, which maps physical state parameters. We have found a classification surface, which applies for three-band hamiltonian systems in the same way than standard Bloch surface does for two-band ones. This generalized Bloch surface is universal in the sense that it classifies a very large class of three-band systems, which we have exhaustively studied, finding specific classification surfaces, applying for each one.</description>

      <title>Proto-Quipper with Reversing and Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum programming language Quipper supports circuit operations such as reversing and control, which allows programmers to control and reverse certain quantum circuits. In addition to these two operations, Quipper provides a function called with-computed, which can be used to program circuits of the form $g; f; g^{\dagger}$. The latter is a common pattern in quantum circuit design. One benefit of using with-computed, as opposed to constructing the circuit $g ; f; g^{\dagger}$ directly from $g$, $f$, and $g^{\dagger}$, is that it facilitates an important optimization. Namely, if the resulting circuit is later controlled, only the circuit $f$ in the middle needs to be controlled; the circuits $g$ and $g^{\dagger}$ need not even be controllable.
  In this paper, we formalize a semantics for reversible and controllable circuits, using a dagger symmetric monoidal category $\mathbf{R}$ to interpret reversible circuits, and a new notion we call a controllable category $\mathbf{N}$ to interpret controllable circuits. The controllable category $\mathbf{N}$ encompasses the control and with-computed operations in Quipper. We extend the language Proto-Quipper with reversing, control and the with-computed operation. Since not all circuits are reversible and/or controllable, we use a type system with modalities to track reversibility and controllability. This generalizes the modality of Fu-Kishida-Ross-Selinger 2023. We give an abstract categorical semantics for reversing, control and with-computed, and show that the type system and operational semantics are sound with respect to this semantics. Lastly, we construct a concrete model using a generalization of biset enrichment from Fu-Kishida-Ross-Selinger 2022.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.03148v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work provides a relativistic, digital quantum simulation scheme for both $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED), based on a discrete spacetime formulation of theory. It takes the form of a quantum circuit, infinitely repeating across space and time, parametrised by the discretization step $\Delta_t=\Delta_x$. Strict causality at each step is ensured as circuit wires coincide with the lightlike worldlines of QED; simulation time under decoherence is optimized. The construction replays the logic that leads to the QED Lagrangian. Namely, it starts from the Dirac quantum walk, well-known to converge towards free relativistic fermions. It then extends the quantum walk into a multi-particle sector quantum cellular automata in a way which respects the fermionic anti-commutation relations and the discrete gauge invariance symmetry. Both requirements can only be achieved at cost of introducing the gauge field. Lastly the gauge field is given its own electromagnetic dynamics, which can be formulated as a quantum walk at each plaquette.</description>

Abstract: Quantum error correction is an important ingredient for scalable quantum computing. Stabilizer codes are one of the most promising and straightforward ways to correct quantum errors, are convenient for logical operations, and improve performance with increasing the number of qubits involved. Here, we propose a resource-efficient scaling of a five-qubit perfect code with cyclic stabilizers for small distances on the ring architecture, which takes into account the topological features of the superconducting platform. We show an approach to construct the quantum circuit of a correction code with ancillas entangled with non-neighboring data qubits. Furthermore, we introduce a neural network-based decoding algorithm supported by an improved lookup table decoder and provide a numerical simulation of the proposed code, which demonstrates the exponential suppression of the logical error rate.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a design approach of reinforcement learning to engineer a gyroscope in an optical lattice for the inertial sensing of rotations. Our methodology is not based on traditional atom interferometry, that is, splitting, reflecting, and recombining wavefunction components. Instead, the learning agent is assigned the task of generating lattice shaking sequences that optimize the sensitivity of the gyroscope to rotational signals in an end-to-end design philosophy. What results is an interference device that is completely distinct from the familiar Mach-Zehnder-type interferometer. For the same total interrogation time, the end-to-end design leads to a 20-fold improvement in sensitivity over traditional Bragg interferometry.</description>

Abstract: Performing interferometry in an optical lattice formed by standing waves of light offers potential advantages over its free-space equivalents since the atoms can be confined and manipulated by the optical potential. We demonstrate such an interferometer in a one dimensional lattice and show the ability to control the atoms by imaging and reconstructing the wavefunction at many stages during its cycle. An acceleration signal is applied and the resulting performance is seen to be close to the optimum possible for the time-space area enclosed according to quantum theory. Our methodology of machine design enables the sensor to be reconfigurable on the fly, and when scaled up, offers the potential to make state-of-the art inertial and gravitational sensors that will have a wide range of potential applications.</description>

      <title>Topological Signal Processing on Quantum Computers for Higher-Order Network Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting and analyzing global behaviour of complex systems is challenging due to the intricate nature of their component interactions. Recent work has started modelling complex systems using networks endowed with multiway interactions among nodes, known as higher-order networks. Simplicial complexes are a class of higher-order networks that have received significant attention due to their topological structure and connections to Hodge theory. Topological signal processing (TSP) utilizes these connections to analyze and manipulate signals defined on non-Euclidean domains such as simplicial complexes. In this work, we present a general quantum algorithm for implementing filtering processes in TSP and describe its application to extracting network data based on the Hodge decomposition. We leverage pre-existing tools introduced in recent quantum algorithms for topological data analysis and combine them with spectral filtering techniques using the quantum singular value transformation framework. While this paper serves as a proof-of-concept, we obtain a super-polynomial improvement over the best known classical algorithms for TSP filtering processes, modulo some important caveats about encoding and retrieving the data from a quantum state. The proposed algorithm generalizes the applicability of tools from quantum topological data analysis to novel applications in analyzing high-dimensional complex systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Landscape Transitions and Coding Barren Plateaus in Hybrid Variational Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entanglement-induced barren plateau is an exponential vanishing of the parameter gradients with system size that limits the practical application of variational quantum algorithms(VQA). A landscape transition from barren plateau to no-barren plateau was recently observed in monitored quantum circuits, hypothesized to coincide with the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) that separates the area-law states from the volume-law states. We argue from an information theory perspective that these are different transitions. This hypothesis is supported by a numerical study that includes cost-gradient variances, visualizations of the optimization runs and cost-landscape, and a quantum-classical channel mutual information measure. The results are evidence for a universal measurement-induced landscape transition (MILT) at $p_c^{\text{MILT}} \approx 0.2 &lt; p_c^{\text{MIPT}}$ and that throughout $0&lt;p&lt;p_c^{\text{MILT}}$, there is a finite quantum-classical channel mutual information in the limit of a large number of qubits. Unlike the barren plateau without measurements, a non-zero rate of measurements induces a coding barren plateau where, typically, information about the parameters is available to a local cost function despite a vanishing gradient.</description>

      <title>Quantum enhanced balanced heterodyne readout for differential interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04940v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional heterodyne readout schemes are now under reconsideration due to the realization of techniques to evade its inherent 3 dB signal-to-noise penalty. The application of high-frequency, spectrally entangled, two-mode squeezed states can further improve the readout sensitivity of audio-band signals. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate quantum-enhanced heterodyne readout of two spatially distinct interferometers with direct optical signal combination, circumventing the 3 dB heterodyne signal-to-noise penalty. Applying a high-frequency, spectrally entangled, two-mode squeezed state, we show further signal-to-noise improvement of an injected audio band signal of 3.5 dB. This technique is applicable for quantum-limited high-precision experiments, with application to searches for quantum gravity, gravitational wave detection and wavelength-multiplexed quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Coupler-Assisted Leakage Reduction for Scalable Quantum Error Correction with Superconducting Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits are a promising platform for building fault-tolerant quantum computers, with recent achievement showing the suppression of logical error with increasing code size. However, leakage into non-computational states, a common issue in practical quantum systems including superconducting circuits, introduces correlated errors that undermine QEC scalability. Here, we propose and demonstrate a leakage reduction scheme utilizing tunable couplers, a widely adopted ingredient in large-scale superconducting quantum processors. Leveraging the strong frequency tunability of the couplers and stray interaction between the couplers and readout resonators, we eliminate state leakage on the couplers, thus suppressing space-correlated errors caused by population propagation among the couplers. Assisted by the couplers, we further reduce leakage to higher qubit levels with high efficiency (98.1%) and low error rate on the computational subspace (0.58%), suppressing time-correlated errors during QEC cycles. The performance of our scheme demonstrates its potential as an indispensable building block for scalable QEC with superconducting qubits.</description>

Abstract: We propose a direct (non-recursive) algorithm for applying a rotation $R_{\theta^\ast}$, $\epsilon$-close to a desired rotation $R_\theta$, to a single qubit using the Clifford+Toffoli gate set. Our algorithm does not rely on repeatedly applying a fixed rotation, but immediately applies $R_{\theta^\ast}$. It succeeds with probability strictly greater than $1/2$, has an expected number of repetitions strictly less than 2, expected Toffoli count logarithmic in $\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}$, and expected gate depth also logarithmic in $\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}$.</description>

      <title>Efficient quantum Gibbs samplers with Kubo--Martin--Schwinger detailed balance condition</title>

Abstract: Lindblad dynamics and other open-system dynamics provide a promising path towards efficient Gibbs sampling on quantum computers. In these proposals, the Lindbladian is obtained via an algorithmic construction akin to designing an artificial thermostat in classical Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics methods, rather than treated as an approximation to weakly coupled system-bath unitary dynamics. Recently, Chen, Kastoryano, and Gily\'en (arXiv:2311.09207) introduced the first efficiently implementable Lindbladian satisfying the Kubo--Martin--Schwinger (KMS) detailed balance condition, which ensures that the Gibbs state is a fixed point of the dynamics and is applicable to non-commuting Hamiltonians. This Gibbs sampler uses a continuously parameterized set of jump operators, and the energy resolution required for implementing each jump operator depends only logarithmically on the precision and the mixing time. In this work, we build upon the structural characterization of KMS detailed balanced Lindbladians by Fagnola and Umanit\`a, and develop a family of efficient quantum Gibbs samplers using a finite set of jump operators (the number can be as few as one), \re{akin to the classical Markov chain-based sampling algorithm. Compared to the existing works, our quantum Gibbs samplers have a comparable quantum simulation cost but with greater design flexibility and a much simpler implementation and error analysis.} Moreover, it encompasses the construction of Chen, Kastoryano, and Gily\'en as a special instance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09935v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of estimating experimentally the von Neumann entanglement entropy $S_{A}^{vN}$ of a symmetric bi-partite quantum system $AB$ by using the basic measurement counts for a it $single$ copy of a prepared state. Using exact diagonalization and analog simulations performed with the publicly available QuEra facilities for chains and ladders of Rydberg atoms, we calculate the Shannon entropy $S_{AB}^X$ associated with the experimental measurements of adiabatically prepared ground states and the reduced entropy $S_A^X$ obtained by tracing the experimental probabilities over the $B$ half of the system. We show several examples for which, in good approximation, $S_{A}^{vN}\propto (2S_A^X-S_{AB}^X)$ with a constant of proportionality slightly larger than one. Our data and specific examples of states suggest that one should have the inequality $S_{A}^{vN}\geq(2S_A^X-S_{AB}^X)$ holding in more general circumstances. This is actually a consequence of Holevo's bound. $2S_A^X-S_{AB}^X$ can be calculated easily for many qubit platforms and appears to be generically robust under measurement errors. Similar results are found for the second order R\'enyi entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Distribution of lowest eigenvalue in $k$-body bosonic random matrix ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically study the distribution of the lowest eigenvalue of finite many-boson systems with $k$-body interactions modeled by Bosonic Embedded Gaussian Orthogonal [BEGOE($k$)] and Unitary [BEGUE($k$)] random matrix Ensembles. Following the recently published result that the $q$-normal describes the smooth form of the eigenvalue density of the $k$-body embedded ensembles, the first four moments of the distribution of lowest eigenvalues have been analyzed as a function of the $q$ parameter, with $q \sim 1$ for $k = 1$ and $q = 0$ for $k = m$; $m$ being the number of bosons. Analytics are difficult as we are dealing with highly correlated variables, however we provide ansatzs for centroids and variances of these distributions. These match very well with the numerical results obtained. Our results show the distribution exhibits a smooth transition from Gaussian like for $q$ close to 1 to a modified Gumbel like for intermediate values of $q$ to the well-known Tracy-Widom distribution for $q=0$. It should be emphasized that this is a new result which numerically demonstrates that the distribution of the lowest eigenvalue of finite many-boson systems with $k$-body interactions exhibits a smooth transition from Gaussian like (for $q$ close to 1) to a modified Gumbel like (for intermediate values of $q$) to the well-known Tracy-Widom distribution (for $q=0$). In addition, we have also studied the distribution of normalized spacing between the lowest and next lowest eigenvalues and it is seen that this distribution exhibits a transition from Wigner's surmise (for $k=1$) to Poisson (for intermediate $k$ values with $k \le m/2$) to Wigner's surmise (starting from $k = m/2$ to $k = m$) with decreasing $q$ value. Thus, the spacings at the spectrum edge behave differently from the spacings inside the spectrum bulk.</description>

Abstract: Harnessing high-dimensional entangled states of light presents a frontier for advancing quantum information technologies, from fundamental tests of quantum mechanics to enhanced computation and communication protocols. In this context, the spatial degree of freedom stands out as particularly suited for on-chip integration. But while traditional demonstrations produce and manipulate path-entangled states sequentially with discrete optical elements, continuously-coupled nonlinear waveguide systems offer a promising alternative where photons can be generated and interfere along the entire propagation length, unveiling novel capabilities within a reduced footprint. Here we exploit this concept to implement a compact and reconfigurable source of spatially entangled photon pairs based on parametric down-conversion in AlGaAs nonlinear waveguides arrays. We use a double-pump configuration to engineer the output quantum state and implement various types of spatial correlations, exploiting a quantum interference effect between the biphoton state generated in each pumped waveguide. This demonstration, at room temperature and telecom wavelength, illustrates the potential of continuously-coupled systems as a promising alternative to discrete multi-component quantum circuits for leveraging the high-dimensional spatial degree of freedom of photons.</description>

      <title>Quantum optimization using a 127-qubit gate-model IBM quantum computer can outperform quantum annealers for nontrivial binary optimization problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01743v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive quantum solver for binary combinatorial optimization problems on gate-model quantum computers that outperforms any published alternative and consistently delivers correct solutions for problems with up to 127 qubits. We provide an overview of the internal workflow, describing the integration of a customized ansatz and variational parameter update strategy, efficient error suppression in hardware execution, and QPU-overhead-free post-processing to correct for bit-flip errors. We benchmark this solver on IBM quantum computers for several classically nontrivial unconstrained binary optimization problems -- the entire optimization is conducted on hardware with no use of classical simulation or prior knowledge of the solution. First, we demonstrate the ability to correctly solve Max-Cut instances for random regular graphs with a variety of densities using up to 120 qubits, where the graph topologies are not matched to device connectivity. Next, we apply the solver to higher-order binary optimization and successfully search for the ground state energy of a 127-qubit spin-glass model with linear, quadratic, and cubic interaction terms. Use of this new quantum solver increases the likelihood of finding the minimum energy by up to $\sim1,500\times$ relative to published results using a DWave annealer, and it can find the correct solution when the annealer fails. Furthermore, for both problem types, the Q-CTRL solver outperforms a heuristic local solver used to indicate the relative difficulty of the problems pursued. Overall, these results represent the largest quantum optimizations successfully solved on hardware to date, and demonstrate the first time a gate-model quantum computer has been able to outperform an annealer for a class of binary optimization problems.</description>

      <title>High-Entanglement Capabilities for Variational Quantum Algorithms: The Poisson Equation Case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10156v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discretized Poisson equation matrix (DPEM) in 1D has been shown to require an exponentially large number of terms when decomposed in the Pauli basis when solving numerical linear algebra problems on a quantum computer. Additionally, traditional ansatz for Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) that are used to heuristically solve linear systems (such as the DPEM) have many parameters, making them harder to train. This research attempts to resolve these problems by utilizing the IonQ Aria quantum computer capabilities that boast all-to-all connectivity of qubits. We propose a decomposition of the DPEM that is based on 2- or 3-qubit entanglement gates and is shown to have $O(1)$ terms with respect to system size, with one term having an $O(n^2)$ circuit depth and the rest having only an $O(1)$ circuit depth (where $n$ is the number of qubits defining the system size). Additionally, we introduce the Globally-Entangling Ansatz which reduces the parameter space of the quantum ansatz while maintaining enough expressibility to find the solution. To test these new improvements, we ran numerical simulations to examine how well the VQAs performed with varying system sizes, showing that the new setup offers an improved scaling of the number of iterations required for convergence compared to Hardware-Efficient Ansatz.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enantiomer-specific state transfer (ESST), which involves transferring enantiomers with different handedness of a chiral molecule into different-energy internal states, is a challenging yet significant task. Previous ESST methods are based on dynamic processes and thus require the preparation of initial states and precise control of microwave operation times. We propose a novel ESST approach, called enantiomer-specific pumping (ESP), which is based on a {\it dissipative} process, and thereby eliminates the need for these two technical requirements. This approach utilizes a special microwave-induced dark state that appears exclusively for the enantiomer with a specific handedness. Specifically, in ESP, the enantiomer lacking the dark state can be pumped out of the subspace of relevant internal states, while the enantiomer with the dark state maintains a finite probability within this subspace, offering high efficiency in ESST. Notably, ESP facilitates enantiodetection without the need for enantiopure samples as reference.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the collective quantum dynamics of nonequilibrium many-body systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum science. In particular, dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations are important for the formation of exotic quantum phases of matter, fundamental high-energy processes, quantum metrology, and quantum algorithms. Here, we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)D Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains. By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these phenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter, corresponding to an amplitude (Higgs) mode. These observations offer a unique viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems and nonequilibrium quantum processes.</description>

Abstract: The standard quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator has an exact, dual relationship with a completely classical system: a classical particle running along a circle. Duality here means that there is a one-to-one relation between all observables in one model, and the observables of the other model. Thus the duality we find, appears to be in conflict with the usual assertion that classical theories can never reproduce quantum effects as observed in many quantum models. We suggest that there must be more of such relationships, but we study only this one as a prototype. It reveals how classical "hidden variables" may work. The classical states can form the basis of Hilbert space that can be adopted in describing the quantum model. Wave functions in the quantum system generate probability distributions in the classical one. One finds that, where the classical system always obeys the rule "probability in = probability out", the same probabilities are quantum probabilities in the quantum system. It is shown how the quantum x and p operators in a quantum oscillator can be given a classical meaning. It is explained how an apparent clash with quantum logic can be explained away.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: HodgeRank generalizes ranking algorithms, e.g. Google PageRank, to rank alternatives based on real-world (often incomplete) data using graphs and discrete exterior calculus. It analyzes multipartite interactions on high-dimensional networks with a complexity that scales exponentially with dimension. We develop a quantum algorithm that approximates the HodgeRank solution with complexity independent of dimension. Our algorithm extracts relevant information from the state such as the ranking consistency, which achieves a superpolynomial speedup over similar classical methods.</description>

      <title>Classifying Multipartite Continuous Variable Entanglement Structures through Data-augmented Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as a promising paradigm for quantum information processing, yet they confront the challenge of generating training datasets with sufficient size and rich diversity, which is particularly acute when dealing with multipartite quantum systems. For instance, in the task of classifying different structures of multipartite entanglement in continuous variable systems, it is necessary to simulate a large number of infinite-dimension state data that can cover as many types of non-Gaussian states as possible. Here, we develop a data-augmented neural network to complete this task with homodyne measurement data. A quantum data augmentation method based on classical data processing techniques and quantum physical principles is proposed to efficiently enhance the network performance. By testing on randomly generated tripartite and quadripartite states, we demonstrate that the network can indicate the entanglement structure among the various partitions and the accuracies are significantly improved with data augmentation. Our approach allows us to further extend the use of data-driven machine learning techniques to more complex tasks of learning quantum systems encoded in a large Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fast Implementation of Functional Bootstrapping and Private Information Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical privacy-preserving computation techniques safeguard sensitive data in cloud computing, but often suffer from low computational efficiency. In this paper, we show that employing a single quantum server can significantly enhance both the efficiency and security of privacy-preserving computation.
  We propose an efficient quantum algorithm for functional bootstrapping of large-precision plaintexts, reducing the time complexity from exponential to polynomial in plaintext-size compared to classical algorithms. To support general functional bootstrapping, we design a fast quantum private information retrieval (PIR) protocol with logarithmic query time. The security relies on the learning with errors (LWE) problem with polynomial modulus, providing stronger security than classical ``exponentially fast'' PIR protocol based on ring-LWE with super-polynomial modulus.
  Technically, we extend a key classical homomorphic operation, known as blind rotation, to the quantum setting through encrypted conditional rotation. Underlying our extension are insights for the quantum extension of polynomial-based cryptographic tools that may gain dramatic speedups.</description>

      <title>Limited Parallelization in Gate Operations Leads to Higher Space Overhead and Lower Noise Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoherence of qubits during gate operations in the error correction phase of fault-tolerant computation is significant since, in practice, gate operations are neither instantaneous nor are they sufficiently parallelized. Thus, in practice, the overhead of a fault-tolerant scheme should depend on the level of parallelization, the speed of gate operations, and the rate of decoherence. In this paper, we obtain a lower bound on the required space overhead for any fault-tolerant technique when the decoherence process is Markov and the errors are either erasure or depolarization. An implication of this bound is that the noise or decoherence threshold, i.e., the noise beyond which no reliable memory (circuit) can be realized, decreases with a decrease in the level of parallelization in gate operations. Also, the noise threshold approaches zero as the level of parallelization approaches zero, implying that any fault-tolerant implementations must strive for sufficient parallelization in gate operations.</description>

      <title>The aspect of bipartite coherence in quantum discord to semi-device-independent nonlocality and its implication for quantum information processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04430v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum discord can demonstrate quantum nonlocality in the context of a semi-device-independent Bell or steering scenario, i.e., by assuming only the Hilbert-space dimension. This work addresses which aspect of bipartite coherence is essential to such semi-device-independent quantum information tasks going beyond standard Bell nonlocality or quantum steering. It has been shown that the global coherence of a single system can be transformed into bipartite entanglement. However, global coherence can also be present in quantum discord. At the same time, discord can display bipartite coherence locally, i.e., only in a subsystem or both subsystems. Thus, global coherence of bipartite separable states is defined here as a form of bipartite coherence that is not reducible to local coherence in any of the subsystems or both subsystems. To answer the above-mentioned question, we demonstrate that global coherence is necessary to demonstrate semi-device-independent nonlocality of quantum discord in Bell or steering scenarios. From this result, it follows that any local operations of the form $\Phi_A \otimes \Phi_B$ that may create coherence locally are free operations in the resource theory of semi-device-independent nonlocality of discord. As a byproduct, we identify the precise quantum resource for the quantum communication task of remote state preparation using two-qubit separable states.</description>

Abstract: The model of multi-level open quantum system interacting with a non-vacuum reservoir in the rotating wave approximation is considered. We provide an exact integral representation for the reduced density matrix of the system. For identical uncorrelated reservoirs in diagonal states, we have obtained the first perturbative correction for such dynamics in the Bogolubov-van Hove limit. We have shown that after initial state renormalization, it can be completely described in terms of finite-dimensional semigroup. The method we provide can also be applied to the further orders of perturbation theory with Bogolubov-van Hove scaling.</description>

      <title>Hardness-Dependent Adiabatic Schedules for Analog Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a numerical approach to design highly efficient adiabatic schedules for analog quantum computing, focusing on the maximum independent set problem and neutral atom platforms. Based on a representative dataset of small graphs, we present numerical evidences that the optimum schedules depend principally on the hardness of the problem rather than on its size. These schedules perform better than the benchmark protocols and admit a straightforward implementation in the hardware. This allows us to extrapolate the results to larger graphs and to successfully solve moderately hard problems using QuEra's 256-qubit Aquila computer. We believe that extending our approach to hybrid algorithms could be the key to solve the hardest instances with the current technology, making yet another step toward real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Generalization Error in Quantum Machine Learning in the Presence of Sampling Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tackling output sampling noise due to finite shots of quantum measurement is an unavoidable challenge when extracting information in machine learning with physical systems. A technique called Eigentask Learning was developed recently as a framework for learning with infinite input training data in the presence of output sampling noise. In the work of Eigentask Learning, numerical evidence was presented that extracting low-noise contributions of features can practically improve performance for machine learning tasks, displaying robustness to overfitting and increasing generalization accuracy. However, it remains unsolved to quantitatively characterize generalization errors in situations where the training dataset is finite, while output sampling noise still exists. In this study, we use methodologies from statistical mechanics to calculate the training and generalization errors of a generic quantum machine learning system when the input training dataset and output measurement sampling shots are both finite. Our analytical findings, supported by numerical validation, offer solid justification that Eigentask Learning provides optimal learning in the sense of minimizing generalization errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Toffoli is an important universal quantum gate, and will alongside the Clifford gates be available in future Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing hardware. Many quantum algorithms rely on performing arbitrarily small single-qubit rotations for their function, and these rotations may also be used to construct any unitary from a limited (but universal) gate set; it is then of significant interest how to carry out such rotations. In this work, we evaluate the performance of a recently proposed single-qubit rotation algorithm using the Clifford+Toffoli gate set by implementation on both a real and simulated quantum computer. We test the algorithm under various simulated noise levels utilizing a per-qubit depolarizing error noise model, finding that the errors are seemingly explained by a binomial distribution wherein these errors change controlling ancilla measurements from $0$ into $1$. Similar observations appear to hold when conducting live runs; noise levels here make further meaningful conclusions difficult, although for the smallest possible number of ancillary controls we do note that error mitigation is helpful. Our results suggest that the algorithm will perform well under up to $1\%$ noise, under the noise model we chose. Our results also suggest the algorithm could be used as a benchmark for Quantum Processing Units, given its linear increase in total number of qubits and Toffoli gates required.</description>

      <title>Design nearly optimal quantum algorithm for linear differential equations via Lindbladians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving linear ordinary differential equations (ODE) is one of the most promising applications for quantum computers to demonstrate exponential advantages. The challenge of designing a quantum ODE algorithm is how to embed non-unitary dynamics into intrinsically unitary quantum circuits. In this work, we propose a new quantum algorithm for ODEs by harnessing open quantum systems. Specifically, we utilize the natural non-unitary dynamics of Lindbladians with the aid of a new technique called the non-diagonal density matrix encoding to encode general linear ODEs into non-diagonal blocks of density matrices. This framework enables us to design a quantum algorithm that has both theoretical simplicity and good performance. Combined with the state-of-the-art quantum Lindbladian simulation algorithms, our algorithm, under a plausible input model, can outperform all existing quantum ODE algorithms and achieve near-optimal dependence on all parameters. We also give applications of our algorithm including the Gibbs state preparations and the partition function estimations.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Noise using variants of Unitarity Randomized Benchmarking</title>

Abstract: Benchmarking of noise that is induced during the implementation of quantum gates is the main concern for practical quantum computers. Several protocols have been proposed that empirically calculate various metrics that quantify the error rates of the quantum gates chosen from a preferred gate set. Unitarity randomized benchmarking (URB) protocol is a method to estimate the coherence of noise induced by the quantum gates which is measured by the metric \textit{unitarity}. In this paper, we for the first time, implement the URB protocol in a quantum simulator with all the parameters and noise model are used from a real quantum device. The direct implementation of the URB protocol in a quantum device is not possible using current technologies, as it requires the preparation of mixed states. To overcome this challenge, we propose a modification of the URB protocol, namely the m-URB protocol, that enables us to practically implement it on any quantum device. We validate our m-URB protocol using two single-qubit noise channels -- (a) depolarising channel and (b) bit-flip channel. We further alter the m-URB protocol, namely, native gate URB or Ng-URB protocol, to study the noise in the native gates into which the quantum circuits are compiled in a quantum computer. Using our Ng-URB protocol, we can also detect the presence of cross-talk errors which are correlated errors caused due to non-local and entangling gates such as CNOT gate. For illustration, we simulate the noise of the native gates taking the noise parameter from two real IBM-Q processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.04805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the intriguing possibilities of steering ultrafast non-adiabatic processes through the geometric properties of bands in quantum materials by laser pulses, we extend a wave-packet transport theory, previously well-established in the adiabatic regime that intuitively captured geometric properties of bands, to the transient and non-adiabatic regime. This extension facilitates us to investigate macroscopic ways of manifesting microscopic band-geometric effects that highlight the special capability of non-adiabatic drivings not available to adiabatic drivings. These include imprinting band-geometric properties to the current rate after switching off the laser pulses and the induction of intrinsic macroscopic spin polarisation with an orientation not accessible by adiabatic processes. In particular, the microscopic geometrically-rooted intrinsic spin coherence is shown to underlie the spin-mediated parts of the macroscopic photocurrents. Through explicit calculations of an example with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, the spin-mediated part is shown to be discernible from the non-spin-mediated part in terms of the anisotropy of the photocurrents. Working principles behind the above theoretical results allegedly applicable beyond the Rashba example are distilled to inspect experimental data collected for SnSe, exhibiting considerable anisotropic effects. Consistency between theory and experiment is observed, paving the way of further exploration into the above intended direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08133v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A defining signature of classical systems is "in principle measurability" without disturbance: a feature manifestly violated by quantum systems. We describe a multi-interferometer experimental setup that can, in principle, reveal the nonclassicality of a spatial superposition-sourced gravitational field if an irreducible disturbance is caused by a measurement of gravity. While one interferometer sources the field, the others are used to measure the gravitational field created by the superposition. This requires neither any specific form of nonclassical gravity, nor the generation of entanglement between any relevant degrees of freedom at any stage, thus distinguishing it from the experiments proposed so far. This test, when added to the recent entanglement-witness based proposals, enlarges the domain of quantum postulates being tested for gravity. Moreover, the proposed test yields a signature of quantum measurement induced disturbance for any finite rate of decoherence, and is device independent.</description>

      <title>Quantum Locking of Intrinsic Spin Squeezed State in Earth-field-range Magnetometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Earth-field range, the nonlinear Zeeman (NLZ) effect has been a bottleneck limiting the sensitivity and accuracy of atomic magnetometry from physical mechanism. To break this bottleneck, various techniques are introduced to suppress the NLZ effect. Here we revisit the spin dynamics in the Earth-field-range magnetometry and identify the existence of the intrinsic spin squeezed state (SSS) generated from the geomagnetically induced NLZ effect with the oscillating squeezing degree and squeezing axis. Such oscillating features of the SSS prevent its direct observation and as well, accessibility to magnetic sensing. To exploit quantum advantage of the intrinsic SSS in the Earth-field-range magnetometry, it's essential to lock the oscillating SSS to a persistent one. Hence, we develop a quantum locking technique to achieve a persistent SSS, benefiting from which the sensitivity of the Earth-field-range magnetometer is quantum-enhanced. This work presents an innovative way turning the drawback of NLZ effect into the quantum advantage and opens a new access to quantum-enhanced magnetometry in the Earth-field range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze quantum-geometric bounds on optical weights in topological phases with pairs of bands hosting non-trivial Euler class, a multi-gap invariant characterizing non-Abelian band topology. We show how the bounds constrain the combined optical weights of the Euler bands at different dopings and further restrict the size of the adjacent band gaps. In this process, we also consider the associated interband contributions to DC conductivities in the flat-band limit. We physically validate these results by recasting the bound in terms of transition rates associated with the optical absorption of light, and demonstrate how the Euler connections and curvatures can be determined through the use of momentum and frequency-resolved optical measurements, allowing for a direct measurement of this multi-band invariant. Additionally, we prove that the bound holds beyond the degenerate limit of Euler bands, resulting in nodal topology captured by the patch Euler class. In this context, we deduce optical manifestations of Euler topology within $\vec{k} \cdot \vec{p}$ models, which include quantized optical conductivity, and third-order jerk photoconductivities. We showcase our findings with numerical validation in lattice-regularized models that benchmark effective theories for real materials and are realizable in metamaterials and optical lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform an extensive bootstrap study of Hermitian and non-Hermitian theories based on the novel analytic continuation of $\langle\phi^n\rangle$ or $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ in $n$. We first use the quantum harmonic oscillator to illustrate various aspects of the $\phi^n$ trajectory bootstrap method, such as the large $n$ expansion, matching conditions, exact quantization condition, and high energy asymptotic behavior. Then we derive highly accurate solutions for the anharmonic oscillators with the parity invariant potential $V(\phi)=\phi^2+\phi^{m}$ and the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant potential $V(\phi)=-(i\phi)^{m}$ for a large range of integral $m$, showing the high efficiency and general applicability of this new bootstrap approach. For the Hermitian quartic and non-Hermitian cubic oscillators, we further verify that the non-integer $n$ results for $\langle\phi^n\rangle$ or $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ are consistent with those from the wave function approach. In the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant case, the existence of $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ with non-integer $n$ allows us to bootstrap the non-Hermitian theories with non-integer powers, such as fractional and irrational $m$.</description>

      <title>Quantized Integrated Shift Effect in Multigap Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that certain three-dimensional multigap topological insulators can host quantized integrated shift photoconductivities due to bulk invariants that are defined under reality conditions imposed by additional symmetries. We recast the quantization in terms of the integrated torsion tensor and the non-Abelian Berry connection constituting Chern-Simons forms. Physically, we recognize that the topological quantization emerges purely from virtual transitions contributing to the optical response. Our findings provide another quantized electromagnetic dc response due to the nontrivial band topology, beyond the quantum anomalous Hall effect of Chern insulators and quantized circular photogalvanic effect found in Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Quasi-Integrable Equations from traveling-wave data using the Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are used to study vortex solutions in the 2+1 dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations. These solutions include the regularized long-wave (RLW) equation and the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) equation, which are toy models of the geostrophic shallow water model in the planetary atmosphere. PINNs successfully solve these equations in the forward process and the solutions are obtained using the mesh-free approach and automatic differentiation while accounting for conservation laws. In the inverse process, the proper equations can be successfully derived from a given training data. Since these equations have a lot in common, there are situations when substantial misidentification arises during the inverse analysis. We consider PINNs with conservation laws (referred to as cPINNs), deformations of the initial profiles, and a friction approach that provides excellent discrimination of the equations to improve the identification's resolution.</description>

      <title>Tensor Train Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Tensor Train Multiplication (TTM) algorithm for the elementwise multiplication of two tensor trains with bond dimension $\chi$. The computational complexity and memory requirements of the TTM algorithm scale as $\chi^3$ and $\chi^2$, respectively. This represents a significant improvement compared with the conventional approach, where the computational complexity scales as $\chi^4$ and memory requirements scale as $\chi^3$.We benchmark the TTM algorithm using flows obtained from artificial turbulence generation and numerically demonstrate its improved runtime and memory scaling compared with the conventional approach. The TTM algorithm paves the way towards GPU accelerated tensor network simulations of computational fluid dynamics problems with large bond dimensions due to its dramatic improvement in memory scaling.</description>

      <title>An approximation of the $S$ matrix for solving the Marchenko equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I present a new approximation of the $S$-matrix dependence on momentum $q$, formulated as a sum of a rational function and a truncated Sinc series. This approach enables pointwise determination of the $S$ matrix with specified resolution, capturing essential features such as resonance behavior with high accuracy. The resulting approximation provides a separable kernel for the Marchenko equation (fixed-$l$ inversion), reducing it to a system of linear equations for the expansion coefficients of the output kernel. Numerical results demonstrate good convergence of this method, applicable to both unitary and non-unitary $S$ matrices. Convergence is further validated through comparisons with an exactly solvable square-well potential model. The method is applied to analyze $S_{31}$ $\pi N$ scattering data.</description>
