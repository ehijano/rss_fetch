      <title>The Behavior of the Electromagnetic Field Near the Edge of a Resistive Half-Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work is aimed at defining the behavior of the electromagnetic field near the edge of a resistive half-plane, taken separately, as well as in conjunction with a perfectly conducting half-plane. The efficiency of accounting for the established field behavior while finding the solution of boundary problems of electrodynamics is illustrated by computational results.</description>

      <title>Metamaterial two-sphere Newton's cradle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Locally resonant metamaterials are among the most studied types of elastic/acoustic metamaterials, with significant research focused on wave propagation in a continuum of "meta-atoms" Here we investigate the collision dynamics of two identical pendulum-suspended mass-in-mass resonators, essentially a two-sphere Newton's cradle, emphasizing the readily realizable scenario where the internal resonator frequency is much greater than the pendulum frequency. We first show that the dynamics of a collision can be described using effective parameters, similar to how previous metamaterials research has characterized wave propagation through effective material properties. Non-conventional collision dynamics -- observed in two colliding mass-in-mass systems where one is initially at rest -- include behaviors such as the moving sphere rebounding as if from a fixed wall while the other remains essentially stationary, the spheres coupling and moving forward in near-unison, and the spheres recoiling in opposite directions. These responses can be achieved by tuning the effective parameters. We demonstrate that these parameters can take on values that differ significantly from those in a conventional Newton's cradle. Additionally, we investigate multiple collisions of the two spheres, revealing complex dynamics. This work paves the way for the development and study of new "collision-based metamaterial" structures.</description>
