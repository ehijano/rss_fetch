      <title>Attention-Infused Autoencoder for Massive MIMO CSI Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the number of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas increases drastically with the development towards 6G systems, channel state information (CSI) compression becomes crucial for mitigating feedback overhead. In recent years, learning models such as autoencoders (AE) have been studied for CSI compression, aiming to eliminate model assumptions and reduce compression loss. However, current learning methods are often designed and trained mainly for individual channel scenarios, with limited generalizability across different scenarios, of which the channel characteristics are prominently discrepant. Motivated by this, we propose a novel AE-based learning method named attention-infused autoencoder network (AiANet), which can parallelly and adaptively extract channel-wise and spatial features of CSI with an attention fusion mechanism. In addition, a locally-aware self-attention mechanism is developed to extract both global and local spatial patterns, to better capture the unique CSI features of different scenarios. Moreover, a mixed-training scheme is introduced to enable the proposed AiANet to gain generalizability across indoor and outdoor scenarios. Results show that when trained and tested in the same scenario, AiANet can substantially outperform the existing AE-based methods such as ACRNet, with an improvement of up to 3.42 dB in terms of normalized mean squared error (NMSE). With the mixed-training scheme, AiANet exhibits superior cross-scenario generalizability compared to the benchmark methods which are trained in one scenario and misused in another.</description>

      <title>Fast Computation of the Discrete Fourier Transform Rectangular Index Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In~\cite{sic-magazine-2025}, the authors show that the square index coefficients (SICs) of the \(N\)-point discrete Fourier transform (DFT) -- that is, the coefficients \(X_{k\sqrt{N}}\) for \(k = 0, 1, \ldots, \sqrt{N} - 1\) -- can be losslessly compressed from \(N\) to \(\sqrt{N}\) points, thereby accelerating the computation of these specific DFT coefficients accordingly. Following up on that, in this article we generalize SICs into what we refer to as rectangular index coefficients (RICs) of the DFT, formalized as $X_{kL}, k=0,1,\cdots,C-1$, in which the integers $C$ and $L$ are generic roots of $N$ such that $N=LC$. We present an algorithm to compress the $N$-point input signal $\mathbf{x}$ into a $C$-point signal $\mathbf{\hat{x}}$ at the expense of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ complex sums and no complex multiplication. We show that a DFT on $\mathbf{\hat{x}}$ is equivalent to a DFT on the RICs of $\mathbf{x}$. In cases where specific frequencies of \(\mathbf{x}\) are of interest -- as in harmonic analysis -- one can conveniently adjust the signal parameters (e.g., frequency resolution) to align the RICs with those frequencies, and use the proposed algorithm to compute them significantly faster. If $N$ is a power of two -- as required by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm -- then $C$ can be any power of two in the range $[2, N/2]$ and one can use our algorithm along with FFT to compute all RICs in $\mathcal{O}(C\log C)$ time complexity.</description>

      <title>Sub-Scalp Brain-Computer Interface Device Design and Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current brain-computer interfaces (BCI) face limitations in signal acquisition. While sub-scalp EEG offers a potential solution, existing devices prioritize chronic seizure monitoring and lack features suited for BCI applications. This work addresses this gap by outlining key specifications for sub-scalp BCI devices, focusing on channel count, sampling rate, power efficiency, and form factor. We present the Set-And-Forget EEG (SAFE) system, a custom-built amplifier and wireless transmitter meeting these criteria. This compact (12x12 mm), six-channel device offers 1024 Hz sampling and Bluetooth Low Energy data transmission. Validation using generated sinusoids and electrocorticography recordings of visual evoked potentials in sheep models demonstrated low noise recording. Future animal studies will assess sub-scalp EEG signal quality for BCI applications. This data lays the groundwork for human trials, ultimately paving the way for chronic, in-home BCIs that empower individuals with physical disabilities.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Multipath Angle Estimation Based on Power-Angle-Delay Profile for Directional Scanning Sounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directional scanning sounding (DSS) has become widely adopted for high-frequency channel measurements because it effectively compensates for severe path loss. However, the resolution of existing multipath component (MPC) angle estimation methods is constrained by the DSS angle sampling interval. Therefore, this communication proposes a high-resolution MPC angle estimation method based on power-angle-delay profile (PADP) for DSS. By exploiting the mapping relationship between the power difference of adjacent angles in the PADP and MPC offset angle, the resolution of MPC angle estimation is refined, significantly enhancing the accuracy of MPC angle and amplitude estimation without increasing measurement complexity. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the mean squared estimation errors of angle and amplitude by one order of magnitude compared to traditional omnidirectional synthesis methods. Furthermore, the estimation errors approach the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bounds (CRLBs) derived for wideband DSS, thereby validating its superior performance in MPC angle and amplitude estimation. Finally, experiments conducted in an indoor scenario at 37.5 GHz validate the excellent performance of the proposed method in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Universal Approximation with XL MIMO Systems: OTA Classification via Trainable Analog Combining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that an eXtremely Large (XL) Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) wireless system with appropriate analog combining components exhibits the properties of a universal function approximator, similar to a feedforward neural network. By treating the XL MIMO channel coefficients as the random nodes of a hidden layer, and the receiver's analog combiner as a trainable output layer, we cast the end-to-end system to the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) framework, leading to a novel formulation for Over-The-Air (OTA) edge inference without requiring traditional digital processing nor pre-processing at the transmitter. Through theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation, we showcase that XL-MIMO-ELM enables near-instantaneous training and efficient classification, suggesting the paradigm shift of beyond massive MIMO systems as neural networks alongside their profound communications role. Compared to deep learning approaches and conventional ELMs, the proposed framework achieves on par performance with orders of magnitude lower complexity, making it highly attractive for ultra low power wireless devices.</description>

      <title>Distributed Intelligent Sensing and Communications for 6G: Architecture and Use Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Distributed Intelligent Sensing and Communication (DISAC) framework redefines Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) for 6G by leveraging distributed architectures to enhance scalability, adaptability, and resource efficiency. This paper presents key architectural enablers, including advanced data representation, seamless target handover, support for heterogeneous devices, and semantic integration. Two use cases illustrate the transformative potential of DISAC: smart factory shop floors and Vulnerable Road User (VRU) protection at smart intersections. These scenarios demonstrate significant improvements in precision, safety, and operational efficiency compared to traditional ISAC systems. The preliminary DISAC architecture incorporates intelligent data processing, distributed coordination, and emerging technologies such as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) to meet 6G's stringent requirements. By addressing critical challenges in sensing accuracy, latency, and real-time decision-making, DISAC positions itself as a cornerstone for next-generation wireless networks, advancing innovation in dynamic and complex environments.</description>

      <title>Supporting Urban Low-Altitude Economy: Channel Gain Map Inference Based on 3D Conditional GAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of advanced air mobility (AAM) in recent years has given rise to the concept of low-altitude economy (LAE). However, the diverse flight activities associated with the emerging LAE applications in urban scenarios confront complex physical environments, which urgently necessitates ubiquitous and reliable communication to guarantee the operation safety of the low-altitude aircraft. As one of promising technologies for the sixth generation (6G) mobile networks, channel knowledge map (CKM) enables the environment-aware communication by constructing a site-specific dataset, thereby providing a priori on-site information for the aircraft to obtain the channel state information (CSI) at arbitrary locations with much reduced online overhead. Diverse base station (BS) deployments in the three-dimensional (3D) urban low-altitude environment require efficient 3D CKM construction to capture spatial channel characteristics with less overhead. Towards this end, this paper proposes a 3D channel gain map (CGM) inference method based on a 3D conditional generative adversarial network (3D-CGAN). Specifically, we first analyze the potential deployment types of BSs in urban low-altitude scenario, and investigate the CGM representation with the corresponding 3D channel gain model. The framework of the proposed 3D-CGAN is then discussed, which is trained by a dataset consisting of existing CGMs. Consequently, the trained 3D-CGAN is capable of inferring the corresponding CGM only based on the BS coordinate without additional measurement. The simulation results demonstrate that the CGMs inferred by the proposed 3D-CGAN outperform those of the benchmark schemes, which can accurately reflect the radio propagation condition in 3D environment.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Beamfocusing in Near-Field IoT Communication Systems: A Transformer-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The massive number of antennas in extremely large aperture array (ELAA) systems shifts the propagation regime of signals in internet of things (IoT) communication systems towards near-field spherical wave propagation. We propose a reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)-assisted beamfocusing mechanism, where the design of the two-dimensional beam codebook that contains both the angular and distance domains is challenging. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Transformer-based two-stage beam training algorithm, which includes the coarse and fine search phases. The proposed mechanism provides a fine-grained codebook with enhanced spatial resolution, enabling precise beamfocusing. Specifically, in the first stage, the beam training is performed to estimate the approximate location of the device by using a simple codebook, determining whether it is within the beamfocusing range (BFR) or the none-beamfocusing range (NBFR). In the second stage, by using a more precise codebook, a fine-grained beam search strategy is conducted. Experimental results unveil that the precision of the RIS-assisted beamfocusing is greatly improved. The proposed method achieves beam selection accuracy up to 97% at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 20 dB, and improves 10% to 50% over the baseline method at different SNRs.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Polysomnography and Cardiotocography Reveal Temporal Correlation Between Maternal Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Fetal Hypoxia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) during pregnancy is common and can negatively affect fetal outcomes. However, studies on the immediate effects of maternal hypoxia on fetal heart rate (FHR) changes are lacking. Methods: We used time-synchronized polysomnography (PSG) and cardiotocography (CTG) data from two cohorts to analyze the correlation between maternal hypoxia and FHR changes (accelerations or decelerations). Maternal hypoxic event characteristics were analyzed using generalized linear modeling (GLM) to assess their associations with different FHR changes. Results: A total of 118 pregnant women participated. FHR changes were significantly associated with maternal hypoxia, primarily characterized by accelerations. A longer hypoxic duration correlated with more significant FHR accelerations (P &lt; 0.05), while prolonged hypoxia and greater SpO2 drop were linked to FHR decelerations (P &lt; 0.05). Both cohorts showed a transient increase in FHR during maternal hypoxia, which returned to baseline after the event resolved. Conclusion: Maternal hypoxia significantly affects FHR, suggesting that maternal OSAS may contribute to fetal hypoxia. These findings highlight the importance of maternal-fetal interactions and provide insights for future interventions.</description>

      <title>ORIS allocation to minimize the outage probability in a multi-user VLC scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visible Light Communication (VLC) is a promising solution to address the growing demand for wireless data, leveraging the widespread use of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as transmitters. However, its deployment is challenged by link blockages that cause connectivity outages. Optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) have recently emerged as a solution to mitigate these disruptions. This work considers a multi-user VLC system and investigates the optimal association of ORISs to LEDs and users to minimize the outage probability while limiting the number of ORISs used. Numerical results from our proposed optimization algorithm demonstrate that using ORISs can reduce the outage probability by up to 85% compared to a no-ORIS scenario.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Audio Deepfake Detection Robustness in Real-world Communication Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing Audio Deepfake Detection (ADD) systems often struggle to generalise effectively due to the significantly degraded audio quality caused by audio codec compression and channel transmission effects in real-world communication scenarios. To address this challenge, we developed a rigorous benchmark to evaluate ADD system performance under such scenarios. We introduced ADD-C, a new test dataset to evaluate the robustness of ADD systems under diverse communication conditions, including different combinations of audio codecs for compression and Packet Loss Rates (PLR). Benchmarking on three baseline ADD models with the ADD-C dataset demonstrated a significant decline in robustness under such conditions. A novel data augmentation strategy was proposed to improve the robustness of ADD systems. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach increases the performance of ADD systems significantly with the proposed ADD-C dataset. Our benchmark can assist future efforts towards building practical and robustly generalisable ADD systems.</description>

      <title>TimeCapsule: Solving the Jigsaw Puzzle of Long-Term Time Series Forecasting with Compressed Predictive Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent deep learning models for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) often emphasize complex, handcrafted designs, while simpler architectures like linear models or MLPs have often outperformed these intricate solutions. In this paper, we revisit and organize the core ideas behind several key techniques, such as redundancy reduction and multi-scale modeling, which are frequently employed in advanced LTSF models. Our goal is to streamline these ideas for more efficient deep learning utilization. To this end, we introduce TimeCapsule, a model built around the principle of high-dimensional information compression that unifies these techniques in a generalized yet simplified framework. Specifically, we model time series as a 3D tensor, incorporating temporal, variate, and level dimensions, and leverage mode production to capture multi-mode dependencies while achieving dimensionality compression. We propose an internal forecast within the compressed representation domain, supported by the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), to monitor the learning of predictive representations. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate the versatility of our method, showing that TimeCapsule can achieve state-of-the-art performance.</description>

Abstract: Movable antennas represent an emerging field in telecommunication research and a potential approach to achieving higher data rates in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications when the total number of antennas is limited. Most solutions and analyses to date have been limited to \emph{narrowband} setups. This work complements the prior studies by quantifying the benefit of using movable antennas in \emph{wideband} MIMO communication systems. First, we derive a novel uplink wideband system model that also accounts for distortion from transceiver hardware impairments. We then formulate and solve an optimization task to maximize the average sum rate by adjusting the antenna positions using particle swarm optimization. Finally, the performance with movable antennas is compared with fixed uniform arrays and the derived theoretical upper bound. The numerical study concludes that the data rate improvement from movable antennas over other arrays heavily depends on the level of hardware impairments, the richness of the multi-path environments, and the number of subcarriers. The present study provides vital insights into the most suitable use cases for movable antennas in future wideband systems.</description>

      <title>Degrees of Freedom of Holographic MIMO -- Fundamental Theory and Analytical Methods</title>

Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is envisioned as one of the most promising technology enablers for future sixth-generation (6G) networks. The use of electrically large holographic surface (HoloS) antennas has the potential to significantly boost the spatial multiplexing gain by increasing the number of degrees of freedom (DoF), even in line-of-sight (LoS) channels. In this context, the research community has shown a growing interest in characterizing the fundamental limits of this technology. In this paper, we compare the two analytical methods commonly utilized in the literature for this purpose: the cut-set integral and the self-adjoint operator. We provide a detailed description of both methods and discuss their advantages and limitations.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Holistic KLD-based Waveform Design for Multi-User-Multi-Target ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20245v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework aimed at designing integrated waveforms for robust integrated sensing and communication systems. The system model consists of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) base station that simultaneously serves communication user equipments and detects multiple targets using a shared-antenna deployment scenario. By leveraging Kullback-Leibler divergence to holistically characterise both communication and sensing subsystems, three optimisation problems are formulated: (i) radar waveform KLD maximisation under communication constraints, (ii) communication waveform KLD maximisation subject to radar KLD requirements, and (iii) an integrated waveform KLD-based optimisation for ISAC that jointly balances both subsystems. The first two problems are solved using a projected gradient method with adaptive penalties for the radar waveforms and a gradient assisted interior point method for the communication waveforms. The third, integrated waveform optimisation approach adopts an alternating direction method of multipliers framework to unify radar and communication waveform designs into a single integrated optimisation, thereby strengthening the trade-off between sensing and communication objectives and achieving higher overall performance than the individual radar- or communication-only techniques. Unlike most existing ISAC waveform designs that regard communication signals solely as interference for sensing, the proposed framework utilises the holistic ISAC waveform-that is, the superimposed communication and sensing signals to boost detection performance in the radar subsystem. Simulation results show significant improvements in both radar detection and communication reliability compared with conventional zero-forcing beamforming and identity covariance radar baselines, demonstrating the promise of KLD-based waveform designs for next-generation ISAC networks.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Holographic Surface-aided Distributed MIMO Radar Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed phased Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (phased-MIMO) radar systems have attracted wide attention in target detection and tracking. However, the phase-shifting circuits in phased subarrays contribute to high power consumption and hardware cost. To address this issue, an energy-efficient and cost-efficient metamaterial antenna array, i.e., reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS), has been developed. In this letter, we propose RHS-aided distributed MIMO radar systems to achieve more accurate multi-target detection under equivalent power consumption and hardware cost as that of distributed phased-MIMO radar systems. Different from phased arrays, the RHS achieves beam steering by regulating the radiation amplitude of its elements, and thus conventional beamforming schemes designed for phased arrays are no longer applicable. Aiming to maximize detection accuracy, we design an amplitude-controlled beamforming scheme for multiple RHS transceiver subarrays. The simulations validate the superiority of the proposed scheme over the distributed phased-MIMO radar scheme and reveal the optimal allocation of spatial diversity and coherent processing gain that leads to the best system performance when hardware resources are fixed.</description>

      <title>AI and Deep Learning for THz Ultra-Massive MIMO: From Model-Driven Approaches to Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to address challenges in terahertz ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (THz UM-MIMO) systems. We identify three key challenges for transceiver design: "hard to compute," "hard to model," and "hard to measure," and argue that AI can provide promising solutions. We propose three research roadmaps for AI algorithms tailored to THz UM-MIMO systems. The first, model-driven deep learning (DL), emphasizes leveraging domain knowledge and using AI to enhance bottleneck modules in established signal processing or optimization frameworks. We discuss four steps: algorithmic frameworks, basis algorithms, loss function design, and neural architecture design. The second roadmap presents channel station information (CSI) foundation models to unify transceiver module design by focusing on the wireless channel. We propose a compact foundation model to estimate wireless channel score functions, serving as a prior for designing transceiver modules. We outline four steps: general frameworks, conditioning, site-specific adaptation, and joint design of CSI models and model-driven DL. The third roadmap explores applying pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to THz UM-MIMO systems, with applications in estimation, optimization, searching, network management, and protocol understanding. Finally, we discuss open problems and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Secure RIS-Enabled ISAC: Passive RIS vs. Active RIS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) communications standard is anticipated to provide integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) as a fundamental service. These ISAC systems present unique security challenges because of the exposure of information-bearing signals to sensing targets, enabling them to potentially eavesdrop on sensitive communication information with the assistance of sophisticated receivers. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have shown promising results in enhancing the physical layer security of various wireless communication systems, including ISAC. However, the performance of conventional passive RIS (pRIS)-enabled systems are often limited due to multiplicative fading, which can be alleviated using active RIS (aIRS). In this paper, we consider the problem of beampattern gain maximization in a secure pRIS/aRIS-enabled ISAC system, subject to signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio constraints at communication receivers, and information leakage constraints at an eavesdropping target. For the challenging non-convex problem of joint beamforming design at the base station and the pRIS/aRIS, we propose a novel successive convex approximation (SCA)-based method. Unlike the conventional alternating optimization (AO)-based methods, in the proposed SCA-based approach, all of the optimization variables are updated simultaneously in each iteration. The proposed method shows significant performance superiority for pRIS-aided ISAC system compared to a benchmark scheme using penalty-based AO method. Moreover, our simulation results also confirm that aRIS-aided system has a notably higher beampattern gain at the target compared to that offered by the pRIS-aided system for the same power budget. We also present a detailed complexity analysis and proof of convergence for the proposed SCA-based method.</description>

      <title>A New Statistical Approach to Calibration-Free Localization Using Unlabeled Crowdsourced Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fingerprinting-based indoor localization methods typically require labor-intensive site surveys to collect signal measurements at known reference locations and frequent recalibration, which limits their scalability. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a novel approach for indoor localization that utilizes crowdsourced data without location labels. We leverage the statistical information of crowdsourced data and propose a cumulative distribution function (CDF) based distance estimation method that maps received signal strength (RSS) to distances from access points. This approach overcomes the limitations of conventional distance estimation based on the empirical path loss model by efficiently capturing the impacts of shadow fading and multipath. Compared to fingerprinting, our unsupervised statistical approach eliminates the need for signal measurements at known reference locations. The estimated distances are then integrated into a three-step framework to determine the target location. The localization performance of our proposed method is evaluated using RSS data generated from ray-tracing simulations. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in localization accuracy compared to methods based on the empirical path loss model. Furthermore, our statistical approach, which relies on unlabeled data, achieves localization accuracy comparable to that of the supervised approach, the $k$-Nearest Neighbor ($k$NN) algorithm, which requires fingerprints with location labels. For reproducibility and future research, we make the ray-tracing dataset publicly available at [2].</description>

      <title>Improved impedance inversion by the iterated graph Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a data-adaptive inversion method that integrates classical or deep learning-based approaches with iterative graph Laplacian regularization, specifically targeting acoustic impedance inversion - a critical task in seismic exploration. Our method initiates from an impedance estimate derived using either traditional inversion techniques or neural network-based methods. This initial estimate guides the construction of a graph Laplacian operator, effectively capturing structural characteristics of the impedance profile. Utilizing a Tikhonov-inspired variational framework with this graph-informed prior, our approach iteratively updates and refines the impedance estimate while continuously recalibrating the graph Laplacian. This iterative refinement shows rapid convergence, increased accuracy, and enhanced robustness to noise compared to initial reconstructions alone. Extensive validation performed on synthetic and real seismic datasets across varying noise levels confirms the effectiveness of our method. Performance evaluations include four initial inversion methods: two classical techniques and two neural networks - previously established in the literature.</description>

      <title>A Coding-Theoretic Analysis of Hyperspherical Prototypical Learning Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperspherical Prototypical Learning (HPL) is a supervised approach to representation learning that designs class prototypes on the unit hypersphere. The prototypes bias the representations to class separation in a scale invariant and known geometry. Previous approaches to HPL have either of the following shortcomings: (i) they follow an unprincipled optimisation procedure; or (ii) they are theoretically sound, but are constrained to only one possible latent dimension. In this paper, we address both shortcomings. To address (i), we present a principled optimisation procedure whose solution we show is optimal. To address (ii), we construct well-separated prototypes in a wide range of dimensions using linear block codes. Additionally, we give a full characterisation of the optimal prototype placement in terms of achievable and converse bounds, showing that our proposed methods are near-optimal.</description>

      <title>Risk Estimate under a Time-Varying Autoregressive Model for Data-Driven Reproduction Number Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the fore epidemiological models which, though describing a wealth of behaviors, have previously received little attention in the signal processing literature. In this work, a generalized time-varying autoregressive model is considered, encompassing, but not reducing to, a state-of-the-art model of viral epidemics propagation. The time-varying parameter of this model is estimated via the minimization of a penalized likelihood estimator. A major challenge is that the estimation accuracy strongly depends on hyperparameters fine-tuning. Without available ground truth, hyperparameters are selected by minimizing specifically designed data-driven oracles, used as proxy for the estimation error. Focusing on the time-varying autoregressive Poisson model, the Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate formalism is generalized to construct asymptotically unbiased risk estimators based on the derivation of an original autoregressive counterpart of Stein's lemma. The accuracy of these oracles and of the resulting estimates are assessed through intensive Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic data. Then, elaborating on recent epidemiological models, a novel weekly scaled Poisson model is proposed, better accounting for intrinsic variability of the contamination while being robust to reporting errors. Finally, the overall data-driven procedure is particularized to the estimation of COVID-19 reproduction number demonstrating its ability to yield very consistent estimates.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning Driven Movable-Antenna-assisted Full-Duplex RSMA for Multi-User Communication: Performance and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Full-duplex (FD) radios at base station (BS) have gained significant interest because of their ability to simultaneously transmit and receive signals on the same frequency band. However, FD communication is hindered by self-interference (SI) and intra-cell interference caused by simultaneous uplink (UL) transmissions affecting downlink (DL) reception. These interferences significantly limit the ability to fully exploit FD's potential. Recently, movable antenna (MA) technology has emerged as a groundbreaking innovation, offering an effective way to mitigate interference by adjusting the position of each MA within the transmitter or receiver region. This dynamic repositioning allows MAs to move away from high-interference zones to areas with minimal interference, thereby enhancing multiplexing gain and improving spectral efficiency (SE). In light of this, in this paper, we investigate an FD communication system by integrating it with MAs to evaluate and investigate its effectiveness in handling SI and intra-cell interference. Moreover, we utilize rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) as our multiple access technique in both UL and DL transmission. To achieve the full potential of the system, we evaluated three different scenarios with FD-BS-RSMA with MAs where our goal is to maximize the total sum rate of the system by jointly optimizing the transmitting and receiving beamforming vectors, UL user equipment (UE) transmission power, MA positions, and common stream split ratio of RSMA while satisfying the minimum data rate requirements of all UEs, common stream constraint, power budget requirements of BS and UL UEs, and inter-MA distance. The formulated optimization problem is highly non-convex in nature, and hence, we propose a gradient-based meta-learning (GML) approach which can handle the non-convexity in a discrete manner by optimizing each variable in a different neural network.</description>
