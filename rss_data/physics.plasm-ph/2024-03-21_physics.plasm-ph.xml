      <title>Physical insights from the aspect ratio dependence of turbulence in negative triangularity plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the impact of aspect ratio A = R0 /r (the ratio of major radius R0 to minor radius r) on the confinement benefits of Negative Triangularity (NT) plasma shaping. We use high-fidelity flux tube gyrokinetic GENE simulations and consider several different scenarios: four of them inspired by TCV experimental data, a scenario inspired by DIII-D experimental data and a scenario expected in the new SMART spherical tokamak. The present study reveals a surprising and non-trivial dependence. NT improves confinement at any value of A for ITG turbulence, while for TEM turbulence confinement is improved only in the case of large and conventional aspect ratios. Additionally, through a detailed study of a large aspect ratio case with pure ITG drive, we develop an intuitive physical picture that explains the beneficial effect of NT at large and conventional aspect ratios. This picture does not hold in TEM-dominated regimes, where a complex synergistic effect of many factors is found. Finally, we performed the first linear gyrokinetic simulations of SMART, finding that both NT and PT scenarios are dominated by micro-tearing-mode (MTM) turbulence and that NT is more susceptible to MTMs at tight aspect ratio. However, we found that a regime where ITGs dominate in SMART can be found, and in this regime NT is more linearly stable.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic wave interaction via asymmetric vector solitons as precursor to rogue wave formation in non-Maxwellian plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An asymmetric pair of coupled nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger (CNLS) equations has been derived through a multiscale perturbation method applied to a plasma fluid model, in which two wavepackets of distinct carrier wavenumbers and amplitudes are allowed to co-propagate and interact. The original fluid model was set up for a non-magnetized plasma consisting of cold inertial ions evolving against a $\kappa-$distributed electron background in 1D. The reduction procedure resulting in the CNLS equations has provided analytical expressions for the dispersion, self-modulation and cross-coupling coefficients in terms of the carrier wavenumbers.
  The system admits various types of vector solitons (VSs), physically representing nonlinear localized electrostatic plasma modes. The possibility for either bright (B) or dark (D) type excitations for either of the two waves provides four combinations for the envelope pair (BB, BD, DB, DD). Moreover, the soliton parameters are also calculated for each type of VS in its respective area of existence. The dependence of the VS characteristics on the carrier wavenumbers and the spectral index $\kappa$ has been explored. In certain cases, the amplitude of one component may exceed its counterpart (second amplitude) by a factor 2.5 or higher, indicating that extremely asymmetric waves may be formed due to modulational interactions among the wavepackets.
  As $\kappa$ decreases from large values, modulational instability (MI) occurs in larger areas of the parameter plane(s) and with higher growth rates. The distribution of different types of VSs on the parameter plane(s) also varies significantly with decreasing $\kappa$, and in fact dramatically for $\kappa$ between $3$ and $2$. Deviation from the Maxwell-Boltzmann picture therefore seems to favor MI as a precursor to the formation of bright (predominantly) type envelope excitations and freak waves.</description>

      <title>A theoretic analysis of magnetoactive GES-based turbulent solar plasma instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recently reported gravito-electrostatic sheath (GES) model is procedurally applied to study the turbumagnetoactive helioseismic oscillation features on the entire bi-fluidic solar plasma system. The bounded solar interior plasma (SIP, internally self-gravitating) and the unbounded solar wind plasma (SWP, externally point-gravitating) are coupled through the interfacial diffused solar surface boundary (SSB) due to an exact gravito-electrostatic interplay. A numerical platform on the developed theoretic formalism reveals the evolution of both dispersive and non-dispersive features of the modified GES mode fluctuations in new parametric windows. Different colourspectral profiles exhibit important features of the GES-based SIP-SWP perturbations elaborately. It is illustratively shown that the thermostatistical GES stability depends mainly on the radial distance, magnetic field, equilibrium plasma density, and plasma temperature. We see that their dispersive features are more pertinently pronounced in the self-gravitational domains (SIP) than the electrostatic ones (SWP). Besides, different characteristic parameters with accelerating (or decelerating) and stabilizing (or destabilizing) effects influencing the entire solar plasma stability are illustratively portrayed. We speculate that, in the SIP, the long-wave (gravitational-like) helioseismic fluctuations become highly dispersive showing more propagatory nature than the shorter ones (acoustic-like). The short waves show more propagatory propensity than the longer ones in the SSB and SWP regime. The reliability of our proposed investigation is bolstered along with the tentative applicability and future scope in light of the current solar observational scenarios, such as SOHO, STEREO, SDO, PSP, and SolO.</description>

      <title>Scalable Implicit Solvers with Dynamic Mesh Adaptation for a Relativistic Drift-Kinetic Fokker-Planck-Boltzmann Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider a relativistic drift-kinetic model for runaway electrons along with a Fokker-Planck operator for small-angle Coulomb collisions, a radiation damping operator, and a secondary knock-on (Boltzmann) collision source. We develop a new scalable fully implicit solver utilizing finite volume and conservative finite difference schemes and dynamic mesh adaptivity. A new data management framework in the PETSc library based on the p4est library is developed to enable simulations with dynamic adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), distributed memory parallelization, and dynamic load balancing of computational work. This framework and the runaway electron solver building on the framework are able to dynamically capture both bulk Maxwellian at the low-energy region and a runaway tail at the high-energy region. To effectively capture features via the AMR algorithm, a new AMR indicator prediction strategy is proposed that is performed alongside the implicit time evolution of the solution. This strategy is complemented by the introduction of computationally cheap feature-based AMR indicators that are analyzed theoretically. Numerical results quantify the advantages of the prediction strategy in better capturing features compared with nonpredictive strategies; and we demonstrate trade-offs regarding computational costs. The robustness with respect to model parameters, algorithmic scalability, and parallel scalability are demonstrated through several benchmark problems including manufactured solutions and solutions of different physics models. We focus on demonstrating the advantages of using implicit time stepping and AMR for runaway electron simulations.</description>
