      <title>Polarization-Dependent Loss Mitigation with Orthogonal-Design-Based Precoding and Interference Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work by Shehadeh and Kschischang provides a simple capacity-achieving scheme for channels with polarization-dependent loss (PDL) under common modeling assumptions via a careful choice of orthogonal-design-based precoding and interference cancellation. This letter extends that work with a simulation-based demonstration showing that this scheme remains highly effective at mitigating PDL in the highly practical setting of 4-PAM with Chase-decoded extended Hamming inner codes rather than the near-capacity inner codes considered in the original work. An alternative near-optimal variation of this scheme is provided requiring only one inner code rather than two and suffering no penalty in the absence of PDL, making it much more practical.</description>

      <title>On $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{P})$-Twisted Generalized Reed-Solomon Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted generalized Reed-Solomon (TGRS) codes are an extension of the generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes by adding specific twists, which attract much attention recently. This paper presents an in-depth and comprehensive investigation of the TGRS codes for the most general form by using a universal method. At first, we propose a more precise definition to describe TGRS codes, namely $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{P})$-TGRS codes, and provide a concise necessary and sufficient condition for $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{P})$-TGRS codes to be MDS, which extends the related results in the previous works. Secondly, we explicitly characterize the parity check matrices of $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{P})$-TGRS codes, and provide a sufficient condition for $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{P})$-TGRS codes to be self-dual. Finally, we conduct an in-depth study into the non-GRS property of $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{P})$-TGRS codes via the Schur squares and the combinatorial techniques respectively. As a result, we obtain a large infinite families of non-GRS MDS codes.</description>

      <title>Bounding User Contributions in the Worst-Case for User-Level Differentially Private Mean Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we revisit the well-studied problem of mean estimation under user-level $\varepsilon$-differential privacy (DP). While user-level $\varepsilon$-DP mechanisms for mean estimation, which typically bound (or clip) user contributions to reduce sensitivity, are well-known, an analysis of their estimation errors usually assumes that the data samples are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and sometimes also that all participating users contribute the same number of samples (data homogeneity). Our main result is a precise characterization of the \emph{worst-case} estimation error under general clipping strategies, for heterogeneous data, and as a by-product, the clipping strategy that gives rise to the smallest worst-case error. Interestingly, we show via experimental studies that even for i.i.d. samples, our clipping strategy performs uniformly better that the well-known clipping strategy of Amin et al. (2019), which involves additional, private parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Uplink Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Mobile Edge Computing with Short-Packet Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) scheme is proposed to assist a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) system where local computation tasks from two users are offloaded to the MEC server, facilitated by uplink RSMA for processing. The efficiency of the MEC service is hence primarily influenced by the RSMA-aided task offloading phase and the subsequent task computation phase, where reliable and low-latency communication is required. For this practical consideration, short-packet communication in the Finite Blocklength (FBL) regime is introduced. In this context, we propose a novel uplink RSMA-aided MEC framework and derive the overall Successful Computation Probability (SCP) with FBL consideration. To maximize the SCP of our proposed RSMA-aided MEC, we strategically optimize: (1) the task offloading factor which determines the number of tasks to be offloaded and processed by the MEC server; (2) the transmit power allocation between different RSMA streams; and (3) the task-splitting factor which decides how many tasks are allocated to splitting streams, while adhering to FBL constraints. To address the strong coupling between these variables in the SCP expression, we apply the Alternative Optimization method, which formulates tractable subproblems to optimize each variable iteratively. The resultant non-convex subproblems are then tackled by Successive Convex Approximation. Numerical results demonstrate that applying uplink RSMA in the MEC system with FBL constraints can not only improve the SCP performance but also provide lower latency in comparison to conventional transmission scheme such as Non-orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA).</description>

      <title>Analysis of Diffusion Models for Manifold Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the time reversed dynamics of generative diffusion models. If the exact empirical score function is used in a regime of large dimension and exponentially large number of samples, these models are known to undergo transitions between distinct dynamical regimes. We extend this analysis and compute the transitions for an analytically tractable manifold model where the statistical model for the data is a mixture of lower dimensional Gaussians embedded in higher dimensional space. We compute the so-called speciation and collapse transition times, as a function of the ratio of manifold-to-ambient space dimensions, and other characteristics of the data model. An important tool used in our analysis is the exact formula for the mutual information (or free energy) of Generalized Linear Models.</description>

      <title>Decomposing Multivariate Information Rates in Networks of Random Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Partial Information Decomposition (PID) framework has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing high-order interdependencies in complex network systems. However, its application to dynamic processes remains challenging due to the implicit assumption of memorylessness, which often falls in real-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce the framework of Partial Information Rate Decomposition (PIRD) that extends PID to random processes with temporal correlations. By leveraging mutual information rate (MIR) instead of mutual information (MI), our approach decomposes the dynamic information shared by multivariate random processes into unique, redundant, and synergistic contributions obtained aggregating information rate atoms in a principled manner. To solve PIRD, we define a pointwise redundancy rate function based on the minimum MI principle applied locally in the frequency-domain representation of the processes. The framework is validated in benchmark simulations of Gaussian systems, demonstrating its advantages over traditional PID in capturing temporal correlations and showing how the spectral representation may reveal scale-specific higher-order interaction that are obscured in the time domain. Furthermore, we apply PIRD to a physiological network comprising cerebrovascular and cardiovascular variables, revealing frequency-dependent redundant information exchange during a protocol of postural stress. Our results highlight the necessity of accounting for the full temporal statistical structure and spectral content of vector random processes to meaningfully perform information decomposition in network systems with dynamic behavior such as those typically encountered in neuroscience and physiology.</description>

      <title>Speeding up Speculative Decoding via Approximate Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) is a recently proposed technique for faster inference using Large Language Models (LLMs). SD operates by using a smaller draft LLM for autoregressively generating a sequence of tokens and a larger target LLM for parallel verification to ensure statistical consistency. However, periodic parallel calls to the target LLM for verification prevent SD from achieving even lower latencies. We propose SPRINTER, which utilizes a low-complexity verifier trained to predict if tokens generated from a draft LLM would be accepted by the target LLM. By performing approximate sequential verification, SPRINTER does not require verification by the target LLM and is only invoked when a token is deemed unacceptable. This leads to reducing the number of calls to the larger LLM and can achieve further speedups. We present a theoretical analysis of SPRINTER, examining the statistical properties of the generated tokens, as well as the expected reduction in latency as a function of the verifier. We evaluate SPRINTER on several datasets and model pairs, demonstrating that approximate verification can still maintain high quality generation while further reducing latency. For instance, on Wiki-Summaries dataset, SPRINTER achieves a 1.7x latency speedup and requires 8.3x fewer flops relative to SD, while still generating high-quality responses when using GPT2-Small and GPT2-XL as draft/target models.</description>

      <title>Dark Brain Energy: Toward an Integrative Model of Spontaneous Slow Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural oscillations facilitate the functioning of the human brain in spatial and temporal dimensions at various frequencies. These oscillations feature a universal frequency architecture that is governed by brain anatomy, ensuring frequency specificity remains invariant across different measurement techniques. Initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methodology constrained functional MRI (fMRI) investigations to a singular frequency range, thereby neglecting the frequency characteristics inherent in blood oxygen level-dependent oscillations. With advancements in MRI technology, it has become feasible to decode intricate brain activities via multi-band frequency analysis (MBFA). During the past decade, the utilization of MBFA in fMRI studies has surged, unveiling frequency-dependent characteristics of spontaneous slow oscillations (SSOs) believed to base dark energy in the brain. There remains a dearth of conclusive insights and hypotheses pertaining to the properties and functionalities of SSOs in distinct bands. We surveyed the SSO MBFA studies during the past 15 years to delineate the attributes of SSOs and enlighten their correlated functions. We further proposed a model to elucidate the hierarchical organization of multi-band SSOs by integrating their function, aimed at bridging theoretical gaps and guiding future MBFA research endeavors.</description>

      <title>Tight Bounds for Noisy Computation of High-Influence Functions, Connectivity, and Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the noisy query model, the (binary) return value of every query (possibly repeated) is independently flipped with some fixed probability $p \in (0, 1/2)$. In this paper, we obtain tight bounds on the noisy query complexity of several fundamental problems.
  Our first contribution is to show that any Boolean function with total influence $\Omega(n)$ has noisy query complexity $\Theta(n\log n)$. Previous works often focus on specific problems, and it is of great interest to have a characterization of noisy query complexity for general functions. Our result is the first noisy query complexity lower bound of this generality, beyond what was known for random Boolean functions [Reischuk and Schmeltz, FOCS 1991].
  Our second contribution is to prove that Graph Connectivity has noisy query complexity $\Theta(n^2 \log n)$. In this problem, the goal is to determine whether an undirected graph is connected using noisy edge queries. While the upper bound can be achieved by a simple algorithm, no non-trivial lower bounds were known prior to this work.
  Last but not least, we determine the exact number of noisy queries (up to lower order terms) needed to solve the $k$-Threshold problem and the Counting problem. The $k$-Threshold problem asks to decide whether there are at least $k$ ones among $n$ bits, given noisy query access to the bits. We prove that $(1\pm o(1)) \frac{n\log (\min\{k,n-k+1\}/\delta)}{(1-2p)\log \frac{1-p}p}$ queries are both sufficient and necessary to achieve error probability $\delta = o(1)$. Previously, such a result was only known when $\min\{k,n-k+1\}=o(n)$ [Wang, Ghaddar, Zhu and Wang, arXiv 2024]. We also show a similar $(1\pm o(1)) \frac{n\log (\min\{k+1,n-k+1\}/\delta)}{(1-2p)\log \frac{1-p}p}$ bound for the Counting problem, where one needs to count the number of ones among $n$ bits given noisy query access and $k$ denotes the answer.</description>

      <title>UAV-Based Cell-Free Massive MIMO: Joint Placement and Power Optimization under Fronthaul Capacity Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) network, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multiple antennas serve as distributed UAV-access points (UAV-APs). These UAV-APs provide seamless coverage by jointly serving user equipments (UEs) with out predefined cell boundaries. However, high-capacity wireless networks face significant challenges due to fronthaul limitations in UAV-assisted architectures. This letter proposes a novel UAV-based cell-free mMIMO framework that leverages distributed UAV-APs to serve UEs while addressing the capacity constraints of wireless fronthaul links. We evaluate functional split Options 7.2 and 8 for the fronthaul links, aiming to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among the UEs and minimize the power consumption by optimizing the transmit powers of UAV-APs and selectively activating them. Our analysis compares sub-6 GHz and millimeter wave (mmWave) bands for the fronthaul, showing that mmWave achieves superior SINR with lower power consumption, particularly under Option 8. Additionally, we determine the minimum fronthaul bandwidth required to activate a single UAV-AP under different split options.</description>

      <title>A Variant of the Bravyi-Terhal Bound for Arbitrary Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a modified version of the Bravyi-Terhal bound that applies to quantum codes defined by local parity-check constraints on a $D$-dimensional lattice quotient. Specifically, we consider a quotient $\mathbb{Z}^D/\Lambda$ of $\mathbb{Z}^D$ of cardinality $n$, where $\Lambda$ is some $D$-dimensional sublattice of $\mathbb{Z}^D$: we suppose that every vertex of this quotient indexes $m$ qubits of a stabilizer code $C$, which therefore has length $nm$. We prove that if all stabilizer generators act on qubits whose indices lie within a ball of radius $\rho$, then the minimum distance $d$ of the code satisfies $d \leq m\sqrt{\gamma_D}(\sqrt{D} + 4\rho)n^\frac{D-1}{D}$ whenever $n^{1/D} \geq 8\rho\sqrt{\gamma_D}$, where $\gamma_D$ is the $D$-dimensional Hermite constant. We apply this bound to derive an upper bound on the minimum distance of Abelian Two-Block Group Algebra (2BGA) codes whose parity-check matrices have the form $[\mathbf{A} \, \vert \, \mathbf{B}]$ with each submatrix representing an element of a group algebra over a finite abelian group.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Guarantees for Recovering Low-Rank Tensors from Symmetric Rank-One Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the sample complexity of recovering tensors with low symmetric rank from symmetric rank-one measurements. This setting is particularly motivated by the study of higher-order interactions and the analysis of two-layer neural networks with polynomial activations (polynomial networks). Using a covering numbers argument, we analyze the performance of the symmetric rank minimization program and establish near-optimal sample complexity bounds when the underlying distribution is log-concave. Our measurement model involves random symmetric rank-one tensors, which lead to involved probability calculations. To address these challenges, we employ the Carbery-Wright inequality, a powerful tool for studying anti-concentration properties of random polynomials, and leverage orthogonal polynomials. Additionally, we provide a sample complexity lower bound based on Fano's inequality, and discuss broader implications of our results for two-layer polynomial networks.</description>

      <title>RISnet: A Domain-Knowledge Driven Neural Network Architecture for RIS Optimization with Mutual Coupling and Partial CSI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space-division multiple access (SDMA) plays an important role in modern wireless communications. Its performance depends on the channel properties, which can be improved by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In this work, we jointly optimize SDMA precoding at the base station (BS) and RIS configuration. We tackle difficulties of mutual coupling between RIS elements, scalability to more than 1000 RIS elements, and high requirement for channel estimation. We first derive an RIS-assisted channel model considering mutual coupling, then propose an unsupervised machine learning (ML) approach to optimize the RIS with a dedicated neural network (NN) architecture RISnet, which has good scalability, desired permutation-invariance, and a low requirement for channel estimation. Moreover, we leverage existing high-performance analytical precoding scheme to propose a hybrid solution of ML-enabled RIS configuration and analytical precoding at BS. More generally, this work is an early contribution to combine ML technique and domain knowledge in communication for NN architecture design. Compared to generic ML, the problem-specific ML can achieve higher performance, lower complexity and permutation-invariance.</description>

      <title>Distributed Signal Processing for Extremely Large-Scale Antenna Array Systems: State-of-the-Art and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAA) play a critical role in enabling the functionalities of next generation wireless communication systems. However, as the number of antennas increases, ELAA systems face significant bottlenecks, such as excessive interconnection costs and high computational complexity. Efficient distributed signal processing (SP) algorithms show great promise in overcoming these challenges. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of distributed SP algorithms for ELAA systems, tailored to address these bottlenecks. We start by presenting three representative forms of ELAA systems: single-base station ELAA systems, coordinated distributed antenna systems, and ELAA systems integrated with emerging technologies. For each form, we review the associated distributed SP algorithms in the literature. Additionally, we outline several important future research directions that are essential for improving the performance and practicality of ELAA systems.</description>

      <title>Polycyclic Codes over the Product Ring $\mathbb{F}_q^l$ and their Annihilator Dual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, for the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, we show that the $\mathbb{F}_q$-algebra $\mathbb{F}_q[x]/\langle f(x) \rangle$ is isomorphic to the product ring $\mathbb{F}_q^{\deg f(x)}$ if and only if $f(x)$ splits over $\mathbb{F}_q$ into distinct factors. We generalize this result to the quotient of the polynomial algebra $\mathbb{F}_q[x_1, x_2,\dots, x_k]$ by the ideal $\langle f_1(x_1), f_2(x_2),\dots, f_k(x_k)\rangle.$ On the other hand, we establish that every finite-dimensional $\mathbb{F}_q$-algebra $\mathcal{S}$ has an orthogonal basis of idempotents with their sum equal to $1_{\mathcal{S}}$ if and only if $\mathcal{S}\cong\mathbb{F}_q^l$ as $\mathbb{F}_q$-algebras, where $l=\dim_{\mathbb{F}_q} \mathcal{S}$. Instead of studying polycyclic codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$-algebras $\mathbb{F}_q[x_1, x_2,\dots, x_k]/\langle f_1(x_1), f_2(x_2),\dots, f_k(x_k)\rangle$ where $f_i(x_i)$ splits into distinct linear factors over $\mathbb{F}_q,$ which is a subclass of $\mathbb{F}_q^l,$ we study polycyclic codes over $\mathbb{F}_q^l$ and obtain their unique decomposition into polycyclic codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ for every such orthogonal basis of $\mathbb{F}_q^l$. We refer to it as an $\mathbb{F}_q$-decomposition. An $\mathbb{F}_q$-decomposition enables us to use results of polycyclic codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ to study polycyclic codes over $\mathbb{F}_q^l$; for instance, we show that the annihilator dual of a polycyclic code over $\mathbb{F}_q^l$ is a polycyclic code over $\mathbb{F}_q^l$. Furthermore, with the help of different Gray maps, we produce a good number of examples of MDS or almost-MDS or/and optimal codes; some of them are LCD over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Finally, we study Gray maps from $(\mathbb{F}_q^l)^n$ to $\mathbb{F}_q^{nl},$ and use it to construct quantum codes with the help of CSS construction.</description>

      <title>Sequential Change Detection for Learning in Piecewise Stationary Bandit Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A finite-horizon variant of the quickest change detection problem is investigated, which is motivated by a change detection problem that arises in piecewise stationary bandits. The goal is to minimize the \emph{latency}, which is smallest threshold such that the probability that the detection delay exceeds the threshold is below a desired low level, while controlling the false alarm probability to a desired low level. When the pre- and post-change distributions are unknown, two tests are proposed as candidate solutions. These tests are shown to attain order optimality in terms of the horizon. Furthermore, the growth in their latencies with respect to the false alarm probability and late detection probability satisfies a property that is desirable in regret analysis for piecewise stationary bandits. Numerical results are provided to validate the theoretical performance results.</description>

      <title>One-Bit Distributed Mean Estimation with Unknown Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of distributed mean estimation with $1$-bit communication constraints when the variance is unknown. We focus on the specific case where each user has access to one i.i.d. sample drawn from a distribution that belongs to a scale-location family, and is limited to sending just a single bit of information to a central server whose goal is to estimate the mean. We propose non-adaptive and adaptive estimators that are shown to be asymptotically normal. We derive bounds on the asymptotic (in the number of users) Mean Squared Error (MSE) achieved by these estimators. For a class of symmetric log-concave distributions, we derive matching lower bounds for the MSE achieved by adaptive estimators, proving the optimality of our scheme. We show that non-adaptive estimators can be strictly suboptimal by deriving a lower bound on the MSE achieved by any non-adaptive estimator for Gaussian distributions and demonstrating a positive gap between this and the MSE achieved by our adaptive scheme.</description>

      <title>Consistent model selection in the spiked Wigner model via AIC-type criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the spiked Wigner model \[
  X = \sum_{i = 1}^k \lambda_i u_i u_i^\top + \sigma G, \] where $G$ is an $N \times N$ GOE random matrix, and the eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ are all spiked, i.e. above the Baik-Ben Arous-P\'ech\'e (BBP) threshold $\sigma$. We consider AIC-type model selection criteria of the form \[
  -2 \, (\text{maximised log-likelihood}) + \gamma \, (\text{number of parameters}) \] for estimating the number $k$ of spikes. For $\gamma &gt; 2$, the above criterion is strongly consistent provided $\lambda_k &gt; \lambda_{\gamma}$, where $\lambda_{\gamma}$ is a threshold strictly above the BBP threshold, whereas for $\gamma &lt; 2$, it almost surely overestimates $k$. Although AIC (which corresponds to $\gamma = 2$) is not strongly consistent, we show that taking $\gamma = 2 + \delta_N$, where $\delta_N \to 0$ and $\delta_N \gg N^{-2/3}$, results in a weakly consistent estimator of $k$. We further show that a soft minimiser of AIC, where one chooses the least complex model whose AIC score is close to the minimum AIC score, is strongly consistent. Based on a spiked (generalised) Wigner representation, we also develop similar model selection criteria for consistently estimating the number of communities in a balanced stochastic block model under some sparsity restrictions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Ruzsa Divergence to Quantify Magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the behavior of quantum entropy under quantum convolution and its application in quantifying magic. We first establish an entropic, quantum central limit theorem (q-CLT), where the rate of convergence is bounded by the magic gap. We also introduce a new quantum divergence based on quantum convolution, called the quantum Ruzsa divergence, to study the stabilizer structure of quantum states. We conjecture a ``convolutional strong subadditivity'' inequality, which leads to the triangle inequality for the quantum Ruzsa divergence. In addition, we propose two new magic measures, the quantum Ruzsa divergence of magic and quantum-doubling constant, to quantify the amount of magic in quantum states. Finally, by using the quantum convolution, we extend the classical, inverse sumset theory to the quantum case. These results shed new insight into the study of the stabilizer and magic states in quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>The Origin and Evolution of Information Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04374v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence and evolution of information handling is essential for unraveling the origins of life. Traditional genetic-first and metabolism-first models fall short in explaining how instructional information control systems naturally arise from molecular dynamics. To address this gap, we adopt an information-first approach, integrating Hofmeyr's (F, A)-systems -- an extension of Rosen's (M, R)-systems -- with temporal parametrization and multiscale causality. These models, which embody closure to efficient causation while remaining open to formal causation, provide a robust framework for primitive autopoiesis, anticipation, and adaptation. We establish a formal equivalence between extended (F, A)-systems and communicating X-machines, resolving self-referential challenges and demonstrating the hypercomputational nature of life processes. Our stepwise model traces the evolution of information handling from simple reaction networks that recognize regular languages to self-replicating chemical systems with memory and anticipatory capabilities. This transition from analog to digital architectures enhances evolutionary robustness and aligns with experimental evidence suggesting that chemical computation does not require life-specific chemistry. Furthermore, we incorporate open-ended evolutionary dynamics driven by computational undecidability and irreducibility, reinforcing the necessity of unconventional computing frameworks. This computational enactivist perspective provides a cohesive theoretical basis for a recently proposed trialectic between autopoiesis, anticipation and adaptation in order to solve the problem of relevance. By highlighting the critical role of hypercomputational processes in life's emergence and evolution, our framework offers new insights into the fundamental principles underlying biological information processing.</description>

      <title>Geometric Signatures of Compositionality Across a Language Model's Lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By virtue of linguistic compositionality, few syntactic rules and a finite lexicon can generate an unbounded number of sentences. That is, language, though seemingly high-dimensional, can be explained using relatively few degrees of freedom. An open question is whether contemporary language models (LMs) reflect the intrinsic simplicity of language that is enabled by compositionality. We take a geometric view of this problem by relating the degree of compositionality in a dataset to the intrinsic dimension (ID) of its representations under an LM, a measure of feature complexity. We find not only that the degree of dataset compositionality is reflected in representations' ID, but that the relationship between compositionality and geometric complexity arises due to learned linguistic features over training. Finally, our analyses reveal a striking contrast between nonlinear and linear dimensionality, showing they respectively encode semantic and superficial aspects of linguistic composition.</description>

      <title>On the reconstruction limits of complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network reconstruction consists in retrieving the hidden interaction structure of a system from observations. Many reconstruction algorithms have been proposed, although less research has been devoted to describe their theoretical limitations. In this work, we adopt an information-theoretic perspective and define the reconstructability: The fraction of structural information recoverable from data. The reconstructability depends on the true data generating (TDG) model which is shown to set the reconstruction limit: any algorithm can perform, on average, at best like the TDG model. We show that the reconstructability is related to various performance measures, such as the probability of error and the Jaccard similarity. In an empirical context where the TDG model is unknown, we introduce the reconstruction index as an approximation of the reconstructability. We find that performing model selection is crucial for the validity of the reconstruction index as a proxy of the reconstructability of empirical time series and networks.</description>
