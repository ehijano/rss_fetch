      <title>A nonstandard approach to the direct integral version of the Spectral Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use nonstandard methods to prove the direct integral version of the Spectral Theorem for Unbounded Self-adjoint Operators. Our proof avoids the standard reduction to the case of bounded normal operators via the Cayley transform and, as such, works uniformly for both real and complex Hilbert spaces. Our method also yields a new nonstandard proof of the spectral measure version of the Spectral Theorem.</description>

      <title>Duality Perspective on Nonlinear Eigenproblems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate nonlinear eigenproblems for a broad class of proper, closed, convex functionals in reflexive Banach spaces. We develop a dual formulation of the nonlinear eigenproblem using the Fenchel conjugate and establish an equivalence to the primal problem. Further, we introduce a duality gap and a geometric characterization of eigenvectors that apply in general Banach spaces. We interpret the dual problem as the eigenproblem for the inverse operator of the primal problem. Concerning numerical methods for solving nonlinear eigenproblems, we analyze the inverse power method, framed as a dual power method, showing strong convergence in the case of absolutely p-homogeneous functionals. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive numerical experiments for the p-Laplacian. We further connect the flow-based proximal power method from the literature to the inverse power method and discuss two numerical approaches to approximate higher-order nonlinear eigenfunctions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral properties of the restricted fractional Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions in a smoothly bent waveguide is investigated. The existence of eigenvalues below the threshold of the continuous spectrum is proved, generalizing classical results known for the local Laplace operator. Our approach utilizes the Caffarelli--Silvestre extension, addressing the specific geometric difficulties arising from the operator non-locality. The sufficient conditions on the curvature magnitude and distribution to ensure the existence of these trapped modes is established.</description>

      <title>Improvement of P\'{o}lya's conjecture for balls and cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: P\'{o}lya's conjecture on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian has been one of the core problems in spectral geometry. Building upon the recent breakthrough works on P\'{o}lya's conjecture for balls and annuli by Filonov, Levitin, Polterovich and Sher, we study several aspects of P\'{o}lya's conjecture for balls and cylinders: by refining the purely analytical portion of the proof in [2] for the Neumann P\'{o}lya's conjecture for the disk, we extend the regime of the spectral parameter that can be established without computer assistance; we obtain improvement of P\'{o}lya's conjecture for disks and balls; we obtain improvement of P\'{o}lya's conjecture for cylinders and confirm the Neumann P\'{o}lya's conjecture for cylinders in $\mathbb{R}^3$. As a supplementary effort, we study Weyl's law for cylinders.</description>

      <title>Factorization for the matrix-valued general Jacobi system on the full-line lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Jacobi system with matrix-valued coefficients and with the spectral parameter depending on a matrix-valued weight factor is considered on the full-line lattice. The scattering from the full-line lattice is expressed in terms of the scattering from the fragments of the whole lattice by developing a factorization formula for the corresponding transition matrices. In particular, the matrix-valued transmission and reflection coefficients for the full-line lattice are explicitly expressed in terms of the scattering coefficients for the left and right lattice fragments. Since the matrix-valued scattering coefficients are easier to determine for the fragments than for the full-line lattice, the factorization formula presented provides a method to determine the scattering coefficients for full-line lattices. The theory presented is illustrated with various explicit examples, including an example demonstrating that the matrix-valued left transmission coefficient in general is not equal to the matrix-valued right transmission coefficient for a lattice.</description>

      <title>Generative Myopia: Why Diffusion Models Fail at Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Diffusion Models (GDMs) optimize for statistical likelihood, implicitly acting as \textbf{frequency filters} that favor abundant substructures over spectrally critical ones. We term this phenomenon \textbf{Generative Myopia}. In combinatorial tasks like graph sparsification, this leads to the catastrophic removal of ``rare bridges,'' edges that are structurally mandatory ($R_{\text{eff}} \approx 1$) but statistically scarce. We prove theoretically and empirically that this failure is driven by \textbf{Gradient Starvation}: the optimization landscape itself suppresses rare structural signals, rendering them unlearnable regardless of model capacity. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{Spectrally-Weighted Diffusion}, which re-aligns the variational objective using Effective Resistance. We demonstrate that spectral priors can be amortized into the training phase with zero inference overhead. Our method eliminates myopia, matching the performance of an optimal Spectral Oracle and achieving \textbf{100\% connectivity} on adversarial benchmarks where standard diffusion fails completely (0\%).</description>

      <title>Disc Game Dynamics: A Latent Space Perspective on Selection and Learning in Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary game theory studies populations that change in response to an underlying game. Often, the functional form relating outcome to player attributes or strategy is complex, preventing mathematical progress. In this work, we axiomatically derive a latent space representation for pairwise, symmetric, zero-sum games by seeking a coordinate space in which the optimal training direction for an agent responding to an opponent depends only on their opponent's coordinates. The associated embedding represents the original game as a linear combination of copies of a simple game, the disc game, in a new coordinate space. In this article, we show that disc-game embedding is useful for studying learning dynamics. We demonstrate that a series of classical evolutionary processes simplify to constrained oscillator equations in the latent space. In particular, the continuous replicator equation reduces to a Hamiltonian system of coupled oscillators that exhibit Poincar\'e recurrence. This reduction allows exact, finite-dimensional closure when the underlying game is finite-rank, and optimal approximation otherwise. It also establishes an exact equivalence between the continuous replicator equation and adaptive dynamics in the transformed coordinates. By identifying a minimal rank representation, the disc game embedding offers numerical methods that could decouple the cost of simulation from the number of attributes used to define agents. These results generalize to metapopulation models that mix inhomogeneously, and to any time-differentiable dynamic where the rate of growth of a type, relative to its expected payout, is a nonnegative function of its frequency. We recommend disc-game embedding as an organizing paradigm for learning and selection in response to symmetric two-player zero-sum games.</description>

      <title>On an infinitesimal Polyakov formula for genus zero polyhedra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a genus zero compact polyhedral surface (the Riemann sphere equipped with a flat conical metric $m$). We derive the variational formulas for the determinant of the Laplacian, ${\rm det}\,\Delta^m$, on $X$ under infinitesimal variations of the positions of the conical points and the conical angles (i. e. infinitesimal variations of $X$ in the class of polyhedra with the same number of vertices). Besides having an independent interest, this derivation may serve as a somewhat belated mathematical counterpart of the well-known heuristic calculation of ${\rm det}\,\Delta^m$ performed by Aurell and Salomonson in the 90-s.</description>

      <title>Spectral selections, commutativity preservation and Coxeter-Lipschitz maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system whose graph is connected, with no infinite edges. A self-map $\tau$ of $W$ such that $\tau_{\sigma\theta}\in \{\tau_{\theta},\ \sigma\tau_{\theta}\}$ for all $\theta\in W$ and all reflections $\sigma$ (analogous to being 1-Lipschitz with respect to the Bruhat order on $W$) is either constant or a right translation. A somewhat stronger version holds for $S_n$, where it suffices that $\sigma$ range over smaller, $\theta$-dependent sets of reflections.
  These combinatorial results have a number of consequences concerning continuous spectrum- and commutativity-preserving maps $\mathrm{SU}(n)\to M_n$ defined on special unitary groups: every such map is a conjugation composed with (a) the identity; (b) transposition, or (c) a continuous diagonal spectrum selection. This parallels and recovers Petek's analogous statement for self-maps of the space $H_n\le M_n$ of self-adjoint matrices, strengthening it slightly by expanding the codomain to $M_n$.</description>

      <title>Laplacians in spinor bundles over translation surfaces: self-adjoint extentions and regularized determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the regularized determinants ${\rm det}\, \Delta$ of various self-adjoint extensions of symmetric Laplacians acting in spinor bundles over compact Riemann surfaces with flat singular metrics $|\omega|^2$, where $\omega$ is a holomorphic one form on the Riemann surface. We find an explicit expression for ${\rm det}\, \Delta$ for the so-called self-adjoint Szeg\"o extension through the Bergman tau-function on the moduli space of Abelian differentials and the theta-constants (corresponding to the spinor bundle). This expression can be considered as a version of the well-known spin-$1/2$ bosonization formula of Bost-Nelson for the case of flat conformal metrics with conical singularities and a higher genus generalization of the Ray-Singer formula for flat elliptic curves. We establish comparison formulas for the determinants of two different extensions (e. g., the Szeg\"o extension and the Friedrichs one). The paper answers a question raised by D'Hoker and Phong \cite{DH-P} more than thirty years ago. We also reconsider the results from \cite{DH-P} on the regularization of diverging determinant ratio for Mandelstam metrics (for any spin) proposing (and computing) a new regularization of this ratio.</description>

      <title>Sharp Spectral Gaps, Arithmetic Localization, and Reducibility via Resonance Analys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes several sharp spectral results for analytic quasiperiodic Schrodinger operators. Key contributions include: (1) exact exponential decay rates for spectral gaps of the almost Mathieu operator, addressing a question raised by Goldstein; (2) sharp arithmetic Anderson localization for a class of quasiperiodic operators on higher-dimensional lattices, which in particular resolves and generalizes Jitomirskaya's phase transition conjecture; and (3) stratified growth patterns for extended eigenfunctions revealing universal partial hierarchical structures for subcritical quasiperiodic Schrodinger operators.
  The proofs are based on novel frameworks-structured quantitative almost reducibility and sharp quantitative duality-to overcome the longstanding challenge of taming infinitely many rotation-number resonances, which enables us to obtain optimal arithmetic reducibility results for analytic SL(2,R)-cocycles, thereby solving another Jitomirskaya's conjecture. These methods enable a first comprehensive treatment of resonance-driven dynamical asymptotics.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}_g$ be the moduli space of hyperbolic surfaces of genus $g$ endowed with the Weil-Petersson metric. We view the regularized determinant $\log \det(\Delta_{X})$ of Laplacian as a function on $\mathcal{M}_g$ and show that there exists a universal constant $E&gt;0$ such that as $g\to \infty$,
  (1) the expected value of $\left|\frac{\log \det(\Delta_{X})}{4\pi(g-1)}-E \right|$ over $\mathcal{M}_g$ has rate of decay $g^{-\delta}$ for some uniform constant $\delta \in (0,1)$;
  (2) the expected value of $\left|\frac{\log \det(\Delta_{X})}{4\pi(g-1)}\right|^\beta$ over $\mathcal{M}_g$ approaches to $E^\beta$ whenever $\beta \in [1,2)$.</description>

      <title>Regularized $\zeta_{\Delta}(1)$ for polyhedra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact polyhedral surface (a compact Riemann surface with flat conformal metric $\mathfrak{T}$ having conical singularities). The zeta-function $\zeta_\Delta(s)$ of the Friedrichs Laplacian on $X$ is meromorphic in ${\mathbb C}$ with only (simple) pole at $s=1$. We define ${\it reg\,}\zeta_\Delta(1)$ as $$\lim\limits_{s\to 1} \left( \zeta_\Delta(s)-\frac{ {\rm Area\,}(X,\mathfrak{T}) }{4\pi(s-1)}\right).$$ We derive an explicit expression for this spectral invariant through the holomorphic invariants of the Riemann surface $X$ and the (generalized) divisor of the conical points of the metric $\mathfrak{T}$. We study the asymptotics of ${\it reg\,}\zeta_\Delta(1)$ for the polyhedron obtained by sewing two other polyhedra along segments of small length. In addition, we calculate ${\it reg\,}\zeta(1)$ for a family of (non-Friedrichs) self-adjoint extensions of the Laplacian on the tetrahedron with all the conical angles equal to $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Fourier Dimension at $C^{1+\alpha}$ Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove power Fourier decay for equilibrium states of nonlinear $C^{1+\alpha}$ iterated function systems, giving first examples of truly $C^{1+\alpha}$ IFSs with attractors of positive Fourier dimension that are not conjugated to a linear IFS previously out of reach of existing techniques. The key new ingredient is a Measure Non-Linearity (MNL) criterion tailored to $C^{1+\alpha}$ IFSs, coupling oscillations in geometric and symbolic directions and allowing us to prove the necessary multiscale non-linearity condition for Fourier decay via an induction-on-scales scheme. This bypasses the classical obstructions that require either large dimension enabling stationary phase comparisons (Kaufman measures), or smoothness or cohomological conditions on the roof function $\tau$ such as $\tau \in C^1$ (Dolgopyat's method), $\tau \in C^\alpha$ but with smooth underlying dynamics (Tsujii--Zhang strategy), or non-flat $C^\alpha$ conjugacy to a constant (fractal van der Corput lemma). The method also applies to parabolic systems including limit sets of geometrically finite groups, Manneville-Pommeau maps, and Lorenz-type maps.</description>
