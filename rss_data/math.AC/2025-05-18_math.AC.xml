      <title>The weak normalization of an affine semigroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we define and explore the weak normalization of an affine semigroup. In particular, for a fixed prime integer, we provide a geometric description of the weak normalization of an affine semigroup with respect to that prime, which corresponds to the weak normalization of the affine semigroup ring over a field of that prime characteristic, similar to the description of the seminormalization of an affine semigroup given by Reid-Roberts. We then use this description to understand the singularities of an affine semigroup ring defined over a field of prime characteristic and provide several examples. In particular, we demonstrate that all affine semigroup rings defined over fields of prime characteristic have a uniform upper bound on the Frobenius test exponent of all ideals, which provides a large and important class of examples with a positive answer to a question of Katzman-Sharp on uniformity of Frobenius test exponents. Finally, we provide an algorithm and implementation to compute the weak normalization of an affine semigroup, as well as the Frobenius test exponent and Frobenius closures of ideals in the affine semigroup ring.</description>

      <title>Symmetric generalized numerical semigroups in $\mathbb{N}^d$ with embedding dimension $2d+1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we classify all symmetric generalized numerical semigroups in $\mathbb{N}^d$ of embedding dimension $2d+1$. Consequently, we show that in this case the property of being symmetric is equivalent to have a unique maximal gap with respect to natural partial order in $\mathbb{N}^d$. Moreover, we deduce that when $d&gt;1$, there does not exist any generalized numerical semigroup of embedding dimension $2d+1$, which is almost symmetric but not symmetric.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}^r$-graded rings and their canonical modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ``Cohen--Macaulay rings'' Bruns and Herzog define the graded canonical module for $\mathbb{Z}^r$-graded rings. We generalize the definition to multigradings and prove that the canonical module ``localizes''. As an application, we give a divisorial proof of the theorem of Danilov and Stanley on the canonical module of affine normal monoid rings. Along the way, we develop the basic theory of multigraded rings and modules.</description>

      <title>A Fr\"{o}berg type theorem for higher secant complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the celebrated Fr\"{o}berg's theorem to embedded joins of copies of a simplicial complex, namely higher secant complexes to the simplicial complex, in terms of property $N_{q+1,p}$ due to Green and Lazarsfeld. Furthermore, we investigate combinatorial phenomena parallel to geometric ones observed for higher secant varieties of minimal degree.</description>

      <title>Elasticity of Orders with Prime Conductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be an order in a number field whose conductor ideal $P := (R:\overline{R})$ is prime in the ring of integers $\overline{R}$. In this paper, we explore the factorization properties of such orders. Most notably, we give a complete characterization of the elasticity of $R$ in terms of its class group. We conclude with an application to the computation of class groups of certain orders.</description>

      <title>Simplicial Resolutions of the Quadratic Power of Monomial Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given any monomial ideal $ I $ minimally generated by $ q $ monomials, we define a simplicial complex $\mathbb{M}_q^2$ that supports a resolution of $ I^2 $. We also define a subcomplex $\mathbb{M}^2(I)$, which depends on the monomial generators of $I$ and also supports the resolution of $ I^2 $. As a byproduct, we obtain bounds on the projective dimension of the second power of any monomial ideal. We also establish bounds on the Betti numbers of $ I^2 $, which are significantly tighter than those determined by the Taylor resolution of $ I^2 $. Moreover, we introduce the permutation ideal $\mathcal{T}_q$ which is generated by $q$ monomials. For any monomial ideal $I$ with $q$ generators, we establish that $\beta(I^2) \leq \beta({\mathcal{T}_q}^2)$. We show that the simplicial complex $\mathbb{M}_q^2$ supports the minimal resolution of ${\mathcal{T}_q}^2$. In fact, $\mathbb{M}_q^2$ is the Scarf complex of ${\mathcal{T}_q}^2$.</description>

      <title>Some algebraic properties of ASM varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fulton's matrix Schubert varieties are affine varieties that arise in the study of Schubert calculus in the complete flag variety. Weigandt showed that arbitrary intersections of matrix Schubert varieties, now called ASM varieties, are indexed by alternating sign matrices (ASMs), objects with a long history in enumerative combinatorics. It is very difficult to assess Cohen-Macaulayness of ASM varieties or to compute their codimension, though these properties are well understood for matrix Schubert varieties due to work of Fulton. In this paper we study these properties of ASM varieties with a focus on the relationship between a pair of ASMs and their direct sum. We also consider ASM pattern avoidance from an algebro-geometric perspective.</description>
