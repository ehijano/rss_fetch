      <title>Constructing a bifunctional platform based on Mn2+-doped Mg2Y8(SiO4)6O2 phosphors for multi-parameter optical thermometry and manometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Series of the Mn2+-doped Mg2Y8(SiO4)6O2 phosphors were synthesized. Upon excitation at 408 nm, these phosphors exhibited intense orange emission originating from Mn2+, with concentration quenching observed beyond x = 0.07, and they also demonstrated excellent thermal stability. For optical thermometry, two independent parameters, emission band centroid ({\lambda}) and lifetime, were employed as thermal indicators, yielding sensitivities of d{\lambda}/dT = 0.053 nm K-1 and SR = 0.86% K-1, respectively. High-pressure in-situ X-ray diffraction revealed that the phosphors retained structural integrity under compression, accompanied by a progressive lattice contraction. With increasing pressure (0.13-10.89 GPa), a spectral red-shift was observed, corresponding to a pressure sensitivity of d{\lambda}/dp = 4.75 nm GPa-1. Additionally, pressure-dependent shifts in color coordinates allowed the development of a colorimetric manometric response, achieving a relative sensitivity of 3.27% GPa-1. Remarkably, the pressure-induced spectral shift of Mn2+ emission, characterized by low thermal cross-sensitivity, enabled a highly reliable ratiometric manometric strategy, with a relative sensitivity of 72% GPa-1. Notably, the system delivered the highest TIMF reported to date above 3 GPa, peaking at 1940 K GPa-1 at 7 GPa. These results position Mn2+-doped Mg2Y8(SiO4)6O2 phosphors as a highly promising bifunctional material for next-generation, multi-parameter optical sensing applications under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning discovery of molecular modulators for perovskite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of effective molecular modulators is essential for advancing perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the research process is hindered by the vastness of chemical space and the time-consuming and expensive trial-and-error experimental screening. Concurrently, machine learning (ML) offers significant potential for accelerating materials discovery. However, applying ML to PSCs remains a major challenge due to data scarcity and limitations of traditional quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models. Here, we apply a chemical informed transfer learning framework based on pre-trained deep neural networks, which achieves high accuracy in predicting the molecular modulator's effect on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. This framework is established through systematical benchmarking of diverse molecular representations, enabling lowcost and high-throughput virtual screening over 79,043 commercially available molecules. Furthermore, we leverage interpretability techniques to visualize the learned chemical representation and experimentally characterize the resulting modulator-perovskite interactions. The top molecular modulators identified by the framework are subsequently validated experimentally, delivering a remarkably improved champion PCE of 26.91% in PSCs.</description>

      <title>Interface-mediated softening and deformation mechanics in amorphous/ amorphous nanolaminates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfaces govern the unique mechanical response of amorphous multilayers. Here, we examine nanoindentation hardness and deformation behaviour of amorphous-amorphous Ta$_2$O$_5$/SiO$_2$ nanolaminates with bilayer thicknesses ranging from 2 nm to 334 nm. Whilst monolithic SiO$_2$ exhibits catastrophic failure through a single dominant shear band, multilayer architectures demonstrate varied deformation mechanisms. Hardness decreases with reduced bilayer thickness, from 7.7 GPa at 334 nm to 5.5 GPa at 2 nm spacing, contrasting with crystalline systems, which strengthen with decreasing spacing. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy reveals that fine bilayer spacings promote closely spaced vertical shear bands with bilayer compression, while coarser spacings show fewer, widely spaced shear bands with chemical intermixing. Scanning electron diffraction mapping demonstrates significant densification beneath indents. The high interface density facilitates strain accommodation that prevents catastrophic failure typical of brittle amorphous materials.</description>

      <title>Ambient-Induced Selenium Segregation and Nanoparticle Formation in 2H-HfSe2: An Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the air-induced degradation of few-layer hafnium diselenide (HfSe$_2$) through combined experimental and theoretical approaches. AFM and SEM reveal the formation of selenium-rich spherical features upon ambient exposure, while EDS confirms Se segregation. \textit{Ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations show that Se atoms migrate to flake edges and that O/O$_2$ exposure leads to selective Hf oxidation, breaking Se--Hf bonds and expelling Se atoms. No stable Se--O bonds are observed, indicating structural reorganization rather than oxidation. These findings emphasize the material's instability in air and the importance of encapsulation for preserving HfSe$_2$ in practical applications. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy confirms the semiconducting character of the nanoparticles, with an electronic bandgap compatible with that of elemental Se. These results highlight the critical role of lattice defects and oxidation dynamics in the degradation process and underscore the need for encapsulation strategies to preserve the integrity of HfSe$_2$-based devices.</description>

      <title>Temperature-driven polarization rotation and triclinic phase at morphotropic phase boundary of Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information about the crystal structures in the range of morphotropic phase boundary of ferroelectric perovskite solid solutions is important for understanding their intricate properties which result in wide opportunities for practical applications. However, for the (1-x)Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-xPbTiO3 solid solution system this information is contradictory. Different composition-temperature phase diagrams have been reported for this system in literature based on the investigations of single crystals and ceramics using various experimental techniques. In this work we apply polarized light microscopy (PLM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and dielectric spectroscopy to study the crystal structure and phase transitions in the 0.68Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.32PbTiO3 single crystal. We confirm the monoclinic MB symmetry (space group Cm) of the room-temperature phase. According to PLM, it transforms with increasing temperature into a triclinic (Tr) phase rather than the previously reported monoclinic MC or tetragonal phase. XRD data are consistent with the presence of Tr phase. The Tr phase transforms to the monoclinic MC (Pm) phase and then to the cubic phase. Ergodic relaxor behavior is observed above the Curie temperature. The unit cell in the MC phase is pseudotetragonal with the lattice parameters a = b &lt; c and small monoclinic angle. In the MB phase the direction of spontaneous polarization is temperature independent and close to the &lt;111&gt; pseudocubic direction. In the Tr and MC phases it changes with temperature so that near the Curie point it is close to [001] axis. No significant anomalies in the dielectric properties or changes in the domain structure are observed at the MB to Tr and Tr to MC phase transitions. The domain structure changes dramatically when the temperature varies within the Tr phase, causing a sharp change in birefringence.</description>

      <title>Impact of Oxygen Plasma Surface Treatment on Photoresist Adhesion in BaTiO3-Based Photonic Device Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxygen-plasma pre-cleans are routine before fabrication, but on BaTiO3 thin films we observed catastrophic photoresist lift-off during mild rinsing and sonication. To explain the failure, we combined optical microscopy, EDS, and XPS. EDS showed no meaningful bulk stoichiometry change, whereas XPS revealed a nanometer-scale, plasma-induced shift in surface chemistry: hydroxylation and carbonate formation consistent with a BaCO3-rich interphase at the resist/BaTiO3 boundary. This chemically weak interphase, recreated upon each plasma step and removable by simple solvent cleaning, provides the mechanism for delamination. The key takeaway for practitioners is process guidance: avoid uncritical O2-plasma use on BTO; if cleaning is required, use alternative chemistries (e.g., UV-ozone) or carefully tuned plasma windows that preserve adhesion. More broadly, the study illustrates how lightweight analytics at the surface (correlative microscopy + surface spectroscopy) can pinpoint the root cause of yield-limiting defects in oxide photonics and translate directly into higher-reliability process recipes.</description>

      <title>Narrow magneto-optical transitions in Erbium implanted silicon carbide-on-insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid state spin photon interfaces operating in the near telecom and telecom bands are a key resource for long distance quantum communication and scalable quantum networks. However, their optical transitions often suffer from spectral diffusion that hampers the generation of coherent spin photon entanglement. Here we demonstrate narrow magneto-optical transitions of erbium dopants implanted into thin film silicon carbide (SiC)-on-insulator, a viable platform for industrially scalable quantum networks. Using high-resolution resonant spectroscopy and spectral hole burning at cryogenic temperatures, we reveal sub megahertz homogeneous linewidths and identify two lattice sites that best stabilise the emitters. We further characterise their optical lifetimes and magneto-optical response, establishing erbium doped SiC-on-insulator as a robust and scalable platform for on-chip quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Elastic and Strain--Tunable Electronic and Optical Properties of La2AlGaO6 Hybrid Perovskite: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite materials, known for their structural versatility and multifunctional properties, continue to draw interest for advanced electronic and optoelectronic applications. In this study, we investigate the elastic and strain--engineered mechanical, electronic properties and optical properties of the orthorhombic La2AlGaO6 (LAGO) hybrid perovskite using first--principles quantum mechanical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Structural optimizations were performed using both the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The mechanical stability of LAGO was confirmed through the Born--Huang criteria, and key elastic constants (C11, C12, C33, C44, and C66) were evaluated. These constants were further used to derive mechanical parameters such as Young's modulus, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Poisson's ratio, Cauchy's pressure, and anisotropic factor, offering insights into the material's ductility, hardness, and elastic anisotropy. Crucially, we explored the influence of biaxial strain on the electronic band structure, DOS/PDOS, and Fermi energy, revealing significant band gap modulation under compressive and tensile strain, and hence, varying the optical properties. The coupling between elastic response and electronic structure highlights LAGO's potential for tunable device applications, where mechanical stimuli can be employed to tailor its electronic functionality.</description>

      <title>Improved treatment of relativistic effects in linear augmented plane wave (LAPW) method: application to Ac, Th, ThO2 and UO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the influence of the relativistic effects within the linear augmented plane wave method (LAPW) with the potential of general shape for solids and suggest a few ways to account them more accurately: (1) we introduce new radial wave functions based on two actual radial solutions of the Dirac equation for j=l-1/2 and j=l+1/2 one-electron states; (2) the canonical LAPW matrix elements for the spherically symmetric component of the potential, assuming non-relativistic radial wave functions, should be corrected; (3) we argue that for a realistic spin-orbit energy splitting of the semicore 6p-states the spin-orbit interaction constant zeta(p) should be calculated with the 6p3/2 radial component; (4) in cases when two j=l +/- 1/2 components are occupied (for example for the 6p states of actinides) the electron density, associated with the small components of valence electrons, can be taken into the calculation scheme. We demonstrate that the new treatment for the relativistic effects is capable to change the equilibrium lattice constant up to 0.15~{\AA} and the bulk modulus up to 26 GPa. We find that the electron density of valence electrons at the nucleus increases by 2.3-4.3 times due to the inclusion of small components, which can be essential for precise description of the potential and density close to the nuclear region, important for nuclear spectroscopies. In contrast to the common believe that in plain band structure treatment UO2 is a metal, we show that in the presence of the spin-orbit coupling UO2 has a small gap of forbidden states (0.2-0.4 eV) at the Fermi level, where the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied $5f$ bands slightly overlap, as in calculations of the conduction and valence band in solid Ge.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Roughness of Freestanding Oxide Membranes Revealed by Electron Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Freestanding oxide films offer significant potential for integrating exotic quantum functionalities with semiconductor technologies. However, their performance is critically limited by surface roughness and interfacial imperfection caused by dangling bonds, which disrupt coherent interactions and suppress quantum phenomena at heterointerfaces. To address the challenge of structural characterization of surfaces and interfaces, we develop a metrological approach achieving atomic-scale precision in mapping the topography of both free surfaces and buried interfaces within ultrathin oxide heterostructures leveraging three-dimensional structures reconstructed from multislice electron ptychography. This method also allows for counting the number of atoms, even including light elements such as oxygen, along the electron trajectory in electron microscopy, leading to the identification of surface termination in oxide films. The planar-view of measurement geometry, allowing for large field-of-view imaging, provides remarkably rich information and high statistics about the atomic-scale structural inhomogeneities in freestanding membranes. This quantitative analysis provides unprecedented capabilities for correlating structural imperfection with quantum device performance, offering critical insights for engineering robust heterointerfaces in next-generation oxide electronics.</description>

      <title>Applicability of Electrical Conductivity Ratio Method to Complicated Band Structure and the Carrier Scattering Mechanisms of SnSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrical conductivity ratio (ECR) method can be used to analyze carrier scattering mechanism (CSM) without the need of magenetic transport measurements. In this work, the applicability of the ECR method in the analysis of complex energy band structures is discussed. Combined with the thermoelectric properties of SnSe, the feasibility using ECR method of ideal single band transport model to study the CSM of semiconductor materials with complicated band structure is studied. The results indicate that ECR method is not only applicable to idea band structure as reported before but also to the complicated band structure. The analysis results of the CSM of single crystal SnSe by ECR method using ideal single-band model agree with the carrier mobility temperature dependence in the nonphase transition temperature range. The CSM along three direction of single crystal SnSe are different because of its anisotropic crystal structure. The difference between dislocation scattering (DS) and charged impurity scattering (CIS) is that DS is always accompanied by polar optical phonon scattering (POP), such as the CSM of SnSe along b axis direction. The difference between CIS and DS can be more easily distinguished by the ECR method than the carrier mobility temperature dependent method. DS and POP might be one of the approaches to improve thermoelectric property because the scattering factor for DS or POP is larger than that of acoustic phonon scattering (APS) and alloy scattering (AS). For polycrystalline SnSe, the carrier scattering mechanisms varies with the crystal structure and the temperature. This indicates that the ECR method can better reflect the variation of carrier scattering mechanisms with temperature compared to the carrier mobility temperature dependence method.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism and Anomalous Transport in Ag$^{2+}$ Fluorides: KAgF$_3$ and K$_2$AgF$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compounds containing Ag$^{2+}$ ion with 4d$^9$ configuration will cause significant Jahn-Teller distortions and orbital ordering. Such orbital order is closely related to the magnetic coupling, according to Goodenough-Kanamori Ruels. Our first-principles calculations reveal that the ground state of KAgF$_3$ exhibits collinear A-type antiferromagnetic (A-AFM) ordering accompanied by C-type orbital ordering. In contrast, K$_2$AgF$_4$ adopts a collinear intralayer antiferromagnetic configuration coupled with ferromagnetic orbital ordering. The A-AFM KAgF$_3$ presents distinct altermagnetic responses, including: (i) prominent anomalous transport effects, such as anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC), anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC), and thermal anomalous Hall conductivity (TAHC); and (ii) strong magneto-optical responses, manifested through pronounced Kerr and Faraday effects. On the other hand, K$_2$AgF$_4$ behaves as a conventional collinear antiferromagnet preserving $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, hence precluding the emergence of an anomalous Hall response.</description>

      <title>The correspondence theory: How supercompatibility conditions, transformations twins, and austenite-martensite interfaces are determined directly from correspondence, metrics and symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenological theory of martensite crystallography (PTMC) explains the main crystallographic and microstructural features of martensite in shape memory alloys, such as the transformation twins between the martensite variants, and the interfaces between austenite and martensite bi-variant laminates. It also permits to determine which austenite and martensite lattice parameters should be targeted to get supercompatibility, which has driven over the last decades important research and development of new shape memory alloys with low hysteresis and high cyclability. First, we show that the cofactor conditions generally used to define supercompatibility are not necessary because they are redundant with the invariant plane condition. Second, we develop an alternative to the PTMC, called correspondence theory (CT). The mathematical tools of the PTMC come from continuum mechanics (pole decompositions and stretch tensors); they are advantageously replaced here by pure crystallographic tools (metric tensors, group of symmetries and correspondence), which allow direct calculations of the transformation twins and their generic and non-generic characters. A new symmetric matrix, called compatibility of metrics by correspondence (CMC) is also introduced. The supercompatibility condition can now be understood and written as the degeneracy of a quadratic form of the CMC, or geometrically as the degeneracy of double-cone into a double-plane, a plane, or the full space. We also show that for usual martensitic transformations, the different types of habit planes formed by bi-variant laminates can be determined from the CMC matrix, in a more rigorous and efficient way than that proposed by the PTMC. The CT does not differ from the PTMC in its foundations, but is represents a good alternative to understand and calculate the crystallographic properties of martensite in shape memory alloys.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity-driven altermagnetism in two-dimensional van der Waals multiferroics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs) are a recently identified class of unconventional collinear compensated antiferromagnets that exhibit momentum-dependent spin splitting despite having zero net magnetization. This unconventional magnetic order gives rise to a range of phenomena, including the anomalous Hall effect, chiral magnons, and nonlinear photocurrents. Here, using spin space group (SSG) symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate an efficient strategy to control altermagnetism in two-dimensional multiferroics through ferroelectric polarization and interlayer sliding. For material realization, we find that monolayer and bilayer FeCuP2S6 exhibit finite spin splitting when ferroelectric sublattices are connected by nonsymmorphic screw-axis operations rather than pure translation or inversion symmetry. Interlayer sliding further enables reversible switching or suppression of spin splitting through modifications of the SSG. Our calculations further reveal that the anomalous Hall response serves as a direct probe of these spin-split states. These findings establish two-dimensional van der Waals multiferroics as promising platforms for realizing electrically controllable altermagnetism and advancing next-generation spintronic and magnetoelectric technologies.</description>

      <title>The stability and topological behaviors in lanthanide antiperovskite nitrides: a high-throughput study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiperovskite (APV) nitrides exhibit a diverse range of electronic properties, including superconductivity, magnetic effects, and nontrivial topological behaviors. In this study, we propose a new family of APV nitrides by incorporating 4$f$-electron metals, known for strong electron correlations, localized magnetic moments, and spin-orbit coupling, to further explore the unique properties of APVs. A high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculation was utilized to identify stable lanthanide APV nitride compounds. To address the challenge of strong electron correlation, we developed a double-screening framework that assumes either a fully itinerant or localized nature of the $f$-electrons during calculations. Using this approach, we systematically identified 37 stable lanthanide APV nitride compounds from both thermodynamic and dynamical perspectives. Furthermore, we report nontrivial topological behaviors observed among these stable lanthanide APV nitride compounds, as computed by DFT. Notably, Dirac and semi-Dirac cones are observed near the Fermi level for Er$_3$TlN. This study opens a pathway to investigate lanthanide APVs, revealing potential novel physical properties by leveraging the rich physics of both APVs and $f$-electrons.</description>

      <title>A CN complex as an alternative to the T center in Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first-principles study of a carbon-nitrogen (CN) impurity complex in silicon as an isoelectronic alternative to the T center [(CCH)$_\mathrm{Si}$]. The latter has been pursued for applications in quantum information science, yet its sensitivity to the presence of hydrogen is still problematic. Our proposed complex has no hydrogen, thereby eliminating this issue. First, we show that the CN complex is stable against decomposition into substitutional and interstitial defects. Next, we show that due to being isoelectronic to the T center, the CN complex has a similar electronic structure, and therefore could be used in similar applications. We assess several low-energy configurations of the CN complex, finding (CN)$_\mathrm{Si}$ to be stable and have the largest Debye-Waller factor. We predict a zero-phonon line (ZPL) of 828 meV (in the telecom S-band) and a radiative lifetime of 4.2 $\mu$s, comparable to the T center. Due to the presence of a bound exciton, choice of the exchange-correlation functional and also supercell-size scaling of the ZPL and transition dipole moment require special scrutiny; we rigorously justify our extrapolation schemes that allow computing values in the dilute limit.</description>

      <title>Characterising Atomic-Scale Surface Disorder on 2D Materials Using Neutral Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS2, have the potential to be widely used in electronic devices and sensors due to their high carrier mobility and tunable band structure. In 2D TMD devices, surface and interface cleanness can critically impact the performance and reproducibility. Even sample surfaces prepared under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) can be contaminated, causing disorder. On such samples, trace levels of submonolayer contamination remain largely overlooked, and conventional surface characterisation techniques have limited capability in detecting such adsorbates. Here, we apply scanning helium microscopy (SHeM), a non-destructive and ultra-sensitive technique, to investigate the surface cleanness of 2D MoS2. Our measurements reveal that even minute amounts of adventitious carbon induce atomic-scale disorder across MoS2 surfaces, leading to the disappearance of helium diffraction. By tracking helium reflectivity over time, we quantify the decay of surface order across different microscopic regions and find that flat areas are more susceptible to contamination than regions near edges. These findings highlight the fragility of surface order in 2D materials, even under UHV, and establish SHeM as a powerful tool for non-damaging microscopic 2D material cleanness characterisation. The approach offers a new route to wafer-scale characterisation of 2D material quality.</description>

      <title>Gate Dielectric Engineering with an Ultrathin Silicon-oxide Interfacial Dipole Layer for Low-Leakage Oxide-Semiconductor Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a gate dielectric engineering approach leveraging an ultrathin, atomic layer deposited (ALD) silicon oxide interfacial layer (SiL) between the amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) channel and the high-k gate dielectric. SiL positively shifts the threshold voltage (V$_T$) of AOS transistors, providing at least four distinct $V_T$ levels with a maximum increase of 500 mV. It achieves stable $V_T$ control without significantly degrading critical device parameters such as mobility, on-state current, all while keeping the process temperature below 225 $^{\circ}$C and requiring no additional heat treatment to activate the dipole. Positive-bias temperature instability tests at 85 $^{\circ}$C indicate a significant reduction in negative $V_{T}$ shifts for SiL-integrated devices, highlighting enhanced reliability. Incorporating this SiL gate stack into two-transistor gain-cell (GC) memory maintains a more stable storage node voltage ($V_{SN}$) (reduces $V_{SN}$ drop by 67\%), by limiting unwanted charge losses. SiL-engineered GCs also reach retention times up to 10,000 s at room temperature and reduce standby leakage current by three orders of magnitude relative to baseline device, substantially lowering refresh energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Validation of Semi-Empirical xTB Methods for High-Throughput Screening of TADF Emitters: A 747-Molecule Benchmark Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters are essential for next-generation, high-efficiency organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), yet their rational design is hampered by the high computational cost of accurate excited-state predictions. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark study validating semi-empirical extended tight-binding (xTB) methods -- specifically sTDA-xTB and sTD-DFT-xTB -- for the high-throughput screening of TADF materials. Using an unprecedentedly large dataset of \num{747} experimentally characterized emitters, our framework demonstrates a computational cost reduction of over \qty{99}{\percent} compared to conventional TD-DFT, while maintaining strong internal consistency between methods (Pearson $r \approx \num{0.82}$ for \deltaest), validating their utility for relative molecular ranking. Validation against \num{312} experimental \deltaest values reveals a mean absolute error of approximately \qty{0.17}{\electronvolt}, a discrepancy attributed to the vertical approximation inherent to the HTS protocol, underscoring the methods' role in screening rather than quantitative prediction. Through large-scale data analysis, we statistically validate key design principles, confirming the superior performance of Donor-Acceptor-Donor (D-A-D) architectures and identifying an optimal D-A torsional angle range of \qtyrange{50}{90}{\degree} for efficient TADF. Principal Component Analysis reveals that the complex property space is fundamentally low-dimensional, with three components capturing nearly \qty{90}{\percent} of the variance. This work establishes these semi-empirical methods as powerful, cost-effective tools for accelerating TADF discovery and provides a robust set of data-driven design rules and methodological guidelines for the computational materials science community.</description>

      <title>Polaronic-Distortion-Driven Enhancement of Excitonic Auger Recombination in ZnO Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface effect and quantum confinement render nanomaterials the optoelectronic properties more susceptible to nonradiative processes than their bulk counterparts. These nonradiative processes usually contain a series of interwoven and competing sub-processes, which are challenging to disentangle. Here, we investigate the structural origin of Auger recombination in ZnO nanoparticles using transient absorption spectroscopy and ultrafast electron diffraction. The photogenerated hot holes are captured by oxygen vacancies through an Auger mechanism, inducing significant local structural distortions around the oxygen vacancy and its neighboring zinc tetrahedron on a sub-picosecond timescale. The recombination of trapped holes accelerates the lattice thermalization and stabilizes the formed small hole polarons. Subsequently, the recombination of localized polarons forms a confined exciton-polaron complex that may account for the long-lived (&gt;7 ns) visible luminescence observed in ZnO nanoparticles. Our findings are potentially applicable to other transition metal oxide nanomaterials, bringing insights for the optimization of their functional properties.</description>

      <title>Domain Morphology, Electrocaloric Response, and Negative Capacitance States of Ferroelectric Nanowires Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed the domain morphology, electrocaloric response, and negative capacitance states in a one-dimensional array of uniformly oriented, radial symmetric ferroelectric nanowires, whose spontaneous polarization is normal to their symmetry axis. The wires are densely packed between flat electrodes. Using finite element modeling based on the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach, electrostatics, and elasticity theory, we calculated the distributions of spontaneous polarization, domain structures, electric potential, electric field, dielectric permittivity, and electrocaloric response in the nanowires. Due to size and depolarization effects, the paraelectric and ferroelectric (poly-domain or single-domain) states of the wires can be stable, depending on their radius and the dielectric permittivity of the surrounding medium. It is demonstrated that dipole-dipole interaction between the nanowires determines the stability of the polar (or anti-polar) state in the array when the wire radius is significantly smaller than the critical size of the paraelectric transition in an isolated wire. We reveal that a large region of a mixed state, characterized by poly-domain ferroelectric states with nonzero average polarization inside each wire and zero average polarization of the whole array, can be stable. By selecting the dielectric permittivity of the surrounding medium and the nanowire radius, one can maximize the negative capacitance effect in the capacitor with densely packed wires. It is also possible to achieve maximal enhancement of the electrocaloric response due to size effects in the wires. The underlying physics of the predicted enhancement is the combined action of size effects and the long-range electrostatic interactions between the ferroelectric dipoles in the nanowires and the image charges in the electrodes</description>

      <title>Exposing Altermagnetism through Momentum Density Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials which show a strong time-reversal symmetry-breaking response leading to spin-polarization phenomena, in conjunction with antiparallel magnetic alignments producing zero net magnetization, have recently been identified, classified, and been given the name 'altermagnets'. However, measuring and diagnosing possible candidates as altermagnetics still remains a challenge. From the uncertainty of the material being an altermagnet, additional experimental probes are essential to resolve this. Here, we propose using spin-dependent and magnetic momentum density probes such as spin-polarised positron annihilation and revisiting magnetic Compton scattering. By looking at the previously claimed altermagnetic candidates RuO2, CrSb and MnTe, we present theoretical altermagnetic calculations of the experimental quantities measured by these probes. We show that these quantities should produce a measurable signal and unequivocally confirm the altermagnetic state. We also highlight the additional benefits from these probes such as extracting spin-resolved Fermi surfaces which are key for further understanding the nature of the altermagnetic state.</description>

      <title>Machine learning descriptors for predicting the high temperature oxidation of refractory complex concentrated alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refractory Complex Concentrated Alloys (RCCAs) can exhibit exceptional high-temperature strength, making such alloys promising candidates for high-temperature structural applications. However, current RCCAs do not possess the high-temperature oxidation resistance required to survive in oxidizing environments for more than a few hours at or above 1000$^\circ$C, without relying primarily on an environmental barrier coating. Here, we present a machine-learning framework designed to predict the oxidation-induced specific mass changes of RCCAs exposed for 24 h at 1000$^\circ$C in air, in order to support the search for oxidation-resistant alloys over a wide range of compositions. A database was constructed of experimental specific mass change data, upon oxidation at 900-1000$^\circ$C for 24 h in air, for 77 compositions comprised of simple elements, binary alloys, and higher-order elemental systems. We then developed a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with physics-informed descriptors based on oxidation products, capturing the fundamental chemistry of oxide formation and stability. Application of this GPR model to the database yielded a MAE (mean absolute error) test score of 5.78 mg/cm$^2$, which was a significant improvement in accuracy relative to models only utilizing traditional alloy-based descriptors. Our model was used to screen over 5,100 quaternary RCCAs, revealing compositions with significantly lower predicted specific mass changes compared to existing literature sources. Overall, this work establishes a versatile and efficient strategy to accelerate the discovery of next-generation RCCAs with enhanced resistance to extreme environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge carrier dynamics critically affect the efficiency and stability of organic photovoltaic devices, but they are challenging to model with traditional analytical methods. We introduce \b{eta}-Linearly Decoded Latent Ordinary Differential Equations (\b{eta}-LLODE), a machine learning framework that disentangles and reconstructs extraction dynamics from time-resolved charge extraction measurements of P3HT:PCBM cells. This model enables the isolated analysis of the underlying charge carrier behaviour, which was found to be well described by a compressed exponential decay. Furthermore, the learnt interpretable latent space enables simulation, including both interpolation and extrapolation of experimental measurement conditions, offering a predictive tool for solar cell research to support device study and optimisation.</description>

      <title>Outstanding figure of merit at high temperature for DFT-based predicted double perovskite oxides, Ba2GaXO6 (X = V, Nb, Ta)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials with a high figure of merit (ZT) are highly demanded for a sustainable solution to the energy crisis. In this study, we have predicted three new double perovskite oxides (DPOs), Ba2GaXO6 (X = V, Nb, Ta), with high ZT values using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and investigated their structural, electronic, thermoelectric, and mechanical properties. The electronic properties, such as electronic band structure, density of states (DOS), and charge density mapping, are used to disclose the conductive nature, chemical bonding within these compounds, which exhibit direct band gaps of 0.924, 2.354, and 3.279 eV for Ba2GaVO6, Ba2GaNbO6, and Ba2GaTaO6, respectively, as calculated using the TB mBJ potential. The thermoelectric performance of the new DPOs, Ba2GaXO6 (X = V, Nb, Ta), was assessed using the BoltzTrap2 code, which yielded outstanding ZT values of 2.36, 1.78, and 1.91 at 1500 K for Ba2GaVO6, Ba2GaNbO6, and Ba2GaTaO6, respectively, indicating their potential for waste heat management. The high ZT values are attributed to an ultra low lattice thermal conductivity, arising from strong scattering of acoustic and optical phonon modes. The changes in thermoelectric parameters with temperature were analyzed and explained.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling between coherent ferrons and cavity acoustic phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent ferrons, the quanta of polarization waves, can potentially be hybridized with many other quasiparticles for achieving novel control modalities in quantum communication, computing, and sensing. Here, we theoretically demonstrate a new hybridized state resulting from the strong coupling between fundamental-mode (wavenumber is zero) coherent ferrons and cavity bulk acoustic phonons. Using a van der Waals ferroelectric CuInP2S6 membrane as an example, we predict an ultra-strong ferron-phonon coupling at room temperature, where the coupling strength g_c reaches over 10% of the resonant frequency {\omega}_0. We also predict an in-situ electric-field-driven bistable control of mode-specific ferron-phonon hybridization via ferroelectric switching. We further show that, CuInP2S6 allows for reaching the fundamentally intriguing but challenging deep strong coupling regime (i.e., g_c/{\omega}_0&gt;1) near the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition. Our findings establish the theoretical basis for exploiting coherent ferrons as a new contender for hybrid quantum system with strong and highly tunable coherent coupling.</description>

      <title>Modulation of Quantum Transport in Complex Oxide Heterostructures with Proton Implantation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interfacial electronic properties of complex oxides are governed by a delicate balance between charge transfer, lattice distortions, and electronic correlations, posing a key challenge for controlled tunability in materials research. Here, we demonstrate that proton implantation serves as a precise tool for modulating interfacial transport in SrTiO3-based heterostructures. By introducing protons into the SrTiO3 substrate beneath an amorphous (La,Sr)(Al,Ta)O3 capping layer, we uncover a competition between disorder and charge doping induced by implantation. At low implantation fluences below 1x1015 protons/cm2 (1E15), charge doping dominates, leading to an increase in carrier density and mobility, analogous to electrostatic gating effect. This enables the emergence of quantum transport oscillations at low temperature. Conversely, at higher fluences (above 1E15), disorder scattering prevails, suppressing carrier mobility and inducing an insulating state. The nonmonotonic evolution of transport with implantation fluence underscores the critical interplay between electronic correlations and disorder, offering a new paradigm for the controlled engineering of interfacial quantum states in SrTiO3-based oxide heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Orbital magnetization in the Nb-substituted Kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study uses angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to examine the low-temperature electronic structure of Cs(V$_{0.95}$Nb$_{0.05}$)$_3$Sb$_5$, demonstrating that partially substituting V atoms with isoelectronic Nb atoms results in \blue{an increase of the band width} and enhanced gap opening at the Dirac-like crossings due to the resulting chemical pressure. This increases the magnetic circular dichroism signal in the angular distribution (MCDAD) compared to CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, enabling detailed analysis of magnetic circular dichroism in several bands near the Fermi level. These results \blue{substantiate} the predicted coupling of orbital magnetic moments to three van Hove singularities near the Fermi level at M points. Previous studies have observed that Nb doping \blue{lowers the charge density transition temperature} and increases the critical temperature for superconductivity. This article demonstrates that Nb doping concomitantly increases the magnetic circular dichroism signal attributed to orbital moments.</description>

      <title>Switchable Polarization in an A-site Deficient Perovskite through Vacancy and Cation Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While defects are unavoidable in crystals and often detrimental to material performance, they can be a key ingredient for inducing functionalities when tailored. Here, we demonstrate that an A-site-deficient perovskite Y$_{1/3}$TaO$_3$ exhibits room-temperature ferroelectricity in a $Pb2_1m$ phase, enabled by ordered vacancies coupled with TaO$_6$ octahedral rotations. Defect-ordered perovskites are frequently trapped in centrosymmetric incommensurate states due to competing structural instabilities; we circumvent this by favoring rotational over polar instability through compositional selection. Unlike canonical improper ferroelectrics that are \textit{ferrielectric}, the vanishing dipoles on vacancy layers in Y$_{1/3}$TaO$_3$ allow for a net ferroelectric alignment of local dipoles, resulting in enhanced polarization. Upon heating, Y$_{1/3}$TaO$_3$ transforms to a paraelectric incommensurate phase at $\simeq$750 K, whose atomic arrangement mirrors the domain topology observed in hybrid improper ferroelectrics. Superspace analysis of the modulated phase reveals a route to improve room-temperature polarization, achieved through epitaxial strain, as confirmed by our lattice-dynamics calculations. This defect-ordering strategy should be generalizable to other improper ferroelectrics, including magnetoelectric multiferroics, providing a pathway to amplify otherwise limited macroscopic polarization.</description>

      <title>Intertwined Hyperferroelectricity, Tunable Multiple Topological Phases and Giant Rashba Effect in Wurtzite LiZnAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composite quantum compounds offer a fertile ground for uncovering the complex interrelations between seemingly distinct phenomena in condensed matter physics for advanced nonvolatile and spintronics applications. Beyond topological superconductors and axion insulators, the idea of intertwined Hyperferroelectricity (HyFE), multiple topological phases and Rashba spin-splitting with reversible spin textures represents the local, global and symmetry-driven characteristics of quantum materials, respectively, offering unique pathways for enhanced functionalities. We unveiled a unified framework to achieve this synergy through the presence of crystalline symmetries and spin-orbit coupling in LiZnAs compound using first-principles calculations. HyFE exhibits ability to maintain spontaneous polarization under open-circuit boundary conditions, even with existence of depolarization field while Rashba effect exhibits paradigmatic spin texture in momentum space with tangential vector field. The presence of unstable $A_{2u}(LO)$ mode leads to free energy minimum with significant well depth and polarization of -66 meV and $P_{HyFE} = 0.282~C/m^2$, respectively indicating stable HyFE. The robust HyFE stem from mode-specific effective charges and larger high-frequency dielectric constants. This study also addresses the subtle question of whether critical point of topological phase transition shifts in response to drastically different Rashba spin-splitting values obtained from VASP and WIEN2k. Moreover, biaxial strain (BAS) induced Weyl semimetal (at 3.4% BAS) and topological insulating phase (after 3.4% BAS) is observed with giant Rashba coefficient of 5.91 eV {\AA} and 2.42 eV {\AA}, respectively. Furthermore, switching of bulk polarization leads to spin texture reversal, providing a robust mechanism to leverage spin degrees of freedom in these Hyperferroelectric Rashba topological materials.</description>

      <title>Low-field magnetization processes of hexagonal easy-plane altermagnet $\alpha$-MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single crystals of $\alpha$-MnTe were synthesized by chemical vapor transport using iodine as the transport reagent. Structural characterization by powder x-ray diffraction confirmed the hexagonal structure (space group P6$_{3}$/mmc). Magnetization $M(T)$ and specific heat $C_p(T)$ measurements revealed an antiferromagnetic phase transition at $T_N \approx307$ K. The magnetic entropy derived from the $C_p(T)$ data is consistent with the $S = 5/2$ spin state of Mn$^{2+}$ ions. Angle- and field-dependent magnetization measurements indicate complex magnetic responses associated with domains, and show an anomaly around 1 T. These features are analyzed using a phenomenological micromagnetic model that includes higher-order anisotropic exchange interactions coupling the weak ferromagnetic component and the antiferromagnetic order parameter. The model captures the generic behavior of magnetic states and demonstrates that the observed uniaxial and unidirectional anisotropies arise from metastable domain configurations and irreversible magnetization processes.</description>

      <title>Raman Spectroscopy Insights into the Reorientational Dynamics of Polyanions in Solid Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between cation diffusion and polyanion rotational dynamics has garnered significant attention, yet characterizing the rotational dynamics of polyanions remains challenging. Previous studies have primarily relied on complex techniques such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering. In this work, we use ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy to investigate the reorientational dynamics of the NO2- polyanion in Na3ONO2 and NaNO2. Our findings reveal distinct reorientational behaviors and establish a clear correlation between molecular reorientation and Raman spectral features in polyanion-based solid electrolytes. AIMD simulations show that NO2- rotates easily in Na3ONO2, while its rotational dynamics are hindered in NaNO2. Raman spectroscopy confirms these results, with temperature-dependent shifts in the internal vibrational modes of the polyanion. In Na3ONO2, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of these modes increases with temperature, while NaNO2 exhibits a constant FWHM until a significant jump at the ordered-disordered phase transition. These insights enhance our understanding of polyanion reorientation and offer a framework for characterizing similar dynamics in other solid electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Pd/Cu single atom alloys for catalysis: from single crystalline to nanostructured model systems for highly selective butanol dehydrogenation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous catalysts based on Single Atom Alloys (SAA) play a significant role in numerous technical processes. The fundamental working principles of these systems, however, remain poorly understood, especially the aspects related to the nanoscopic nature of bimetallic particles and the associated structure-reactivity relationships. In this study, we developed for the first time well-defined SAA catalysts consisting of Pd atomically dispersed in Cu nanoparticles prepared under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions on model Al2O3/NiAl(110) support. Employing a unique combination of surface sensitive techniques - scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS), molecular beams - and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we performed detailed structural characterization of these systems at the microscopic level. We demonstrate that Pd disperses atomically in Cu nanoparticles and becomes partly negatively charged. Importantly, these Pd/Cu nanostructured systems show an outstanding catalytic performance in selective dehydrogenation of butanol and exhibit 100 % selectivity toward butanal over a broad range of Pd loadings - the property that cannot be reproduced employing simplified single crystalline Pd/Cu(111) counterparts. The developed approach for preparation and characterization of these nanostructured SAA-catalysts lays a foundation for further fundamental-level catalytic studies on this important class of materials and their rational design for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Automated Workflow for Non-Empirical Wannier-Localized Optimal Tuning of Range-Separated Hybrid Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an automated workflow for generating non-empirical Wannier-localized optimally-tuned screened range-separated hybrid (WOT-SRSH) functionals. WOT-SRSH functionals have been shown to yield highly accurate fundamental band gaps, band structures, and optical spectra for bulk and 2D semiconductors and insulators. Our workflow automatically and efficiently determines the WOT-SRSH functional parameters for a given crystal structure and composition, approximately enforcing the correct screened long-range Coulomb interaction and an ionization potential ansatz. In contrast to previous manual tuning approaches, our tuning procedure relies on a new search algorithm that only requires a few hybrid functional calculations with minimal user input. We demonstrate our workflow on 23 previously studied semiconductors and insulators, reporting the same high level of accuracy. By automating the tuning process and improving its computational efficiency, the approach outlined here enables applications of the WOT-SRSH functional to compute spectroscopic and optoelectronic properties for a wide range of materials.</description>

      <title>Toward Spectroscopic Accuracy in Quantum Dynamics Simulations with Fourth-Generation High-Dimensional Committee Neural Network Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive simulation of vibrational spectra of complex condensed phases and interfaces with thousands of degrees of freedom has long been a challenging task of modern condensed matter theory. In this work, fourth-generation high-dimensional committee neural network potentials (4G-HDCNNPs) are developed for the first time, using active learning and query-by-committee, and introduced to the essential nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) as well as conformational entropy and anharmonicities from path integral (PI) molecular dynamics simulations. Using representative bulk water and air-water interface systems, we demonstrate the accuracy of the developed framework in infrared and vibrational sum frequency generation spectral simulations. Specifically, by seamlessly integrating non-local charge transfer interactions from 4G-HDCNNPs with the NQEs from PI methods, our introduced methodology yields accurate infrared spectra using predicted charges from the 4G-HDCNNP architecture without explicit training of dipole moments. Our vibrational sum frequency generation spectra also illustrate high accuracy for the considered air-water interface system. The introduced framework in this work is general and offers a benchmark tool and a simple, practical paradigm for predictive spectral simulations of complex condensed phases and interfaces, free from empirical parameterizations and/or ad hoc fittings.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Nonlinear Planar Thermal Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the intrinsic nonlinear planar thermal Hall effect (NPTHE)-- a dissipationless thermal response proportional to $(\nabla T)^2B$, which arises when the temperature gradient $\nabla T$ and magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ lie within the same plane. The effect originates from a thermal gradient induced correction to the Berry curvature, characterized by the thermal Berry connection polarizability (TBCP) tensor, leading to a nonlinear transverse heat current independent of scattering time. A symmetry analysis shows that the intrinsic NPTHE is permitted only in noncentrosymmetric crystal point groups lacking horizontal mirror symmetry. Using a tilted Dirac model, we demonstrate that its characteristic angular dependence provides an effective means to control the nonlinear thermal response. Our results establish a new class of quantum geometry driven intrinsic nonlinear thermal transport, offering both a sensitive probe of band geometry and a pathway toward nonlinear thermal functionalities in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Charge disproportionation driven polar magnetic metallic double-layered perovskite Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong coupling among spontaneous structural symmetric breaking, magnetism and metallicity in an intrinsic polar magnetic metal can give rise to novel physical phenomena and holds great promise for applications in spintronics. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of metallic ferroelectricity in the recently discovered polar metal Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$. Our first-principles calculations reveal that both the spontaneous ferroelectric displacements and the metallicity originate from charge disproportionation of Co ions. This is characterized by an inverted ligand-field splitting of the Co $t_2g$ orbitals at one site, while the metallic behavior is preserved by the t$_2g$ orbitals at both sites. The charge disproportionation stabilizes the asymmetric phase Within the framework of the on-site Hubbard U interaction. We thus propose that in related transition metal oxides, charge disproportionation within specific orbitals can concurrently drive metallicity and ferroelectricity, enabling strong coupling between these properties. More remarkably, this mechanism allows for the coexistence of magnetism, as evidenced in Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$. Our findings highlight a promising avenue for realizing polar magnetic metals and provide a new design principle for exploring multifunctional materials.</description>

      <title>Comparison between first-principles supercell calculations of polarons and the ab initio polaron equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarons are composite quasiparticles formed by excess charges and the accompanying lattice distortions in solids, and play a critical role in transport, optical, and catalytic properties of semiconductors and insulators. The standard approach for calculating polarons from first principles relies on density functional theory and periodic supercells. An alternative approach consists of recasting the calculation of polaron wavefunction, lattice distortion, and energy as a coupled nonlinear eigenvalue problem, using the band structure, phonon dispersions, and the electron-phonon matrix elements as obtained from density functional perturbation theory. Here, we revisit the formal connection between these two approaches, with an emphasis on the handling of self-interaction correction, and we establish a compact formal link between them. We perform a quantitative comparison of these methods for the case of small polarons in the prototypical insulators TiO2, MgO, and LiF. We find that the polaron wavefunctions and lattice distortions obtained from these methods are nearly indistinguishable in all cases, and the formation energies are in good (TiO2) to fair (MgO) agreement. We show that the residual deviations can be ascribed to the neglect of higher-order electron-phonon couplings in the density functional perturbation theory approach.</description>

      <title>Excitons in moir\'{e} superlattices with disordered electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'{e} superlattices in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) heterobilayers exhibit various correlated insulating states driven by long-range Coulomb interactions, and these states crucially alter exciton resonances, particularly at fractional fillings. We revisit a theoretical framework to investigate the doping dependence of exciton spectra by extending hydrogenic exciton wavefunctions, systematically analyzing how the 1$s$, 2$s$, and 3$s$ Rydberg states respond to moir\'e-induced mixing of $s$- and $p$-type orbitals. Notably, while the 1$s$ state remains relatively robust against doping, higher Rydberg excitons show strong redshifts and oscillator-strength quenching near specific fractional fillings. We incorporate both defect-induced quasi-ordering and thermal fluctuations to capture realistic device conditions, employing a large supercell approach. By selectively randomizing a subset of electrons or utilizing classical Monte Carlo simulations, we present direct calculations of exciton spectra under varying defect densities and temperatures. Our results emphasize how even moderate disorder or finite temperature can partially or completely suppress characteristic moir\'{e} exciton physics. Especially, we show how the 2$s$ exciton states respond to the phase transition in correlated electron states. This comprehensive picture not only clarifies recent experimental observations but also provides a framework to guide the design of moir\'{e}-based optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Thermal tuning of dynamic response in Ag-based nanowire networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-assembled networks of metallic nanowires (NWs) are being intensively explored as test benches for neuromorphic proposals. In this work, we study the electric transport properties of dense self-assembled networks of Ag-based NWs (AgNWNs) coated with a thin insulating layer, using DC and AC stimuli. The building blocks of this network are the metallic NWs and the NW-NW junctions, either metallic or memristive. In the pristine state, frequency independence of the impedance reveals an over-percolated purely resistive network. A combination of low-temperature annealing and AC stimulus is shown to drastically affect the resistivity of the sample (interpreted as a depopulation of purely metallic junctions), unveiling a rich dynamic response. This procedure triggers the achievement of a capacitive response, which is successfully rationalized using a previously introduced 'two junction model'. Thermal treatment appears to be an indirect strategy to effectively modify the humidity content at the NW-NW intersections and, consequently, enable multiple switching schemes suitable for brain-like processing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Directional atomic layer etching of lithium niobate using Br-based plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium niobate (LiNbO$_3$, LN) is a nonlinear optical material of high interest for integrated photonics with applications ranging from optical communications to quantum information processing. The performance of on-chip devices based on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) is presently limited by fabrication imperfections such as sidewall surface roughness and geometry inhomogeneities over the chip. Atomic layer etching (ALE) could potentially be used to overcome these difficulties. Although an isotropic ALE process for LN has been reported, performing LN fabrication completely with ALE faces several challenges, including the lack of a directional ALE process for pattern transfer and the redeposition of involatile compounds. Here, we report a directional ALE process for LN consisting of sequential exposures of HBr/BCl$_3$/Ar plasma for surface modification and Ar plasma for removal. The HBr chemistry is found to decrease redeposition compared to F- and Cl-based plasmas, which we attribute to the higher vapor pressures of Br-based products. A grating pattern etched entirely by the process (total etch depth of 220 nm) exhibits no aspect ratio dependent etching (ARDE) down to the smallest tested gap of 150 nm, in contrast to ion milling in which ARDE manifests even at 300 nm gaps for the same etch depth. The HBr plasma chemistry is also found to support an isotropic process consisting of sequential exposures of H$_2$ plasma and HBr/BCl$_3$/Ar plasma. These processes could be used together to perform the complete fabrication process for TFLN devices, eliminating imperfections arising from ion milling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a hole is introduced into an elastic material, it will usually act to reduce the overall mechanical stiffness. A general ambition is to investigate whether a stiff shell around the hole can act to maintain the overall mechanical properties. We consider the basic example situation of an isotropic, homogeneous, linearly elastic material loaded uniformly under plane strain for low concentrations of holes. As we demonstrate, the thickness of the shell can be adjusted in a way to maintain the overall stiffness of the system. We derive a corresponding mathematical expression for the thickness of the shell that conceals the hole. Thus, one can work with given materials to mask the presence of the holes. One does not necessarily need to adjust the material parameters and thus materials themselves. Our predictions from linear elasticity continuum theory are extended to atomistic level using molecular dynamics simulations of a model Lennard-Jones solid. Small deviations from linear elasticity theory can be minimized by tuning the hole-to-system size ratio in the molecular dynamics simulations. This extension attests the robustness of our continuum predictions even at atomistic scales. The basic concept is important in the context of light-weight construction.</description>

      <title>Chimeric states of matter: Meissner effect without superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is central to how we classify phases of matter: solids break spatial translations, superfluids break particle-number conservation, and superconductors "break" gauge symmetry. Mixed anomalies involving higher-form symmetries, however, present a generalization of spontaneous symmetry breaking that admits a wider and more versatile set of possibilities. We introduce chimeric states of matter, in which aspects of broken and unbroken phases coexist. We find that the Meissner effect -- usually regarded as the defining hallmark of superconductivity -- can occur in media that are resistive or even insulating when probed by electric fields. We demonstrate this by constructing an effective field theory of "symmetry chimerization" and propose that Josephson junction networks could provide a laboratory realization. These results broaden the landscape of possible phases of matter, showing that physical media can mix features of symmetry-restored and symmetry-broken states in a single substrate.</description>

      <title>Approximating Young Measures With Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametrized measures (or Young measures) enable to reformulate non-convex variational problems as convex problems at the cost of enlarging the search space from space of functions to space of measures. To benefit from such machinery, we need powerful tools for approximating measures. We develop a deep neural network approximation of Young measures in this paper. The key idea is to write the Young measure as push-forward of Gaussian measures, and reformulate the problem of finding Young measures to finding the corresponding push-forward. We approximate the push-forward map using deep neural networks by encoding the reformulated variational problem in the loss function. After developing the framework, we demonstrate the approach in several numerical examples. We hope this framework and our illustrative computational experiments provide a pathway for approximating Young measures in their wide range of applications from modeling complex microstructure in materials to non-cooperative games.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Full Damage Profile of Focused Ion Beams via 4D-STEM Precession Electron Diffraction and PSNR Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Focused ion beams (FIBs) are widely used in nanofabrication for applications such as circuit repair, ultra-thin lamella preparation, strain engineering, and quantum device prototyping. Although the lateral spread of the ion beam is often overlooked, it becomes critical in precision tasks such as impurity placement in host substrates, where accurate knowledge of the ion-matter interaction profile is essential. Existing techniques typically characterise only the beam core, where most ions land, thus underestimating the full extent of the point spread function (PSF). In this work, we use four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to resolve the ion beam tail at defect densities equivalent to $&lt;$0.1 ions nm$^{-2}$. Convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) patterns were collected in calibration regions with known ion fluence and compared to patterns acquired around static dwell spots exposed to a 30 keV Ga$^{+}$ beam for 1-10 s. Cross-correlation using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) revealed that 4D-STEM datasets are ultra-sensitive for defect quantification and more robust against scanning artefacts than conventional dark-field imaging. This approach is complementary to image resolution methods enabling a comprehensive profiling of ion-induced damage even at low-dose regimes, offering a more accurate representation of FIB performance and supporting application tailoring beyond the conventional resolution metrics focused solely on the beam core.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Electronic Structure of Graphene by Controlling Spatial Confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00688v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic properties of a material depend on the spatial freedom of the electron wavefunction. A well-known example is graphite, which is a conventional gapless semiconductor, while a single layer of it, graphene, exhibits extremely high electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, graphene ribbons can have different physical properties, such as a tunable band gap, from gapless to large band gap semiconductor. The purpose of this study is to investigate the electronic structure of graphene few-layers composed of a layer of graphene nanoribbons and graphene sheet(s), where quasi-one-dimensional nanoribbons can interact with two-dimensional sheet of graphite. Using the tight-binding model for graphite, we show how different configuration of such heterostructures can affect the electronic structure, in which is different from their components electronic structure. Namely, a gap of ~0.6 eV can be opened in a bilayer configuration composed of a layer of gapless armchair nanoribbon stacked on graphene.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Materials for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various coils for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are widely available for clinical and research use. These coils are almost all designed as air coils, which require large levels of energy to achieve a given magnetic flux density and in turn electric field strength, whereas in other sectors, such as power electronics or electrical machines, magnetic materials have been used for a long time to achieve higher efficiencies. We tested the impact on the electric and magnetic properties of different soft magnetic materials, including various ferrite cores, laminated sheet materials of nonisotropic corn-oriented silicon-steel, non-oriented silicon-steel, as well as cobalt-iron, and soft magnetic compound powder cores with insulated particles. Every material led to a reduction in coil current and voltage for the same target electric field strength. For the same field energy, every material yielded lower losses. Most common materials saturated already at very low currents. More material in thicker layers could shift the saturation point but at the cost of high weight. Due to their low saturation flux density, ferrites appear unsuitable for the high amplitude requirements of TMS. Laminated sheet materials and powder cores reduce the pulse energy, but the laminated sheet material adds more weight for the same effect than powder cores. Thus, appropriate magnetic materials can reduce the required pulse energy. Saturation flux density is the most relevant parameter, whereas the permeability beyond a certain base level is practically irrelevant. Most importantly, the weight of a magnetic-core coil may always be increased compared to an air coil for the same target field.</description>

      <title>New avenues for characterizing individual mineralized collagen fibrils with transmission electron microscopy</title>

Abstract: Bone serves as a remarkable example of nature's architectured material with its unique blend of strength and toughness, all at a lightweight design. Given the hierarchical nature of these materials, it is essential to understand the governing mechanisms and organization of its constituents across length scales for bio-inspired structural design. Despite recent advances in transmission electron miscoscopy (TEM) that have allowed us to witness the fascinating arrangement of bone at micro-down to the nano-scale, we are still missing the details about the structural organization and mechanical properties of the main building blocks of bone -- mineralized collagen fibrils (MCFs). Here, we propose a novel approach for extracting individual MCFs from nature's model material via a dropcasting procedure. By isolating the MCFs onto TEM-compatible substrates, we visualized the arrangement of organic and mineral phases within the individual MCFs at the nanoscale. Using a 4D-STEM approach, the orientation of individual mineral crystals within the MCFs was examined. Furthermore, we conducted first-of-its-kind in situ tensile experiments, revealing exceptional tensile strains of at least 8%, demonstrating the intricate relationship between structural organization and the mechanical behavior of MCFs. The capabilities of TEM allow us to resolve MCF organization and composition down to the nanoscale level. This new knowledge of the ultrastructure of the bone-building blocks and the proposed sample extraction and in situ mechanical testing opens up new avenues for research into nature's inspired material design.</description>

      <title>Robust structural superlubricity of twisted graphene bilayer and domain walls between commensurate moir\'e pattern domains from first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted graphene layers exhibit extremely low friction for relative sliding. Nevertheless, previous studies suggest that the area contribution to friction for commensurate moir\'e systems is finite and might restrict macroscopic superlubricity for large layer overlaps. In this paper, we investigate the potential energy surface (PES) for relative displacement of the layers forming moir\'e patterns (2,1) and (3,1) by accurate density functional theory calculations using the vdW-DF3 functional. The amplitudes of PES corrugations on the order of 0.4 and 0.03 $\mu$eV per atom of one layer, respectively, are obtained. The account of structural relaxation doubles this value for the (2,1) pattern, while causing only minimal changes for the (3,1) pattern. We show that different from aligned graphene layers, for moir\'e patterns, PES minima and maxima can switch their positions upon changing the interlayer distance. The PES shape is closely described by the first spatial Fourier harmonics both with and without account of structural relaxation. A barrier for relative rotation of the layers to an incommensurate state that can make superlubricity robust is estimated based on the approximated PES. We also derive a set of measurable physical properties related to interlayer interaction including shear mode frequency, shear modulus and static friction force. Furthermore, we predict that it should be possible to observe domain walls separating commensurate domains, each comprising a large number of moir\'e pattern unit cells, and provide estimates of their characteristics.</description>

      <title>Explosive connectivity and mechanical rigidity in cubic lattice structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study explosive connectivity and mechanical rigidity in three-dimensional cubic lattice structures under Achlioptas-type product-rule dynamics. Our work combines extensive numerical simulation with the development of a new theoretical framework. For connectivity, we rigorously establish the presence of sublinear-width merger-cascade windows for $k\ge 2$, which drive macroscopic jumps in the order parameter and imply a first-order transition. For rigidity, we discover numerically that for richly-connected hosts, increasing the number of choices $k$ monotonically enhances the efficiency of rigidification. To explain this phenomenon, we propose a theoretical model centered on a conditional progress function that links an edge's local product-rule score to its global mechanical utility. We show that this function becomes non-increasing, thus explaining the observed monotonic efficiency, under two physically-motivated assumptions. Altogether, our work provides new insights into the relationship between local dynamics and global connectivity and rigidity in cubic lattice structures via both theory and computation.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in Kitaev materials have highlighted their potential to host Majorana fermions without or high-temperature of superconductivity. In this research, we propose $Li_2IrO_3$ as a promising High-temperature superconducting platform supporting Majorana edge modes due to its strong spin-orbit coupling, honeycomb lattice structure, and proximity to a quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. A theoretical and numerical framework based on the Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian is developed to model spin interactions in $Li_2IrO_3$. Here, the existence of topological zero-energy states is demonstrated, and their signatures in the edge-localized spectral weight are identified. A device concept based on this material is also proposed with potential industrial applications in spintronics, magnetic field sensing, and topological quantum memory.</description>

      <title>Large spin signal and spin rectification in folded-bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene is an exceptional platform for spin-based non-volatile memory, logic, and neuromorphic computing by combining long-distance spin transport with electrical tunability at room temperature. However, advancing beyond passive spin channels requires devices capable of generating large spin signals with efficient rectification capabilities, which are essential for active spintronic components. Here, we demonstrate a folded-bilayer graphene spin-valve device with giant non-local spin signals in the several mV range with pronounced spin-rectification effects. The efficient spin injection creates a giant spin accumulation of 20 meV, and generates a spin-diode effect with an asymmetry of over an order of magnitude between forward and reverse bias conditions. This spin-diode effect arises from the nonlinear coupling between large spin accumulation and the applied electric field. These large spin signals, together with the spin-diode effect, are achieved with folded-bilayer graphene, offering a promising platform for developing active ultrathin two-dimensional spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Fano resonance as detection of low-damping magnon pairs: Theory and experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We probe the broadband nonlinear magnetization dynamics of a high-quality magnetic sphere under a strong microwave drive using microwave spectroscopy. We observe a \textit{Fano resonance} in the microwave transmission when the driven amplitude of the magnetization is large and the drive frequency $\omega_d$ is close to but not at the ferromagnetic resonance. When the drive frequency is very close to the ferromagnetic resonance, the microwave transmission splits into two absorption dips. We interpret the unexpected Fano resonance by a scattering theory of photons considering the three-magnon interaction between the Kittel magnon and magnon pairs with opposite wave vectors of frequency $\omega_d/2$. The theoretical model suggests that the microwave spectroscopy measures the dynamics of the fluctuation $\delta \hat{\alpha}$ of the Kittel magnon and $\delta\hat{\beta}_{\pm k}$ of the magnon pairs over the driven steady states, which are coupled coherently by the steady-state amplitudes. When the damping of $\delta\hat{\beta}_{\pm k}$ is much smaller than that of $\delta \hat{\alpha}$, the theoretical calculation can well reproduce the observed Fano resonance. Mode fluctuations with a low damping should be useful for quantum information and logic operations in future magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Unconventional relativistic spin polarization of electronic bands in an altermagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a recently identified phase with a d, g or i-wave spin symmetry of magnetic ordering. Its discovery opens new research fronts at intersections of magnetism and spintronics with fields ranging from superconductivity to topological and relativistic quantum physics. Here we demonstrate an unconventional relativistic spin polarization in an altermagnet by spin and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy of electronic bands in single-domain MnTe. The relativistic spin-orbit coupling origin is revealed by observing that the alternating momentum-dependent spin polarization is orthogonal to the magnetic-ordering vector. The collinearity, even-parity and time-reversal-odd nature of the demonstrated relativistic spin polarization in the altermagnet is unparalleled in conventional forms of the relativistic spin polarization. Our experimental results and methodology are supported by non-relativistic spin-symmetry and relativistic magnetic-symmetry analyses, and microscopic ab initio ground-state and photoemission theory.</description>

      <title>A Synthesizability-Guided Pipeline for Materials Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational materials discovery relies on the generation of plausible crystal structures. The plausibility is typically judged through density functional theory methods which, while typically accurate at zero Kelvin, often favor low-energy structures that are not experimentally accessible. We develop a combined compositional and structural synthesizability score which provides an accurate way of predicting which compounds can actually be synthesized in a laboratory. We use it to evaluate non-synthesized structures from the Materials Project, GNoME, and Alexandria, and identified several hundred highly synthesizable candidates. We then predict synthesis pathways, conduct corresponding experiments, and characterize the products across 16 targets, successfully synthesizing 7 of 16. The entire experimental process was completed in only three days. Our results highlight omissions in lists of known synthesized structures, deliver insights into the practical utility of current materials databases, and showcase the central role synthesizability prediction can play in materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Quantum Acoustics Demystifies the Strange Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonons have long been thought to be incapable of explaining key phenomena in strange metals, including linear-in-\textit{T} Planckian resistivity from high to very low temperatures. We argue that these conclusions were based on static, perturbative approaches that overlooked essential time-dependent and nonperturbative electron-lattice physics. In fact ``phonons'' are not the best target for discussion, just like ``photons'' are not the best way to think about Maxwell's equations. Quantum optics connects photons and electromagnetism, as developed 60 years ago by Glauber and others. We have been developing the parallel world of quantum acoustics. Far from being only of academic interest, the new tools are rapidly exposing the secrets of the strange metals, revealing strong vibronic (vibration-electronic) interactions playing a crucial role forming polarons and charge density waves, linear-in-$T$ resistivity at the Planckian rate over thousands of degrees, resolution of the Drude peak infrared anomaly, and the absence of a $T^4$ low-temperature resistivity rise in 2D systems, and of a Mott-Ioffe-Regel resistivity saturation. We derive Planckian transport, polarons, CDWs, and pseudogaps from the Fr\"ohlich model. The ``new physics'' has been hiding in this model all along, in the right parameter regime, if it is treated nonperturbatively. In the course of this work we have uncovered the generalization of Anderson localization to dynamic media: a universal Planckian diffusion emerges, a ``ghost'' of Anderson localization. Planckian diffusion is clearly defined and is more fundamental than the popular but elusive, model dependent concept of ``Planckian speed limit''.</description>

      <title>Kagome on beta-Sb with valley-hot Berry curvature and tunable intrinsic SHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.05424v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-area, single-crystalline antimonene polygonal domains self-assemble on Al(111) at room temperature without forming an interfacial alloy layer by MBE. Beyond the beta-Sb phase,with increasing deposition, once the beta-Sb coverage surpasses a threshold, we observe a previously unreported kagome-Sb overlayer. STM height maps and line profiles track a phase evolution from an enlarged-period honeycomb to a close-packed layer and ultimately a kagome lattice. XPS peak not only shows resolves a time-dependent redistribution of Sb-related components that quantitatively mirrors the STM-observed phase sequence, but also revals the substrate core levels remain unchanged, ruling out interfacial alloying throughout growth. ARPES of beta-Sb resolves a Dirac-like crossing at Gamma around -1.4 eV, in agreement with first-principles calculations. Although beta-Sb is Z2-trivial and the heterostructure is metallic, Wannier-based calculations reveal valley-contrasting Berry-curvature hotspots, yielding an intrinsic spin Hall conductivity that is strongly Fermi-level dependent. These results demonstrate a reproducible kagome-Sb/beta-Sb heterophase interface and uncover a controllable spin-orbit-driven response in a homoelemental 2D system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03416v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme pressures and temperatures create conditions that allow even hard and brittle materials to deform plastically. Despite extensive research, the upper limits of flow strength, the resistance to plastic flow, remain uncertain, and the mechanisms driving deformation at the relevant stresses are a subject of debate. Using femtosecond in situ X-ray diffraction experiments and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that stacking fault-mediated strengthening enables shock-compressed nano-polycrystalline diamond to achieve a peak flow strength of 107+-5 GPa at a stress of 227+-8 GPa. Our findings show that extreme conditions can unlock unusual strength via mechanisms that can be used as design tools in targeted applications.</description>

      <title>Multiferroic Dark Excitonic Mott Insulator in the Breathing-Kagome Lattice Material Nb$_3$Cl$_8$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat electronic bands strongly enhance Coulomb interactions and can stabilize unconventional insulating states. Motivated by the recent discovery of flat bands in breathing Kagome lattices, we use first-principles GW--Bethe--Salpeter theory to investigate the excitonic spectrum of single-layer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$. We find a dark spin-triplet Frenkel exciton whose spectral peak lies at negative energy ($-0.14$~eV) relative to the quasiparticle gap, directly signaling a preformed bound state and an excitonic Mott insulating phase potentially stable at room temperature. Bright excitons appear at $0.94$~eV and $1.21$~eV, with ultra-large binding energies of $2.05$~eV and $1.77$~eV. By mapping the low-energy dynamics onto a spin-1 Hubbard model on a triangular lattice, we show that frustrated antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric tendencies naturally emerge. These results identify Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ as a candidate multiferroic dark excitonic insulator, opening a pathway to correlated quantum phases in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Nernst effect in Co thin films under laser irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) generates electromotive forces transverse to temperature gradients and has attracted much attention for potential applications into alternative thermoelectric power generators. ANE efficiency is generally characterized by uniform temperature gradients in a steady state prepared by heaters. However, although focusing laser beams on a magnetic film can form much larger temperature gradients, the laser-irradiation method has not been sufficiently considered for quantifying the ANE coefficient due to the difficulty in estimating the localized in-homogeneous temperature gradients. In this study, we present a quantitative study of ANE in Ru(5 nm)/Co($t_{\mathrm{Co}}$) ($t_{\mathrm{Co}}$ = 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 40, and 60 nm) bilayers on sapphire (0001) substrates by combining a laser irradiation approach with finite-element analysis of temperature gradients under laser excitation. We find that the estimated ANE coefficients are consistent with previously reported values and one independently characterized using a heater. Our results also reveal the advantages of the laser irradiation method over the conventional method using heaters. Intensity-modulated laser beams can create ac temperature gradients as large as approximately 10$^3$ K/mm at a frequency of tens of kilohertz in a micrometer-scale region.</description>

      <title>Physical spin torques from exactly constrained exchange-correlation torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of capturing physical spin torques in non-collinear magnetic systems has dominated the scene of spin-density functional theory (SDFT) in the last two decades. Progress has been hindered by the fact that the spin torque is directly connected to the divergence of the spin current, a quantity that is {\em extraneous} to SDFT -- thus leading to {\em spurious} exchange-correlation (xc) torques in the spin dynamics. Moreover, SDFT cannot rigorously include vector potentials and spin-orbit couplings. Here, we propose a solution that exploits the U(1)$\times$SU(2)-invariance of the xc energy of SpinCurrent-DFT (SCDFT) -- an exact constraint that is not accessible to SDFT. Non-vanishing xc torques obtained on non-collinear solutions are constrained by the aforementioned exact internal symmetry and do not enter the propagation of the spin magnetization -- i.e., the spin dynamics involve {\em only} the physical currents and physical spin-torques.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Doping Effects on Altermagnetism in MnTe: Emergence of Quasi-altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Governed by specific symmetries, altermagnetism is an emerging field in condensed matter physics, characterized by unique spin-splitting of the bands in the momentum space co-existing with the compensated magnetization as in antiferromagnets. As crystals can have tailored and unintended defects, it is important to gain insights on how altermagnets are affected by the defects-driven symmetry-breaking which, in turn, can build promising perspectives on potential applications. In this study, considering the widely investigated MnTe as a prototype altermagnet, defects are introduced through substitutional doping to create a large configuration space of spin space groups. With the aid of density functional theory calculations, symmetry analysis, and model studies in this configuration space, we demonstrate the generic presence of spin-split of the antiferromagnetic bands in the momentum space. This is indicative of a wider class of quasi-altermagnetic materials, augmenting the set of ideal altermagnetic systems. Furthermore, we show that while pristine MnTe does not show anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) with out-of-plane magnetization, suitable doping can be carried out to obtain finite and varied AHC. Our predictions of quasi-altermagnetism and doping-driven tailored AHC have the potential to open up as-yet-unexplored directions in this developing field.</description>

      <title>Anharmonicity-driven phonon avoided crossing and anomalous thermal transport in nodal-line semimetal ZrSiS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding thermal and electrical transport in topological materials is essential for advancing their applications in quantum technologies and energy conversion. Herein, we employ first-principles calculations to systematically investigate phonon and charge transport in the prototypical nodal-line semimetal ZrSiS. The results unveil that anharmonic phonon renormalization results in the pronounced softening of heat-carrying phonons and suppressed lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$). Crucially, anharmonic effects are found to noticeably weaken Zr-S interactions, triggering avoided-crossing behavior of low-frequency optical phonons. The combination of phonon softening and avoided crossing synergistically reduces phonon group velocities, yielding a 16\% suppression in $\kappa_{\rm L}$ along the $c$-axis at room temperature. Contrary to conventional metals, we discover that the lattice contribution to thermal conductivity in ZrSiS is abnormally large, even dominating heat conduction along the $c$-axis. This unusual behavior results in a substantial deviation of the Lorenz number from the Sommerfeld value -- exceeding it by up to threefold -- thereby challenging the validation of standard Wiedemann-Franz law for thermal conductivity estimation. Moreover, our calculations demonstrate that ZrSiS exhibits exceptional electrical conductivity, attributed to its topological electronic Dirac states that account for both high Fermi velocities and weak electron-phonon coupling. This study provides critical insights into the electrical and thermal transport mechanisms in ZrSiS and highlights the importance of anharmonic effects in the lattice dynamics and thermal transport of metallic materials.</description>

Abstract: The vibrational structure of chromium germanium telluride (Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, CGT) is investigated and a strong spin-phonon coupling is revealed. The measured high-resolution Raman scattering (RS) spectra are composed of the 10 Raman-active modes: 5A$_\textrm{g}$ and 5E$_\textrm{g}$, predicted by calculation using the density functional theory and identified using polarization-resolved RS measurements. We also studied the effect of temperature on the RS spectra of CGT from 5~K to 300~K. A strong magneto-phonon coupling in CGT is revealed at temperatures of about 150~K and 60~K, which are associated with the appearance of the local magnetic order in the material and the transition to the complete ferromagnetic phase, respectively. Moreover, a unique shape of the A$_g^5$ mode composed of a set of very narrow Raman peaks is simulated using a model that takes into account vibrations of Ge-Ge pseudo-molecules for various Ge isotopes.</description>

      <title>From High-Entropy Ceramics (HECs) to Compositionally Complex Ceramics (CCCs) and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade, the field of high-entropy ceramics (HECs) has expanded rapidly to encompass a broad range of oxides, borides, silicides, and other ceramic solid solutions. In 2020, we proposed extending the concept of HECs to compositionally complex ceramics (CCCs), where non-equimolar compositions and the presence of long- or short-range order, despite reducing configurational entropy, create new opportunities to tailor and enhance properties, often surpassing those of higher-entropy counterparts. Along this line, several fundamental scientific questions arise. Is the entropy in HECs truly high? Should maximizing entropy always be the goal? In this perspective article, I revisit key concepts and terminologies and highlight emerging directions, including dual-phase CCCs, ultrahigh-entropy phases, and novel processing routes such as ultrafast reactive sintering. I propose that exploring compositional complexity across vast non-equimolar spaces, together with correlated disorder (coupled chemical and structural short-range order), offers an effective strategy for designing ceramics with superior performance.</description>

      <title>Predicting Crystal Structures and Ionic Conductivities in Li$_{3}$YCl$_{6-x}$Br$_{x}$ Halide Solid Electrolytes Using a Fine-Tuned Machine Learning Interatomic Potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding ionic transport in halide solid electrolytes is essential for advancing next-generation solid-state batteries. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of fine-tuning the Crystal Hamiltonian Graph Network (CHGNet) universal machine learning interatomic potential to accurately predict total energies, relaxed geometries, and lithium-ion dynamics in the ternary halide family Li$_{3}$YCl$_{6-x}$Br$_{x}$ (LYCB). Starting from experimentally refined disordered structures of Li$_{3}$YCl$_{6}$ and Li$_{3}$YBr$_{6}$, we present a strategy for generating ordered structural models through systematic enumeration and energy ranking, providing realistic structural models. These serve as initial configurations for an iterative fine-tuning workflow that integrates molecular dynamics simulations and static density functional theory calculations to achieve near-ab initio accuracy at four orders of magnitude lower computational cost. We further reveal the influence of composition (varied x) on the predicted phase stability and ionic conductivity in LYCB, demonstrating the robustness of our approach for modeling transport properties in complex solid electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Cross-Domain Transfer for Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate yet transferable machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are essential for accelerating materials and chemical discovery. However, most universal MLIPs overfit to narrow datasets or computational protocols, limiting their reliability across chemical and functional domains. We introduce a transferable multi-domain training strategy that jointly optimizes universal and task-specific parameters through selective regularization, coupled with a domain-bridging set (DBS) that aligns potential-energy surfaces across datasets. Systematic ablation experiments show that small DBS fractions (0.1%) and targeted regularization synergistically enhance out-of-distribution generalization while preserving in-domain fidelity. Trained on fifteen open databases spanning molecules, crystals, and surfaces, our model, SevenNet-Omni, achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain accuracy, including adsorption-energy errors below 0.06 eV on metallic surfaces and 0.1 eV on metal-organic frameworks. Despite containing only 0.5% r$^2$SCAN data, SevenNet-Omni reproduces high-fidelity r$^2$SCAN energetics, demonstrating effective cross-functional transfer from large PBE datasets. This framework offers a scalable route toward universal, transferable MLIPs that bridge quantum-mechanical fidelities and chemical domains.</description>

      <title>Generative diffusion modeling protocols for improving the Kikuchi pattern indexing in electron back-scatter diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) has traditionally relied upon methods such as the Hough transform and dictionary Indexing to interpret diffraction patterns and extract crystallographic orientation. However, these methods encounter significant limitations, particularly when operating at high scanning speeds, where the exposure time per pattern is decreased beyond the operating sensitivity of CCD camera. Hence the signal to noise ratio decreases for the observed pattern which makes the pattern noisy, leading to reduced indexing accuracy. This research work aims to develop generative machine learning models for the post-processing or on-the-fly processing of Kikuchi patterns which are capable of restoring noisy EBSD patterns obtained at high scan speeds. These restored patterns can be used for the determination of crystal orientations to provide reliable indexing results. We compare the performance of such generative models in enhancing the quality of patterns captured at short exposure times (high scan speeds). An interesting observation is that the methodology is not data-hungry as typical machine learning methods.</description>

      <title>Dirac points and Weyl phase in a honeycomb altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present unconventional nodal crossings in a two-dimensional (2D) collinear altermagnet, which are enforced by crystal symmetries to lock spin polarization and valley degrees of freedom. The altermagnetism generate nonrelativistic spin-splitting in honeycomb antiferromagnets, guaranteeing novel band degeneracies between bands sharing identical spin configurations yet different sublattices. Inspired by the $XPS_{3}$ (X=Mn, Fe, Ni) materials, we demonstrate distinctive Berry curvature distributions concentrating intensely at Weyl nodes, which further generalize the locking between valleys and Berry curvature. Topological phase transitions are characterized by the high Chern numbers preserving the non-intersecting flows of Wannier centers over occupied bands, where degeneracy lifting contributes to unconventional spin textures to induce the valley Hall effect. Our results yield unique topological nodes via leveraging the crystal symmetry constraints with the intrinsic time-reversal symmetry breaking, where corresponding topological responses enable the potential of advancing spintronics. Our results yield unique topological nodes without the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) achieved by combining crystal symmetry constraints with inherent time-reversal symmetry breaking, whose associated topological responses enable promising applications in spintronics.</description>

      <title>E2Former: An Efficient and Equivariant Transformer with Linear-Scaling Tensor Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19216v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have demonstrated significant success in modeling microscale systems, including those in chemistry, biology and materials science. However, EGNNs face substantial computational challenges due to the high cost of constructing edge features via spherical tensor products, making them impractical for large-scale systems. To address this limitation, we introduce E2Former, an equivariant and efficient transformer architecture that incorporates the Wigner $6j$ convolution (Wigner $6j$ Conv). By shifting the computational burden from edges to nodes, the Wigner $6j$ Conv reduces the complexity from $O(|\mathcal{E}|)$ to $ O(| \mathcal{V}|)$ while preserving both the model's expressive power and rotational equivariance. We show that this approach achieves a 7x-30x speedup compared to conventional $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ convolutions. Furthermore, our empirical results demonstrate that the derived E2Former mitigates the computational challenges of existing approaches without compromising the ability to capture detailed geometric information. This development could suggest a promising direction for scalable and efficient molecular modeling.</description>

Abstract: We present BraWl, a Fortran package implementing a range of conventional and enhanced sampling algorithms for exploration of the phase space of the Bragg-Williams model, facilitating study of diffusional solid-solid transformations in binary and multicomponent alloys. These sampling algorithms include Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo, Wang-Landau sampling, and Nested Sampling.

      <title>Hierarchical Topological States without Dimension Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators exhibit boundary states protected by bulk band topology, a principle first established in quantum systems and later extended to classical waves, including phononics. Conventionally, an $n$-dimensional bulk with nontrivial topology hosts $(n-1)$-dimensional topologically protected boundary states, which may be further gapped out by breaking the symmetry that protects them, potentially leading to the emergence of $(n-2)$-dimensional, or even lower-dimensional topological states, as in higher-order topological insulators. In this work, we introduce an alternative mechanism for gapping out topological states and forming new topological modes within the resulting gap without further unit-cell symmetry breaking or dimension reduction. Using one- and two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models, we show that controlled repositioning of topological domain walls enables the construction of hierarchical unit cells that gap out the original domain-wall states while preserving the underlying symmetry. This process produces higher-hierarchical-level topological states, characterized by a generalized winding number, and can be iterated to realize multiple - potentially infinite - hierarchical levels of topological states. Our approach expands the conventional topological classification and offers a versatile route for engineering complex networks of protected modes in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Spin-Orbit Torques by Tensorial Spin Hall Magnetoresistance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15930v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetoresistance (MR) provides a crucial tool for experimentally studying spin torques. While MR is well established in the device geometry of the spin Hall effect (SHE), as exemplified by the magnet/heavy-metal heterostructures, its role and manifestation beyond the SHE paradigm remain elusive. We propose a hitherto unknown form of MR where the underlying charge-to-spin conversion and its inverse process violate the simple geometry of the SHE, calling for tensorial descriptions. This MR can generate a series of unique harmonic responses essential for the experimental characterization of unconventional spin-orbit torques in non-SHE materials. We demonstrate these harmonic signals with semimetal WTe$_2$ in mind but the results are not restricted to specific materials.</description>

      <title>Growth of Structural Lengthscale in Kob Andersen Binary Mixtures: Role of medium range order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central and extensively debated question in glass physics concerns whether a single, growing lengthscale fundamentally controls glassy dynamics, particularly in systems lacking obvious structural motifs like the Kob Andersen binary Lennard Jones (KALJ) model. In this work, we investigate structural and dynamical lengthscales in supercooled liquids using KALJ model in two compositions: 80:20 and 60:40. We compute the dynamical lengthscale from displacement displacement correlation functions and observe a consistent growth as temperature decreases. To explore the static counterpart, we use a structural order parameter (SOP) based on the mean field caging potential. While this SOP is known to predict short time dynamics effectively, its bare correlation function reveals minimal spatial growth. Motivated by recent findings that long time dynamics reflect collective rearrangements, we perform spatial coarse graining of the SOP and identify an optimal lengthscale Lmax that maximises structure dynamics correlation. We show that the structural correlation length derived from SOP coarse grained over Lmax exhibits clear growth with cooling and closely tracks the dynamical lengthscale, especially for A particles in the 80:20 mixture and for both A and B particles in the 60:40 system. Our results reconcile the previously observed absence of static length growth in the KALJ model by highlighting the necessity of intermediate range structural descriptors. Furthermore, we find that the particles with larger structural length growth also correspond to species with latent crystallisation tendencies, suggesting a possible link between structural order, dynamics, and incipient crystallisation.</description>

      <title>Vibrational Spectra of Materials and Molecules from Partially-Adiabatic Elevated-Temperature Centroid Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) incorporates nuclear quantum statistics into the calculation of vibrational spectra. However, when performed in Cartesian coordinates, CMD shows unphysical artifacts in certain vibrational bands, known as the curvature problem. Recent work showed that CMD spectra can be freed from the curvature problem by evolving the ring-polymer centroid on a potential of mean force (PMF) calculated at an elevated temperature ($T_e$-CMD). Here we present a partially-adiabatic implementation of $T_e$-CMD (PA-$T_e$-CMD), which eliminates the need for precomputed PMFs and instead yields the centroid force 'on the fly'. We introduce a two-temperature path-integral Langevin thermostat to achieve a temperature separation between centroid and internal modes of the ring polymer. Because it is paramount that the elevated temperature be chosen as low as possible for a given physical temperature in this formulation, we present a general scheme for its determination. We benchmark PA-$T_e$-CMD against exact vibrational spectra for the isolated water monomer and discuss its performance for challenging anharmonic systems: the carbonic acid fluoride molecule (CAF) and the methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (MAPI). We conclude that PA-$T_e$-CMD mitigates the curvature problem and the steep increase in computational cost with decreasing temperature of conventional path-integral methods. We observe energy leakage from the hot internal modes to high-frequency centroid modes in some cases, which, nevertheless, only compromises the spectral lineshapes at lower temperatures. While an adiabatic setup based on a coarse-grained centroid PMF is still preferable when a good pre-trained PMF can be easily obtained, PA-$T_e$-CMD presents a low-barrier single-shot setup for any system.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum anomalous Hall effect in fullerene monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nearly four decades after its theoretical prediction, the search for material realizations of quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains a highly active field of research. Many materials have been predicted to exhibit quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) physics under feasible conditions but the experimental verification remains widely elusive. In this work, we propose an alternative approach towards QAH materials design by engineering customized molecular building blocks. We demonstrate this ansatz for a two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb lattice of C26 fullerenes, which exhibits a ferromagnetic ground state and thus breaks time-reversal symmetry. The molecular system is found to be highly tunable with respect to its magnetic degrees of freedom and applied strain, giving rise to a rich phase diagram with Chern numbers C= +/-2, +/-1, 0. Our proposal offers a versatile platform to realize tunable QAH physics under accessible conditions and provides an experimentally feasible approach for chemical synthesis of molecular networks with QAHE.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic performance of field-effect transistors and amplifiers based on selective area grown InAs nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Indium-Arsenide (InAs) nanowire field-effect transistors (NWFETs) are promising platforms for high-speed, low-power nanoelectronics operating at cryogenic conditions, relevant for quantum information processing. We use selective area growth (SAG) of nanowires to realize scalable and planar nanowire device geometries that are compatible with standard semiconductor processing techniques. NWFETs are fabricated and their low temperature characteristics - including ION/IOFF ratios, threshold voltages, sub-threshold slope, interfacial trap density, hysteresis, and mobility - are characterized. The NWFETs operate effectively in integrated circuitry relying on saturation-mode operation. In sub-threshold applications such as amplifiers, we find bandwidths exceeding our cryostat wiring, but the gate hysteresis presents challenges for precise tuning of the amplifier operating point. We discuss the role of crystal imperfections and fabrication processes on the transistor characteristics and propose strategies for further improvements.</description>

      <title>Language Native Lightly Structured Databases for Large Language Model Driven Composite Materials Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The preparation procedures of materials are often embedded narratively in experimental protocols, research articles, patents, and laboratory notes, and are structured around procedural sequences, causal relationships, and conditional logic. The synthesis of boron nitride nanosheet (BNNS) polymer composites exemplifies this linguistically encoded decision-making system, where the practical experiments involve interdependent multistage and path-dependent processes such as exfoliation, functionalization, and dispersion, each governed by heterogeneous parameters and contextual contingencies, challenging conventional numerical optimization paradigms for experiment design. We reformulate this challenge into a text-reasoning problem through a framework centered on a text-first, lightly structured materials database and large language models (LLMs) as text reasoning engines. We constructed a database that captures evidence-linked narrative excerpts from the literature while normalizing only the minimum necessary entities, attributes, and relations to enable composite retrieval that unifies semantic matching, lexical cues, and explicit value filters. Building on this language-native, provenance-preserving foundation, the LLM operates in two complementary modes: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), grounding outputs in retrieved evidence modules from the database, and experience-augmented reasoning (EAR), which leverages iteratively trained text guides derived from multi-source literature-based narrative data as external references to inform reasoning and decision-making. Applying this integration-and-reasoning framework, we demonstrate rapid, laboratory-scale optimization of BNNS preparation, highlighting how language-native data combined with LLM-based reasoning can significantly accelerate practical material preparation.</description>
