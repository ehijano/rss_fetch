      <title>Resonance-free Fabry-P\'erot cavity via unrestricted orbital-angular-momentum ladder-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introducing elements into an optical cavity that modify the transverse spatial field structure can also impact the cavity spectral response. In particular, an intra-cavity spatial mode-converter is expected to induce modal runaway: unrestricted ladder-up in the modal order, concomitantly thwarting coherent field interference, thereby altogether suppressing the resonant response - a phenomenon that has yet to be observed in an optical cavity. Here we show that a single intra-cavity holographic phase mask placed in a compact free-standing planar Fabry-P\'erot cavity renders the cavity spectral response resonance-free. By acting as a mode-converter on a basis of Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes, an incident broadband fundamental Gaussian mode exits the cavity in the form of a superposition of a large number of collinearly propagating broadband LG modes of fixed parity whose spectra coincide with that of the input. Crucially, the resonance-free spectral response is maintained while changing the cavity length by $\sim350\%$, raising the prospect of stable resonant optical sensors whose performance is impervious to length perturbations.</description>

      <title>Stokes and skyrmion tensors with application to non-Cartesian coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We replace the familiar Stokes vector by a tensor. This enables us to derive the skyrmion field as a tensor quantity. The advantage we obtain is the freedom to work with non-Cartesian coordinates, including polar coordinates. An expression of optical skyrmions in terms of cylindrical coordinates should simplify the descriptions of their propagation and focussing. We reveal a fundamental electromagnetic source of a skyrmion field in the form of radiation by an oscillating dipole.</description>

      <title>Universal structure of propagation-invariant optical pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-time structuring of light - where spatial and temporal degrees of freedom are deliberately coupled and controlled - is an emerging area of optics that enables novel configurations of electromagnetic fields. Of particular importance for applications are optical pulses whose peak intensity travels at an arbitrary, tunable velocity while maintaining its spatiotemporal profile. Space-time wave packets and the ideal flying focus are two prominent realizations of these pulses. Here, we show that these realizations share an identical spatiotemporal field structure, and that this structure represents a universal solution for constant-velocity, propagation-invariant pulses.</description>

      <title>The development of vibration modes propagation method to perform wave-optics simulation of beamline vibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution from 3rd to 4th generation synchrotron radiation (SR) sources provide promising potential improvements in X-ray techniques, particularly in spatial resolution for imaging, temporal resolution for dynamic studies, and beam size control for nanoprobes. Achieving these enhancements demands effective vibration suppression in beamline systems. This challenge drives the need for optical designs that ensure efficient photon transport while maintaining vibration within acceptable thresholds. To address the advanced coherence requirements of fourth-generation SR sources, wave-optics simulations must be incorporated into optical design processes. We therefore propose a vibration mode propagation method using wave-optics techniques for beamline vibration simulation. Our approach achieves an almost 40-fold computational acceleration in actual beamline models compared to conventional methods, enabling direct analysis of propagating wavefront vibrations. This framework allows systematic evaluation of intensity distribution variations, coherence changes, and beam positioning errors caused by mechanical vibrations.</description>

      <title>Numerical and Theoretical Investigation of Multi-Beam Interference and Cavity Resonance in Top-Emission QLEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Top-emission quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) have been extensively studied due to their potential application in augmented/virtual reality. Particularly, the impact of Fabry-P\'erot resonance on top-emission QLEDs has been investigated through both experimental and theoretical studies. Additionally, multi-beam interference effects in QLED emission layers have been explored theoretically. However, previous studies predominantly rely on simplified simulations or governing equations with minor numerical corrections, often resulting in discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental results. Notably, a comprehensive investigation of multi-beam interference effects remains insufficient.
  This study aims to perform a theoretical analysis of multi-beam interference, substantiated with numerical simulations. Specifically, we examine Fabry-P\'erot resonance effects and compare them with interference between upward and downward emission components in QLED layers. The findings are expected to provide insights into designing more efficient QLED architectures.</description>

      <title>Broadband Angular-selective Mid-infrared Photodetector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-infrared photodetectors are susceptible to background noise since every object in the surroundings emits thermal radiation from different directions. To reduce this background noise and enhance signal-to-noise ratio of mid-infrared sensing, different strategies to achieve angular-selective filtering have been proposed. However, these methods are either wavelength- and polarization-dependent, or require bulky lens or mirror systems. The former compromises the photodetector sensitivity, and the latter makes it difficult to integrate with wearable or on-chip devices. In this study, we present a novel angular-selective microstructure array that can seamlessly integrate onto a mid-infrared photodetector. Our compact device leverages the conservation of etendue to attain high angular selectivity over a broad range of mid-infrared wavelengths. Radiation from unwanted angles is substantially filtered, which leads to a markedly enhanced photodetection signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, the device's photoresponse is shown to be polarization- and wavelength-independent, avoiding signal losses associated with narrow spectral ranges or polarization dependence, and therefore circumventing degradation in photodetector sensitivity. Our broadband angular-selective mid-infrared photodetector holds great promise for wearable devices, medical diagnostics and space applications.</description>

      <title>Energy scaling of Kerr-lens modelocked Ho:YAG thin-disk oscillators to the microjoule level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate peak power and pulse energy scaling of Kerr-lens modelocking (KLM) Ho:YAG thin-disk lasers (TDLs) emitting at 2.1-{\mu}m wavelength. We compare different laser configurations to reach a maximum pulse energy of 1.7 {\mu}J at an output power of 29 W with a pulse duration of 434 fs, corresponding to a peak power of 3.7 MW. This represents a 5-fold increase in pulse energy and 4-fold increase in peak power compared to previous KLM Ho:YAG TDLs, thus reaching record high peak power for 2.1-{\mu}m mode-locked oscillators. We discuss current limitations at this wavelength and guidelines for future work towards higher power and pulse energies.</description>

      <title>Broadband shot-to-shot transient absorption anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient absorption (TA) is the most widespread method to follow ultrafast dynamics in molecules and materials. The related method of TA anisotropy (TAA) reports on the ultrafast reorientation dynamics of transition dipole moments, reporting on phenomena ranging from electronic dephasing to orientational diffusion. While these are fundamental aspects complementary to TA, TAA is generally less widely used. The main reason is that TAA signals are usually not measured directly but are retrieved from two consecutive TA measurements with parallel and perpendicular polarization of pump and probe pulses. This means that even minor systematic errors in these measurements lead to drastic changes in the TAA signal. In this work, the authors demonstrate alternating shot-to-shot detection of TA measurements with different pump polarization, minimizing systematic errors due to laser fluctuations. The employed broadband detection lets us discuss effects dependent on detection wavelength in the ultrafast anisotropy decay of 2,3-Naphthalocyanin, a system previously scrutinized by David Jonas and co-workers. In particular we compare timescales of population relaxation and decoherence and supported the proposals for isotropic type of relaxation in square symmetric molecules.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Duality Symmetry-Protected Dirac-Like Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac-like cones, featuring conical linear dispersions intersecting with flat bands, typically arise from accidental degeneracy of multiple modes that requires precise tuning of material and structural parameters, inherently limiting their robustness and applications. In this work, by introducing electromagnetic duality symmetry into photonic crystals, we demonstrate the emergence of intrinsically robust deterministic Dirac-like cones. We show that such symmetry (achieved through either self-dual particles or non-self-dual particle clusters with duality-glide symmetry) enforces double degeneracies for band structures of photonic crystals. Furthermore, by harnessing the joint duality-structural symmetry, multiple deterministic Dirac-like cones exhibiting exceptional resilience to lattice size variations can be obtained. Our introduction of an extra symmetry into photonic crystals establishes a profound connection between duality symmetry and Dirac physics, providing a robust platform for advanced photonic band engineering.</description>

      <title>Automating Experimental Optics with Sample Efficient Machine Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As free-space optical systems grow in scale and complexity, troubleshooting becomes increasingly time-consuming and, in the case of remote installations, perhaps impractical. An example of a task that is often laborious is the alignment of a high-finesse optical resonator, which is highly sensitive to the mode of the input beam. In this work, we demonstrate how machine learning can be used to achieve autonomous mode-matching of a free-space optical resonator with minimal supervision. Our approach leverages sample-efficient algorithms to reduce data requirements while maintaining a simple architecture for easy deployment. The reinforcement learning scheme that we have developed shows that automation is feasible even in systems prone to drift in experimental parameters, as may well be the case in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Gain-modified emission dynamics between two quantum emitters in a plasmonic gain cavity system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general theory of gain-modified emission dynamics between two quantum emitters (two level systems) in a linear gain medium, demonstrating how gain modifies the usual radiative decay rates and inter-emitter coupling and decay rates, that are well known from purely lossy systems. We derive a Born-Markov master equation that shows explicitly how gain modifies the usual rates appearing for two emitters in a loss only medium, and introduces new gain terms. We then present Bloch equations in the bare state basis as well as a dressed-state basis (using superradiant and subradiant states). As an application of the theory, we show calculations for a fully three-dimensional metal dimer in a gain-compensated medium, containing two quantum emitters, and show explicit solutions in terms of the quasinormal modes, which easily allows one to obtain all the relevant decay rates. We study the modified decay dynamics, gain excited pumping, as well as the entanglement entropy and spectral emission. We also demonstrate how a breakdown of the weak excitation approximation in the presence of gain requires a careful treatment beyond a linear response, which yields non-trivial incoherent coupling terms that typically are not included in dipole-dipole coupling models or heuristic gain pumping models.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-Plasmon Interaction in Nanoparticle Assemblies: Role of the Dipole-Quadrupole Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The synthesis of metallic nanoparticle assemblies is nowadays well-controlled, such that these systems offer the possibility of controlling light at a sub-wavelength scale, thanks, for instance, to surface plasmons. Determining the energy dispersion of plasmons likely to couple to light within these nanostructures is, therefore, a necessary preliminary task on the way to understanding both their photonic properties and their physical nature, namely the role of the quadrupole contribution. Starting with a general model that takes account of all energy modes, we show that its low-lying energy dispersion gained numerically, can be compared to that of a minimal model that treats dipoles and quadrupoles on the same footing. The main advantage of the latter relies on the fact that its formulation is tractable, such that a semi-analytical Bogoliubov transformation allows one to access the experimentally relevant energy bands. Based on this semi-analytical derivation, we determine quantitatively the limit of validity of the dipole-only model, the presently proposed dipole and quadrupole model, compared to a full-plasmon-mode Hamiltonian. The results show that the dispersion relation, which includes dipoles and quadrupoles, is sufficient to capture the low-energy physics at play in most experimental situations. Besides, we show that at small lattice spacing, the contribution of quadrupoles is dominant around the Brillouin zone center.</description>

      <title>Non-Bloch edge dynamics of non-Hermitian lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, i.e., the localization of nominally bulk modes, not only drastically reshapes the spectral properties of non-Hermitian systems, but also dramatically modifies the real-time dynamics therein. Here we investigate the time evolution of waves (or quantum-mechanical particles) initialized around the edge of non-Hermitian lattices. The non-Hermitian skin effect tends to localize the wave to the edge, meaning that the real-time dynamics differs from the Bloch-theory picture. We focus on the long-time decay or growth rate of wave function, which is quantified by the Lyapunov exponents. These exponents can be obtained from the saddle points in the complex momentum space. We propose an efficient yet unambiguous criterion for identifying the dominant saddle point that determines the Lyapunov exponents. Our criterion can be precisely formulated in terms of a mathematical concept known as the Lefschetz thimble. Counterintuitively, the seemingly natural criterion based on the imaginary part of the energy fails. Our work provides a coherent theory for characterizing the real-time edge dynamics of non-Hermitian lattices. Our predictions are testable in various non-Hermitian physical platforms.</description>

      <title>Ten-channel Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between independent optical combs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) frequency comb exhibits broad and narrow-linewidth frequency modes, which make it suitable for quantum communication. However, scalable quantum network based on multiple independent combs is still a challenge due to their fabrication-induced frequency mismatches. This limitation becomes critical in measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution, which requires high visibility of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between multiple frequency channels. Here, we experimentally demonstrate two independent DKS combs with ten spectrally aligned lines without any frequency locking system. The visibility for individual comb-line pairs reaches up to $46.72 \pm 0.63\%$ via precision frequency translation, establishing a foundation for deploying DKS combs in multi-user quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Flexible BiSel/NiO-based X-ray synapses bridging the functions of detection and memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, the X-ray detectors are widely used in medical imaging, industrial inspection, aerospace, and other fields, as the market demand for high-efficiency, flexible, and low-power detectors is increased. Although the traditional inorganic X-ray detection materials have achieved great success and effectiveness, they have their own limitations and let alone flexibility/bendability and memory function. In this study, we present the design of a BiSeI/NiO-based X-ray synaptic detector and its application in the simulation of biological synaptic processes. Herein, the BiSeI, a quasi-1D inorganic semiconductor, stands out as an ideal choice for the X-ray detectors, especially for flexible and portable devices due to its large atomic number, large photoelectric absorption coefficient, and mechanical plasticity. Meanwhile, the NiO-based materials provide the memory function required for the intelligent detection systems. Moreover, our devices offer notable advantages in terms of low power consumption, compared with traditional X-ray detectors. The BiSeI/NiO detectors demonstrate advanced features with an ultrahigh sensitivity, an ultralow detection limit, and include the paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and the transition from short- to long-term memory, maintaining the functionality on flexible substrates. This design represents a significant step toward the development of intelligent and flexible X-ray detectors.</description>

      <title>Harnessing of temporal dispersion for integrated pump filtering in spontaneous heralded single-photon generation processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cointegration of heralded single-photon generation and on-chip detection requires the ability to differentiate between pump light and single photons. We explored the dispersion-induced temporal separation of optical pulses to reach this goal. Our method exploits the distinct group velocities of pump light and single photons, as well as single-photon detectors with high timing resolution. We simulate the propagation for photon pair generation by spontaneous parametric down-conversion in titanium in-diffused waveguides in lithium niobate and thin-film lithium niobate, and spontaneous four-wave mixing in silicon on insulator and silicon nitride. For the different integration platforms, we show the propagation distance required to sufficiently distinguish between pump and single photons for different timing resolutions, and demonstrate that this should be feasible with current superconducting nanowire single-photon detector technologies. Finally, we experimentally simulate our approach using the dispersion in the optical fiber.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole Mie-resonant metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense lattices of photonic crystals can serve as artificial materials, with light propagation in these structures described by effective material parameters that surpass the capabilities of natural materials. In this study, we introduce a metamaterial that supports quadrupole magnetization, a characteristic rarely observed in existing structures. We experimentally demonstrate a magnetic quadrupole metamaterial associated with Mie-resonance-excited stop bands below the Bragg band. Additionally, we develop a theoretical model that addresses both dispersion and boundary conditions within this framework. Using a Fabry-Perot resonator as a case study, we validate our model and reveal that the quadrupole metamaterial can exhibit a markedly different reflection/transmission spectrum, including zero reflection at normal incidence. Our findings underscore the practical potential for both experimental and theoretical investigations of metamaterials that extend beyond the dipole approximation.</description>

      <title>Fast square-oscillations in semiconductor VCSELs with delayed orthogonal polarization feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an experimental investigation into the generation of self-sustained and fast square oscillations from the TE mode of semiconductor VCSELs with delayed orthogonal polarization feedback. We find that the low frequency switching originates from the rotation of the TE and TM modes facilitated by a long time delay, but the fast oscillations are anchored to the frequency beating between the TE and TM modes and are modified by a half-wavelength ($\lambda/2$) plate. A comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the nonlinear dynamics is conducted and the related mechanism is discussed. Our study not only deepens our comprehension of laser nonlinear dynamics but also offers an all-optical approach for producing specialized signals, which could be instrumental in applications such as optical communications and photonic computing leveraging the complexity of long-delay systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient PCSEL Design: A Data-Driven Approach for Design Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a data-driven design approach for photonic crystals to achieve high efficiency in photonic crystal surface-emitting lasers (PCSELs). By discretizing the photonic crystal structure into a grid, we enable the generation of arbitrary lattice designs. Multiple fully connected layers combined with a position embedding module extract essential features from the photonic crystal designs, while coupled-wave theory (CWT) is used to evaluate the efficiency (based on the ratio of surface-emitting to edge-emitting resonant) and quality factor Q. We introduce the NN model to evaluate the structures, and to find a better performance design according to the evaluation result. The model achieves high prediction accuracy, with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.780 for SEE and 0.887 for the log-transformed Q. Additionally, we perform Shapley value analysis to identify the most important Fourier coefficients, providing insights into the factors that impact the performance of PCSEL designs. Our work speeds up the design process and offers valuable guidance for optimizing high-performance PCSELs, supporting the development of fully photonic design automation (PDA).</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Superdirective and Superabsorptive Aperiodic Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a general theory of aperiodic subwavelength arrays for controlling electromagnetic waves. The considered platform is formed by an array of electrically small loaded scatterers above a ground plane. While the array is geometrically periodic, all the loads can be in general different, so that the distributions of currents induced by plane waves are not periodic. To allow analytical solutions, we study arrays of thin wires or strips loaded by bulk loads. We demonstrate a practical way of creating tunable and reconfigurable multifunctional devices, on examples of superdirective beam splitters, focusing lenses establishing subdiffraction focusing, and absorbers going beyond perfect absorption. Contrary to the constraints imposed by the Floquet theorem in periodic counterparts like periodic metasurfaces or metagratings, where a fixed angle of incidence and period dictate the propagating directions of reflected waves, the proposed aperiodic designs allow controlling all propagating modes in any direction, which provides more freedom in manipulating electromagnetic waves. We hope that these results can be useful in multiple applications, such as telecommunications, radar techniques, signal processing, and energy harnessing.</description>

      <title>Momentum-entangled two-photon interference for quantum-limited transverse-displacement estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme achieving the ultimate quantum precision for the estimation of the transverse displacement between two interfering photons. Such a transverse displacement could be caused, for example, by the refracting properties of the propagation medium or by the orientation of a system of mirrors. By performing transverse-momentum sampling interference between polarization-entangled pairs of photons that propagate with different momenta, we show that it is possible to perform transverse-displacement estimation with a precision that increases with the difference of the transverse momenta of the photons. We show that the precision achieved with our scheme is independent of the value of the displacement, useful when tracking a variable displacement. Moreover, only for small displacements, we show that the estimation can be performed without the need for transverse-momentum-resolving detectors. More fundamentally, we demonstrate that it is the quantum interference arising from two-photon entanglement in the transverse momenta at the very heart of the foreseen quantum-limited sensitivity in the spatial domain.</description>

      <title>Solving Dicke superradiance analytically: A compendium of methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10463v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present several analytical approaches to the Dicke superradiance problem, which involves determining the time evolution of the density operator for an initially inverted ensemble of $N$ identical two-level systems undergoing collective spontaneous emission. This serves as one of the simplest cases of open quantum system dynamics that allows for a fully analytical solution. We explore multiple methods to tackle this problem, yielding a solution valid for any time and any number of spins. These approaches range from solving coupled rate equations and identifying exceptional points in non-Hermitian evolution to employing combinatorial and probabilistic techniques, as well as utilizing a quantum jump unraveling of the master equation. The analytical solution is expressed as a residue sum obtained from a contour integral in the complex plane, suggesting the possibility of fully analytical solutions for a broader class of open quantum system dynamics problems.</description>
