      <title>Computable Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computable analysis typically topological spaces with countable bases are considered. The Theorem of Kreitz-Weihrauch implies that the subbase representation of a second-countable $T_0$ space is admissible with respect to the topology that the subbase generates. We consider generalizations of this setting to bases that are representable, but not necessarily countable. We introduce the notions of a computable presubbase and a computable prebase. We prove a generalization of the Theorem of Kreitz-Weihrauch for the presubbase representation that shows that any such representation is admissible with respect to the topology generated by compact intersections of the presubbase elements. For computable prebases we obtain representations that are admissible with respect to the topology that they generate. These concepts provide a natural way to investigate many topological spaces that have been studied in computable analysis. The benefit of this approach is that topologies can be described by their usual subbases and standard constructions for such subbases can be applied. Finally we discuss a Galois connection between presubbases and representations of $T_0$ spaces that indicates that presubbases and representations offer particular views on the same mathematical structure from different perspectives.</description>

      <title>The Axiom of Real Determinacy and the Axiom of Real Blackwell Determinacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Axiom of Real Determinacy $\mathsf{AD}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and the Axiom of Real Blackwell Determinacy $\mathsf{Bl}\text{-}\mathsf{AD}_{\mathbb{R}}$ are equivalent in $\mathsf{ZF}$+$\mathsf{DC}$. This answers the question of L\"{o}we [15, Question 53]. While we do not know whether they are equivalent in $\mathsf{ZF}$+$\mathsf{AC}_{\omega} (\mathbb{R})$, we show that the theories $\mathsf{ZF}$+$\mathsf{AD}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $\mathsf{ZF}$+$\mathsf{AC}_{\omega} (\mathbb{R})$+$\mathsf{Bl}\text{-}\mathsf{AD}_{\mathbb{R}}$ are equiconsistent.</description>

      <title>A note on adding isomorphisms and the pseudointersection number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for every tower $\mathcal T$ there are $\aleph_1$-dense $A$ and $B$ so that any ``reasonable" forcing notion $\mathbb{P}$ -- an adjective that includes all known ones -- for making $A$ and $B$ isomorphic will add a pseudointersection for the tower. This shows in particular that $\mathsf{MA}_{\aleph_1}(\sigma{\rm -centered})$ holds in all known models of $\mathsf{BA}$, which provides intrigue to well known questions of Todor\v{c}evi\'c and Stepr\=ans-Watson.</description>

      <title>The isomorphism problem for finitely generated bi-orderable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the classification problem for finitely generated orderable groups from the viewpoint of descriptive set theory. We define the space of finitely generated left-orderable groups, and the subspace of finitely generated bi-orderable groups using spaces of relative cones, and show that both spaces are Polish. We use this setup to show that the isomorphism relation on the space of finitely generated bi-orderable groups is weakly universal.</description>

      <title>Topological weak containment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build on work of Elek and Zucker and develop a topological analogue of the theory of weak containment. We show that definitions in terms of local patterns, containment in ultra(co)products, and continuous model theory are all equivalent, just as in ergodic theory. And, for actions on Cantor space, we show these are all equivalent to approximate conjugacy.
  Restricting our attention to Cantor space, we connect this theory to questions about generic actions. We show how the shape of the space of weak equivalence classes reflects the geometry of the acting group. And, we show that, for $\mathbb{Z}^2$, there is no smallest limit of finite actions.</description>

      <title>Cut-elimination for the alternation-free modal mu-calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a syntactic cut-elimination procedure for the alternation-free fragment of the modal mu-calculus. Cut reduction is carried out within a cyclic proof system, where proofs are finitely branching but may be non-wellfounded. The structure of such proofs is exploited to directly transform a cyclic proof with cuts into a cut-free one, without detouring through other logics or relying on intermediate machinery for regularisation. Novel ingredients include the use of multicuts and results from the theory of well-quasi-orders, the later used in the termination argument.</description>

      <title>The information content of points on lines and $k$-plane extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a new lower bound on the algorithmic information content of points lying on a line in $\mathbb{R}^n$. More precisely, we show that a typical point $z$ on any line $\ell$ satisfies
  \begin{equation*}
  K_r(z)\geq \frac{K_r(\ell)}{2} + r - o(r)
  \end{equation*}
  at every precision $r$. In other words, a randomly chosen point on a line has (at least) half of the complexity of the line plus the complexity of its first coordinate. We apply this effective result to establish a classical bound on how much the Hausdorff dimension of a union of positive measure subsets of $k$-planes can increase when each subset is replaced with the entire $k$-plane. To prove the complexity bound, we modify a recent idea of Cholak-Cs\"ornyei-Lutz-Lutz-Mayordomo-Stull.</description>

Abstract: We first present a Priestley-style dualitiy for the classes of algebras that are the algebraic counterpart of some congruential, finitary and filter-distributive logic with theorems. Then we analyze which properties of the dual spaces correspond to properties that the logic might enjoy, like the deduction theorem or the existence of a disjunction.</description>

      <title>Propositional Calculus with Multiple Negations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One advantage of paraconsistent logic is that it can deal with inconsistencies without making the system trivial. However, unlike classical propositional calculus, its deductive system is limited, and the meaning of paraconsistent negation is still not clear. This article presents a logical system that brings together the strengths of both approaches. The Propositional Calculus with Multiple Negations $\left(\textbf{CPN}_{n}\right)$ is a generalization of classical propositional logic in which a finite number of negations (each weaker than the classical one but with similar behavior) are added. This makes it possible to introduce weak inconsistencies in a controlled way without leading to triviality.</description>

      <title>Comparing and Contrasting Arrow's Impossibility Theorem and G\"odel's Incompleteness Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incomputability results in formal logic and the Theory of Computation (i.e., incompleteness and undecidability) have deep implications for the foundations of mathematics and computer science. Likewise, Social Choice Theory, a branch of Welfare Economics, contains several impossibility results that place limits on the potential fairness, rationality and consistency of social decision-making processes. However, a relationship between G\"odel's Incompleteness Theorems in formal logic, and Arrow's Impossibility Theorem in Social Choice Theory is lacking. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a general mathematical object called a Self-Reference System. Impossibility in Social Choice Theory is demonstrated to correspond to the impossibility of a Self-Reference System to interpret its own internal consistency. We also provide a proof of G\"odel's First Incompleteness Theorem in the same terms. The two results are shown to arise out of self-referential paradoxes. Nevertheless, we show that the mechanisms generating Arrovian impossibility and G\"odelian incompleteness have subtle differences.</description>

Abstract: We show that the class of Kalmar elementary functions can be inductively generated from the addition, the integer remainder and the base-two exponentiation, hence improving previous results by Marchenkov and Mazzanti. We also prove that the substitution basis defined by these three operations is minimal. Furthermore, we discuss alternative substitution bases under arity constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study projective functions. We prove that projective functions generalise lower and upper-semianalytic ones while being stable by composition and difference. We show that the class of projective functions is closed under sums, differences, products, finite suprema and infima, sections and compositions. Assuming the set-theoretical axiom of Projective Determinacy, we also prove measurable selection results, stability under integration, and the existence of $\epsilon$-optimal selectors. Finally, we illustrate how these results are important in the context of model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Cofibrant generation of pure monomorphisms in presheaf categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterise when the pure monomorphisms in a presheaf category $\mathbf{Set}^\mathcal{C}$ are cofibrantly generated in terms of the category $\mathcal{C}$. In particular, when $\mathcal{C}$ is a monoid $S$ this characterises cofibrant generation of pure monomorphisms between sets with an $S$-action in terms of $S$: this happens if and only if for all $a, b \in S$ there is $c \in S$ such that $a = cb$ or $ca = b$. We give a model-theoretic proof: we prove that our characterisation is equivalent to having a stable independence relation, which in turn is equivalent to cofibrant generation. As a corollary, we show that pure monomorphisms in acts over the multiplicative monoid of natural numbers are not cofibrantly generated.</description>

Abstract: A random rooted graph is said to be sofic if it is the Benjamini-Schramm limit of a sequence of finite graphs. Given any finite graph $H$, we prove that every one-ended, unimodular random rooted graph that does not have H as a minor must be sofic. The hypothesis regarding the number of ends can be dropped under the additional assumption that the graph is quasi-transitive.</description>

Abstract: The paper considers computable Folner sequences in computably enumerable amenable groups. We extend some basic results of M. Cavaleri on existence of such sequences to the case of groups where finite generation is not assumed. We also initiate some new directions in this topic, for example complexity of families of effective Folner sequences. Possible extensions of this approach to metric groups are also discussed.
  This paper also contains some unpublished results from the paper of the first author arXiv:1904.02640.</description>

      <title>A new characterization of (pre)liminary C*-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20980v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an arbitrary countable ordinal $\alpha $, we introduce the notion of type $I_{\alpha }$ C*-algebra and $\alpha $-subhomogeneous C*-algebra. When $\alpha =0$, these recover the notions of Fell C*-algebra and of commutative C*-algebra, respectively. When $\alpha = n &lt;\omega $, these recover the notions of type $I_{n}$ C*-algebra and of $n$-subhomogeneous C*-algebra, respectively. We prove that a separable C*-algebra is liminary if and only if it is type $I_{\alpha }$ for some $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$, and it is preliminary (i.e., has no infinite-dimensional irreducible representation) if and only if it is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous for some $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$. We also prove that for any countable ordinal $\alpha $ there exists a separable C*-algebra that is type $I_{\alpha }$ and not type $I_{\beta }$ for $\beta &lt;\alpha $, and a separable C*-algebra that is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous and not $\beta $-subhomogeneous for any $\beta &lt;\alpha $.</description>
