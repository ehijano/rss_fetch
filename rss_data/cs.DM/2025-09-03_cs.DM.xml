      <title>Sorting with constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the generalized sorting problem, where we are given a set of $n$ elements to be sorted, but only a subset of all possible pairwise element comparisons is allowed. We look at the problem from the perspective of the graph formed by the ``forbidden'' pairs, and we parameterize algorithms using the clique number and the chromatic number of this graph. We also extend these results to the class of problems where the input graph is not necessarily sortable, and one is only interested in discovering the partial order. We use our results to develop a simple algorithm that always determines the underlying partial order in $O(n^{3/2} \log n)$ probes, when the input graph is an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi graph.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Linear Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a static data structure problem of computing a linear operator under cell-probe model. Given a linear operator $M \in \mathbb{F}_2^{m \times n}$, the goal is to pre-process a vector $X \in \mathbb{F}_2^n$ into a data structure of size $s$ to answer any query $\langle M_i , X \rangle$ in time $t$. We prove that for a random operator $M$, any such data structure requires:
  $$ t \geq \Omega ( \min \{ \log (m/s) , n / \log s \} ).$$ This result overcomes the well-known logarithmic barrier in static data structures [MNSW98, Sie04, PD06, PTW08, Pat11, DGW19] by using a random linear operator. Furthermore, it provides the first significant progress toward confirming a decades-old folklore conjecture: that non-linear pre-processing does not substantially help in computing most linear operators.
  A straightforward modification of our proof also yields a wire lower bound of $\Omega(n \cdot \log^{1/d}(n))$ for depth-$d$ circuits with arbitrary gates that compute a specific linear operator $M \in \mathbb{F}_2^{O(n) \times n}$, even against some small constant advantage over random guessing. This bound holds even for circuits with only a small constant advantage over random guessing, improving upon longstanding results [RS03, Che08a, Che08b, GHK+13] for a random operator.
  Finally, our work partially resolves the communication form of the Multiphase Conjecture [Pat10] and makes progress on Jukna-Schnitger's Conjecture [JS11, Juk12]. We address the former by considering the Inner Product (mod 2) problem (instead of Set Disjointness) when the number of queries $m$ is super-polynomial (e.g., $2^{n^{1/3}}$), and the total update time is $m^{0.99}$. Our result for the latter also applies to cases with super-polynomial $m$.</description>

      <title>Homotopy equivalence of digital pictures in $\mathbb{Z}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of digital homotopy in the context of digital pictures $(X,\kappa,\bar \kappa)$, where $X\subsetneq \mathbb{Z}^n$ is a finite set, $\kappa$ is an adjacency relation on $X$, and $\bar \kappa$ is an adjacency relation on the complement of $X$. In particular we focus on homotopy equivalence between digital pictures in $\mathbb{Z}^2$. We define a numerical homotopy-type invariant for digital pictures in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ called the outer perimeter, which is a basic tool for distinguishing homotopy types of digital pictures. When a digital pictures has no holes, we show that it is homotopy equivalent to its rc-convex hull, obtained by ``filling in the gaps'' of any row or column. We show that a digital picture $(X,c_i,c_j)$ is homotopy equivalent to only finitely many other digital pictures $(Y,c_i,c_j)$. At the end of the paper, we raise a conjecture on the row-column-convex hull of a digital picture.</description>

      <title>Fast approximation algorithms for the 1-median problem on real-world large graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 1-median problem (1MP) on undirected weighted graphs seeks to find a facility location minimizing the total weighted distance to all customer nodes. Although the 1MP can be solved exactly by computing the single-source shortest paths from each customer node, such approaches become computationally expensive on large-scale graphs with millions of nodes. In many real-world applications, such as recommendation systems based on large-scale knowledge graphs, the number of nodes (i.e., potential facility locations) is enormous, whereas the number of customer nodes is relatively small and spatially concentrated. In such cases, exhaustive graph exploration is not only inefficient but also unnecessary. Leveraging this observation, we propose three approximation algorithms that reduce computation by terminating Dijkstra's algorithm early. We provide theoretical analysis showing that one of the proposed algorithms guarantees an approximation ratio of 2, whereas the other two improve this ratio to 1.618. We demonstrate that the lower bound of the approximation ratio is 1.2 by presenting a specific instance. Moreover, we show that all proposed algorithms return optimal solutions when the number of customer nodes is less than or equal to three. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our algorithms significantly outperform baseline exact methods in runtime while maintaining near-optimal accuracy across all tested graph types. Notably, on grid graphs with 10 million nodes, our algorithms obtains all optimal solutions within 1 millisecond, whereas the baseline exact method requires over 70 seconds on average.</description>

      <title>Representation number of word-representable co-bipartite graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph $G = (V, E)$ is said to be word-representable if there exists a word $w$ over the alphabet $V$ such that, for any two distinct letters $x, y \in V$, the letters $x$ and $y$ alternate in $w$ if and only if $xy \in E$. A graph is co-bipartite if its complement is bipartite. Therefore, the vertex set of a co-bipartite graph can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets $X$ and $Y$ such that the subgraphs induced by $X$ and $Y$ are cliques.
  The concept of word-representability for graph classes has gained significant attention in recent years. The book Words and Graphs by Sergey Kitaev and Vadim Lozin presents examples of co-bipartite graphs that are not word-representable. It is known that a graph is word-representable if and only if it admits a semi-transitive orientation. Although the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a semi-transitive orientation in co-bipartite graphs have been established, the characterization based on vertex ordering remains open. In this paper, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for a co-bipartite graph to be word-representable in terms of its vertex ordering. Furthermore, based on this vertex ordering, we provide an algorithm to construct a $3$-uniform word-representation for any word-representable co-bipartite graph. Using this result, we prove that except for the permutation graphs, the representation number of all other word-representable co-bipartite graphs is $3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph is $k$-gap-planar if it has a drawing in the plane such that every crossing can be charged to one of the two edges involved so that at most $k$ crossings are charged to each edge. We show this class of graphs has linear expansion. In particular, every $r$-shallow minor of a $k$-gap-planar graph has density $O(rk)$. Several extensions of this result are proved: for topological minors, for $k$-cover-planar graphs, for $k$-gap-cover-planar graphs, and for drawings on any surface. Application to graph colouring are presented.</description>

      <title>Line Graphs of Non-Word-Representable Graphs are Not Always Non-Word-Representable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph is said to be word-representable if there exists a word over its vertex set such that any two vertices are adjacent if and only if they alternate in the word. If no such word exists, the graph is non-word-representable. In the literature, there are examples of non-word-representable graphs whose line graphs are non-word-representable. However, it is an open problem to determine whether the line graph of a non-word-representable graph is always non-word-representable or not? In this work, we address the open problem by considering a class of non-word-representable graphs, viz., Mycielski graphs of odd cycles of length at least five, and show that their line graphs are word-representable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Row Impartial Terminus (RIT), an impartial combinatorial game played on integer partitions. We show that any position in RIT can be uniquely decomposed into a core and a remnant. Our central result is that the Conway pair of any RIT position-which determines the outcome under both normal and mis\`ere play-is identical to the Conway pair of a corresponding position in the game of Nim defined by the remnant. This finding provides a complete winning strategy for both variants of RIT, reducing its analysis to the well-understood framework of Nim. As a consequence, we classify RIT within the Conway-Gurvich-Ho hierarchy, showing it to be forced and miserable but not pet.</description>

      <title>KKL theorem for the influence of a set of variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a Boolean function f on the n-dimensional hypercube, and a set of variables (indexed by) $S \subset \{1,2,\ldots,n\}.$ The coalition influence of the variables S on a function f is the probability that after a random assignment of variables not in S, the value of f is undetermined. In this paper, we study a complementary notion, which we call the joint influence: the probability that, after a random assignment of variables not in S, the value of f is dependent on all variables in S.
  We show that for an arbitrary fixed d, every Boolean function f on n variables admits a d-set of joint influence at least $\tfrac{1}{10} W^{\geq d}(f) (\frac{\log n}{n})^d$, where $W^{\geq d}(f)$ is the Fourier weight of f at degrees at least d. This result is a direct generalisation of the Kahn-Kalai-Linial theorem. Further, we give an example demonstrating essential sharpness of the above bound. In our study of the joint influence we consider another notion of multi-bit influence recently introduced by Tal.</description>

      <title>Log-concavity of the independence polynomials of $\mathbf{W}_{p}$ graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph of order $n$. For a positive integer $p$, $G$ is said to be a $\mathbf{W}_{p}$ graph if $n\geq p$ and every $p$ pairwise disjoint independent sets of $G$ are contained within $p$ pairwise disjoint maximum independent sets. In this paper, we establish that every connected $\mathbf{W}_{p}$ graph $G$ is $p$-quasi-regularizable if and only if $n\geq(p+1)\cdot\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the independence number of $G$ and $p\neq2$. This finding ensures that the independence polynomial of a connected $\mathbf{W}_{p}$ graph $G$ is log-concave whenever $(p+1)\cdot\alpha\leq n\leq p\cdot\alpha+2\sqrt{p\cdot\alpha+p}$ and $\frac{\alpha^{2}}{4\left( \alpha+1\right) }\leq p$, or $p\cdot\alpha+2\sqrt{p\cdot\alpha+p}&lt;n\leq \frac{\left( \alpha^{2}+1\right) \cdot p+\left( \alpha-1\right) ^{2}}{\alpha-1}$ and $\frac{\alpha\left( \alpha-1\right) }{\alpha+1}\leq p$. Moreover, the clique corona graph $G\circ K_{p}$ serves as an example of the $\mathbf{W}_{p}$ graph class. We further demonstrate that the independence polynomial of $G\circ K_{p}$ is always log-concave for sufficiently large $p$.

      <description>arXiv:2501.03379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An independent set may not contain both a vertex and one of its neighbours. This basic fact makes the uniform distribution over independent sets rather special. We consider the hard-core model, an essential generalization of the uniform distribution over independent sets. We show how its local analysis yields remarkable insights into the global structure of independent sets in the host graph, in connection with, for instance, Ramsey numbers, graph colourings, and sphere packings.</description>

      <title>On Supportedness in Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses an inconsistency in various definitions of supported non-dominated points within multi-objective combinatorial problems (MOCO). MOCO problems are known to contain supported and unsupported non-dominated points, with the latter typically outnumbering the former. Supported points are, in general, easier to determine, can serve as representations, and are used in two-phase methods to generate the entire non-dominated point set. Despite their importance, several different characterizations for supported efficient solutions (and supported non-dominated points) are used in the literature.
  While these definitions are equivalent for multi-objective linear problems, they can yield different sets of supported non-dominated points for MOCO problems. We show by an example that these definitions are not equivalent for MOCO or general multi-objective optimization problems. Moreover, we analyze the structural and computational properties of the resulting sets of supported non-dominated points. These considerations motivate us to summarize equivalent definitions and characterizations for supported efficient solutions and to introduce a distinction between supported and weakly supported efficient solutions.</description>

      <title>On multiplicities of interpoint distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04283v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a set $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points and a distance $d&gt;0$, the multiplicity of $d$ is the number of times the distance $d$ appears between points in $X$. Let $a_1(X) \geq a_2(X) \geq \cdots \geq a_m(X)$ denote the multiplicities of the $m$ distances determined by $X$ and let $a(X)=\left(a_1(X),\dots,a_m(X)\right)$. In this paper, we study several questions from Erd\H{o}s's time regarding distance multiplicities. Among other results, we show that:
  (1) If $X$ is convex or ``not too convex'', then there exists a distance other than the diameter that has multiplicity at most $n$.
  (2) There exists a set $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, such that many distances occur with high multiplicity. In particular, at least $n^{\Omega(1/\log\log{n})}$ distances have superlinear multiplicity in $n$.
  (3) For any (not necessarily fixed) integer $1\leq k\leq\log{n}$, there exists $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, such that the difference between the $k^{\text{th}}$ and $(k+1)^{\text{th}}$ largest multiplicities is at least $\Omega(\frac{n\log{n}}{k})$. Moreover, the distances in $X$ with the largest $k$ multiplicities can be prescribed.
  (4) For every $n\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, not all collinear or cocircular, such that $a(X)= (n-1,n-2,\ldots,1)$. There also exists $Y\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points with pairwise distinct distance multiplicities and $a(Y) \neq (n-1,n-2,\ldots,1)$.</description>
