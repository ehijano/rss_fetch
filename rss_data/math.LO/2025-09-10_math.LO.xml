      <title>Taylor expansions over generalised power series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of formal Taylor expansions for functions defined on fields of generalised series. We prove a general result for the existence and convergence of those expansions for fields equipped with a derivation and an exponential function, and apply this to the case of standard fields of transseries, such as $\log$-$\exp$ transseries and $\omega$-series.</description>

      <title>Decidability in First-Order Modal Logic with Non-Rigid Constants and Definite Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While modal extensions of decidable fragments of first-order logic are usually undecidable, their monodic counterparts, in which formulas in the scope of modal operators have at most one free variable, are typically decidable. This only holds, however, under the provision that non-rigid constants, definite descriptions and non-trivial counting are not admitted. Indeed, several monodic fragments having at least one of these features are known to be undecidable. We investigate these features systematically and show that fundamental monodic fragments such as the two-variable fragment with counting and the guarded fragment of standard first-order modal logics $\mathbf{K}_{n}$ and $\mathbf{S5}_{n}$ are decidable. Tight complexity bounds are established as well. Under the expanding-domain semantics, we show decidability of the basic modal logic extended with the transitive closure operator on finite acyclic frames; this logic, however, is Ackermann-hard.</description>

      <title>Some Results on Finitely Splitting Subtrees of Aronszajn Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any $2 \le n &lt; \omega$, we introduce a forcing poset using generalized promises which adds a normal $n$-splitting subtree to a $(\ge \! n)$-splitting normal Aronszajn tree. Using this forcing poset, we prove several consistency results concerning finitely splitting subtrees of Aronszajn trees. For example, it is consistent that there exists an infinitely splitting Suslin tree whose topological square is not Lindel\"{o}f, which solves an open problem due to Marun. For any $2 &lt; n &lt; \omega$, it is consistent that every $(\ge \! n)$-splitting normal Aronszajn tree contains a normal $n$-splitting subtree, but there exists a normal infinitely splitting Aronszajn tree which contains no $(&lt; \! n)$-splitting subtree. To show the latter consistency result, we prove a forcing iteration preservation theorem related to not adding new small-splitting subtrees of Aronszajn trees.</description>

      <title>The number of normal measures, revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new version of the Friedman-Magidor theorem: for every measurable cardinal $\kappa$ and $\tau\leq\kappa^{++}$, there exists a forcing extension $V\subseteq V[G]$ such that any normal measure $U\in V$ on $\kappa$ has exactly $\tau$ distinct lifts in $V[G]$, and every normal measure on $\kappa$ in $V[G]$ arises as such a lift. This version differs from the original Friedman-Magidor theorem in several notable ways. First, the new technique does not involve forcing over canonical inner models or rely on any fine-structural tools or assumptions, allowing it to be applied in the realm of large cardinals beyond the current reach of the inner model program. Second, in the case where $\tau\leq \kappa^+$, all lifts of a normal measure $U\in V$ on $\kappa$ to $V[G]$ have the same ultrapower. Finally, the technique generalizes to a version of the Friedman-Magidor theorem for extenders. An additional advantage is that the forcing used is notably simple, relying only on nonstationary support product forcing.</description>

      <title>Groups with infinite linearly ordered products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a formalism of infinite, linearly ordered products in general groups. Using this, we define infinite compositions in certain groups of formal power series such as transseries. We show that such groups can sometimes be represented as infinite, linearly ordered, semidirect products of ordered Abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Formal conjugacy and asymptotic differential algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17036v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study conjugacy of formal derivations on fields of generalised power series in characteristic 0. Casting the problem of Poincar\'e resonance in terms of asymptotic differential algebra, we give conditions for conjugacy of parabolic flat log-exp transseries, flat grid-based transseries, logarithmic transseries, power series with exponents and coefficients in an ordered field, and formal Puiseux series.</description>

      <title>Topological groups with tractable minimal dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Polish group $G$ has the generic point property if any minimal $G$-flow admits a comeager orbit, or equivalently if the universal minimal flow (UMF) does. The class $\mathsf{GPP}$ of such Polish groups is a proper extension of the class $\sf{PCMD}$ of Polish groups with metrizable UMF. Motivated by analogous results for $\mathsf{PCMD}$, we define and explore a robust generalization of $\sf{GPP}$ which makes sense for all topological groups, thus defining the class $\mathsf{TMD}$ of topological groups with tractable minimal dynamics. These characterizations yield novel results even for $\mathsf{GPP}$; for instance, a Polish group is in $\mathsf{GPP}$ iff its UMF has no points of first countability.
  Motivated by work of Kechris, Pestov, and Todor\v{c}evi\'c that connects topological dynamics and structural Ramsey theory, we state and prove an abstract KPT correspondence which characterizes the class $\mathsf{TMD}$ and shows that $\mathsf{TMD}$ is $\Delta_1$ in the L\'evy hierarchy. We then develop set-theoretic methods which allow us to apply forcing and absoluteness arguments to generalize numerous results about $\mathsf{GPP}$ to all of $\mathsf{TMD}$. We also apply these new set-theoretic methods to first generalize parts of Glasner's structure theorem for minimal, metrizable tame flows to the non-metrizable setting, and then to prove the revised Newelski conjecture regarding definable NIP groups. We conclude by discussing some tantalizing connections between definable NIP groups and $\mathsf{TMD}$ groups.</description>

      <title>Homological Invariants of Higher-Order Equational Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many first-order equational theories, such as the theory of groups or boolean algebras, can be presented by a smaller set of axioms than the original one. Recent studies showed that a homological approach to equational theories gives us inequalities to obtain lower bounds on the number of axioms. In this paper, we extend this result to higher-order equational theories. More precisely, we consider simply typed lambda calculus with product and unit types and study sets of equations between lambda terms. Then, we define homology groups of the given equational theory and show that a lower bound on the number of equations can be computed from the homology groups.</description>
