      <title>AbFlow : End-to-end Paratope-Centric Antibody Design by Interaction Enhanced Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antigen-antibody binding is a critical process in the immune response. Although recent progress has advanced antibody design, current methods lack a generative framework for end-to-end modeling of full-atom antibody structures and struggle to fully exploit antigen-specific geometric information for optimizing local binding interfaces and global structures. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AbFlow, a flow-matching framework that leverages optimal transport to design full-atom antibodies end-to-end. AbFlow incorporates an extended velocity field network featuring an equivariant Surface Multi-channel Encoder, which uses surface-level antigen interaction data to refine the antibody structure, particularly the CDR-H3 region. Extensive experiments in paratoep-centric antibody design, multi-CDRs and full-atom antibody design, binding affinity optimization, and complex structure prediction show that AbFlow produces superior antigen-antibody complexes, especially at the contact interface, and markedly improves the binding affinity of generated antibodies.</description>

      <title>scDFM: Distributional Flow Matching Model for Robust Single-Cell Perturbation Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central goal in systems biology and drug discovery is to predict the transcriptional response of cells to perturbations. This task is challenging due to the noisy and sparse nature of single-cell measurements, as well as the fact that perturbations often induce population-level shifts rather than changes in individual cells. Existing deep learning methods typically assume cell-level correspondences, limiting their ability to capture such global effects. We present scDFM, a generative framework based on conditional flow matching that models the full distribution of perturbed cells conditioned on control states. By incorporating a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) objective, our method aligns perturbed and control populations beyond cell-level correspondences. To further improve robustness to sparsity and noise, we introduce the Perturbation-Aware Differential Transformer (PAD-Transformer), a backbone architecture that leverages gene interaction graphs and differential attention to capture context-specific expression changes. Across multiple genetic and drug perturbation benchmarks, scDFM consistently outperforms prior methods, demonstrating strong generalization in both unseen and combinatorial settings. In the combinatorial setting, it reduces mean squared error by 19.6% relative to the strongest baseline. These results highlight the importance of distribution-level generative modeling for robust in silico perturbation prediction.

      <title>Generative structural elucidation from mass spectra as an iterative optimization problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is a critical analytical technique for molecular identification across metabolomics, environmental chemistry, and chemical forensics. A variety of computational methods have emerged for structural annotation of spectral features of interest, but many of these features cannot be confidently annotated with reference structures or spectra. Here, we introduce FOAM (Formula-constrained Optimization for Annotating Metabolites), a computational workflow that poses structure elucidation from LC-MS/MS as an iterative optimization problem. FOAM couples a formula-constrained graph genetic algorithm with spectral simulation to explore candidate annotations given an experimental spectrum. We demonstrate FOAM's performance on the NIST'20 and MassSpecGym datasets as both a standalone elucidation pipeline and as a complement to existing inverse models. This work establishes iterative optimization as an effective and extensible paradigm for structural elucidation.</description>

      <title>Oxi-Shapes: Tropical geometric analysis of bounded redox proteomic state spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Redox proteomics generates bounded biochemical measurements that are categorically mismatched to conventional linear algebraic formalisms. This work introduces Oxi-Shapes, a tropical geometric framework for the measurement-native analysis of bounded redox proteomic data. Oxi-Shapes represents cysteine oxidation as a scalar field over a discrete lattice, enabling global and site-wise analysis without rescaling, interpolation, or kinetic assumptions. At the global level, the framework yields internal redox entropy, lattice curvature, and derived energy functionals that characterise the geometric structure of the redox proteome. At the site level, Oxi-Shapes defines a bounded change space that makes explicit hard geometric constraints on admissible redox transitions and enables a normalised signed representation of site-wise change as a fraction of available redox freedom. Applied to an ageing mouse brain dataset, Oxi-Shapes reveals that a small decrease in mean oxidation arises from a profound redistribution of site-wise redox states, with thousands of residues shifting toward the reduced absorbing boundary. These results demonstrate that categorically correct algebraic representations expose structure in proteomic data that is inaccessible to mean-centric or unbounded analyses.</description>

      <title>Deep-learning-based pan-phenomic data reveals the explosive evolution of avian visual disparity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of biological morphology is critical for understanding the diversity of the natural world, yet traditional analyses often involve subjective biases in the selection and coding of morphological traits. This study employs deep learning techniques, utilising a ResNet34 model capable of recognising over 10,000 bird species, to explore avian morphological evolution. We extract weights from the model's final fully connected (fc) layer and investigate the semantic alignment between the high-dimensional embedding space learned by the model and biological phenotypes. The results demonstrate that the high-dimensional embedding space encodes phenotypic convergence. Subsequently, we assess the morphological disparity among various taxa and evaluate the association between morphological disparity and species richness, demonstrating that species richness is the primary driver of morphospace expansion. Moreover, the disparity-through-time analysis reveals a visual "early burst" after the K-Pg extinction.
  While mainly aimed at evolutionary analysis, this study also provides insights into the interpretability of Deep Neural Networks. We demonstrate that hierarchical semantic structures (biological taxonomy) emerged in the high-dimensional embedding space despite being trained on flat labels. Furthermore, through adversarial examples, we provide evidence that our model in this task can overcome texture bias and learn holistic shape representations (body plans), challenging the prevailing view that CNNs rely primarily on local textures.</description>

      <title>DrugR: Optimizing Molecular Drugs through LLM-based Explicit Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecule generation and optimization is a fundamental task in chemical domain. The rapid development of intelligent tools, especially large language models (LLMs) with powerful knowledge reserves and interactive capabilities, has provided new paradigms for it. Nevertheless, the intrinsic challenge for LLMs lies in the complex implicit relationship between molecular structure and pharmacological properties and the lack of corresponding labeled data. To bridge this gap, we propose DrugR, an LLM-based method that introduces explicit, step-by-step pharmacological reasoning into the optimization process. Our approach integrates domain-specific continual pretraining, supervised fine-tuning via reverse data engineering, and self-balanced multi-granular reinforcement learning. This framework enables DrugR to effectively improve key ADMET properties while preserving the original molecule's core efficacy. Experimental results demonstrate that DrugR achieves comprehensive enhancement across multiple properties without compromising structural similarity or target binding affinity. Importantly, its explicit reasoning process provides clear, interpretable rationales for each optimization step, yielding actionable design insights and advancing toward automated, knowledge-driven scientific discovery. Our code and model checkpoints are open-sourced to foster future research.</description>

      <title>Central Dogma Transformer II: An AI Microscope for Understanding Cellular Regulatory Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current biological AI models lack interpretability -- their internal representations do not correspond to biological relationships that
  researchers can examine. Here we present CDT-II, an "AI microscope" whose attention maps are directly interpretable as regulatory structure.
  By mirroring the central dogma in its architecture, each attention mechanism corresponds to a specific biological relationship: DNA
  self-attention for genomic relationships, RNA self-attention for gene co-regulation, and DNA-to-RNA cross-attention for transcriptional
  control. Using only genomic embeddings and raw per-cell expression, CDT-II enables experimental biologists to observe regulatory networks in
  their own data. Applied to K562 CRISPRi data, CDT-II predicts perturbation effects (per-gene mean $r = 0.84$) and recovers the GFI1B
  regulatory network without supervision (6.6-fold enrichment, $P = 3.5 \times 10^{-17}$). Two distinct attention mechanisms converge on an RNA
  processing module ($P = 1 \times 10^{-16}$). CDT-II establishes mechanism-oriented AI as an alternative to task-oriented approaches, revealing
  regulatory structure rather than merely optimizing predictions.</description>

      <title>A practical identifiability criterion leveraging weak-form parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17373v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we define a practical identifiability criterion, (e, q)-identifiability, based on a parameter e, reflecting the noise in observed variables, and a parameter q, reflecting the mean-square error of the parameter estimator. This criterion is better able to encompass changes in the quality of the parameter estimate due to increased noise in the data (compared to existing criteria based solely on average relative errors). Furthermore, we leverage a weak-form equation error-based method of parameter estimation for systems with unobserved variables to assess practical identifiability far more quickly in comparison to output error-based parameter estimation. We do so by generating weak-form input-output equations using differential algebra techniques, as previously proposed by Boulier et al [1], and then applying Weak form Estimation of Nonlinear Dynamics (WENDy) to obtain parameter estimates. This method is computationally efficient and robust to noise, as demonstrated through two classical biological modelling examples.</description>

      <title>Predicting brain tumour enhancement from non-contrast MR imaging with artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brain tumour imaging assessment typically requires both pre- and post-contrast MRI, but gadolinium administration is not always desirable, such as in frequent follow-up, renal impairment, allergy, or paediatric patients. We aimed to develop and validate a deep learning model capable of predicting brain tumour contrast enhancement from non-contrast MRI sequences alone. We assembled 11089 brain MRI studies from 10 international datasets spanning adult and paediatric populations with various neuro-oncological states, including glioma, meningioma, metastases, and post-resection appearances. Deep learning models (nnU-Net, SegResNet, SwinUNETR) were trained to predict and segment enhancing tumour using only non-contrast T1-, T2-, and T2/FLAIR-weighted images. Performance was evaluated on 1109 held-out test patients using patient-level detection metrics and voxel-level segmentation accuracy. Model predictions were compared against 11 expert radiologists who each reviewed 100 randomly selected patients. The best-performing nnU-Net achieved 83% balanced accuracy, 91.5% sensitivity, and 74.4% specificity in detecting enhancing tumour. Enhancement volume predictions strongly correlated with ground truth (R2 0.859). The model outperformed expert radiologists, who achieved 69.8% accuracy, 75.9% sensitivity, and 64.7% specificity. 76.8% of test patients had Dice over 0.3 (acceptable detection), 67.5% had Dice over 0.5 (good detection), and 50.2% had Dice over 0.7 (excellent detection). Deep learning can identify contrast-enhancing brain tumours from non-contrast MRI with clinically relevant performance. These models show promise as screening tools and may reduce gadolinium dependence in neuro-oncology imaging. Future work should evaluate clinical utility alongside radiology experts.</description>
