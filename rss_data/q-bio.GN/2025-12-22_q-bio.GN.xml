      <title>DNAMotifTokenizer: Towards Biologically Informed Tokenization of Genomic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17126v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA language models have advanced genomics, but their downstream performance varies widely due to differences in tokenization, pretraining data, and architecture. We argue that a major bottleneck lies in tokenizing sparse and unevenly distributed DNA sequence motifs, which are critical for accurate and interpretable models. To investigate, we systematically benchmark k-mer and Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers under controlled pretraining budget, evaluating across multiple downstream tasks from five datasets. We find that tokenizer choice induces task-specific trade-offs, and that vocabulary size and tokenizer training data strongly influence the biological knowledge captured. Notably, BPE tokenizers achieve strong performance when trained on smaller but biologically significant data. Building on these insights, we introduce DNAMotifTokenizer, which directly incorporates domain knowledge of DNA sequence motifs into the tokenization process. DNAMotifTokenizer consistently outperforms BPE across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating that knowledge-infused tokenization is crucial for learning powerful, interpretable, and generalizable genomic representations.</description>

      <title>BHiCect 2.0: Multi-resolution clustering of Hi-C data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromatin conformation capture technologies such as Hi-C have revealed that the genome is organized in a hierarchy of structures spanning multiple scales observed at different resolutions. Current algorithms often focus on specific interaction patterns found at a specific Hi-C resolution. We present BHi-Cect 2.0, a method that leverages Hi-C data at multiple resolutions to describe chromosome architecture as nested preferentially self-interacting clusters using spectral clustering. This new version describes the hierarchical configuration of chromosomes by now integrating multiple Hi-C data resolutions. Our new implementation offers a more comprehensive description of the multi-scale architecture of the chromosomes. We further provide these functionalities as an R package to assist their integration with other computational pipelines. The BHiCect 2.0 R packages is available on github at https://github.com/princeps091-binf/BHiCect2with the version used for this manuscript on Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17985844.</description>

      <title>Quantum Generative Modeling of Single-Cell transcriptomes: Capturing Gene-Gene and Cell-Cell Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data simulation is limited by classical methods that rely on linear correlations, failing to capture the intrinsic, nonlinear dependencies. No existing simulator jointly models gene-gene and cell-cell interactions. We introduce qSimCells, a novel quantum computing-based simulator that employs entanglement to model intra- and inter-cellular interactions, generating realistic single-cell transcriptomes with cellular heterogeneity. The core innovation is a quantum kernel that uses a parameterized quantum circuit with CNOT gates to encode complex, nonlinear gene regulatory network (GRN) as well as cell-cell communication topologies with explicit causal directionality. The resulting synthetic data exhibits non-classical dependencies: standard correlation-based analyses (Pearson and Spearman) fail to recover the programmed causal pathways and instead report spurious associations driven by high baseline gene-expression probabilities. Furthermore, applying cell-cell communication detection to the simulated data validates the true mechanistic links, revealing a robust, up to 75-fold relative increase in inferred communication probability only when quantum entanglement is active. These results demonstrate that the quantum kernel is essential for producing high-fidelity ground-truth datasets and highlight the need for advanced inference techniques to capture the complex, non-classical dependencies inherent in gene regulation.</description>
