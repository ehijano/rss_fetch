      <title>Two sequences of fully-nonlinear evolution equations and their symmetry properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the complete Lie point symmetry algebras of two sequences of odd-order evolution equations. This includes equations that are fully-nonlinear, i.e. nonlinear in the highest derivative. Two of the equations in the sequences have recently been identified as symmetry-integrable, namely a 3rd-order equation and a 5th-order equation [Open Communications in Nonlinear Mathematical Physics, Special Issue in honour of George W Bluman, ocnmp:15938, 1--15, 2025]. These two examples provided the motivation for the current study. The Lie-B\"acklund symmetries and the consequent symmetry-integrability of the equations in the sequences are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Superintegrable bosonic star networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of bosonic star networks involving a central site interacting with the surrounding environment sites. These networks are shown to be superintegrable. We present two forms of Bethe Ansatz solution providing expressions for the energy eigenvalues. A brief discussion is included on the potential applications.</description>

      <title>Ultra-discretization of Yang-Baxter maps, probability distributions and independence preserving property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the relationship between Yang-Baxter maps and the independence preserving (IP) property, motivated by their role in integrable systems, from the perspective of ultra-discretization. YangBaxter maps satisfy the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation, while the IP property ensures independence of transformed random variables. The relationship between these two seemingly unrelated properties has recently started to be studied in [Sasada and Uozumi, 2024]. Ultradiscretization is a concept primarily used in the context of integrable systems and is an area of active research, serving as a method for exploring the connections between different integrable systems. However, there are few studies on how the stationary distribution for integrable systems changes through ultra-discretization. In this paper, we introduce the concept of ultra-discretization for probability distributions, and prove that the properties of being a Yang-Baxter map and having the IP property are both preserved under ultra-discretization. Applying this to quadrirational Yang-Baxter maps, we confirm that their ultra-discrete versions retain these properties, yielding new examples of piecewise linear maps having the IP property. We also explore implications of our results for stationary distributions of integrable systems and pose several open questions.</description>

      <title>Tsunami Solitons Emerging from Superconducting Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a classical integrable system exhibiting the tsunami-like solitons with rocky-desert-like disordered stationary background. One of the Lax operators describing this system is interpretable as a Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian in parity-mixed superconductor. The family of integrable equations is generated from this seed operator by Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave limit includes the coupled Schr\"odinger-Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma physics. A linearly unstable finite background with superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we coin \textit{the KdV rocks}. In the Zakharov-Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are created from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in energy gap and the KdV rocks from normal electrons/holes. The unexpected large space of stationary solutions comes from the non-coprime Lax pair and the multi-valued Baker-Akhiezer functions on the Riemann surface, formulated in terms of higher-rank holomorphic bundles by Krichever and Novikov. Furthermore, the concept of \textit{isodispersive phases} is introduced to characterize quasiperiodic multi-tsunami backgrounds and consider its classification.</description>
