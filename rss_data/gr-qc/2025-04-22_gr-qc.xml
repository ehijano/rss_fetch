      <title>Non-singular anisotropic solutions for strange star model in $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{T},\mathcal{R}_{\zeta\gamma}\mathcal{T}^{\zeta\gamma})$ gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on different anisotropic models within the framework of a specific modified $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{T},\mathcal{R}_{\zeta\gamma}\mathcal{T}^{\zeta\gamma})$ gravity theory. The study adopts a static spherically symmetric spacetime to determine the field equations for two different modified models: (i) $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{T},\mathcal{R}_{\zeta\gamma}\mathcal{T}^{\zeta\gamma})=\mathcal{R}+\eta\mathcal{R}_{\zeta\gamma}\mathcal{T}^{\zeta\gamma}$, and (ii) $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{T},\mathcal{R}_{\zeta\gamma}\mathcal{T}^{\zeta\gamma})=\mathcal{R}(1+\eta\mathcal{R}_{\zeta\gamma}\mathcal{T}^{\zeta\gamma})$, where $\eta$ is a constant parameter. To address the additional degrees of freedom in the field equations and obtain their corresponding unique solution, the Durgapal-Fuloria spacetime geometry and MIT bag model are utilized. Matching conditions are applied to determine unknown constants within the chosen spacetime geometry. We adopt a certain range of model parameters to analyze the physical characteristics of the developed models in the interior distribution of a particular compact star candidate 4U 1820-30. Energy conditions and some other tests are also implemented to ensure their viability and stability. Additionally, the disappearing radial pressure constraint is employed to find the values of the model parameter, aligning with the observed information of an array of stars. The study concludes that both of our models are well-behaved and satisfy all necessary conditions, and thus we observe them suitable for the modeling of astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>K-essence sources of Kerr-Schild spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend a result by one of the authors, established for nonvacuum Einstein gravity, to minimally coupled k-essence scalar-tensor theories. First we prove that in order to source a Kerr-Schild type spacetime, the k-essence Lagrangian should be at most quadratic in the kinetic term. This is reduced to linear dependence when the Kerr-Schild null congruence is autoparallel. Finally, we show that requiring the solutions of the Einstein equations linearized in Kerr-Schild type perturbations to also solve the full nonlinear system of Einstein equations, selects once again k-essence scalar fields with Lagrangians linear in the kinetic term. The only other k-essence sharing the property of sourcing perturbative Kerr-Schild spacetimes which are also exact, is the scalar field constant along the integral curves of the Kerr-Schild congruence, with otherwise unrestricted Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>General Shells and Generalized Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, standard methods of the mixed thin-shell foramlism are refined using the framework of Colombeau's theory of generalized functions. To this end, systematic use is made of smooth generalized functions, in particular regularizations of the Heaviside step function and the delta distribution, instead of working directly with the corresponding Schwartz distributions. Based on this change of method, the resulting extended thin shell formalism is shown to offer a decisive advantage over traditional approaches to the subject: it avoids dealing with ill-defined products of distributions in the calculation of nonlinear curvature expressions, thereby allowing for the treatment of problems that prove intractable with the 'conventional' thin-shell formalism. This includes, in particular, the problem of matching singular spacetimes with distributional metrics (containing a delta distribution term) across a joint boundary hypersurface in spacetime, the problem of setting up the dominant energy condition for thin shells, and the problem of defining reasonably rigorously nonlinear distribution-valued curvature invariants needed in higher-derivative theories of gravity. Eventually, as a further application, close links to Penrose's cut-and-paste method are established by proving that results of said method can be re-derived using the generalized formalism presented.</description>

      <title>Description of the eikonal limit of a class of renormalizable gravity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, the scattering between a light scalar particle $\phi$ and a heavy scalar $\sigma$ is studied in the eikonal limit, for gravity scenarios containing higher order derivatives, studied in \cite{stelle1}-\cite{modesto4}. It is suggested that if one of the new gravity scales introduced in the higher order action is smaller than the Planck mass, for instance of the order of $M_{GUT}\sim 10^{15}$ GeV, the functional form of the GR eikonal formulas appears enhanced. However, for these new models, the conditions for the eikonal approximation to hold has to be revised, as the introduction of new scales may change the allowed center of mass and impulse transfer scales. This issue is analyzed in the text. The statements of the present work however should be taken with a grain of salt, as the Schwarzschild radius for these polynomials theories is not yet established. We believe nevertheless, that they are reasonable. The next to leading order approximation and part of the seagull diagrams are estimated. Different to the GR case, the next order does not vanish and in fact it is divergent and has to be regularized. An explicit regularization scheme is presented, based on Riesz and Hadamard procedures. The need of a regularization is partially expected, as the inclusion of small energy fluctuations may spoil the eikonal approximation.</description>

      <title>G\"odel's Universe and the Local Limit of Nonlocal Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the G\"odel universe within the context of the local limit of nonlocal gravity. This theory differs from Einstein's general relativity (GR) through the existence of a scalar susceptibility function $S(x)$ that is a characteristic feature of the gravitational field and vanishes in the GR limit. We show that G\"odel's spacetime is a solution of the modified gravitational field equations provided $S$ is a constant, in conformity with the spatial homogeneity of the G\"odel universe.</description>

      <title>An interstellar mission to test astrophysical black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes are the sources of the strongest gravitational fields that can be found today in the Universe and are ideal laboratories for testing Einstein's theory of General Relativity in the strong field regime. In this letter, I show that the possibility of an interstellar mission to send small spacecrafts to the nearest black hole, although very speculative and extremely challenging, is not completely unrealistic. Certainly we do not have the necessary technology today, but it may be available in the next 20-30 years. The mission may last 80-100 years, but we would be able to obtain very valuable information about black holes and General Relativity that could be unlikely obtained in other ways.</description>

      <title>Shock waves in classical dust collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During gravitational collapse of dust in spherical symmetry, matter particles may collide forming shell crossing surfaces (SCS) on which the Einstein equations become indeterministic. We show that there is a unique evolution beyond SCS such that a propagating shock wave forms, the metric remains continuous, and the stress-energy tensor dynamically becomes that of a thin shell. We give numerical simulations that exhibit this result.</description>

      <title>Bayesian model selection of Primordial Black Holes and Dressed Primordial Black Holes with lensed Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If particle dark matter (DM) and primordial black holes (PBHs) coexist, PBHs will be surrounded by particle DM, forming celestial objects known as dressed PBHs (dPBHs). These structures suggest a scenario in which PBHs and DM can exist simultaneously. However, in the high-frequency regime, the gravitational lensing effect of bare PBHs is similar to that of dPBHs. Ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors are particularly sensitive to high-frequency GW signals. In this regime, the lensing effect of a point-mass lens with a mass in the range of $10^{-1} \sim 10^2 M_{\odot}$ becomes significant. In this work, we incorporate dPBH models with GW observations and employ Bayesian inference techniques to distinguish PBHs from dPBHs. Using the third-generation ground-based GW detectors, Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE), as examples, we demonstrate that these detectors can effectively differentiate the lensing effects of dPBHs from those of PBHs across a broad frequency range. Furthermore, we find that with a larger black hole (BH) mass inside the surrounding particle DM, ET and CE can distinguish these two lensed models with even greater precision.</description>

      <title>Analytical constraints on gravitational models with a quadratic Weyl tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We set analytical constraints on the parameter space of models of gravity containing a term quadratic in Weyl curvature $-\alpha C^2$. In this class of models, there are four propagating tensorial degrees of freedom, two vector degrees of freedom, and two scalar degrees of freedom, $\delta_m$ and $\Phi$, corresponding to gauge invariant perturbations in the matter density and the gravitational Bardeen potential, respectively. We consider the era of matter domination, and requiring that growth of perturbations are recovered in the scalar sector and classical instabilities are eliminated in the vector and tensor sectors, we obtain bounds on the free coupling parameter to the quadratic Weyl curvature term, $10^{14}H^2_0 \lesssim \alpha^{-1} \ll M^2_{\text{cutoff}}$, where $M_{\text{cutoff}}$ is the cutoff scale of the low energy effective field theory, and $\alpha^{-1}$ is proportional to the masses of the additional propagating degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Effective Starobinsky pre-inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider one-loop corrections to a recently obtained form of Starobinsky inflation in Jordan frame to extract information about the initial conditions of the universe leading to cosmological inflation. Integrating out graviton modes, we find higher-derivative instabilities that are shown to decay into scalarons and causing an effective kinetic-domination stage where the universe behaves as a stiff fluid. Through slow cosmological expansion, the kination stage leads to inflation. We find a natural cut-off for the scalaron magnitude ensuring positivity of the modified kinetic term which matches Planck constraints on inflaton energy density at the pivot scale. We, then, backtrack to find that even for arbitrary initial conditions, kination naturally leads to the inflationary epoch without the need for fine-tuning. Modifications to the scalar power spectrum are also shown to potentially explain low-$l$ anomaly in CMB observations as well as the updated prediction of spectral index $\approx0.9743$ accounting for data from Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT).</description>

For the completeness of the results, we also consider the case of phantom U(1)- gauge field. The key role in the proof is bounded with conformal positive energy theorem.</description>

      <title>Conserved charges and asymptotic symmetries of BTZ-like black holes in Einstein-bumblebee gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the solution phase space method, we investigate the conserved charges of BTZ-like black holes in Einstein-bumblebee gravity. Our study shows that the black hole mass, angular momentum and entropy are influenced by the Lorentz-violating parameter. Through the study of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we derive the asymptotic charge algebra, which consists of two copies of the Virasoro algebra with non-trivial central charges. By employing the Cardy formula, we calculate the microscopic entropy of dual conformal field theory, which precisely matches with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Furthermore, by imposing the Detournay-Smoes-Wutte boundary conditions in the near horizon geometry of the extremal BTZ-like black hole, we obtain a Virasoro-Kac-Moody $\mathrm{U(1)}$ algebra, representing the symmetry algebra of a warped conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Conformal boundaries near extremal black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine four dimensional, near-extremal black hole solutions in the presence of a finite boundary obeying conformal boundary conditions, where the conformal class of the induced metric and the trace of the extrinsic curvature are fixed. Working in Euclidean signature and at fixed charge, we find the near-extremal regime is dominated by a double-scaling limit which reveals new scaling laws for the quasi-local conformal entropy at low temperatures. Upon spherical dimensional reduction, we obtain the effective two-dimensional dilaton-gravity theory that describes the near-extremal regime. In contrast to Dirichlet boundaries, for conformal boundaries a linear dilaton potential is not sufficient to capture the leading correction away from extremality and higher orders are needed. We also examine near-Nariai solutions and the spherical reduction of pure three-dimensional gravity in (Anti-) de Sitter space. In the latter, provided the boundary is placed near the conformal boundary of three-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space, the dynamics of the spherically symmetric boundary mode is governed by a Liouville equation that descends from a (minus) Schwarzian effective action.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial constitutive laws and unified structures in constrained BF theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Does a nontrivial gravitational excitation require a modified internal gauge theory constitutive law? As there is no canonical mapping between differential forms valued in distinct Lie algebras, the answer is negative, and entirely dependent on the specific unification scheme. A structural formulation in BF theory in terms of a constitutive diagram between the excitations of different interaction sectors is provided, alongside a discussion of the structure of the broken phase. As a nontrivial option, a spontaneous breaking into the physical constraint is attempted, however it is shown that basic B-potentials alone would not be viable. A heuristic discussion of internal and external gauge theory is provided, and by conflating the observer's internal and external state with the spacetime tangent structure, it is argued that there is a simple geometric obstruction to a nontrivially unified phase. A more ad hoc treatment of gauge theory and gravitational structure remains as the clear path forward, while observer, signal and causal considerations would suggest studying alternative backgrounds to the manifold topology.</description>

      <title>Perturbative analysis of the reheating dynamics of $\alpha$-attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the reheating phase following inflation in the context of single-field models, focusing on the perturbative decay of the inflaton into lighter particles. A general analytical framework is presented to compute the reheating temperature $T_{re}$ and related quantities by combining cosmological observations with model-dependent parameters. We derive expressions for $T_{re}$ for three types of interactions: gravitational, scalar, and Yukawa-type fermionic couplings, and apply these results to the class of $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models, which exhibit attractor behavior in the $(n_s, r)$ plane. The main goal of this work is to investigate how key cosmological quantities such as $T_{re}$, $N_{re}$, and $m_\phi$ among others, evolve with the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the Yukawa coupling constant $y$, within a consistent analytical framework. Although the formulas used are approximate, they are sufficient to capture the qualitative behavior of the relevant quantities across a wide range of parameter values. Here, we are not interested in precise numerical approximations or data analysis, but rather in understanding the general trends and dependence of cosmological quantities of interest. In particular, tendencies observed in the figures, such as the sensitivity of $T_{re}$ to the coupling strength and the equation-of-state parameter $\omega_{re}$, reflect physical features that are not strongly affected by the approximations involved.</description>

Abstract: We carefully examine the exact analytic spectrum of quasinormal modes of general black holes in the so-called subtracted geometry of maximally supersymmetric supergravity. These black holes have the same area and surface gravity at both the outer and inner horizons as the original asymptotically flat black holes. We proceed to explore the relationship with conformal field theories that describe horizon physics of these black holes. As a consequence, we show that the horizon area of these black holes is quantized in units of 8{\pi}l_{Planck}^2.</description>

      <title>Examining Lorentz invariance violation with three remarkable GRB photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance violation in photons can be quantified by measuring the difference in arrival times between high- and low-energy photons originating from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). When analyzing data, it is crucial to consider the inherent time delay in the emission of these photons at the source of the GRB. In a recent study, three distinct models were evaluated to explain the intrinsic emission times of high-energy photons by analyzing 14 multi-GeV photon events detected from 8 GRBs using the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST). In this study, we examine three remarkable GRB photons recorded by different observatories: the 99.3~GeV photon from GRB 221009A observed by FGST, the 1.07~TeV photon from GRB 190114C detected by the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescope, and the 12.2~TeV photon from GRB 221009A observed by the Large High Altitude Air-shower Observatory (LHAASO). Our analysis indicates that the newly proposed model with a linear relationship between photon energy and intrinsic emission time can offer a consistent framework to explain the behavior of all three exceptional photons with a Lorentz violation scale $E_{\rm LV}\sim 3\times 10^{17}$~GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the studies of pseudo-entropy in de Sitter, there have been recent proposals for a timelike entanglement in AdS/CFT. In this work, we explore this proposal in the context of a holographic CFT undergoing a global quench. We study various cases in which the timelike intervals are anchored at various boundary times, sometimes straddling the infalling shell. Our results seem to be consistent with how the quenched CFT evolve towards thermalization.</description>

      <title>Evidence for non-cold dark matter from DESI DR2 measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate potential deviations from cold dark matter (CDM) using the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Analyzing DESI data alone constrains the dark matter equation of state parameter $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = -0.042^{+0.047}_{-0.024}$, revealing a mild preference for non-cold dark matter. This preference strengthens significantly in combined analyses, but reveals a striking tension in the inferred $w_{\mathrm{dm}}$ values from observations of different nature. The DESI+DESY5 combination yields $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = -0.084 \pm 0.035$, excluding CDM ($w_{\mathrm{dm}}=0$) at 2.4$\sigma$ significance. In contrast, Planck+DESI gives $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = 0.00077\pm0.00038$, differing from concordance model at 2$\sigma$ significance. The non-vanishing $w_{\mathrm{dm}}$ preference is particularly driven by low-redshift BAO measurements ($z&lt;1.1$), while higher redshift data remain consistent with $\Lambda$CDM. The evidence for non-cold dark matter is more pronounced in DESI compared to the previous BAO surveys. All dataset combinations show significant improvement over the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, providing compelling evidence for non-cold dark matter scenario.</description>

      <title>Resolving the S8 tension with the Lambda Prime ($\Lambda'$) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $S_8$ parameter, which quantifies the amplitude of matter fluctuations on scales of $8h^{-1}$ Mpc, has been a source of tension between weak lensing surveys (e.g. KiDS, DES, HSC) and the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements. This discrepancy challenges the standard ${\Lambda}$CDM model and has become one of the most significant tensions in modern cosmology. The ${\Lambda'}$ model offers a potential resolution by introducing modifications to the cosmic growth history through alterations to the gravitational sector. The alterations involve including a Ricci soliton into Einstein's field equations which introduce a time dependent factor yielding a time varying cosmological constant ${\Lambda'}=(1-{\alpha(t)^2}(t)){\Lambda_{DE}}\frac{{\rho}_g}{\rho_{DE}}$ and subsequently the evolution of the cosmos. The Ricci soliton is sourced from gravitational energy density. In this study we analyze results from six surveys and compare the results for $w_a$ and $w_0$ with the ${\Lambda'}$ model. We also find ${\sigma}_8={0.750}_{-0.020}^{+0.020}$ , $S_8={0.788}$. These values are closer to some low $S_8$ measurements from weak lensing surveys (e.g DES, KiDS), which report $S_8 \approx 0.76-0.78$, suggesting that the model may alleviate the $S_8$ tension. High values of ${\alpha(t)}$ in the late universe are the cause of suppressed structure formation and low values of ${\Lambda'}$. The late universe in the ${\Lambda'}$ model is effectively or apparently 5-10% younger than in ${\Lambda}$CDM which translates to $H_0={72.734}_{-1.687}^{+1.687}$ km/s/Mpc, which is in agreement with late universe probes. ${\Lambda'}$ is classified under the dynamical dark energy models, however unlike alternatives, it does not invoke exotic particles nor phantom energy.</description>

      <title>The ladder of Finsler-type objects and their variational problems on spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space of anisotropic $r$-contravariant $s$-covariant $\alpha$-homogeneous tensors on a manifold admits a functorial structure where vertical derivatives $\dot{\partial}$ and contractions $\imath_{\mathbb{C}}$ by the Liouville vector field $\mathbb{C}$ are operators which maintain $s+\alpha$ constant. In (semi-)Finsler geometry, this structure is transmitted faithfully to connection-type elements yielding the following ladder: geodesic sprays / nonlinear connections / anisotropic connections / linear (Finslerian) connections. However, it is more loosely transmitted to metric-type ones: Finslerian Lagrangians / Legendre transformations / anisotropic metrics. We will study this structure in depth and apply it to discuss the recent variational proposals (Einstein-Hilbert, Einstein-Palatini, Einstein-Cartan) for generalizing Einstein equations to the Finsler setting.</description>

Abstract: Inertia is the most fundamental and yet elusive concept in physics. Modern geniuses such as Newton and Einstein have wondered about its nature, but the last word has yet to be said and "the question of questions" still remains: what is inertia? In the paper, analysing the properties and criticalities of the concept of geodesic, I propose to separate the notion of geodesic inertial motion from that of natural motion, which I identify as motion characterised by a generalised version of the geodesic deviation. This strategy succeeds in shedding new light on the motion of bodies.</description>

      <title>Note on Type $III_1$ Algebras in $ c= 1$ String Theory and Bulk Causal Diamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the Leutheusser-Liu procedure of isolating a von Neumann algebra in the $N = \infty$ limit of string theories, leads to the algebra of relativistic fermion fields on a half line for the $c = 1$ string theory. This is a Type $I$ von Neumann algebra, since it is the algebra of the Rindler wedge in the Rindler vacuum state. Subalgebras of finite regions are Type $III_1$. The argument uses the elegant results of Moore and of Alexandrov, Kazakov and Kostov. This model is well known to be integrable and have no black hole excitations. We have speculated that adding an interaction invisible in perturbation theory to a large finite number, $M$, of copies of the model, produces a non-integrable model with meta-stable excitations having all of the properties of linear dilaton black holes. The algebra of fields is the tensor product of $M$ copies of the $c = 1$ model's algebra, whether or not we add the non-integrable interaction. We argue that the infinite dimensional $c = 1$ algebras are analogous to those of the boundary field theory in AdS/CFT, even though they appear to encode bulk causal structure. An IR cutoff on the boundary renders them finite and causal structure must be formulated in terms of an analog of the Tensor Network Renormalization Group. This is a time dependent Hamiltonian flow, embedding smaller Hilbert spaces into larger ones. It is the analog of one sided modular inclusion in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Configuration Requirements for 21-cm Forest Background Quasar Searches with the Moon-based Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 21-cm forest offers a powerful cosmological probe of the thermal history and small-scale structure of the intergalactic medium during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Its success, however, critically depends on the availability of high-redshift radio-loud quasars (HzRLQs) as background sources. In this work, we investigate the configuration requirements for a Moon-based low-frequency radio interferometer aimed at maximizing the detection of HzRLQs for future 21-cm forest studies. Building upon a previously developed quasar luminosity function (QLF), we forecast HzRLQ abundances under various array configurations. Assuming a total survey area of $10^4\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ and 1 year of observation, we compare continuum surveys with 10 MHz bandwidth and 21-cm forest surveys with 5 kHz resolution. Our results show that a minimum collecting area of $\sim$6 500 m$^2$ enables detection at $z \sim 6$, while SKA-like arrays ($N_{\mathrm{st}} = 512$) extend the detection limit to $z \sim 10$ for 21-cm forest survey and $z \sim 16$ for continuum survey. Larger arrays with $N_{\mathrm{st}} = 2048$ can reach $z \sim 11$ in 21-cm forest mode. We also explore configurations that maintain fixed collecting areas while increasing the number to enhance survey efficiency. This boosts source detection but significantly increases the data volume and computational demands. These results underscore the importance of optimizing array design for different survey goals and balancing sensitivity, spectral resolution, and data management. A well-designed Moon-based array could open a new observational window on reionization and early cosmic structure formation.</description>

      <title>FRB cosmology with the RM-PRS Luminosity Correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as a powerful tool for cosmological studies, particularly through the dispersion measure-redshift ($\mathrm{DM}-z$) relation. This work proposes a novel calibration method for FRBs using the Yang-Li-Zhang (YLZ) empirical relation, which links the rotation measure (RM) of FRBs to the luminosity of their associated persistent radio sources (PRS). We demonstrate that this approach provides independent constraints on cosmological parameters, bypassing limitations inherent to traditional $\mathrm{DM}-z$ method. Utilizing the current sample of four YLZ-calibrated FRBs, we derive a Hubble constant measurement of $H_0 = 86.18_{-14.99}^{+18.03}\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$ (68\% CL). Monte Carlo simulations indicate that a future catalog of 400 FRB-PSR systems could reduce the relative uncertainty of $H_0$ to 4.5\%. Combining YLZ-calibrated FRBs with $\mathrm{DM}-z$ sample reveals critical synergies: joint analysis of equalized samples ($N=100$ for both methods) reduces the relative uncertainty of $H_0$ to 2.9\%, mainly because the incorporation of PRS observations substantially mitigates the degeneracy between the parameters such as IGM baryon mass fraction ($f_{\rm IGM}$) and other cosmological parameters inherent to the $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation.</description>

      <title>Physical vs phantom dark energy after DESI: thawing quintessence in a curved background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent data from DESI, in combination with other data, provide moderate evidence of dynamical dark energy, $w\neq-1$. In the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization of $w$, there is a preference for a phantom crossing, $w&lt;-1$, at redshift $z\sim0.5$. In general relativity, the phantom equation of state is unphysical. Thus it is important to check whether phantom crossing is present in other physically self-consistent models of dark energy that have equivalent evidence to the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization. We find that thawing quintessence with nonzero cosmic curvature can fit the recent data slightly better than $w_0, w_a$ in a flat background. The phantom crossing may be a spurious artifact of a parametrization that is not based on a physical model.</description>

      <title>Did DESI DR2 truly reveal dynamical dark energy?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question in cosmology is whether dark energy evolves over time, a topic that has gained prominence since the discovery of cosmic acceleration. Recently, the DESI collaboration has reported increasing evidence for evolving dark energy using combinations of cosmic microwave background (CMB), type Ia supernova (SN), and their new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). However, our analysis reveals that these combinations are problematic due to clear tensions among the CMB, BAO and SN datasets. Consequently, DESI's claim of dynamical dark energy (DDE) is not robust. A more reliable approach involves constraining the evolution of dark energy using each dataset independently. Through a statistical comparison for each dataset, on average, we find that DDE is strongly preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model. This suggests that DDE likely exists, although its real parameter space remains elusive due to weak constraints on the dark energy equation of state and inconsistencies among the datasets. Interestingly, when considering DDE, none of the individual datasets -- including CMB, DESI DR2, Pantheon+, Union3, and DESY5 -- can independently detect cosmic acceleration at a significant level. Our findings not only clarify the current understanding of the nature of dark energy but also challenge the established discovery of cosmic acceleration and the long-held notion that dark energy exerts negative pressure. Both individual and combined datasets suggest that the ultimate fate of the universe is likely to be dominated by matter rather than dark energy.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the linear transport of neutral system within the framework of relativistic kinetic theory. Under the relaxation time approximation, we obtain an iterative solution to the relativistic Boltzmann equation in generic stationary spacetime. This solution provides a scheme to study non-equilibrium system order by order. Our calculations are performed in generic hydrodynamic frame, and the results can be reduced to a specific hydrodynamic frame by imposing constraints. As a specific example, we analytically calculated the covariant expressions of the particle flow and the energy momentum tensor up to the first order in relaxation time. Finally and most importantly, we present all 14 kinetic coefficients for a neutral system, which are verified to satisfy the Onsager reciprocal relation in a generic hydrodynamic frame and guarantee a non-negative entropy production in the frame where the first order conservation laws are restored.</description>

Abstract: A black hole evaporates by Hawking radiation. Each mode of that radiation is thermal. If the total state is nevertheless to be pure, modes must be entangled. Estimating the minimum size of this entanglement has been an important outstanding issue. We develop a new theory of constrained random symplectic transformations, based on that the total state is pure and Gaussian with given marginals. In the random constrained symplectic model we then compute the distribution of mode-mode correlations, from which we bound mode-mode entanglement. Modes of frequency much larger than $\frac{k_B T_{H}(t)}{\hbar}$ are not populated at time $t$ and drop out of the analysis. Among the other modes we find that correlations and hence entanglement between relatively thinly populated modes (early-time high-frequency modes and/or late modes of any frequency) to be strongly suppressed. Relatively highly populated modes (early-time low-frequency modes) can on the other hand be strongly correlated, but a detailed analysis reveals that they are nevertheless very unlikely to be entangled. Our analysis hence establishes that restoring unitarity after a complete evaporation of a black hole does not require any significant quantum entanglement between any pair of Hawking modes. Our analysis further gives exact general expressions for the distribution of mode-mode correlations in random, pure, Gaussian states with given marginals, which may have applications beyond black hole physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Cherenkov radiation can be interpreted as ghost instability of a certain type. Solutions of modified gravity theories often contain ghost instabilities. One type of such ghost instability is associated with existence of different types of species with causal cones that do not share common time, which leads to vacuum decay via creation of particles with positive and negative energies. We show that this ghost instability can be seen as Cherenkov radiation and vice versa.</description>

Abstract: Electromagnetic waves propagating in the background provided by a spacetime hosting a strong curvature, naked singularity, are fully studied. The analysis is performed not only in the realm of geometrical optics -- which, not surprisingly, proves to be inadequate in the strong field regime characterizing the vicinity of the singularity -- but also in the physical one in which the field amplitudes must necessarily be incorporated into the description. In addition to the expected divergent outcome with regard to the field amplitudes and power flux as the waves approach the singularity, we found a number of regular (bounded) solutions which seem to coexist with the unbridled effects of the spacetime curvature. In some of them, the singularity operates as a perfect mirror reflecting the surrounding fields. Strikingly, other solutions exhibit a perfectly well behaved, bounded power flux as they propagate towards the singularity, suggesting thus the possibility of having electromagnetic energy transference through it.</description>

      <title>Improved post-Newtonian waveform model for inspiralling precessing-eccentric compact binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurement of spin-precession and orbital eccentricity in gravitational-wave (GW) signals is a key priority in GW astronomy, as these effects not only provide insights into the astrophysical formation and evolution of compact binaries but also, if neglected, could introduce significant biases in parameter estimation, searches, and tests of General Relativity. Despite the growing potential of upcoming LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs and future detectors to measure eccentric-precessing signals, accurately and efficiently modeling them remains a challenge. In this work, we present pyEFPE, a frequency-domain post-Newtonian (PN) waveform model for the inspiral of precessing-eccentric compact binaries. pyEFPE improves upon previous models by introducing analytical expressions for the Fourier mode amplitudes, enhancing the numerical stability of the multiple scale analysis framework, and adding recently derived PN corrections, critical to accurately describe signals in GW detectors. Additionally, we simplify the numerical implementation and introduce a scheme to interpolate the amplitudes, achieving a speedup of up to ~O(15) in the waveform computations, making the model practical for data analysis applications. We thoroughly validate pyEFPE by comparing it to other waveform models in the quasi-circular and eccentric-spin-aligned limits, finding good agreement. Additionally, we demonstrate pyEFPE's capability to analyze simulated GW events, accurately recovering the parameters of signals described by both pyEFPE and IMRPhenomXP. While pyEFPE still lacks important physical effects, such as higher-order PN corrections, higher-order modes, mode asymmetries, tidal interactions or the merger-ringdown phase, it represents a significant step towards more complete waveform models, offering a flexible and efficient framework that can be extended in future work to incorporate these effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that gravity field equations based on a tensor with rank greater than 2 have consistency problems in the sense that integration constants in the solutions, such as the parameter $m$ in the Schwarzschild metric, do not allow for an interpretation in terms of conserved quantities in the theory. The recently introduced Conformal Killing Gravity, an interesting extension of General Relativity that inherits all the solutions of the latter, and defined with a rank-3 tensor field equation that does not arise from a diffeomorphism-invariant action, is plagued with this problem. In this theory, it is not clear at all how one can define the energy and angular momentum for black hole solutions, or define the analogues of the formulas, such as the quadrupole formula, in the weak field limit for gravitational waves emitted by compact sources.</description>

We join these efforts and present our first steps to achieve this goal: we discuss a formulation of Einstein equations for a vacuum axisymmetric spacetime with vanishing twist in spherical-polar coordinates, its linearised approximation, and identify some problems in achieving numerically stable evolution at the threshold of a black hole formation.</description>

      <title>Geodesically Complete Regularized Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical general relativity predicts a singularity at the center of a black hole, where known laws of physics break down. This suggests the existence of deeper, yet unknown principles of Nature. Among various theoretical possibilities, one of the most promising proposals is a transition to a de Sitter phase at the BH core. This transition, originally proposed by Gliner and Sakharov, ensures the regularity of metric coefficients and avoids the singularity. In search for such a regular BH solution with finite curvature scalar, we propose a metric $g_{rr}$ that exhibits a dS core in the central region. An appealing feature of this metric is the existence of a $single$ event horizon resembling the Schwarzschild black hole. Furthermore, the entire spacetime geometry is determined by the black hole mass alone, in agreement with the Isarel-Carter $no-hair$ $theorem$ for a charge-less, non-rotating black hole. To determine the gravitational action consistent with such a solution, we consider a general Lagrangian density $f(R)$ in place of the Einstein-Hilbert action. By numerically solving the resulting field equation, we find that, in addition to the Einstein-Hilbert term, a Pad\'e approximant in the Ricci scalar $R$ can produce such regular black hole solutions. To assess the physical viability of these black hole solutions, we verify that the proposed metric satisfies the principal energy conditions: DEC, WEC, and NEC, throughout spacetime. Furthermore, in agreement with Zaslavskii's regularity criterion, the metric satisfies the SEC in the range $r\geq r_h/2$, where $r_h$ is the event horizon. Furthermore, with the proposed regularized metric, the expansion scalar in the Raychaudhuri equation remains finite and its derivative vanishes at $r=0$, thereby preventing formation of caustic. This confirms that the spacetime is geodesically complete and free from true physical singularities.</description>

      <title>Inflation with Gauss-Bonnet correction: beyond slow-roll</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If a coupling between the inflaton and the Gauss-Bonnet term is introduced, many models of inflation that were ruled out by the most recent Planck data can be made viable again. The predictions for the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio are typically computed using the slow-roll approximation. In this paper we instead study the full equations of motion and determine the necessary initial conditions for reasonable inflation epoch. We derive the conditions under which the Friedmann equation admits positive solutions for the Hubble parameter. Then we study the possibility of the inflaton becoming trapped in a local potential minimum induced by the Gauss-Bonnet term. Finally we demonstrate the results on monomial potential models with a quadratic and a quartic potential and show that the slow-roll approximation becomes imprecise in the quartic case.</description>

      <title>First law of de Sitter thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05763v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The de Sitter state has a special symmetry: it is homogeneous, and its curvature is constant in space. Since all the points in the de Sitter space are equivalent, this state is described by local thermodynamics. This state has the local temperature $T=H/\pi$ (which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature), the local entropy density, the local energy density, and also the local gravitational degrees of freedom -- the scalar curvature ${\cal R}$ and the effective gravitational coupling $K$. On the other hand, there is the cosmological horizon, which can be also characterized by the thermodynamic relations. We consider the connections between the local thermodynamics and the thermodynamics of the cosmological horizon. In particular, there is the holographic connection between the entropy density integrated over the Hubble volume and the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of the horizon, $S_{\rm volume}=S_{\rm horizon}=A/4G$. We also consider the first law of thermodynamics in these two approaches. In the local thermodynamics, on the one hand, the first law is valid for an arbitrary volume $V$ of de Sitter space. On the other hand, the first law is also applicable to the thermodynamics of the horizon. In both cases, the temperature is the same. This consideration is extended to the contracting de Sitter with its negative entropy, $S_{\rm volume}=S_{\rm horizon}=-A/4G$.</description>

      <title>Long-lived Quasinormal modes around regular black holes and wormholes in Covariant Effective Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quasinormal modes of massive scalar and massless Dirac fields in the background of regular black holes and traversable wormholes arising in Covariant Effective Quantum Gravity. Using both the JWKB approximation and time-domain integration, we analyze the impact of quantum corrections on the quasinormal spectra and late-time behavior of perturbations. Our results reveal the existence of slowly decaying, oscillatory tails and quasi-resonant modes in the scalar sector, particularly in the high-mass regime. In the fermionic case, the damping rate increases with the quantum correction parameter $ \xi $, while the oscillation frequency decreases. We also observe pronounced echo-like structures in the time-domain profiles near the black hole-wormhole threshold. These findings provide insight into the dynamics of perturbations in quantum-corrected spacetimes and offer potential signatures for distinguishing black holes from wormholes in future gravitational wave observations.</description>

Abstract: We investigate photon geodesics in a static black hole spacetime sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED)--a model inspired by the confinement of heavy quark-antiquark pairs that recovers Maxwell's theory in the strong-field limit. This solution generalizes the Schwarzschild metric by introducing both an electric charge $Q$ and a nonlinear parameter $\zeta$. Employing a backward ray-tracing scheme, we integrate the null geodesic equations to characterize critical orbits and deflection angles in the NLED background. To explore rotational effects, we then generate the spinning analogue via the Newman-Janis algorithm, and analyze its resulting ergosphere and shadow profile.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent advances in observational astrophysics and continued explorations in the field of analog gravity, we discuss the prospect of simulating models of cosmology within the context of synthetic mechanical lattice experiments. We focus on the physics of expanding Universe scenarios described by the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. Specifically, quantizing scalar fluctuations in a background FLRW spacetime leads to a quadratic bosonic Hamiltonian with temporally varying pair production terms. Here we present a mapping that provides a one-to-one correspondence between these classes of cosmology models and feedback-coupled mechanical oscillators. As proof-of-principle, we then perform experiments on a synthetic mechanical lattice composed of such oscillators. We simulate two different FLRW expansion scenarios with Universes dominated by vacuum energy and matter and discuss our experimental results.</description>

      <title>Solving the PTA Data Analysis Problem with a Global Gibbs Scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The announcement in the summer of 2023 about the discovery of evidence for a gravitational wave background (GWB) using pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has ignited both the PTA and the larger scientific community's interest in the experiment and the scientific implications of its findings. As a result, numerous scientific works have been published analyzing and further developing various aspects of the experiment, from performing tests of gravity to improving the efficiency of the current data analysis techniques. In this regard, we contribute to the recent advancements in the field of PTAs by presenting the most general, agnostic, per-frequency Bayesian search for a low-frequency (red) noise process in these data. Our new method involves the use of a conjugate Jeffrey's-like multivariate prior which allows one to model all unique parameters of the global PTA-level red noise covariance matrix as a separate model parameter for which a marginalized posterior-probability distribution can be found using Gibbs sampling. Even though perfecting the implementation of the Gibbs sampling and mitigating the numerical stability challenges require further development, we show the power of this new method by analyzing realistic and theoretical PTA simulated data sets. We show how our technique is consistent with the more restricted standard techniques in recovering both the auto and the cross-spectrum of pulsars' low-frequency (red) noise. Furthermore, we highlight ways to approximately characterize a GWB (both its auto- and cross-spectrum) using Fourier coefficient estimates from single-pulsar and so-called CURN (common uncorrelated red noise) analyses via analytic draws from a specific Inverse-Wishart distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18046v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense repeating soft X-ray bursts with recurrence times about a few hours to a few weeks from galactic nuclei. More and more analyses show that QPEs are the result of collisions between a stellar mass object (SMO, a stellar mass black hole or a main sequence star) and an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. In this work, we propose an osculating trajectory method for efficiently calculating secular evolution of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) that are perturbed by an accretion disk. This method accelerates the calculation of EMRI orbital evolution by orders of magnitude and lays the foundation for analyzing long-term QPE observations. Applying this method to orbital analyses of GSN 069 and eRO-QPE2, the two most stable QPE sources, we find informative constraints on the SMBH mass, the radiation efficiency of QPEs, the SMO nature, the accretion disk surface density and the accretion disk viscosity. Combining all the QPE sources available, we find the QPE EMRIs can be divided into two populations according to their orbital eccentricities, where the orbital periods and the SMBH masses in the low-eccentricity population follow a scaling relation $T_{\rm obt}\propto M_{\bullet}^n$ with $n\approx 0.8$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aims: The presence of a Yukawa-like correction to Newtonian gravity is investigated at the Galactic Center, leading to a new upper limit for the intensity of such a correction. Methods: We perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using the astrometric and spectroscopic data of star S$2$ collected at the Very Large Telescope by GRAVITY, NACO and SINFONI instruments, covering the period from $1992$ to $2022$. Results: The precision of the GRAVITY instrument allows us to derive the most stringent upper limit at the Galactic Center for the intensity of the Yukawa contribution ($\propto \, \alpha e^{- \lambda r}$) to be $|\alpha| &lt; 0.003$ for a scale length $\lambda = 3 \cdot 10^{13}\, \rm m\, (\sim 200 \, \rm AU)$. This improves by roughly one order of magnitude all estimates obtained in previous works.</description>

Abstract: We present a version of the Lorentzian splitting theorem under a weakened Ricci curvature condition. The proof makes use of basic properties of achronal limits [19], [20], together with the geometric maximum principle for $C^0$ spacelike hypersurfaces in [1]. Our version strengthens a related result in [29] in the globally hyperbolic setting by removing a certain boundedness condition on the Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>Perihelion precession in non-Newtonian central potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High order corrections to the perihelion precession are obtained in non-Newtonian central potentials, via complex analysis techniques. The result is an exact series expansion whose terms, for a perturbation of the form $\delta V=\frac{\gamma}{r^{s}}$, are calculated in closed form. To validate the method, the series is applied to the specific case of s=3, and the results are compared with those presented in literature, which are relate to the Schwarzschild metric. As a further test, a numerical simulation was carried out for the case where s=4. The algebraic calculations and numerical simulations were carried out via software with symbolic capabilities.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Singularities from Holographic Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a second law of complexity, we prove a black hole singularity theorem. By introducing the notion of trapped extremal surfaces, we show that their existence implies null geodesic incompleteness inside globally hyperbolic black holes. We also demonstrate that the vanishing of the growth rate of the volume of extremal surfaces provides a sharp diagnostic of the black hole singularity. In static, uncharged, spherically symmetric spacetimes, this corresponds to the growth rate of spacelike extremal surfaces going to zero at the singularity. In charged or rotating spacetimes, such as the Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr black holes, we identify novel timelike extremal surfaces that exhibit the same behavior at the timelike singularity.</description>
