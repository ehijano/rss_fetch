      <title>Community Detection using Fortunato's Performance Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his paper on Community Detection [1], Fortunato introduced a quality function called performance to assess the goodness of a graph partition. This measure counts the number of correctly ``interpreted" pairs of vertices, i. e. two vertices belonging to the same community and connected by an edge, or two vertices belonging to different communities and not connected by an edge. In this paper, we explore Fortunato's performance measure (fp measure) for detecting communities in unweighted, undirected networks. First, we give a greedy algorithm fpGreed that tries to optimise the fp measure by working iteratively at two-levels, vertex-level and community-level. At the vertex level, a vertex joins a community only if the fp value improves. Once this is done, an initial set of communities are obtained. At the next stage, two communities merge only if the fp measure improves. Once there are no further improvements to be made, the algorithm switches back to the vertex level and so on. fpGreed terminates when there are no changes to any community. We then present a faster heuristic algorithm fastFp more suitable for running on large datasets. We present the quality of the communities and the time it takes to compute them on several well-known datasets. For some of the large datasets, such as youtube and livejournal, we find that Algorithm fastFP performs really well, both in terms of the time and the quality of the solution obtained.</description>

      <title>Towards Propagation-aware Representation Learning for Supervised Social Media Graph Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms generate vast, complex graph-structured data, facilitating diverse tasks such as rumor detection, bot identification, and influence modeling. Real-world applications like public opinion monitoring and stock trading -- which have a strong attachment to social media -- demand models that are performant across diverse tasks and datasets. However, most existing solutions are purely data-driven, exhibiting vulnerability to the inherent noise within social media data. Moreover, the reliance on task-specific model design challenges efficient reuse of the same model architecture on different tasks, incurring repetitive engineering efforts. To address these challenges in social media graph analytics, we propose a general representation learning framework that integrates a dual-encoder structure with a kinetic-guided propagation module. In addition to jointly modeling structural and contextual information with two encoders, our framework innovatively captures the information propagation dynamics within social media graphs by integrating principled kinetic knowledge. By deriving a propagation-aware encoder and corresponding optimization objective from a Markov chain-based transmission model, the representation learning pipeline receives a boost in its robustness to noisy data and versatility in diverse tasks. Extensive experiments verify that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with a unified architecture on a variety of social media graph mining tasks spanning graph classification, node classification, and link prediction. Besides, our solution exhibits strong zero-shot and few-shot transferability across datasets, demonstrating practicality when handling data-scarce tasks.</description>

      <title>Unnoticeable Community Deception via Multi-objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection in graphs is crucial for understanding the organization of nodes into densely connected clusters. While numerous strategies have been developed to identify these clusters, the success of community detection can lead to privacy and information security concerns, as individuals may not want their personal information exposed. To address this, community deception methods have been proposed to reduce the effectiveness of detection algorithms. Nevertheless, several limitations, such as the rationality of evaluation metrics and the unnoticeability of attacks, have been ignored in current deception methods. Therefore, in this work, we first investigate the limitations of the widely used deception metric, i.e., the decrease of modularity, through empirical studies. Then, we propose a new deception metric, and combine this new metric together with the attack budget to model the unnoticeable community deception task as a multi-objective optimization problem. To further improve the deception performance, we propose two variant methods by incorporating the degree-biased and community-biased candidate node selection mechanisms. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed community deception strategies.</description>

      <title>Content and Engagement Trends in COVID-19 YouTube Videos: Evidence from the Late Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigated about 10,000 COVID-19-related YouTube videos published between January 2023 and October 2024 to evaluate how temporal, lexical, linguistic, and structural factors influenced engagement during the late pandemic period. Publishing activity showed consistent weekday effects: in the first window, average views peaked on Mondays at 92,658; in the second, on Wednesdays at 115,479; and in the third, on Fridays at 84,874, reflecting a shift in audience attention toward mid- and late week. Lexical analysis of video titles revealed recurring high-frequency keywords related to COVID-19 and YouTube features, including COVID, coronavirus, shorts, and live. Frequency analysis revealed sharp spikes, with COVID appearing in 799 video titles in August 2024, while engagement analysis showed that videos titled with shorts attracted very high views, peaking at 2.16 million average views per video in June 2023. Analysis of sentiment of video descriptions in English showed weak correlation with views in the raw data (Pearson r = 0.0154, p = 0.2987), but stronger correlations emerged once outliers were addressed, with Spearman r = 0.110 (p &lt; 0.001) and Pearson r = 0.0925 (p &lt; 0.001). Category-level analysis of video durations revealed contrasting outcomes: long videos focusing on people and blogs averaged 209,114 views, short entertainment videos averaged 288,675 views, and medium-to-long news and politics videos averaged 51,309 and 59,226 views, respectively. These results demonstrate that engagement patterns of COVID-19-related videos on YouTube during the late pandemic followed distinct characteristics driven by publishing schedules, title vocabulary, topics, and genre-specific duration effects.</description>

      <title>Dynamics in Two-Sided Attention Markets: Objective, Optimization, and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With most content distributed online and mediated by platforms, there is a pressing need to understand the ecosystem of content creation and consumption. A considerable body of recent work shed light on the one-sided market on creator-platform or user-platform interactions, showing key properties of static (Nash) equilibria and online learning. In this work, we examine the {\it two-sided} market including the platform and both users and creators. We design a potential function for the coupled interactions among users, platform and creators. We show that such coupling of creators' best-response dynamics with users' multilogit choices is equivalent to mirror descent on this potential function. Furthermore, a range of platform ranking strategies correspond to a family of potential functions, and the dynamics of two-sided interactions still correspond to mirror descent. We also provide new local convergence result for mirror descent in non-convex functions, which could be of independent interest. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for explaining the diverse outcomes observed in attention markets.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal networks consist of timestamped directed interactions rather than static links. These links may appear continuously in time, yet few studies have directly tackled the continuous-time modeling of networks. Here, we introduce a maximum entropy approach to temporal networks and with basic assumptions on constraints, the corresponding network ensembles admit a modular and interpretable representation: a set of global time processes -an inhomogeneous Poisson or a Hawkes process- and a static maximum-entropy (MaxEnt) edge, e.g. node pair, probability. This time-edge labels factorization yields closed-form log-likelihoods, degree/unique-edge expectations, and yields a whole class of effective generative models. We provide maximum-entropy derivation of a log-linear Hawkes/NHPP intensity for temporal networks via functional optimization over path entropy, connecting inhomogeneous Poisson modeling -e.g. Hawkes models- to MaxEnt network ensembles. Global Hawkes time layers consistently improve log-likelihood over generic NHPP, while the MaxEnt edge labels recover strength constraints and reproduce expected unique-degree curves. We discuss the limitations of this unified framework and how it could be integrated with calibrated community/motif tools, Hawkes calibration procedures, and (neural) kernel estimation.</description>

      <title>RumorSphere: A Framework for Million-scale Agent-based Dynamic Simulation of Rumor Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rumor propagation modeling is critical for understanding the dynamics of misinformation spread. Previous models are either overly simplistic or static, making them ineffective for simulating real-world rumor dynamics. In this paper, leveraging the impressive human behavior imitation capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we present a novel dynamic and hierarchical social network simulation framework, which supports simulations with millions of agents. This simulator is used to explore the rumor dynamic in the real world. Experiments on real-world rumor propagation datasets reveal a strong alignment between simulated and real-world rumor dynamics, outperforming existing models with an average 64\% reduction in opinion bias. Our findings underscore the substantial potential of LLM-based multi-agent systems in social network simulations, offering critical insights for advancing social science research. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the tightly connected local community structure within social networks is one of the key factors promoting the rapid spread of rumors. In these communities, as rumors propagate to a certain extent, some individuals, influenced by ''social pressure'', are often compelled to conform, while holders of minority opinions are further silenced, resulting in a vicious cycle that accelerates rumor dissemination. Through counterfactual experiments, we evaluate various intervention strategies and demonstrate that early and sustained efforts to correct misinformation are more effective in mitigating the spread of rumors, while debunking rumors through opinion leaders proves to be the most effective strategy. These findings provide valuable insights for public opinion management and policymaking.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Single-Linkage Clustering for Community Detection with Overlaps and Outliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most community detection approaches make very strong assumptions about communities in the data, such as every vertex must belong to exactly one community (the communities form a partition). For vector data, Hierarchical Density Based Spatial Clustering for Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) has emerged as a leading clustering algorithm that allows for outlier points that do not belong to any cluster. The first step in HDBSCAN is to redefine the distance between vectors in such a way that single-linkage clustering is effective and robust to noise. Many community detection algorithms start with a similar step that attempts to increase the weight of edges between similar nodes and decrease weights of noisy edges. In this paper, we apply the hierarchical single-linkage clustering algorithm from HDBSCAN to a variety of node/edge similarity scores to see if there is an algorithm that can effectively detect clusters while allowing for outliers. In experiments on synthetic and real world data sets, we find that no single method is optimal for every type of graph, but the admirable performance indicates that hierarchical single-linkage clustering is a viable paradigm for graph clustering.</description>

      <title>A Keyframe-Based Approach for Auditing Bias in YouTube Shorts Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: YouTube Shorts and other short-form video platforms now influence how billions engage with content, yet their recommendation systems remain largely opaque. Small shifts in promoted content can significantly impact user exposure, especially for politically sensitive topics. In this work, we propose a keyframe-based method to audit bias and drift in short-form video recommendations. Rather than analyzing full videos or relying on metadata, we extract perceptually salient keyframes, generate captions, and embed both into a shared content space. Using visual mapping across recommendation chains, we observe consistent shifts and clustering patterns that indicate topic drift and potential filtering. Comparing politically sensitive topics with general YouTube categories, we find notable differences in recommendation behavior. Our findings show that keyframes provide an efficient and interpretable lens for understanding bias in short-form video algorithms.</description>

      <title>Queuing for Civility: Regulating Emotions and Reducing Toxicity in Digital Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pervasiveness of online toxicity, including hate speech and trolling, disrupts digital interactions and online well-being. Previous research has mainly focused on post-hoc moderation, overlooking the real-time emotional dynamics of online conversations and the impact of users' emotions on others. This paper presents a graph-based framework to identify the need for emotion regulation within online conversations. This framework promotes self-reflection to manage emotional responses and encourage responsible behaviour in real time. Additionally, a comment queuing mechanism is proposed to address intentional trolls who exploit emotions to inflame conversations. This mechanism introduces a delay in publishing comments, giving users time to self-regulate before further engaging in the conversation and helping maintain emotional balance. Analysis of social media data from Twitter and Reddit demonstrates that the graph-based framework reduced toxicity by 12%, while the comment queuing mechanism decreased the spread of anger by 15%, with only 4% of comments being temporarily held on average. These findings indicate that combining real-time emotion regulation with delayed moderation can significantly improve well-being in online environments.</description>

      <title>Network Community Detection and Novelty Scoring Reveal Underexplored Hub Genes in Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the modular structure and central elements of complex biological networks is critical for uncovering system-level mechanisms in disease. Here, we constructed weighted gene co-expression networks from bulk RNA-seq data of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial tissue, using pairwise correlation and a percolation-guided thresholding strategy. Community detection with Louvain and Leiden algorithms revealed robust modules, and node-strength ranking identified the top 50 hub genes globally and within communities. To assess novelty, we integrated genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with literature-based evidence from PubMed, highlighting five high-centrality genes with little to no prior RA-specific association. Functional enrichment confirmed their roles in immune-related processes, including adaptive immune response and lymphocyte regulation. Notably, these hubs showed strong positive correlations with T- and B-cell markers and negative correlations with NK-cell markers, consistent with RA immunopathology. Overall, our framework demonstrates how correlation-based network construction, modularity-driven clustering, and centrality-guided novelty scoring can jointly reveal informative structure in omics-scale data. This generalizable approach offers a scalable path to gene prioritization in RA and other autoimmune conditions.</description>

      <title>Using Gaussian Mixtures to Model Evolving Multi-Modal Beliefs Across Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Gaussian mixtures to model formation and evolution of multi-modal beliefs and opinion uncertainty across social networks. In this model, opinions evolve by Bayesian belief update when incorporating exogenous factors (signals from outside sources, e.g., news articles) and by non-Bayesian mixing dynamics when incorporating endogenous factors (interactions across social media). The modeling enables capturing the richness of behavior observed in multi-modal opinion dynamics while maintaining interpretability and simplicity of scalar models. We present preliminary results on opinion formation and uncertainty to investigate the effect of stubborn individuals (as social influencers). This leads to a notion of centrality based on the ease with which an individual can disrupt the flow of information across the social network.</description>

      <title>HiGraph: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Graph Dataset for Malware Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of graph-based malware analysis is critically limited by the absence of large-scale datasets that capture the inherent hierarchical structure of software. Existing methods often oversimplify programs into single level graphs, failing to model the crucial semantic relationship between high-level functional interactions and low-level instruction logic. To bridge this gap, we introduce \dataset, the largest public hierarchical graph dataset for malware analysis, comprising over \textbf{200M} Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) nested within \textbf{595K} Function Call Graphs (FCGs). This two-level representation preserves structural semantics essential for building robust detectors resilient to code obfuscation and malware evolution. We demonstrate HiGraph's utility through a large-scale analysis that reveals distinct structural properties of benign and malicious software, establishing it as a foundational benchmark for the community. The dataset and tools are publicly available at https://higraph.org.</description>

      <title>Community as a Vague Operator: Epistemological Questions for a Critical Heuristics of Community Detection Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.02753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we aim to analyse the nature and epistemic consequences of what figures in network science as patterns of nodes and edges called 'communities'. Tracing these patterns as multi-faceted and ambivalent, we propose to describe the concept of community as a 'vague operator', a variant of Susan Leigh Star's notion of the boundary object, and propose that the ability to construct different modes of description that are both vague in some registers and hyper-precise in others, is core both to digital politics and the analysis of 'communities'. Engaging with these formations in terms drawn from mathematics and software studies enables a wider mapping of their formation. Disentangling different lineages in network science then allows us to contextualise the founding account of 'community' popularised by Michelle Girvan and Mark Newman in 2002. After studying one particular community detection algorithm, the widely-used 'Louvain algorithm', we comment on controversies arising with some of their more ambiguous applications. We argue that 'community' can act as a real abstraction with the power to reshape social relations such as producing echo chambers in social networking sites. To rework the epistemological terms of community detection and propose a reconsideration of vague operators, we draw on debates and propositions within the literature of network science to imagine a 'critical heuristics' that embraces partiality, epistemic humbleness, reflexivity and artificiality.</description>

      <title>Network Modelling in Analysing Cyber-related Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to improve the resilience of computer infrastructure against cyber attacks and finding ways to mitigate their impact we need to understand their structure and dynamics. Here we propose a novel network-based influence spreading model to investigate event trajectories or paths in various types of attack and causal graphs, which can be directed, weighted, and / or cyclic. In case of attack graphs with acyclic paths, only self-avoiding attack chains are allowed. In the framework of our model a detailed probabilistic analysis beyond the traditional visualisation of attack graphs, based on vulnerabilities, services, and exploitabilities, can be performed. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the model, we present three use cases with cyber-related graphs, namely two attack graphs and a causal graph. The model can be of benefit to cyber analysts in generating quantitative metrics for prioritisation, summaries, or analysis of larger graphs.</description>

      <title>Cascade-driven opinion dynamics on social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online social networks (OSNs) have transformed the way individuals fulfill their social needs and consume information. As OSNs become increasingly prominent sources for news dissemination, individuals often encounter content that influences their opinions through both direct interactions and broader network dynamics. In this paper, we propose the Friedkin-Johnsen on Cascade (FJC) model, which is, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to integrate information cascades and opinion dynamics, specifically using the very popular Friedkin-Johnsen model. Our model, validated over real social cascades, highlights how the convergence of socialization and sharing news on these platforms can disrupt opinion evolution dynamics typically observed in offline settings. Our findings demonstrate that these cascades can amplify the influence of central opinion leaders, making them more resistant to divergent viewpoints, even when challenged by a critical mass of dissenting opinions. This research underscores the importance of understanding the interplay between social dynamics and information flow in shaping public discourse in the digital age.</description>

      <title>Dense Subgraph Clustering and a New Cluster Ensemble Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose DSC-Flow-Iter, a new community detection algorithm that is based on iterative extraction of dense subgraphs. Although DSC-Flow-Iter leaves many nodes unclustered, it is competitive with leading methods and has high-precision and low-recall, making it complementary to modularity-based methods that typically have high recall but lower precision. Based on this observation, we introduce a novel cluster ensemble technique that combines DSC-Flow-Iter with modularity-based clustering, to provide improved accuracy. We show that our proposed pipeline, which uses this ensemble technique, outperforms its individual components and improves upon the baseline techniques on a large collection of synthetic networks.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of A National Digitally-Enabled Health Promotion Campaign for Mental Health Awareness using Social Media Platforms Tik Tok, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mental health disorders rank among the 10 leading contributors to the global burden of diseases, yet persistent stigma and care barriers delay early intervention. This has inspired efforts to leverage digital platforms for scalable health promotion to engage at-risk populations. To evaluate the effectiveness of a digitally-enabled mental health promotion (DEHP) campaign, we conducted an observational cross-sectional study of a 3-month (February-April 2025) nation-wide campaign in Singapore. Campaign materials were developed using a marketing funnel framework and disseminated across YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. This included narrative videos and infographics to promote symptom awareness, coping strategies, and/or patient navigation to Singapore's Mindline website, as the intended endpoint for user engagement and support. Primary outcomes include anonymised performance analytics (impressions, unique reach, video content view, engagements) stratified by demographics, device types, and sector. Secondary outcomes measured cost-efficiency metrics and traffic to the Mindline website respectively. This campaign generated 3.49 million total impressions and reached 1.39 million unique residents, with a Cost per Mille at $26.90, Cost per Click at $29.33, and Cost per Action at $6.06. Narrative videos accumulated over 630,000 views and 18,768 engagements. Overall, we demonstrate that DEHP campaigns can achieve national engagement for mental health awareness through multi-channel distribution and creative, narrative-driven designs.</description>

      <title>Analyzing News Engagement on Facebook: Tracking Ideological Segregation and News Quality in the Facebook URL Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13461v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Facebook Privacy-Protected Full URLs Dataset was released to enable independent, academic research on the impact of Facebook's platform on society while ensuring user privacy. The dataset has been used in several studies to analyze the relationship between social media engagement and societal issues such as misinformation, polarization, and the quality of consumed news. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the engagement with popular news domains, covering four years from January 2017 to December 2020, with a focus on user engagement metrics related to news URLs in the U.S. By incorporating the ideological alignment and composite score of quality and reliability of news sources, along with users' political preferences, we construct weighted averages of ideology and quality of news consumption for liberal, conservative, and moderate audiences. This allows us to track the evolution of (i) the ideological gap in news consumption between liberals and conservatives and (ii) the average quality of each group's news consumption. We identify two major shifts in trends, each tied to engagement changes. In both, the ideological gap widens and news quality declines. However, engagement rises in the first shift but falls in the second. Finally, we contextualize these trends by linking them to two major Facebook News Feed updates. Our findings provide empirical evidence to better understand user behavior and engagement with news and their leaning and reliability during the period covered by the dataset.</description>

      <title>Competing LLM Agents in a Non-Cooperative Game of Opinion Polarisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel non-cooperative game to analyse opinion formation and resistance, incorporating principles from social psychology such as confirmation bias, resource constraints, and influence penalties. Our simulation features Large Language Model (LLM) agents competing to influence a population, with penalties imposed for generating messages that propagate or counter misinformation. This framework integrates resource optimisation into the agents' decision-making process. Our findings demonstrate that while higher confirmation bias strengthens opinion alignment within groups, it also exacerbates overall polarisation. Conversely, lower confirmation bias leads to fragmented opinions and limited shifts in individual beliefs. Investing heavily in a high-resource debunking strategy can initially align the population with the debunking agent, but risks rapid resource depletion and diminished long-term influence</description>

      <title>On Word-of-Mouth and Private-Prior Sequential Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02913v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social learning constitutes a fundamental framework for studying interactions among rational agents who observe each other's actions but lack direct access to individual beliefs. This paper investigates a specific social learning paradigm known as Word-of-Mouth (WoM), where a series of agents seeks to estimate the state of a dynamical system. The first agent receives noisy measurements of the state, while each subsequent agent relies solely on a degraded version of her predecessor's estimate. A defining feature of WoM is that the final agent's belief is publicly broadcast and subsequently adopted by all agents, in place of their own. We analyze this setting theoretically and through numerical simulations, noting that some agents benefit from using the belief of the last agent, while others experience performance deterioration.</description>

      <title>User Location Disclosure Fails to Deter Overseas Criticism but Amplifies Regional Divisions on Chinese Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the behavioral impact of a user location disclosure policy on Sina Weibo, China's largest microblogging platform, using a unique high-frequency dataset of uncensored engagement, including tens of thousands of comments and replies, on prominent government and media accounts. The policy, publicly justified as a measure to curb misinformation and counter foreign influence, was abruptly rolled out on April 28, 2022. Using an interrupted time series design, we find no decline in participation by overseas users. Instead, it significantly reduced domestic engagement with local issues outside users' home provinces, particularly among critical comments. Evidence indicates this decline was not driven by generalized fear or concerns about credibility, but by a surge in regionally discriminatory replies that raised the social cost of cross-provincial engagement. Our findings suggest that identity disclosure tools can have unintended consequences by activating existing social divisions in ways that reinforce state control without direct censorship.</description>

      <title>Affective Polarization across European Parliaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Affective polarization, characterized by increased negativity and hostility towards opposing groups, has become a prominent feature of political discourse worldwide. Our study examines the presence of this type of polarization in a selection of European parliaments in a fully automated manner. Utilizing a comprehensive corpus of parliamentary speeches from the parliaments of six European countries, we employ natural language processing techniques to estimate parliamentarian sentiment. By comparing the levels of negativity conveyed in references to individuals from opposing groups versus one's own, we discover patterns of affectively polarized interactions. The findings demonstrate the existence of consistent affective polarization across all six European parliaments. Although activity correlates with negativity, there is no observed difference in affective polarization between less active and more active members of parliament. Finally, we show that reciprocity is a contributing mechanism in affective polarization between parliamentarians across all six parliaments.</description>
