      <title>Self-organizing Multiagent Target Enclosing under Limited Information and Safety Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to address the target enclosing problem using non-holonomic multiagent systems, where agents autonomously self-organize themselves in the desired formation around a fixed target. Our approach combines global enclosing behavior and local collision avoidance mechanisms by devising a novel potential function and sliding manifold. In our approach, agents independently move toward the desired enclosing geometry when apart and activate the collision avoidance mechanism when a collision is imminent, thereby guaranteeing inter-agent safety. We rigorously show that an agent does not need to ensure safety with every other agent and put forth a concept of the nearest colliding agent (for any arbitrary agent) with whom ensuring safety is sufficient to avoid collisions in the entire swarm. The proposed control eliminates the need for a fixed or pre-established agent arrangement around the target and requires only relative information between an agent and the target. This makes our design particularly appealing for scenarios with limited global information, hence significantly reducing communication requirements. We finally present simulation results to vindicate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Automatic Gradient Estimation for Calibrating Crowd Models with Discrete Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently proposed gradient estimators enable gradient descent over stochastic programs with discrete jumps in the response surface, which are not covered by automatic differentiation (AD) alone. Although these estimators' capability to guide a swift local search has been shown for certain problems, their applicability to models relevant to real-world applications remains largely unexplored. As the gradients governing the choice in candidate solutions are calculated from sampled simulation trajectories, the optimization procedure bears similarities to metaheuristics such as particle swarm optimization, which puts the focus on the different methods' calibration progress per function evaluation. Here, we consider the calibration of force-based crowd evacuation models based on the popular Social Force model augmented by discrete decision making. After studying the ability of an AD-based estimator for branching programs to capture the simulation's rugged response surface, calibration problems are tackled using gradient descent and two metaheuristics. As our main insights, we find 1) that the estimation's fidelity benefits from disregarding jumps of large magnitude inherent to the Social Force model, and 2) that the common problem of calibration by adjusting a simulation input distribution obviates the need for AD across the Social Force calculations, allowing gradient descent to excel.</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamics for Utility Maximizing Agents: Exploring the Impact of Resource Penalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a continuous-time nonlinear model of opinion dynamics with utility-maximizing agents connected via a social influence network. A distinguishing feature of the proposed model is the inclusion of an opinion-dependent resource-penalty term in the utilities, which limits the agents from holding opinions of large magnitude. The proposed utility functions also account for how the relative resources within the social group affect both an agent's stubbornness and social influence. Each agent myopically seeks to maximize its utility by revising its opinion in the gradient ascent direction of its utility function, thus leading to the proposed opinion dynamics. We show that, for any arbitrary social influence network, opinions are ultimately bounded. For networks with weak antagonistic relations, we show that there exists a globally exponentially stable equilibrium using contraction theory. We establish conditions for the existence of consensus equilibrium and analyze the relative dominance of the agents at consensus. We also conduct a game-theoretic analysis of the underlying opinion formation game, including on Nash equilibria and on prices of anarchy in terms of satisfaction ratios. Additionally, we also investigate the oscillatory behavior of opinions in a two-agent scenario. Finally, simulations illustrate our findings.</description>

      <title>Safe Voting: Resilience to Abstention and Sybils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.05271v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Voting rules may implement the will of the society when all eligible voters vote, and only them. However, they may fail to do so when sybil (fake or duplicate) votes are present and when only some honest (non sybil) voters actively participate. As, unfortunately, sometimes this is the case, our aim here is to address social choice in the presence of sybils and voter abstention. To do so we build upon the framework of Reality-aware Social Choice: we assume the status-quo as an ever-present distinguished alternative, and study Status-Quo Enforcing voting rules, which add virtual votes in support of the status-quo. We characterize the tradeoff between safety and liveness (the ability of active honest voters to maintain/change the status-quo, respectively) in several domains, and show that the Status-Quo Enforcing voting rules are often optimal. We comment on the applicability of our methods and analyses to the governance of digital communities.</description>

      <title>Editing Personality for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02168v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative task focused on editing the personality traits of Large Language Models (LLMs). This task seeks to adjust the models' responses to opinion-related questions on specified topics since an individual's personality often manifests in the form of their expressed opinions, thereby showcasing different personality traits. Specifically, we construct a new benchmark dataset PersonalityEdit to address this task. Drawing on the theory in Social Psychology, we isolate three representative traits, namely Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Agreeableness, as the foundation for our benchmark. We then gather data using GPT-4, generating responses that not only align with a specified topic but also embody the targeted personality trait. We conduct comprehensive experiments involving various baselines and discuss the representation of personality behavior in LLMs. Our intriguing findings uncover potential challenges of the proposed task, illustrating several remaining issues. We anticipate that our work can provide the NLP community with insights. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.</description>

      <title>Causal evidence for social group sizes from Wikipedia editing data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human communities have self-organizing properties in which specific Dunbar Numbers may be invoked to explain group attachments. By analyzing Wikipedia editing histories across a wide range of subject pages, we show that there is an emergent coherence in the size of transient groups formed to edit the content of subject texts, with two peaks averaging at around $N=8$ for the size corresponding to maximal contention, and at around $N=4$ as a regular team. These values are consistent with the observed sizes of conversational groups, as well as the hierarchical structuring of Dunbar graphs. We use the Promise Theory model of bipartite trust to derive a scaling law that fits the data and may apply to all group size distributions, when based on attraction to a seeded group process. In addition to providing further evidence that even spontaneous communities of strangers are self-organizing, the results have important implications for the governance of the Wikipedia commons and for the security of all online social platforms and associations.</description>

      <title>Caching-Augmented Lifelong Multi-Agent Path Finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), which involves finding collision-free paths for multiple robots, is crucial in various applications. Lifelong MAPF, where targets are reassigned to agents as soon as they complete their initial targets, offers a more accurate approximation of real-world warehouse planning. In this paper, we present a novel mechanism named Caching-Augmented Lifelong MAPF (CAL-MAPF), designed to improve the performance of Lifelong MAPF. We have developed a new type of map grid called cache for temporary item storage and replacement, and created a locking mechanism to improve the planning solution's stability. A task assigner (TA) is designed for CAL-MAPF to allocate target locations to agents and control agent status in different situations. CAL-MAPF has been evaluated using various cache replacement policies and input task distributions. We have identified three main factors significantly impacting CAL-MAPF performance through experimentation: suitable input task distribution, high cache hit rate, and smooth traffic. In general, CAL-MAPF has demonstrated potential for performance improvements in certain task distributions, map and agent configurations.</description>

      <title>Prioritize Team Actions: Multi-Agent Temporal Logic Task Planning with Ordering Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17704v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of linear temporal logic (LTL) path planning for multi-agent systems, introducing the new concept of \emph{ordering constraints}. Specifically, we consider a generic objective function that is defined for the path of each individual agent. The primary objective is to find a global plan for the team of agents, ensuring they collectively meet the specified LTL requirements. Simultaneously, we aim to maintain a pre-determined order in the values of the objective function for each agent, which we refer to as the ordering constraints. This new requirement stems from scenarios like security-aware planning, where relative orders outweigh absolute values in importance. We present an efficient algorithm to solve this problem, supported by proofs of correctness that demonstrate the optimality of our solution. Additionally, we provide a case study in security-aware path planning to illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Electric Vehicle Routing Problem for Emergency Power Supply: Towards Telecom Base Station Relief</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a telecom provider, our company has a critical mission to maintain telecom services even during power outages. To accomplish the mission, it is essential to maintain the power of the telecom base stations. Here we consider a solution where electric vehicles (EVs) directly supply power to base stations by traveling to their locations. The goal is to find EV routes that minimize both the total travel distance of all EVs and the number of downed base stations. In this paper, we formulate this routing problem as a new variant of the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) and propose a solver that combines a rule-based vehicle selector and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based node selector. The rule of the vehicle selector ensures the exact environmental states when the selected EV starts to move. In addition, the node selection by the RL model enables fast route generation, which is critical in emergencies. We evaluate our solver on both synthetic datasets and real datasets. The results show that our solver outperforms baselines in terms of the objective value and computation time. Moreover, we analyze the generalization and scalability of our solver, demonstrating the capability toward unseen settings and large-scale problems.
