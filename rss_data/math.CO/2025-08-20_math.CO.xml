      <title>Strongly Set-Colorable Graphs: A Complete Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we revisit the notion of strong set-colorings introduced by Hegde (2009) and completed by equivalences due to Boutin et al. (2010) and provide a necessary and sufficient \emph{Steiner packing} characterisation: a finite graph $G$ is strongly set-colorable if and only if its associated $3$-uniform hypergraph is a $(2,3,2^{n}-1)$-packing of the unique Steiner triple system $S(2,3,2^{n}-1)$. This unification allows many earlier necessary conditions to be derived instantly as corollaries, streamlining the structure theory of strongly set-colorable graphs.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue Distribution of Large Weighted Random Sparse Uniform $q$-Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study eigenvalue distribution of the adjacency matrix $A^{(N,p,q)}$ of weighted random uniform $q$-hypergraphs $\Gamma= \Gamma_{N,p,q}$. We assume that the graphs have $N$ vertices and the average number of hyperedges attached to one vertex is $(q-1)!\cdot p$. To each edge of the graph $e_{ij}$ we assign a weight given by a random variable $a_{ij}$ with all moments finite. We consider the moments of normalized eigenvalue counting function $\sigma_{N,p,q}$ of $A^{(N,p,q)}$. Assuming all moments of $a$ finite, we obtain recurrent relations that determine the moments of the limiting measure $\sigma_{p,q} = \lim_{N\to\infty} \sigma_{N,p,q}$.</description>

      <title>A sharp lower bound for the number of phylogenetic trees displayed by a tree-child network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A normal (phylogenetic) network with $k$ reticulations displays $2^k$ phylogenetic trees. In this paper, we establish an analogous result for tree-child (phylogenetic) networks with no underlying $3$-cycles. In particular, we show that a tree-child network with $k\ge 2$ reticulations and no underlying $3$-cycles displays at least $2^{k/2}$ phylogenetic trees if $k$ is even and at least $\frac{3}{2\sqrt{2}}2^{k/2}$ if $k$ is odd. Moreover, we show that these bounds are sharp and characterise the tree-child networks that attain these bounds.</description>

      <title>Maya-Tupi graphs: a generalization of split graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the family of Maya-Tupi graphs as those graphs that admit a partition $(A,B)$ of their vertex sets such that $A$ induces a complete multipartite graph where each part has size at most two, and $B$ induces a graph where every connected component is $K_1$ or $K_2$. The family of Maya-Tupi graphs is self complementary, generalizes split graphs, falls into the sparse-dense partitioning schema and is characterized by finitely many forbidden induced subgraphs. Unfortunately, our computational experiments show that the number of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs to characterize Maya-Tupi graphs is greater than 2000.
  In this work, we study Maya-Tupi graphs when restricted to some well-known graph classes. We find characterizations in terms of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs for disconnected graphs, trees and cographs; our results imply linear time certifying recognition algorithms for Maya-Tupi graphs within these classes. We also show that Maya-Tupi graphs can be recognized in $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$-time in $C_4$-free graphs and in graphs with bounded neighborhood diversity.</description>

      <title>Comparison between the first Steklov eigenvalue and algebraic connectivity on trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trees can be regarded as discrete analogue of Hadamard manifolds, namely simply-connected Riemannian manifolds of non-positive sectional curvature. In this paper, we compare the first (non-trivial) Steklov eigenvalue and algebraic connectivity of trees with prescribed number of boundary vertices and matching number. It is particularly noteworthy that while the extremal trees coincide for both operators, their corresponding eigenvalues differ significantly.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the Atiyah problem on configurations and the related Atiyah--Sutcliffe conjectures 1 and 2 using finite graphs, configurations of points and tensors. Our conjectures are intriguing geometric inequalities, defined using the pairwise directions of the configuration of points, just as in the original problem. The generalization of the Atiyah determinant to our setting is no longer a determinant. We call it the $G$-amplitude function, where $G$ is a finite simple graph, in analogy with probability amplitudes in quantum physics. If $G = K_n$ is the complete graph with $n$ vertices, we recover the Atiyah--Sutcliffe conjectures 1 and 2.</description>

      <title>The fundamental module of $S_3$-symmetric tridiagonal algebra associated with cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terwilliger recently introduced the $S_3$-symmetric tridiagonal algebra, a generalization of the tridiagonal algebra. This algebra has six generators naturally associated with the vertices of a regular hexagon: adjacent generators satisfy the tridiagonal relations, while non-adjacent ones commute. To each $Q$-polynomial distance-regular graph $\Gamma$, we associate scalars $\beta, \gamma, \gamma^*, \varrho, \varrho^*$, and define the corresponding $S_3$-symmetric tridiagonal algebra $\mathbb{T} = \mathbb{T}(\beta, \gamma, \gamma^*, \varrho, \varrho^*)$. Let $V$ denote the standard module of $\Gamma$. Then the tensor $V^{\otimes 3} := V \otimes V \otimes V$ supports a $\mathbb{T}$-module structure, and within it exists a unique irreducible $\mathbb{T}$-submodule called the fundamental $\mathbb{T}$-module, denoted by $\Lambda$. In this paper, we focus on the case where $\Gamma$ is a cycle with vertex set $X$ and diameter $D$. We show that the associated scalars satisfy: \begin{align*} \beta = \zeta + \zeta^{-1}, \quad \gamma = \gamma^* = 0, \quad \varrho = \varrho^* = -(\zeta-\zeta^{-1})^2, \end{align*} where $\zeta$ is a fixed primitive $|X|$th root of unity. We prove that \begin{align*} \operatorname{dim}(\Lambda) &amp; = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} \textstyle 2D^2+2 &amp; \text{if } |X| \text{ is even},\\ \textstyle 2D^2 + 2D +1 &amp; \text{if } |X| \text{ is odd}, \end{array} \right. \end{align*} and construct two explicit bases for $\Lambda$, each of which diagonalizes half of the generators of $\mathbb{T}$. Finally, we verify that Terwilliger's conjectures hold when $\Gamma$ is a cycle.</description>

      <title>Strong spectral stabilities for $C_{2k+1}$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stability result due to Ren, Wang, Wang and Yang [SIAM J. Discrete Math. 38 (2024)] shows that if $3\le r \le 2k$ and $n\ge 318 (r-2)^2k$, and $G$ is a $C_{2k+1}$-free graph on $n$ vertices with $e(G)\ge \lfloor {(n-r+1)^2}/{4}\rfloor +{r \choose 2}$, then $G$ can be made bipartite by deleting at most $r-2$ vertices. Using a different method, we give a linear bound on $n$ in terms of $k$ and show a stronger structural result, which roughly says that $G$ can be obtained from a large bipartite graph by suspending some small graphs that the total number of vertices is at most $r-2$. This improves a result of Yan and Peng (2024) by weakening the requirement on $n$ and $k$. As a direct corollary, we obtain a tight upper bound on the size of an $n$-vertex $C_{2k+1}$-free graph with chromatic number $\chi (G)\ge r$ for every $r\le 2k$. The second part of this paper concerns the spectral extremal problem for $C_{2k+1}$-free graphs. We denote by $\lambda (G)$ the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix of a graph $G$. Let $T_{n-r+1,2}\circ K_r$ be the graph obtained by identifying a vertex of the complete graph $K_r$ and a vertex of the smaller partite set of the bipartite Tur\'{a}n graph $T_{n-r+1 ,2}$. Using the spectral techniques, we prove that if $3\le r\le 2k$ and $n\ge 712k$, and $G$ is an $n$-vertex $C_{2k+1}$-free graph with chromatic number $\chi (G) \ge r$, then $\lambda (G)\le \lambda (T_{n-r+1,2}\circ K_r)$, where the equality holds if and only if $G=T_{n-r+1,2}\circ K_r$. Our result not only extends a result of Guo, Lin and Zhao [Linear Algebra Appl. 627 (2021)] as well as a result of Zhang and Zhao [Discrete Math. 346 (2023)], but also provides the first solution to the spectral extremal problem for $F$-free graphs with high chromatic number.</description>

      <title>Cyclic sieving phenomena via combinatorics of continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will exhibit several instances of the cyclic sieving phenomenon involving statistics and involutions on the following combinatorial families of objects: permutations, set partitions, perfect matchings, D-permutations (and its subclasses). Our results will be based on continued fraction identities enumerating these objects. Our instances of cyclic sieving phenomenon for permutations involve the Corteel involution; this was first studied by Adams, Elder, Lafreni\`ere, McNicholas, Striker and Welch (arxiv~2024). We will reprove several of their results using our setting of continued fractions; we will also prove two of their conjectures. Our study of set partitions and perfect matchings will involve the Kasraoui--Zeng involution and the Chen--Deng--Du--Stanley--Yan (CDDSY) involution. Finally, for D-permutations, we will construct a new involution which we call the Genocchi--Corteel involution. The common feature of all of these involutions, other than the CDDSY involution, is that they are constructed via bijections to weighted lattice paths, and that they exchange crossings and nestings on their respective objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending the slice-rank method for diagonal tensors to triangular tensors, we give new and shorter proofs for some well-known theorems on set-intersections like Frankl-Wilson and Snevily with modular constraints, and some of the more recent set-intersection results. We also improve Snevily with modular constraints in some special cases. Then, using Snevily's theorem with some combinatorial lemmas, we give new bounds on some generalizations of the reverse odd-town problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Athanasiadis and Kalampogia-Evangelinou recently conjectured that the chain polynomial of any geometric lattice has only real zeros. We verify this conjecture for families of geometric lattices including perfect matroid designs, Dowling lattices, and for a class of geometric lattices that contains all lattices of flats of paving matroids.
  We also investigate how the conjecture behaves with respect to certain operations such as direct products, ordinal sums and single-element extensions.</description>

      <title>Enumerating Vector Parking Functions and their Outcomes Based on Specified Lucky Cars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a parking function, a car is considered lucky if it is able to park in its preferred spot. Extending work of Harris and Martinez, we enumerate outcomes of parking functions with a fixed set of lucky cars. We then consider a generalization of parking functions known as vector parking functions or $\boldsymbol{u}$-parking functions, in which a nonnegative integer capacity is given to each parking spot in the street. With certain restrictions on $\boldsymbol{u}$, we enumerate outcomes of $\boldsymbol{u}$-parking functions with a fixed set of lucky cars or with a fixed number of lucky cars. We also count outcomes according to which spots contain lucky cars, and give formulas for enumerating $\boldsymbol{u}$-parking functions themselves according to their set of lucky cars.</description>

      <title>A generalization of RSK to $d$-complete posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hook length formula for $d$-complete posets expresses the number of linear extensions of a $d$-complete poset $P$ in terms of hooks of $P$. It generalizes the usual hook length formula for standard Young tableaux, as well as hook length formulas for shifted Young tableaux and trees. We give a new proof of the hook length formula for $d$-complete posets which is elementary and purely combinatorial. Our approach is to define a generalization of the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth bijection for $d$-complete posets, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Tight Bounds for Sparsifying Random CSPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of CSP sparsification asks: for a given CSP instance, what is the sparsest possible reweighting such that for every possible assignment to the instance, the number of satisfied constraints is preserved up to a factor of $1 \pm \epsilon$? We initiate the study of the sparsification of random CSPs. In particular, we consider two natural random models: the $r$-partite model and the uniform model. In the $r$-partite model, CSPs are formed by partitioning the variables into $r$ parts, with constraints selected by randomly picking one vertex out of each part. In the uniform model, $r$ distinct vertices are chosen at random from the pool of variables to form each constraint.
  In the $r$-partite model, we exhibit a sharp threshold phenomenon. For every predicate $P$, there is an integer $k$ such that a random instance on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges cannot (essentially) be sparsified if $m \le n^k$ and can be sparsified to size $\approx n^k$ if $m \ge n^k$. Here, $k$ corresponds to the largest copy of the AND which can be found within $P$. Furthermore, these sparsifiers are simple, as they can be constructed by i.i.d. sampling of the edges.
  In the uniform model, the situation is a bit more complex. For every predicate $P$, there is an integer $k$ such that a random instance on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges cannot (essentially) be sparsified if $m \le n^k$ and can sparsified to size $\approx n^k$ if $m \ge n^{k+1}$. However, for some predicates $P$, if $m \in [n^k, n^{k+1}]$, there may or may not be a nontrivial sparsifier. In fact, we show that there are predicates where the sparsifiability of random instances is non-monotone, i.e., as we add more random constraints, the instances become more sparsifiable. We give a precise (efficiently computable) procedure for determining which situation a specific predicate $P$ falls into.</description>

      <title>Generating the Spanning Trees of Series-Parallel Graphs up to Graph Automorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of generating the spanning trees of a graph $G$ up to the automorphisms or "symmetries" of $G$. After introducing and surveying this problem for general input graphs, we present algorithms that fully solve the case of series-parallel graphs, under two standard definitions. We first show how to generate the nonequivalent spanning trees of a oriented series-parallel graph $G$ in output-linear time, where both terminals of $G$ have been individually distinguished (i.e. applying an automorphism that exchanges the terminals produces a different series-parallel graph). Subsequently, we show how to adapt these oriented algorithms to the case of semioriented series-parallel graphs, where we still have a set of two distinguished terminals but neither has been designated as a source or sink. Finally, we discuss the case of unoriented series-parallel graphs, where no terminals have been distinguished and present a few observations and open questions relating to them. The algorithms we present generate the nonequivalent spanning trees of $G$ but never explicitly compute the automorphism group of $G$, revealing how the recursive structure of $G$'s automorphism group mirrors that of its spanning trees.</description>

      <title>Amplitude maximization in stable systems, Schur positivity, and some conjectures on polynomial interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $r &gt; 0$ and integers $t \ge n &gt; 0$, we consider the following ``amplitude maximization'' problem: maximize the quantity $|x_t|$ over the set of complex solutions $x = (x_0, x_1, \dots)$ of all homogeneous linear difference equations of order $n$ with the roots of characteristic polynomial in the disc $\{z \in \mathbb{C}: |z| \le r\}$, and with initial values $x_0, \dots, x_{n-1}$ in the unit disc. We find that for any $t,n,r$, the maximum is attained in the case of coinciding roots on the boundary circle; this implies that for all $r &lt; 1$, the maximum amplitude can be computed explicitly, by studying a single equation whose characteristic polynomial is $(z-r)^n$. Moreover, the optimality of the co-phase root configuration holds for origin-centered polydiscs. To prove this result, we first reduce the problem to a certain interpolation problem over monomials, then solve the latter by leveraging the theory of symmetric functions and identifying the associated Schur positivity structure. We also discuss the implications for more general Reinhardt domains. Finally, we study the problem of estimating the derivatives of a real entire function from its values at $n/2$ pairs of complex conjugate points in the unit disc. Here, we propose conjectures on the extremality of the monomial $z^n$, and restate them in terms of Schur polynomials.</description>

      <title>Surface sums in two-dimensional large-$N$ lattice Yang--Mills: Cancellations and explicit computation for general loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of two-dimensional large-$N$ lattice Yang--Mills theory, we perform a refined study of the surface sums defined in the companion work [BCSK24]. In this setting, the surface sums are a priori expected to exhibit significant simplifications, because two-dimensional Yang--Mills theory is a special model admitting many known exact formulas. Thus, a natural problem is to understand these simplifications directly from the perspective of the surface sums. Towards this goal, we develop a key new tool, in the form of a surface exploration algorithm (or "peeling process") which at each step carefully selects the next edge to explore. Using this algorithm, we manage to find many cancellations in the surface sums, thereby obtaining a detailed understanding of precisely which surfaces remain after cancellation. As a consequence, we obtain many new explicit formulas for Wilson loop expectations of general loops in the large-$N$ limit of lattice Yang--Mills in two dimensions and prove a convergence result for the empirical spectral measure of any simple loop.</description>

      <title>Finding subdigraphs in digraphs of bounded directed treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that directed treewidth does not enjoy the nice algorithmic properties of its undirected counterpart. There exist, however, some positive results that, essentially, present XP algorithms for the problem of finding, in a given digraph $D$, a subdigraph isomorphic to a digraph $H$ that can be formed by the union of $k$ directed paths (with some extra properties), parameterized by $k$ and the directed treewidth of $D$. Our motivation is to tackle the following question: Are there subdigraphs, other than the directed paths, that can be found efficiently in digraphs of bounded directed treewidth? In a nutshell, the main message of this article is that, other than the directed paths, the only digraphs that seem to behave well with respect to directed treewidth are the stars. For this, we present a number of positive and negative results, generalizing several results in the literature, as well as some directions for further research.</description>

      <title>The separating variety for matrix invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a linear algebraic group defined over an algebraically closed field $k$, and let $V$ be a vector space on which $G$ acts linearly. The separating variety $\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$ is the subvariety of $V^2$ consisting of pairs of points indistinguishable by invariant polynomials in $k[V]^G$. Its geometry places restrictions on the existence of small separating sets, i.e. sets of invariants which distinguish the same points as the full algebra of invariants. The purpose of this article is to study the separating variety in the important special case where $G=\mathrm{GL}_p(\mathbb{C})$ acts on the set $V$ of $n$-tuples of $p \times p$ matrices by simultaneous conjugation. We define a purely combinatorial poset, $\mathcal{P}_{p,n}$, whose maximal elements are in 1-1 correspondence with the irreducible components of $\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$. We show that $\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$ is a variety of dimension $(n+1)p^2-1$, and determine its subdimension for all $n$ and $p$. In particular we show the subdimension is $(n+1)p^2-p$ if $n \geq 3$, or $n \geq 2$ and $p \geq 4$. In the case $n \geq 3$, we give a formula for the number of components of given codimension in $\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$. We give explicit decompositions of $\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$ for all $n$ where $p=2,3$ or $4$. Our results in particular show that when $n\geq 2$ and $p\geq 4$, or $n\geq 3$ and $p=3$, $\mathbb{C}[V]^G$ does not contain a polynomial or hypersurface separating set. It was proven in arXiv:2202.05717 that the same is true if $n \geq 4$ and $p=2$. The author made a conjecture in arXiv:2211.17088 generalising the Skronowski-Weyman theorem for representations of quivers. The results of this paper prove that conjecture in two important special cases: for the quiver with one vertex and an arbitrary number, $n$, of loops, and for the quiver with two vertices and $n$ arrows between them.</description>

      <title>Embeddings of the line graphs associated with the essential graphs of commutative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a finite commutative ring with unity $1 \neq 0.$ An ideal of $A$ is said to be essential if it has a non-zero intersection with every non-zero ideal of $A.$ The essential graph of $A$ is a simple undirected graph whose vertex set consists of all non-zero zero-divisors of $A.$ Two different vertices $u$ and $v$ are connected by an edge precisely when the ideal formed by the annihilator of their product $uv$ is essential in $A.$ This paper examines the minimal embeddings of the line graph of the essential graph of $A$ into orientable surfaces as well as non-orientable surfaces. Our results include a complete classification of finite commutative rings for which the line graphs of their essential graphs is planar, outerplanar or have genus or crosscap number at most two. We also characterize all such non-local rings for which the line graph of their zero-divisor graph is outerplanar.</description>

      <title>A PC Algorithm for Max-Linear Bayesian Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Max-linear Bayesian networks (MLBNs) are a relatively recent class of structural equation models which arise when the random variables involved have heavy-tailed distributions. Unlike most directed graphical models, MLBNs are typically not faithful to d-separation and thus classical causal discovery algorithms such as the PC algorithm or greedy equivalence search can not be used to accurately recover the true graph structure. In this paper, we begin the study of constraint-based discovery algorithms for MLBNs given an oracle for testing conditional independence in the true, unknown graph. We show that if the oracle is given by the $\ast$-separation criteria in the true graph, then the PC algorithm remains consistent despite the presence of additional CI statements implied by $\ast$-separation. We also introduce a new causal discovery algorithm named "PCstar" which assumes faithfulness to $C^\ast$-separation and is able to orient additional edges which cannot be oriented with only d- or $\ast$-separation.</description>

      <title>A survey of congruences and quotients of partially ordered sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03765v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quotient of a poset $P$ is a partial order obtained on the equivalence classes of an equivalence relation $\theta$ on $P$; $\theta$ is then called a congruence if it satisfies certain conditions, which vary according to different theories. The literature on congruences and quotients of partially ordered sets contains a large and profilerating array of approaches, but little in the way of systematic exposition and examination of the subject. We seek to rectify this by surveying the different theories in the literature and providing philosophical discussion on requirements for notions of congruences of posets. We advocate a pluralist approach which recognises that different types of congruence arise naturally in different mathematical situations. There are some notions of congruence which are very general, whilst others capture specific structure which often appears in examples. Indeed, we finish by giving several examples where quotients of posets appear naturally in mathematics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An interesting phenomenon in combinatorics on words is when every recurrent word satisfying some avoidance constraints has the same factor set as a morphic word. An early example is the Hall-Thue word, fixed point of the morphism $\texttt{0}\to\texttt{012}$, $\texttt{1}\to\texttt{02}$, $\texttt{2}\to\texttt{1}$, which is essentially the only ternary word avoiding squares and the words \texttt{010} and \texttt{212}. We provide some examples of this phenomenon from various contexts.</description>

      <title>On the existence of reflecting $n$-queens configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1967, Klarner proposed a problem concerning the existence of reflecting $n$-queens configurations. The problem considers the feasibility of placing $n$ mutually non-attacking queens on the reflecting chessboard, an $n\times n$ chessboard with a $1\times n$ "reflecting strip" of squares added along one side of the board. A queen placed on the reflecting chessboard can attack the squares in the same row, column, and diagonal, with the additional feature that its diagonal path can be reflected via the reflecting strip. Klarner noted the equivalence of this problem to a number theory problem proposed by Slater, which asks: for which $n$ is it possible to pair up the integers 1 through $n$ with the integers $n+1$ through $2n$ such that no two of the sums or differences of the $n$ pairs of integers are the same. We prove the existence of reflecting $n$-queens configurations for all sufficiently large $n$, thereby resolving both Slater's and Klarner's questions for all but a finite number of integers.</description>

Abstract: Gosper developed an algorithm for performing arithmetic operations on continued fractions (CFs), getting a CF as the result. Straightforward implementation of the algorithm leads to infinite loops on some inputs. Here we present a modified version of the arithmetic algorithm and prove that it avoids all difficulties with infinite loops. We then combine CF arithmetic with the spigot algorithm to compute the CF expansions of exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions of CFs. We have implemented these algorithms in Haskell.</description>

  In this paper, we will use a similar procedure to obtain an upper bound of the same type in the case of semidirect products $\mathbb{Z}_p \rtimes_{\varphi} H$ where $\varphi: H \to Aut(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ satisfies $\varphi(h) \in \{id, -id\}$ for each $h \in H$ and where $H$ is abelian and each subset of $H$ can be ordered such that all of its partial products are distinct.</description>

Abstract: A $3$-partition of an $n$-element set $V$ is a triple of pairwise disjoint nonempty subsets $X,Y,Z$ such that $V=X\cup Y\cup Z$. We determine the minimum size $\varphi_3(n)$ of a set $\mathcal{E}$ of triples such that for every 3-partition $X,Y,Z$ of the set $\{1,\dots,n\}$, there is some $\{x,y,z\}\in \mathcal{E}$ with $x\in X$, $y\in Y$, and $z\in Z$. In particular, $$\varphi_3(n)=\left\lceil{\frac{n(n-2)}{3}}\right\rceil.$$ For $d&gt;3$, one may define an analogous number $\varphi_d(n)$. We determine the order of magnitude of $\varphi_d(n)$, and prove the following upper and lower bounds, for $d&gt;3$: $$\frac{2 n^{d-1}}{d!} -o(n^{d-1}) \leq \varphi_d(n) \leq \frac{0.86}{(d-1)!}n^{d-1}+o(n^{d-1}).$$</description>

      <title>Finite $s$-geodesic transitive graphs under certain girths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an integer $s\geq1$ and a graph $\Gamma$, a path $(u_0, u_1, \ldots, u_{s})$ of vertices of $\Gamma$ is called an {\em $s$-geodesic} if it is a shortest path from $u_0$ to $u_{s}$. We say that $\Gamma$ is {\em $s$-geodesic transitive} if, for each $i\leq s$, $\Gamma$ has at least one $i$-geodesic, and its automorphism group is transitive on the set of $i$-geodesics. In 2021, Jin and Praeger [J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 178 (2021) 105349] have studied $3$-geodesic transitive graphs of girth $5$ or $6$, and they also proposed to the problem that to classify $s$-geodesic transitive graphs of girth $2s-1$ or $2s-2$ for $s=4, 5, 6, 7, 8$. The case of $s = 4$ was investigated in [J. Algebra Combin. 60 (2024) 949--963]. In this paper, we study such graphs with $s\geq5$. More precisely, it is shown that a connected $(G,s)$-geodesic transitive graph $\Gamma$ with a nontrivial intransitive normal subgroup $N$ of $G$ which has at least $3$ orbits, where $G$ is an automorphism group of $\Gamma$ and $s\geq 5$, either $\Gamma$ is the Foster graph and $\Gamma_N$ is the Tutte's $8$-cage, or $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma_N$ have the same girth and $\Gamma_N$ is $(G/N,s)$-geodesic transitive. Moreover, it is proved that if $G$ acts quasiprimitively on its vertex set, then $G$ is an almost simple group, and if $G$ acts biquasiprimitively, the stabilizer of biparts of $\Gamma$ in $G$ is an almost simple quasiprimitive group on each of biparts. In addition, $G$ cannot be primitive or biprimitive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13915v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the techniques developed in [5] to present several consequences of studying UMP algebras and the ramifications graph of a monomial bound quiver algebra. Specifically, we prove that every weakly connected component of the ramifications graph of a UMP monomial algebra is unilaterally connected. Furthermore, using the main result characterizing UMP algebras in the monomial context, we prove that the class of UMP algebras is equivalent to the class of special multiserial algebras when the algebra is a quadratic monomial algebra. Based on this equivalence and the classification of Chen-Shen-Zhou on Gorenstein projective modules in [6], we extend their results to the class of monomial special multiserial UMP algebras, where we use the analysis of homological properties on quadratic monomial algebras given by these authors.</description>

      <title>Dynamically syndetic sets and the combinatorics of syndetic, idempotent filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A subset of the positive integers is dynamically central syndetic if it contains the times that a point returns to a neighborhood of itself in a minimal topological dynamical system. These sets are part of the highly-influential link between dynamics and combinatorics forged by Furstenberg and Weiss in the 1970's. Our main result is a characterization of dynamically central syndetic sets as precisely those sets that belong to syndetic, idempotent filters. This gives a "global" analogue to the well-known "local" characterization of Furstenberg's central sets as members of minimal, idempotent ultrafilters. Applying the main result, we answer two open questions posed by Host, Kra, and Maass concerning sets of pointwise topological recurrence.</description>

      <title>The GFB Tree and Tree Imbalance Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12854v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tree balance plays an important role in various research areas in phylogenetics and computer science. Typically, it is measured with the help of a balance index or imbalance index. There are more than 25 such indices available, recently surveyed in a book by Fischer et al. They are used to rank rooted binary trees on a scale from the most balanced to the least balanced. We show that a wide range of subtree-size based measures satisfying concavity and monotonicity conditions are minimized by the complete or greedy-from-the-bottom (GFB) tree and maximized by the caterpillar tree, yielding an infinitely large family of distinct new imbalance indices. Answering an open question from the literature, we show that one such established measure, the $\widehat{s}$-shape statistic, has the GFB tree as its unique minimizer. We also provide an alternative characterization of GFB trees, showing that they are equivalent to complete trees, which arise in different contexts. We give asymptotic bounds on the expected $\widehat{s}$-shape statistic under the uniform and Yule-Harding distributions of trees, and answer questions for the related $Q$-shape statistic as well.</description>

      <title>NP-Hardness and ETH-Based Inapproximability of Communication Complexity via Relaxed Interlacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that computing the deterministic communication complexity D(f) of a Boolean function is NP-hard in the standard protocol-tree model, answering, independently and concurrently with Hirahara-Llango-Loff (arXiv:2507.10426), a question first posed by Yao (1979). Our reduction builds and expands on a suite of structural "interlacing" lemmas introduced by Mackenzie and Saffidine (arXiv:2411.19003); these lemmas can be reused as black boxes in future lower-bound constructions.
  The instances produced by our reduction admit optimal protocols for self-similar constructions with strong structural properties, giving a flexible framework for the design of reductions showing NP-hardness of deciding the communication complexity of a Boolean matrix. This complements the work by Hirahara, Ilango, and Loff, which establishes NP-hardness in the same model via a different route; our analysis additionally yields reusable structural guarantees and underpins further consequences concerning inapproximability.
  Because the gadgets in our construction are self-similar, they can be recursively embedded. We sketch how this yields, under the Exponential-Time Hypothesis, an additive inapproximability gap that grows without bound. Furthermore we outline a route toward NP-hardness of approximating D(f) within a fixed constant additive error. Full details of the ETH-based inapproximability results will appear in a future version.
  Beyond settling the complexity of deterministic communication complexity itself, the modular framework we develop opens the door to a wider class of reductions and, we believe, will prove useful in tackling other long-standing questions in communication complexity.</description>

      <title>Perfect t-embeddings and the octahedron equation of the two-periodic Aztec diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the connection between perfect t-embeddings and the octahedron equation in the setting of the two-periodic Aztec diamond. In particular, we show that the positions of both the t-embedding and the corresponding origami map can be expressed as sums of density functions arising from solutions to the octahedron equation with appropriate flat initial conditions.</description>

      <title>New examples of $M\setminus L$: intruder sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exhibit new examples of regions of $M\setminus L$ where $M$ and $L$ denote the Markov and Lagrange spectra, respectively. These regions have a different nature from all known regions studied so far: they contain \emph{intruder sets} associated with distinct combinatorics that trespass the region where self-replication holds. Our construction follows the usual self-replication method but replaces the standard local uniqueness condition with a more flexible and weaker property. These examples emerged from a large-scale computational search for regions of $M\setminus L$, which indicates that many such regions with intruder sets exist. We conclude with some open problems about these new regions.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of constrained reconfiguration and motion planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coordinating the motion of multiple agents in constrained environments is a fundamental challenge in robotics, motion planning, and scheduling. A motivating example involves $n$ robotic arms, each represented as a line segment. The objective is to rotate each arm to its vertical orientation, one at a time (clockwise or counterclockwise), without collisions nor rotating any arm more than once. This scenario is an example of the more general $k$-Compatible Ordering problem, where $n$ agents, each capable of $k$ state-changing actions, must transition to specific target states under constraints encoded as a set $\mathcal{G}$ of $k$ pairs of directed graphs.
  We show that $k$-Compatible Ordering is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete, even when $\mathcal{G}$ is planar, degenerate, or acyclic. On the positive side, we provide polynomial-time algorithms for cases such as when $k = 1$ or $\mathcal{G}$ has bounded treewidth. We also introduce generalized variants supporting multiple state-changing actions per agent, broadening the applicability of our framework. These results extend to a wide range of scheduling, reconfiguration, and motion planning applications in constrained environments.</description>
