      <title>Machine Learning Models for Dengue Forecasting in Singapore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With emerging prevalence beyond traditionally endemic regions, the global burden of dengue disease is forecasted to be one of the fastest growing. With limited direct treatment or vaccination currently available, prevention through vector control is widely believed to be the most effective form of managing outbreaks. This study examines traditional state space models (moving average, autoregressive, ARIMA, SARIMA), supervised learning techniques (XGBoost, SVM, KNN) and deep networks (LSTM, CNN, ConvLSTM) for forecasting weekly dengue cases in Singapore. Meteorological data and search engine trends were included as features for ML techniques. Forecasts using CNNs yielded lowest RMSE in weekly cases in 2019.</description>

      <title>Rooting behavior of pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) hardwood cuttings in relation to genotype and irrigation frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study was conducted to determine the best irrigation frequency for rooting hardwood cuttings of some pomegranate genotypes that are cultivated in Halabja province, Kurdistan Region, Iraq. The hardwood cuttings were collected from 11 genotypes, which were 'Salakhani Trsh' (G1), 'Salakhani Mekhosh' (G2), 'Amriki' (G3), 'Twekl Sury Trsh' (G4), 'Twekl Astury Naw Spy' (G5), 'Hanara Sherina' (G6), 'Kawa Hanary Sherin' (G7), 'Kawa Hanary Trsh' (G8), 'Malesay Twekl Asture' (G9), 'Malesay Twekl Tank' (G10), and 'Sura Hanary Trsh' (G11). The genotypes were subjected to irrigation applications by 1-day, 2-day, 7-day, or 10-day frequencies. Among pomegranates, G11, G6, and G7 produced 95, 90, and 83% rooting percentages, which were significantly higher than the rest of other genotypes. The lowest rooting percentages (28, 36, 38, and 40%) were found in G1, G5, G3, and G10, respectively. The effect of irrigation frequencies on the genotypes confirmed that a 7-day frequency was the best irrigation frequency to achieve the maximum rooting percentages (93, 86, 80, 73, 53, and 40%) in G6, G9, G2, G4, G3, and G1, respectively. In contrast, the minimum rooting percentage (20%) was recorded in G3 with a 1-day frequency and in G1 with 10-day frequency. In this study, it was found that the cuttings of G11, G6, and G7 had the best ability to form roots, and irrigation with a 7-day frequency was the best for the cuttings of all the 11 pomegranate genotypes investigated.</description>

      <title>Cement Dust Exposure and Risk of Hyperglycemia and Overweight among Artisans and Residents Close to a Cement Factory in Sokoto, Nigeria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential health risks of cement dust exposure are increasingly raising concern worldwide as the cement industry expands in response to rising cement demand. This necessitates the need to determine the nature of the risks in order to develop appropriate measures. This study determined the effects of cement dust exposure on the weight and blood glucose levels of people residing or working around a cement company in Sokoto, Nigeria. Demographic information was obtained using questionnaires from 72 participants, which included age, gender, educational level, exposure hours, occupation, and lifestyle. The blood glucose levels and body mass index (BMI) were measured using a Fine Test glucometer and a mechanical scale, respectively. The results showed that most of the people living or working around the cement company were middle-aged men (31-40; 42.06%) with a primary (33.33%) or secondary (45.83%) school education. It showed that 30 (41.69%) of the participants were overweight while 5 (6.94%) were obese. Additionally, 52.78% of the participants were diabetic while 31.94% were prediabetic. Participants that were exposed for long hours (&gt; 15 hours per day) were the most diabetic (20% of the participants), followed by smokers (15%), and artisans (7%). It can be concluded that exposure to cement dust from the company increased the risk of overweight, obesity, and hyperglycemia among the participants. These health risks were worsened by daily long hours of exposure, smoking, and artisanal pollutant exposure. Human settlements and artisans should not be located near the cement company, and the company should minimize pollutant emissions.</description>

      <title>Development of Hydrogen Bonding Magnetic Reaction-based Gene Regulation through Cyclic Electromagnetic DNA Simulation in Double-Stranded DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.7091</link>
      <description>arXiv:1210.7091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proton-magnetic reaction is commonly used in MRI machines with a strong magnetic field of over 1 T, while this study hypothesized that the electron magnetic reaction of hydrogen could affect the hydrogen bonds of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) at a low magnetic field below 0.01 T. The goal is to develop a hydrogen bonding magnetic reaction-based gene regulation (HBMR-GR) system. The polarities of DNA base pairs are derived from the relative electrostatic charge between purines and pyrimidines, which become positively and negatively charged, respectively. The Pyu dsDNAs with pyrimidine(s)-purine(s) sequences, ds3T3A, ds3C3G, and ds3C3A, showed stronger DNA hybridization potential, increased infrared absorption at 3400-3200 cm-1, and a unique DNA conformation in HPLC analysis compared to the corresponding Puy dsDNAs. To target the three-dimensional structure of dsDNA based on the DNA base pair polarities, one can use cyclic electromagnetic DNA simulation (CEDS) with approximately 25% efficiency for randomly oriented dsDNAs. CEDS was found to induce sequence-specific hybridization of target oligo-dsDNAs in 0.005M NaCl solution and sequence-specific conformation of oligo-dsDNAs in 0.1M NaCl solution. It was found that the Pyu oligo-dsDNAs were more responsible for the hybridization and conformational changes by CEDS than the Puy oligo-dsDNAs. CEDS decreased ethidium bromide (EtBr) DNA intercalation and spermidine DNA condensation depending on CEDS time in the binding assay. The results also included that the Pyu oligo-dsDNAs were more responsible for CEDS by forming stable and unique conformation of oligo-dsDNA than the Therefore, it is postulated that the low-level HBMR-based CEDS can enhance the hybridization potential of oligo-dsDNAs and subsequently lead to the unique DNA conformation required for the initiation of various DNA functions.</description>
