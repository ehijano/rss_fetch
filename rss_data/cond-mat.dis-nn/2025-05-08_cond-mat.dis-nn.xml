      <title>Spin-glass quantum phase transition in amorphous arrays of Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experiments performed with neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezers and coherently coupled to the Rydberg state allow quantum simulations of paradigmatic Hamiltonians for quantum magnetism. Previous studies have focused mainly on periodic arrangements of the optical tweezers, which host various spatially ordered magnetic phases. Here, we perform unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the ground state of quantum Ising models for amorphous arrays of Rydberg atoms. These models are designed to feature well-controlled local structural properties in the absence of long-range order. Notably, by determining the Edwards-Anderson order parameter, we find evidence of a quantum phase transition from a paramagnetic to a spin-glass phase. The magnetic structure factor indicates short-range isotropic antiferromagnetic correlations. For the feasible sizes, the spin-overlap distribution features a nontrivial structure with two broad peaks and a sizable weight at zero overlap. The comparison against results for the clean kagome lattice, which features local structural properties similar to those of our amorphous arrays, highlights the important role of the absence of long-range structural order of the underlying array. Our findings indicate a route to experimentally implement the details of a Hamiltonian which hosts a quantum spin-glass phase.</description>

      <title>Report on Neural-like Criticality in Ag-based Nanoparticle Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emulating the neural-like information processing dynamics of the brain provides a time and energy efficient approach for solving complex problems. While the majority of neuromorphic hardware currently developed rely on large arrays of highly organized building units, such as in rigid crossbar architectures, in biological neuron assemblies make use of dynamic transitions within highly parallel, reconfigurable connection schemes. Neuroscience suggests that efficiency of information processing in the brain rely on dynamic interactions and signal propagations which are self-tuned and non-rigid. Brain-like dynamic and avalanche criticality have already been found in a variety of self-organized networks of nanoobjects, such as nanoparticles (NP) or nanowires. Here we report on the dynamics of the electrical spiking signals from Ag-based self-organized nanoparticle networks (NPNs) at the example of monometallic Ag NPNs, bimetallic AgAu alloy NPNs and composite Ag/ZrN NPNs, which combine two distinct NP species. We present time series recordings of the resistive switching responses in each network and showcase the determination of switching events as well as the evaluation of avalanche criticality. In each case, for Ag NPN, AgAu NPN and Ag/ZrN NPN, the agreement of three independently derived estimates of the characteristic exponent provides evidence for avalanche criticality. The study shows that Ag-based NPNs offer a broad range of versatility for integration purposes into physical computing systems without destroying their critical dynamics, as the composition of these NPNs can be modified to suit specific requirements for integration.</description>

      <title>Phase Retrieval via Gain-Based Photonic XY-Hamiltonian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-retrieval from coded diffraction patterns (CDP) is important to X-ray crystallography, diffraction tomography and astronomical imaging, yet remains a hard, non-convex inverse problem. We show that CDP recovery can be reformulated exactly as the minimisation of a continuous-variable XY Hamiltonian and solved by gain-based photonic networks. The coupled-mode equations we exploit are the natural mean-field dynamics of exciton-polariton condensate lattices, coupled-laser arrays and driven photon Bose-Einstein condensates, while other hardware such as the spatial photonic Ising machine can implement the same update rule through high-speed digital feedback, preserving full optical parallelism. Numerical experiments on images, two- and three-dimensional vortices and unstructured complex data demonstrate that the gain-based solver consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art Relaxed-Reflect-Reflect (RRR) algorithm in the medium-noise regime (signal-to-noise ratios 10--40 dB) and retains this advantage as problem size scales. Because the physical platform performs the continuous optimisation, our approach promises fast, energy-efficient phase retrieval on readily available photonic hardware. uch as two- and three-dimensional vortices, and unstructured random data. Moreover, the solver's accuracy remains high as problem sizes increase, underscoring its scalability.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic thresholds in combinatorial optimization depend on the time scaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last decades, many efforts have focused on analyzing typical-case hardness in optimization and inference problems. Some recent work has pointed out that polynomial algorithms exist, running with a time that grows more than linearly with the system size, which can do better than linear algorithms, finding solutions to random problems in a wider range of parameters. However, a theory for polynomial and superlinear algorithms is in general lacking. In this paper, we examine the performance of the Simulated Annealing algorithm, a standard, versatile, and robust choice for solving optimization and inference problems, in the prototypical random $K$-Sat problem. For the first time, we show that the algorithmic thresholds depend on the time scaling of the algorithm with the size of the system. Indeed, one can identify not just one, but different thresholds for linear, quadratic, cubic regimes (and so on). This observation opens new directions in studying the typical case hardness in optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Connecting NTK and NNGP: A Unified Theoretical Framework for Wide Neural Network Learning Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04522v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks have revolutionized machine learning in recent years, but a complete theoretical framework for their learning process is still lacking. Substantial advances were achieved for wide networks, within two disparate theoretical frameworks: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), which assumes linearized gradient descent dynamics, and the Bayesian Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP). We unify these two theories using gradient descent learning with an additional noise in an ensemble of wide deep networks. We construct an analytical theory for the network input-output function and introduce a new time-dependent Neural Dynamical Kernel (NDK) from which both NTK and NNGP kernels are derived. We identify two learning phases: a gradient-driven learning phase, dominated by loss minimization, in which the time scale is governed by the initialization variance. It is followed by a slow diffusive learning stage, where the parameters sample the solution space, with a time constant decided by the noise and the Bayesian prior variance. The two variance parameters strongly affect the performance in the two regimes, especially in sigmoidal neurons. In contrast to the exponential convergence of the mean predictor in the initial phase, the convergence to the equilibrium is more complex and may behave nonmonotonically. By characterizing the diffusive phase, our work sheds light on representational drift in the brain, explaining how neural activity changes continuously without degrading performance, either by ongoing gradient signals that synchronize the drifts of different synapses or by architectural biases that generate task-relevant information that is robust against the drift process. This work closes the gap between the NTK and NNGP theories, providing a comprehensive framework for the learning process of deep wide neural networks and for analyzing dynamics in biological circuits.</description>

      <title>Topological protection breakdown: a route to frustrated ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phases manifesting topological patterns in functional systems, like ferroelectric and ferromagnetic vortex superlattices, are typically frustrated non-ergodic states characterized by high-dimensional energy landscapes with intricate and apparently ungovernable behavior. This is also the case for potassium-tantalate-niobate (KTN) crystals. These transparent ferroelectrics manifest remarkable but little-understood metastable domain patterns at optical (micrometer and above) scales near the cubic-to-tetragonal structural phase transition. Here, we formulate the Topological Breakdown Model based on the competition between intrinsic scales of domain-domain collinear and non-collinear interactions associated with polarization-charge screening. The model is able to explain the KTN mesoscopic domain patterns and phase diagram as a function of temperature and external electric field. Findings include a precise set of sharp and broad percolative transitions that are experimentally verified, validating the model. Our study identifies the central role played by competing topologically protected states, identifying the fundamental link between topological protection and frustration that supports a hitherto unexplored functional non-ergodic arena.</description>

      <title>Statistical field theory of random graphs with prescribed degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical field theory methods have been very successful with a number of random graph and random matrix problems, but it is challenging to apply these methods to graphs with prescribed degree sequences due to the extensive number of constraints that enforce the desired degree at each vertex. Building on top of recent results where similar methods are applied to random regular graph counting, we develop an accurate statistical field theory description for the adjacency matrix spectra of graphs with prescribed degrees. For large graphs, the expectation values are dominated by functional saddle points satisfying explicit equations. For the case of regular graphs, this immediately leads to the known McKay distribution. We then consider mixed-regular graphs with N1 vertices of degree d1, N2 vertices of degree d2, etc, such that the ratios N_i/N are kept fixed as N goes to infinity. For such graphs, the eigenvalue densities are governed by nonlinear integral equations of the Hammerstein type. Solving these equations numerically reproduces with an excellent accuracy the empirical eigenvalue distributions.</description>
