      <title>Halo Lightcones with Optimised Orientation and Interpolation in Cosmological Simulations -- an application to mock H$\alpha$ selected galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical step to create realistic mock catalogs that support large-scale photometric and spectroscopic sky surveys is the production of cosmological simulations that accurately model the survey observables taking into account the redshift-dependent galaxy formation and evolution processes. Here we develop an efficient framework, HOLCon (Halo Optimised Lightcone Constructor), for post-facto construction of dark matter halo lightcones from simulations and use them to generate a mock galaxy catalogue. HOLCon includes a module to optimise the lightcone's orientation within the simulation box, minimising repeated structures when the survey volume exceeds a single box -- a common challenge in modern surveys. A linear interpolation scheme tracks the evolution of halo properties across snapshots. Applied to the publicly available Uchuu simulation, we construct a lightcone of 50 ${\rm deg}^2$ and extending up to $z = 10$, providing representative coverage of deep fields of Stage IV surveys. We validate the lightcone for cosmological applications by comparing the dark matter halo clustering in the lightcone with those from the original simulation snapshots. Subsequently, we make the galaxy-halo connection on the lightcone with a redshift extended version of the SciPIC algorithm producing a comprehensive set of descriptive galaxy attributes. HOLCon leverages Dask, a scalable parallel computing pythonic framework for fast construction of dark matter halo lightcones enabling rapid creation of multiple statistical realizations essential for robust cosmological inference. The produced galaxy mock makes predictions for clustering of H$\alpha$ emitters, making it a useful cosmology resource.</description>

      <title>Buried but not destroyed: the evolution from prompt cusps to NFW haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internal structure of dark matter haloes encodes their assembly history and offers critical insight into the nature of dark matter and structure formation. Analytical studies and high-resolution simulations have recently predicted the formation of 'prompt cusps' - steep power-law density profiles that emerge rapidly from the monolithic collapse of primordial peaks. Yet, by $z=0$ most haloes are well described by Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profiles, raising the question of how these early cusps are transformed in a cosmological setting. We address this problem using 64 zoom-in $N$-body simulations of eight haloes, each resimulated with eight different free-streaming wavenumbers to control the abundance of small-scale structure while keeping the large-scale environment fixed. To mitigate numerical discreteness effects, we classify artificial fragments and genuine subhaloes with a physically motivated procedure based on matching subhaloes to their progenitor peaks. At the population level, we demonstrate that haloes initially form prompt cusps, and their profiles subsequently transition towards the NFW form. Our study reveals three distinct pathways by which prompt cusps evolve: major mergers, accretion of artificial fragments, and interactions with large-scale filaments, each having a distinct impact on the inner density profile. In particular, we show that the original power-law cusp remains visible in the profile of particles associated with the primordial peak even when the total halo profile is already NFW-like. This work highlights the imprint of early collapse on present-day halo structure and provides new insights into the origin of the universality of the NFW profile.</description>

      <title>A high-dynamic-range view of the growth of structure and the warm/hot Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryons heat to temperatures above $&gt;\!\!10^5\,\mathrm{K}$ as they accrete onto massive overdensities -- galaxies, groups, clusters, and filaments -- where they ionize and become optically transparent. Deep mm-wave observations such as those with ALMA have begun to probe a handful ($\sim\,$4) of massive systems at $z\!\sim\!2-4$, while low-resolution mm-wave surveys have detected thousands of objects at arcminute resolution out to $z\!\approx\!2$. To truly advance the field of the evolution of large-scale structures, mapping the warm/hot distribution of ionized gas out to the redshift of their formation, the ESO community requires a large-aperture single-dish (sub-)mm telescope. This will need to provide several orders of magnitude higher mapping speeds than currently available while preserving the few arcsecond resolution required for imaging the gas and removing contaminating radio and dusty thermal signals across the full (sub-)mm wavelength range.</description>

      <title>AtLAST -- Cosmology with submillimetre galaxies magnification bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnification bias offers a uniquely powerful and independent route to cosmological information. As a gravitational-lensing observable, it probes galaxy-matter correlations without relying on galaxy shapes, PSF modelling, or intrinsic-alignment corrections. Its sensitivity spans both geometry and growth: magnification bias simultaneously responds to the matter density, the amplitude of structure, and the redshift evolution of dark energy (DE) below $z \leq 1$. Importantly, its parameter degeneracy directions differ from those of shear, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, making it a complementary and consistency-check probe with substantial diagnostic value for the next decade of precision cosmology. However, the current potential of magnification bias is restricted by limited sky coverage, catalogue inhomogeneities, and insufficiently precise redshift or number-count characterisation. A next-generation wide-field submillimetre facility like AtLAST -- capable of uniform, deep surveys and spectroscopic mapping -- would overcome these limitations and transform magnification bias into a competitive, high-precision cosmological tool.</description>

      <title>AtLAST -- Determination of Halo Mass Density Profiles at kpc Scales through Magnification Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnification bias, the lensing-induced modification of background source number counts, provides a uniquely powerful probe of the mass density profiles of galaxies and clusters down to kpc scales. Unlike shear-based weak lensing, magnification bias does not rely on galaxy shapes and thus avoids dominant small-scale systematics. Existing studies, however, are limited by sky coverage, positional uncertainty, and insufficiently deep, confusion-limited submillimetre (submm) surveys. A next-generation wide-field, high-throughput submm facility like the proposed 50m-telescope AtLAST is required to unlock this technique's full diagnostic power.</description>

      <title>Catalogs of optically-selected clusters and photometric luminous red galaxies from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program final year dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct samples of optically-selected clusters and photometric luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program final year dataset covering $\sim 1200$~deg$^2$. The cluster catalogs extend out to the redshift of $1.38$ and contain more than 10000 clusters with richness larger than $15$, where the richness is defined to be a membership probability weighted number of galaxies above the stellar masses of approximately $10^{10.2}M_\odot$. The total number of probable red cluster member galaxies in these clusters are more than $6\times 10^5$. Photometric redshifts of the clusters are shown to be precise with the scatter better than $\sim 0.01$ for a wide redshift range. We detect stacked weak lensing signals of clusters out to the redshift of $1$, and use them to update constraints on the mass-richness relation. Our catalog of about 6 million photometric LRGs extend out to the redshift of $1.25$, and have the scatter of the photometric redshift better than $\sim 0.02$ for the redshift range between $0.4$ and $1.0$.</description>

      <title>Revealing the baryon cycle in Galaxy Clusters: connecting galaxy dynamics and gas thermodynamics using (sub-)mm-wave and optical IFU surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations in the visible and near infrared are transforming our view of the processes affecting galaxy evolution, much of which is dominated by interactions with the large scale environment. Yet a complete picture is missing, as no corresponding high resolution view of the warm/hot intracluster, circumgalactic, and intergalactic media exists over large areas and a comparably broad range of redshifts. Combined with wide-field optical IFU surveys such as CATARSIS, a large diameter sub-mm telescope with a degree-scale field of view would enable a joint view of galaxy dynamics and gas thermodynamics, transforming our understanding of environmental processes.</description>

      <title>Invisible gravitons and large-scale magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale limits on the relic signals of gravitational radiation complement the bounds coming from the interferometric detectors (in the audio band) and from the pulsar timing arrays (in the nHz range). Within this inclusive perspective the spectral energy density of the gravitons is sharply suppressed in the aHz region even though the high frequency signal can be comparatively much larger both in the kHz and GHz domains. For there are no direct tests on the expansion rate prior to the formation of the light nuclei, a modified postinflationary timeline affects the total number of $e$-folds and additionally suppresses the tensor to scalar ratio by making the relic signals effectively invisible in the aHz range. The expansion rate prior to nucleosynthesis is further bounded by the evolution of the hypercharge field and the large-scale magnetism also constrains the decelerated expansion rate. The magnetogenesis requirements are compatible with a potentially detectable spectral energy density of the relic gravitons between the MHz and the THz while the tensor to scalar ratio remains suppressed in the aHz region. A maximum of the spectral energy density of the gravitons in the audio domain leads instead to a larger magnetic field when the scale of the gravitational collapse of the protogalaxy (of the order of the Mpc) gets comparable with the Hubble radius before equality. Along a converse viewpoint the results obtained here imply that a long decelerated stage expanding faster than radiation does not affect the high frequency range but reduces the effective number of $e$-folds by so enhancing the tensor to scalar ratio, possibly beyond its observational limit.</description>

      <title>A sub-ppm upper limit on the cosmological variations of the fine structure constant alpha</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absorption spectroscopy toward high-redshift quasars provides strong constraints on the putative variation of fundamental constants of physics on cosmological time scales. The submillimeter ground-state transitions of methylidyne (CH) and water (H2O), both molecules widespread and coeval in the interstellar medium, provide a sensitive test for variations of alpha, the fine structure constant, and mu, the proton-to-electron mass ratio, taking advantage of the unmatched spectral resolution and frequency reliability of radio techniques. We used ALMA simultaneous observations of the two species to constrain any velocity offset between their absorption profiles toward the radio-bright lensed quasars PKS1830-211 (z_abs=0.88582) and B0218+357 (z_abs=0.68466). Our observational setup minimizes instrumental errors and known sources of systematics, such as time variability of the absorption profile and frequency-dependent morphology of the background quasar. The excellent correlation between CH and H2O opacities, the large number of individual narrow velocity components, and the number of independent spectra obtained due to the intrinsic time variability of the absorption profiles ensure that even the chemical segregation bias is minimized. We obtained bulk velocity shifts delta_v = -0.048 pm 0.028 km/s and -0.13 pm 0.14 km/s (1 sigma confidence level) between CH and H2O in the direction of PKS1830-211(NE) and B0218+357(SW), respectively. These values convert into the 3sigma upper limits |Delta_alpha/alpha| &lt; 0.55 ppm and 1.5 ppm, respectively, taking into account the independent upper limits on |Delta_mu/mu| previously obtained for these systems. These constraints on |Delta_alpha/alpha|, at look-back times of about half the present age of the Universe, are two to four times deeper than previous constraints on any other single high-z system.</description>

      <title>Primordial features and low-$\ell$ suppression from isocurvature modes in multi-field Higgs-$R^2$ inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study primordial perturbations in Higgs-$R^2$ inflation in the presence of a non-minimal kinetic mixing between the Higgs and the scalaron. By performing a full numerical integration of the multifield background and linear perturbations, we identify distinct dynamical regimes controlled by the non-minimal coupling $\xi_h$. For $\xi_h \sim \mathcal{O}(0.1)$, the turning rate of the inflationary trajectory induces transient multifield effects that imprint localized features in the scalar power spectrum. In the limit $\xi_h\ll 1$, the adiabatic spectrum becomes featureless, but isocurvature modes fail to fully decay, leaving a residual contribution at the end of inflation. We compute CMB angular power spectra TT, TE, EE and show how these regimes yield distinct observational signatures, delineating the parameter space compatible with current bounds. Our results highlight that suppressing spectral features does not guarantee the elimination of isocurvature perturbations, placing non-trivial constraints on Higgs-$R^2$ multifield realizations and motivating future probes sensitive to primordial isocurvature.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Reconstruction of $\Lambda(t)$CDM Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have performed two kinematic parametrizations for $\Lambda(t)$CDM models, namely, the linear expansions $\Lambda(z)=\Lambda_0+\Lambda_1z$ and $Q(z)=Q_0+Q_1z$, where $Q$ is the interaction term. In the case of the $Q(z)$ parametrization, we have also tested the particular case of a constant interaction term, $Q(z)=Q_0$. In order to constrain the free parameters of these models, we have used Cosmic Chronometers (CC), SNe Ia data (Pantheon+\&amp;SH0ES) and BAO data. As a general result, we have found weak constrains over the free parameters of the analysed models. In the case of $\Lambda(z)$, we have found for the $\Lambda$ variation parameter, $\Omega_{\Lambda1}\equiv\frac{\Lambda_1}{3H_0^2}=0.02\pm0.14$. In the case of the $Q(z)$ parametrization, we have worked with the dimensionless interaction term $\gQ(z)\equiv\frac{8\pi GQ(z)}{3H_0^3}$, from which we have found $\gQ_0=0.1\pm5.8$ and $\gQ_1=0.06\pm0.67$. In the particular case of a constant interaction term, we have found $\gQ_0=-0.1\pm5.7$. All these constraints are at 68\% c.l. The constraints we have obtained are compatible with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, although still providing a large margin for $\Lambda$ variation.</description>

      <title>kSZ for everyone: the pseudo-Cl approach to stacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a harmonic-space estimator for the cross-correlation between the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and the reconstructed galaxy momentum field that offers several practical advantages over the traditional stacking approach. The estimator is easy to deploy using relatively modest computational resources and recovers all information available in the galaxy-kSZ cross-correlation. In particular, by using well-understood power spectrum estimation techniques, its statistical uncertainties, including potential correlated uncertainties with other large-scale structure observables, can be easily and accurately estimated. Moreover, standard kSZ stacking measurements can be reconstructed exactly from the estimator at a lower computational cost, employing harmonic-space, catalog-level techniques to recover all small-scale information.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of a gravitational wave background (GWB) can be established not only via exquisitely precise pulsar timing array (PTA) measurements, but also via astrometric observations. Indeed, the very same background responsible for the delay in the arrival time of pulse causes an apparent displacement of galactic objects as stars and asteroids. In this work we provide a framework that allows to derive the displacement of sources overcoming the usually adopted ``infinite distance'' approximation. We also present how this formalism can be used to study the displacements of objects at distances comparable to the GW wavelength, as asteroids, and of objects with a non-trivial three-dimensional distribution, as stars in the Milky Way. Thus, it can be used to probe frequencies beyond PTA experiments, reaching the mHz GWs, also detectable by LISA. We forecast the capability of observing the astrometric deflection induced by a GWB evaluating the harmonic signal-to-noise ratio including correlations between different probes. We find an SNR greater than one for the relevant cases considered and as a consequence a promising Fisher forecast, suggesting a constraining power up to the percent level for a flat background.</description>

      <title>A universal scaling law for gravitational waves induced during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic gravitational wave background induced by arbitrary source fields that are amplified during cosmological inflation. The associated tensor spectral index is shown to be given, under minimal assumptions, by a simple formula easy to use in most situations of accelerated expansion. For slow-roll inflation, the induced spectrum is nearly scale-invariant, with an index that slightly deviates from the standard outcome of vacuum generated gravitational waves. Remarkably, we demonstrate that scale invariance remains true regardless of the original spectrum of the source.</description>

      <title>Clustering with Light (but Massive) Relics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the effect of Light (but Massive) Relics (LiMRs) on the clustering of matter in the early Universe. We account for the fact that LiMRs which are massive enough may cluster on large length scales at early times, and may thus impact weak lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) even on small angular scales. In particular, we find that LiMRs in the $\gtrsim$ eV mass range (and even $&gt; 10$ eV), can constitute a non-negligible component of dark matter. This opens up a class of scenarios in which energy is injected as dark radiation, but begins to redshift as matter before recombination, thus avoiding constraints on $\Delta N_{eff}$ while providing an eV-range dark matter component.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Strings Gravitational Wave Probe of Leptogenesis: Thermal, Non-thermal, Near-resonant and Flavourful</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breaking a global or local $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ symmetry at high scales simultaneously generates Majorana masses for heavy right-handed neutrinos and produces a network of cosmic strings. The evolution and decay of these strings source a stochastic gravitational-wave background that may be probed by current and future gravitational-wave experiments, while the decays of the resulting massive right-handed neutrinos can generate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis. We derive analytical bounds for successful leptogenesis with a global and a local $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, separately finding an absolute lower bound on the lightest right-handed neutrino mass $M_1 &gt; 1.74 \times 10^{8}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ for thermal initial conditions and $M_1 &gt; \mathcal{O}(10^{6})\,\mathrm{GeV}$ for non-thermal initial conditions. Allowing for near-resonant leptogenesis relaxes these bounds to TeV scale in both cases making it a viable target at collider searches complementing the GW signals. Full flavour effects are included, and crucially, we determine the region where successful leptogenesis can be probed through gravitational-wave observations in upcoming experiments such as LISA and Einstein Telescope. Importantly, we find that flavour effects rescue regions of the parameter space that are ruled out due to current CMB or gravitational wave measurements.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Constraints on Scalar-Tensor Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we derive novel constraints on scalar-tensor theories from neutrino physics. Spatial variations of the background scalar field effectively generate density and position-dependent Standard Model masses, including neutrinos. Neutrinos are a unicum in the SM due to their ability both to propagate over galactic distances and to traverse dense media such as Earth. This makes them an ideal probe of the background scalar field, which can in turn alter flavour oscillations and supernova time delays. As we enter the era of precision neutrino physics, we are compelled to explore such a scenario. We derive expressions for the relevant observables and obtain new bounds on a broad class of scalar-tensor models. We finally map the bounds to popular screening mechanisms models, such as the Symmetron and Chameleon.</description>

      <title>A Cosmic Higgs Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines frameworks and phenomenology of ultrarelativistic Higgs vacuum bubble collisions in a first-order phase transition associated with the Standard Model Higgs field in the early Universe. Such collisions act as a cosmic scale Higgs collider, providing access to energy scales far beyond any temperature reached in our cosmic history, potentially up to the Planck scale. This provides a unique opportunity to probe new physics that couples to the Higgs at very high scales, while also enabling novel applications for various cosmological phenomena, opening tremendous opportunities for particle physics and cosmology. As examples, we demonstrate the viability of nonthermal production of ultra-heavy Higgs portal dark matter up to $10^{16}$ GeV (with observable indirect and direct detection signals up to $m_\text{DM}=O(10)$ TeV), and leptogenesis from the production of GUT scale right-handed neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Connection between galaxy morphology and dark-matter halo structure II: predicting disk structure from dark-matter halo properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how galactic disk structures connect to the detailed properties of their host dark-matter halos using the TNG50 simulation. From the hydrodynamic and matched dark-matter-only runs, we measure a comprehensive list of halo properties describing density structure, angular momentum, shape, assembly history, and environment. Using the morphological decomposition developed in Paper I, we quantify the sizes, scale heights, and mass fractions of the disk components for galaxies at $0 \le z \le 4$. Random Forest (RF) regression shows halo properties alone predict disk size and thickness with high accuracy, while Symbolic Regression (SR) provides compact empirical relations with slightly lower accuracy. Disk height is consistently easier to predict than disk size, and lower-mass halos yield higher accuracy than massive halos. Predictions based on halo properties measured in the full-physics hydro simulations outperform those based on the matched dark-matter-only halos, reflecting the imprint of baryonic restructuring on the inner halo. SHAP analysis reveals that the most informative halo parameters include concentration, Einasto shape, global and inner spin, and recent mass accretion, though their importance varies across disk properties. We show that correlations between disk size and the density-profile shape arise primarily from disk-induced modification of the inner halo, rather than a primordial connection. Finally, we point out that disks become more extended with respect to their host halos at higher redshift in low-mass halos, while massive high-redshift halos show the opposite trend. We provide SR-based prescriptions that accurately map halo properties to disk structures, offering practical tools for galaxy-halo modeling.</description>

      <title>Quantum Walks and Exact RG in de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The local physics of light scalar fields in de Sitter space is well described by classical random walks, as expressed through the framework of Stochastic Inflation. Recent work has clarified how this formalism arises from quantum field theory (QFT) and the renormalization group (RG), allowing for corrections to this formalism to be determined order by order. Yet, this description is incomplete. For example, the quantum dynamics of these fields are expected to become important when determining the tail of the probability distribution for the fluctuations. In this paper, we develop the understanding of fields in de Sitter as a quantum walk in order to bridge the gap between the classical and quantum description. We use the framework of exact RG to calculate the evolution equation for the reduced density matrix of the long wavelength fields. This master equation provides the direct map from light fields to models of quantum walks. We show how to reduce the master equation to Stochastic Inflation, and provide a new understanding of how the higher-order corrections arise. In the process, we demonstrate that divergences and secular growth in de Sitter, for both light and heavy fields, can be absorbed by (dynamical) renormalization.</description>

      <title>AtLAST -- A five fold increase in the number of identified Strongly Lensed Galaxies in the sub-millimetre and its consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful probe of cosmology, dark matter (DM), and high-redshift galaxy evolution, but current samples of strongly lensed galaxies (SLGs) remain far too small to exploit its full potential. $\textit{Herschel}$'s submillimeter (submm) surveys demonstrated that submm selection provides the most efficient and least biased route to identifying high-redshift SLGs, yet produced only a few hundred systems over limited, heterogeneous fields. Achieving the thousands of SLGs required for precision cosmology and detailed studies of distant dusty star-forming galaxies demands a new, wide-area, homogeneous sub-mm survey. A facility like AtLAST, capable of extending $\textit{Herschel}$-like methodologies to much larger areas, is uniquely positioned to deliver the order-of-magnitude increase in SLG numbers needed for transformative progress.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Reionization Epoch through 21\,cm and Line Intensity Mapping Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The epoch of reionization (EoR), marking the Universe's transition from a neutral to ionized state, represents a pivotal phase for understanding the formation of the first stars and galaxies. Intensity mapping of atomic and molecular lines, such as $[\mathrm{CII}]$ and CO J-ladder transitions, across a broad redshift range is a powerful tool for investigating star formation history, metallicity, the distribution of gas and dust, and the physical conditions within galaxies. Additionally, 21\,cm line intensity mapping directly probes the neutral hydrogen content in the intergalactic medium, offering a unique window into the timing and morphology of reionization. In this study, we explore the cross-correlation between the 21\,cm signal and multi-line intensity mapping (LIM) to forecast their detectability for next-generation experiments. Our analysis emphasizes the complementary potential of these techniques to constrain parameters such as the minimum mass of ionizing sources and the ionization fraction $x_e$. Cross-correlations with LIM also enable constraints on physical properties like metal enrichment and the relationship between star formation rates and multi-line luminosities. Using mock observations from Square Kilometre Array (SKA)-low 21\,cm and Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST)-like LIM experiments, we find that the $[\mathrm{CII}]$--21\,cm cross-correlation can constrain reionization history by measuring $x_e$ across multiple redshift bins with significance levels ranging from 9 to 40$\sigma$. We extend our analysis to CO transitions, showing that the CO(1-0)--21\,cm cross-correlation provides competitive constraints on reionization parameters. The synergies explored here will enable robust constraints on both reionization and LIM parameters, maximizing the scientific return of current and next-generation intensity mapping experiments.</description>

      <title>The Role of Microstate Degeneracy in Phase Transitions: Gravitational Waves from Bubble Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vacuum bubbles, formed in first order phase transitions, have important implications for cosmology. In particular, they source gravitational waves. Usually, it is assumed that, once bubbles are materialized, their state, further evolution and mergers are well-described classically. This paper will show that this intuition breaks down for bubbles which possess high microstate degeneracy. This is generic when the phase transition breaks spontaneously a symmetry. First, the degeneracy enhances the transition rate. Furthermore, the internal quantum state of the bubbles profoundly affects the classical dynamics of their mergers. A bubble, no matter how macroscopic, is born in a maximally entangled quantum state. This state can be viewed as a symmetric superposition of many different would-be classical bubbles. The inner entanglement is largely maintained up until their mergers. The resulting true quantum dynamics of the merger is macroscopically different from any type of classical mergers. These differences are imprinted as macroscopic features in the resulting classical gravitational waves. In this way, the inner microstate entanglement of merging bubbles provides a qualitatively new source of gravitational waves. This phenomenon is quantified and compared with the swift memory burden effect in black hole mergers.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes as Seeds for Extremely Overmassive AGN Observed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently identified Abell 2744-QSO1 as a compact, metal-poor, black hole (BH) dominated galaxy at $z\simeq 7$. This system exhibits an extreme black-hole-to-stellar mass ratio and unusually low metallicity, posing significant challenges to BH seeding models. Motivated by these discoveries, we perform high-resolution cosmological simulations with a massive primordial black hole (PBH; $M_{\rm BH}=5\times10^7\,M_\odot$) seed, incorporating for the first time a fully coupled treatment of PBH accretion, BH feedback, and Population~III/II star formation and stellar feedback. Although PBHs accelerate structure formation through the seed effect, the associated strong thermal feedback from the accretion delays the onset of star formation to $z\lesssim 10$, producing short, bursty episodes throughout the subsequent evolution. PBH-driven outflows expel enriched gas from the nucleus, while sustained inflows from the intergalactic medium continuously replenish pristine material. This feedback-regulated cycle naturally yields low accretion rates ($\dot{m}_{\rm BH}/\dot{m}_{\rm edd} \sim 1-10\%$), subsolar metallicities ($Z/Z_\odot\lesssim10^{-2}$) and extreme $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratios during both the initial star-forming phase and the subsequent quenching phases, in excellent agreement with JWST observations. Our results demonstrate that massive PBHs offer a viable pathway for forming the most extreme high-redshift systems, providing a physically motivated explanation for the extraordinary properties of Abell 2744-QSO1, as a sub-class of the broader population of JWST-discovered "little red dots".</description>

      <title>NIKA2 Cosmological Legacy Survey. First measurement of the confusion noise at the IRAM 30 m telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The NIKA2 Cosmological Legacy Survey (N2CLS) is a large programme using the NIKA2 dual-band camera on the IRAM 30\,m telescope. Its goal is to improve our understanding of the physics of distant Dusty Star Forming Galaxies (DSFGs) by carrying out deep surveys of two fields, GOODS-North and COSMOS. This work is focussed on GOODS-North, which was observed for 78.2 hours, simultaneously at 1.2 and 2\,mm, with a field of view of $\sim$240\,arcmin$^2$. With such a deep integration, we were able to measure, for the first time, the confusion noise limits at the 30\,m telescope using the best sampled $\sim 62$\,arcmin$^2$ and masking sources with a flux greater than 0.54 or 0.17\,mJy at 1.2 or 2\,mm, respectively. We found a confusion noise of $139.1^{+ 15.9}_{- 19.2}\pm11.9$\,$\mu$Jy/beam at 1.2\,mm and $38.6^{+ 9.6}_{- 13.1} \pm3.7$\,$\mu$Jy/beam at 2\,mm (the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is the cosmic variance). In this region, this corresponds to half the instrumental noise. To derive these estimates, we devised a novel estimator, referred to as the cross variance, which also enabled us to estimate the correlated confusion noise between the two bands. Thus, we obtained a result of $49.6^{+ 15.9}_{- 24.8}\pm 6.4$\,$\mu$Jy/beam. These values are consistent with the state of the art Simulated Infrared Dusty Extragalactic Sky (SIDES) model.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Bounds on Scotogenic Model with Asymmetric Mediator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cosmological constraints on the asymmetric mediator scenario, a variant of the scotogenic model that addresses the origins of neutrino masses, dark matter (DM), and the baryon asymmetry. An SU(2)$_L$ doublet scalar $\eta$ mediates between the visible and dark sectors, while a singlet scalar $\sigma$ serves as the DM candidate. We evaluate the DM relic abundance by solving the Boltzmann equations including $\eta$ decay and scattering processes prior to the freeze-out of the $\eta$ asymmetry, and show Big Bang nucleosynthesis constraints from late-time $\eta$ decays. Combining the DM abundance and BBN bounds, we find the favored parameter space of this model, for instance, the mediator masses of $m_\eta \lesssim \mathcal{O}(10)$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Confinement in $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a detailed analysis of the gravitational wave spectrum of $SU(N)$ pure Yang-Mills theory. The confinement phase transition is described with an effective Polyakov loop model, using the latest lattice data as an input. In particular, recent lattice studies clarified the large-$N$ scaling of the surface tension, which we incorporate through a modification of the kinetic term. We demonstrate that the thin-wall approximation agrees with the Polyakov loop model at small $N$ while it breaks down at large $N$. Furthermore, we include reliable estimates of the bubble wall velocity using a recently developed framework based on a large enthalpy jump at the phase transition. Altogether, this allows us to derive the gravitational wave signals for all $SU(N)$ confinement phase transitions and clarifies the behaviour at large $N$. The strongest signal arises for $N=20$, but overall the predicted signals remain rather weak. Our work paves the way for future studies of other gauge groups and systems with fermions.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger and time-domain astronomy in the 2040s</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-messenger astronomy will be transformed in the 2040s by an unprecedented volume of detections from next-generation gravitational wave, high-energy, and ultra-high energy neutrino, cosmic ray, and time domain observatories. This white paper, prepared for the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Expanding Horizons call, outlines the key science questions enabled by this emerging multi-messenger ecosystem, ranging from nucleosynthesis and dense matter physics to cosmology, fundamental physics, and the growth of black holes across cosmic time. We demonstrate that fully exploiting these discoveries requires a step change in optical to near infrared spectroscopic capability, including low latency response, high throughput, and flexible time domain operations across both hemispheres. We argue that without a dedicated large-aperture time domain facility, the scientific return of multi-messenger astronomy in the 2040s will be considerably limited.</description>

      <title>Cluster properties as a function of dynamical state in the DESI Legacy x UNIONS surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the dynamical state of galaxy clusters influences their galaxy populations and mass distributions. Using photometrically selected clusters from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey cross-matched with the UNIONS galaxy shear catalogue, we classify clusters as evolved or evolving based on their rest-frame r-band magnitude gaps and stellar mass ratios between the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and bright satellites. We measure the stellar mass functions, weak-lensing profiles, and radial number density and red-fraction profiles of stacked clusters in both subsamples. Evolved clusters exhibit more concentrated lensing profiles, bimodal stellar mass functions dominated by massive BCGs, and a deficit of intermediate-mass satellites, while evolving clusters show flatter central lensing signals and an excess of massive satellites. Applying the same selection to IllustrisTNG clusters reproduces these trends and links the observed differences to distinct mass accretion histories. These results demonstrate the close link between cluster galaxy populations and the overall dynamical state of their underlying dark matter halo.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Inflation in Numerical Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A set of 3+1 equations for stochastic inflation incorporating all metric and scalar matter degrees of freedom, first presented in previous work, are re-derived in a gauge invariant manner. We then present numerical implementations of these stochastic equations, cast in the BSSN formulation of Numerical Relativity, demonstrating their efficacy in both a slow-roll and an ultra slow-roll scenario. We find the evolution is correctly reproduced for all the dynamical variables, and the energy and momentum constraints are well-satisfied. This demonstrates that the stochastic equations are theoretically and numerically robust and ready to be applied to a wider inflationary landscape. Our simulations result in real space realizations of the fully non-linear stochastic dynamics with gradient information retained. As a generalisation of standard stochastic inflation, inflationary numerical relativity and lattice cosmology, this work opens up the possibility for reliable predictions of non-perturbative phenomena and provides precise initial conditions for subsequent cosmological eras.</description>

      <title>NGC 3521 as the Milky Way near twin: spectral energy distribution from UV to radio decameter ranges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Milky Way analogues (MWAs) are usually selected from structural and kinematic properties, but robust SED-based similarity criteria are limited by heterogeneous photometry and incomplete wavelength coverage. We present a homogeneous, aperture-photometry SED of the Milky Way near-twin NGC~3521 from the ultraviolet to the radio decameter range. Fluxes are measured within a fixed elliptical isophotal aperture using GALEX, SDSS, WISE, Spitzer/MIPS, Herschel/PACS+SPIRE, and VLA data, and supplemented by meter/decameter constraints. We report new observations obtained in Jan-Feb 2022 with the Ukrainian T-shape radio telescope and derive, for the first time, an upper limit in the 24--32~MHz band. The UV-to-decameter SED (27 points) is modelled with \textsc{CIGALE}, including a dedicated low-frequency radio prescription (\texttt{radio_extra}) that accounts for emission and absorption effects. Using ZTF and NEOWISE data (2014--2025), we detect genuine nuclear variability; optical trends at $\sim2^{\prime\prime}$ primarily trace the compact nucleus, while NEOWISE variability reflects a mix of nuclear changes and warm-dust emission within the larger aperture. The preferred fit yields $M_\star \simeq 6.0\times10^{10},M_\odot$, ${\rm SFR}\simeq1.65,M_\odot,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, $M_{\rm dust}\simeq1.3\times10^{8},M_\odot$, and an effective dust temperature of $\sim23$~K. The decameter constraint gives $S_{28,{\rm MHz}}&lt;11.22$~Jy, consistent with expectations for a Milky Way-like system placed at 10.7~Mpc. We conclude that an integrated, homogeneous SED, especially below 100~MHz, provides a complementary diagnostic for identifying and validating MWAs and for interpreting how Milky Way properties would appear to an external observer.</description>

Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) arises generically in scenarios for physics beyond the Standard Model that have dark sectors with light mediators or strong dynamics. The self-interactions allow energy and momentum transport through halos, altering their structure and dynamics relative to those produced by collisionless dark matter. SIDM models provide a promising way to explain the diversity of galactic rotation curves, and they form a predictive and versatile framework for interpreting astrophysical phenomena related to dark matter. This review provides a comprehensive explanation of the physical effects of dark matter self-interactions in objects ranging from galactic satellites (dark and luminous) to clusters of galaxies and the large-scale structure. The second major part describes the methods used to constrain SIDM models including current constraints, with the aim of advancing tests with upcoming galaxy surveys. This part also provides a detailed review of the unresolved small-scale structure formation issues and concrete ways to test simple SIDM models. The review is rounded off by a discussion of the theoretical motivation for self-interactions, degeneracies with baryonic and gravitational effects, extensions to the single-component elastic-interactions SIDM framework, and future observational and theoretical prospects.</description>

      <title>CMB delensing with deep learning</title>

Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) stands as a pivotal source for studying weak gravitational lensing. While the lensed CMB aids in constraining cosmological parameters, it simultaneously smooths the original CMB's features. The angular power spectrum of the unlensed CMB showcases sharper acoustic peaks and more pronounced damping tails, enhancing the precision of inferring cosmological parameters that influence these aspects. Although delensing diminishes the $B$-mode power spectrum, it facilitates the pursuit of primordial gravitational waves and enables a lower variance reconstruction of lensing and additional sources of secondary CMB anisotropies. In this work, we explore the potential of deep learning techniques, specifically the U-Net++ algorithm, to play a pivotal role in CMB delensing. We analyze three fields, namely $T$, $Q$, and $U$ sky maps, present the angular power spectra of the CMB delensed $TT$, $EE$, $BB$, and $TE$, and compare them with the unlensed CMB angular power spectra. Our findings reveal that the angular power spectrum of the lensed CMB, processed by U-Net++, closely aligns with that of the unlensed CMB. Thus, U-Net++ based CMB delensing proves to be effective in mitigating the impacts of weak gravitational lensing, paving the way for enhancing the CMB delensing power spectrum in forthcoming CMB experiments. The code utilized for this analysis is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the interaction strength in the model of interacting dynamical dark energy with linear and non-linear interacting terms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work the observational constraints on interaction coupling parameter between dynamical dark energy and cold dark matter were obtained using CMB, BAO and SN Ia data. The dark energy in considered models is dynamical and evolution of its equation of state parameter depends on dark coupling and internal properties of the dark energy. Such model is believed to be more physically consistent than models of interacting dark energy considered in previous works. Constraints were made for three types of interaction. The first two are the types which are often considered in other works on interacting dark energy. The third type has the non-linear dependence on densities of dark components and is studied for the first time. Observational constraints on Hubble constant $H_{0}$ for the first two models are in strong disagreement with so called local measurements of $H_{0}$. And the third model is in better agreement with local measurements than $\Lambda$CDM model. Also for the last non-linear model existence of non-zero interaction was found at greater than $1\sigma$ significance level.</description>

      <title>Hints of Primordial Magnetic Fields at Recombination and Implications for the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial Magnetic Fields (PMFs), long studied as relics of the early Universe, accelerate recombination and have been proposed as a way to relieve the Hubble tension. However, previous studies relied on simplified toy models. Here we use recent evaluations of recombination with PMFs, incorporating full magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and detailed Lyman-alpha radiative transfer, to test PMF-enhanced recombination ($b\Lambda$CDM) against observational data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and Type Ia supernovae (SN). Focusing on non-helical PMFs with a Batchelor spectrum, we find a preference for present-day total field strengths of approximately 5-10 pico-Gauss. Depending on the dataset combination, this preference ranges from mild ($\sim 1.8\sigma$ with Planck + DESI) to moderate ($\sim 3\sigma$ with Planck + DESI + SH0ES-calibrated SN) significance. The $b\Lambda$CDM has Planck + DESI $\chi^2$ values equal to or better than $\Lambda$CDM while predicting a higher Hubble constant. Future high-resolution CMB temperature and polarization measurements will be crucial for confirming or further constraining PMFs at recombination. Field strengths of 5-10 pico-Gauss align closely with those required for cluster magnetic fields to originate entirely from primordial sources, without the need for additional dynamo amplification.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Spectroscopic Redshift Errors on Cosmological Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21182v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectroscopic redshift errors, including redshift uncertainty and catastrophic failures, can bias cosmological measurements from galaxy redshift surveys at sub-percent level. In this work, we investigate their impact on the full-shape analysis using contaminated mock catalogs. We find that redshift uncertainty introduces a scale-dependent damping effect on the power spectrum, which is absorbed by counterterms in clustering model, keeping parameter biases below $5\%$. Catastrophic failures suppress the power spectrum amplitude by an approximately constant factor that scales with the catastrophic rate $f_c$. While this effect is negligible for DESI galaxy populations ($f_c=1\%$), the slitless-like errors, combining redshift uncertainty with $f_c=5\%$ catastrophics, introduce significant biases in cosmological constraints. In this case, we observe $6\%$ to $16\%$ shifts ($\sim2.2\sigma$ level) in estimating the fractional growth rate $df\equiv f/f^{\rm{fid}}$ and the log primordial amplitude $\ln(10^{10} A_{s})$. Applying the correction factor $(1-f_c)^2$ on the galaxy power spectrum mitigates the bias but weakens the parameter constraints due to new degeneracies. Alternatively, fixing $f_c$ to its expected value restores the constraining power with a modest bias of $1.0\sigma$. Our results indicate that for space-based slitless surveys such as \textit{Euclid}, at minimum accurate estimation of $f_c$ and its incorporation into the clustering model are essential to get unbiased cosmological inference. Extending to evolving dark energy and massive neutrino cosmologies, redshift errors do not bias the dark energy properties parametrized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, but can degrade constraints on the summed neutrino mass $\sum m_\nu$ by up to 80% in the worst case.</description>

      <title>An improved model for the effect of correlated Si-III absorption on the one-dimensional Lyman-$\alpha$ forest power spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of Si III absorption and its effect on the 1D Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum using the Sherwood-Relics hydrodynamical simulation suite. In addition to oscillations from the Ly$\alpha$--Si III cross correlation that are damped toward smaller scales, we find an enhancement in small-scale power that has been ignored in previous studies. We therefore develop a new analytical fitting function that captures two critical effects that have previously been neglected: distinct Ly$\alpha$ and Si III line profiles, and a variable ratio for coeval Ly$\alpha$ and Si III optical depths. In contrast to earlier work, we also predict amplitudes for the Si III power spectrum and Ly$\alpha$--Si III cross power spectrum that decrease toward lower redshift due to the hardening metagalactic UV background spectrum at $z\lesssim 3.5$. The fitting function is validated by comparison against multiple simulated datasets at redshifts $2.2\leq z \leq 5.0$ and wavenumbers $k &lt; 0.2\rm\,s\,km^{-1}$. Our model has little effect on existing warm dark matter constraints from the Ly$\alpha$ forest when adopting a physically motivated prior on the silicon abundance. It will, however, be an essential consideration for future, high precision Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum measurements.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing of 21 cm HI signal: detection prospects at z ~ 1 with uGMRT in galaxy cluster lenses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The atomic hydrogen HI content of galaxies is intimately related to star formation and galaxy evolution through the baryon cycle, which involves processes such as accretion, feedback, outflows, and gas recycling. While probing the HI gas over cosmic time has improved our understanding, direct HI detection with the redshifted 21 cm line is essentially limited to $z\lesssim 0.42$. Detections beyond this redshift are based on stacking to obtain average HI mass of galaxy populations. Gravitational lensing by the cluster lenses enhances the HI signal and can extend the redshift limit further. In this work, we describe simulations of HI lensing in cluster lenses. We explore the feasibility of detecting strongly lensed HI emission from background galaxies using known $50$ cluster lenses within the uGMRT sky coverage. We demonstrate that certain clusters offer a strong likelihood of HI detection. We also investigate how strong lensing distorts the HI spectral lines. The shape of the HI signal in these lensing models provides useful information and can be used in optimising signal extraction in blind and targeted HI surveys. We find that blind detection of HI signal from galaxies in the redshift range up to $1.58$ requires more than a few hundred hours of observations of individual clusters with the uGMRT. Detecting HI emission in galaxies with strong optical lensing seems promising, with a $5\sigma$ detection potential in less than 50 hours for Abell 370 and 75 hours for Abell 1703 using the uGMRT.</description>

We include in this analysis 35 multiple images from 13 background sources, of which 25 are spectroscopically confirmed thanks to observations from the MUSE, spanning a redshift range from z = 0.535 to z = 4.877. After fully reanalysing the MUSE spectroscopy, we combine it with archival spectroscopic catalogues allowing us to select 65 secure cluster members. This sample is further complemented with 114 photometric member galaxies, identified within the Euclid VIS and NISP imaging down to magnitude H = 23. We also measure the stellar velocity dispersions for 22 cluster members, in order to calibrate the Faber-Jackson relation and hence the scaling relations for the subhalo mass components. We test and compare 11 total mass parametrisations of the galaxy cluster with increasing complexity. To do so, we employ the new parametric strong lensing modelling code Gravity.jl. Our best fit total mass parametrisation is characterised by a single large scale halo, 179 subhalo components, and an external shear term. The reference model yields a mean scatter between the model predicted and observed positions of the multiple images of 0.32 arcseconds. We are able to quantify the systematics arising from our modelling choices by taking advantage of all the different explored total mass parametrisations. When our results are compared with those from other lensing studies, we notice an overall agreement in the reconstructed cluster total mass profile in the outermost strong lensing regime: the discrepancy in the innermost region of the cluster (few kiloparsec from the brightest cluster galaxy, where few or no strong lensing features are observed) could possibly be ascribed to the different data and modelling choices.</description>

      <title>Baryonic Feedback across Halo Mass: Impact on the Matter Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upcoming weak-lensing surveys will probe the matter distribution at a few percent level on nonlinear scales ($k&gt;1\,{\rm h\,Mpc}^{-1}$) where baryonic feedback from galaxy formation modifies the clustering of matter. Using the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations, we quantify the mass and radial dependence of baryonic suppression of the matter power spectrum by selectively replacing halos in the collisionless run with their full-physics counterparts. We find that group-scale halos with $\log M_{\rm 200m}/h^{-1}M_\odot \in[13, 14]$ dominate the suppression, contributing a large fraction of the total reduction in power at $k\sim2-30\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. The suppression is smaller on either side of this mass bin. Correctly reproducing the full suppression of the power spectrum requires accounting for matter redistribution (while enforcing mass conservation) beyond the virial radius of each halo. We show that the same group-scale regime produces the most detectable deviations in group-galaxy lensing, making stacked group lensing a powerful observational test of feedback models together with SZ measurements. Our results motivate emulators that jointly predict the matter power spectrum and halo-matter correlations including baryonic effects, enabling unbiased cosmological inference from small scales.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes as cosmic expansion accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18352v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel and natural mechanism for cosmic acceleration driven by primordial black holes (PBHs) exhibiting repulsive behavior. Using a new ``Swiss Cheese'' cosmological approach, we demonstrate that this cosmic acceleration mechanism is a general phenomenon by examining three regular black hole spacetimes - namely the Hayward, the Bardeen and the Dymnikova spacetimes - as well as the singular de Sitter-Schwarzschild spacetime. Interestingly, by matching these black hole spacetimes with an isotropic and homogeneous expanding Universe, we obtain a phase of cosmic acceleration that ends at an energy scale characteristic to the black hole parameters or due to black hole evaporation. This cosmic acceleration mechanism can be relevant either to an inflationary phase with a graceful exit and reheating or to an early dark energy type of contribution pertinent to the Hubble tension. Remarkably, we find that ultra-light PBHs with masses $m&lt;5\times 10^8\mathrm{g}$ dominating the energy content of the Univese before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, can drive a successful inflationary expansion era without the use of an inflaton field. Additionally, PBHs with masses $m \sim 10^{12}\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $0.107 &lt; \Omega^\mathrm{eq}_\mathrm{PBH}&lt; 0.5$, slightly before matter-radiation equality, can produce a substantial amount of early dark energy, helping to alleviate the $H_0$ tension.</description>

      <title>A Common Origin of Asymmetric Self-interacting Dark Matter and Dirac Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming dark matter to be asymmetric as well as self-interacting and neutrinos to be Dirac fermions, we propose a framework to address the observed baryon imbalance of the universe. We add three right-handed neutrinos $\nu_{R_i},\,{i=1,2,3}$, one singlet fermion $\chi$, a doublet fermion $\psi$, and heavy scalar doublets $\eta_i,\,{i=1,2}$ to the Standard Model. A global $B-L$ is imposed to protect the Dirac nature of neutrinos. Both $\chi$ and $\psi$ are fermions with non-zero charge under an extended $U(1)_{B-L} \times U(1)_D$ symmetry. Additionally, a $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry is imposed, where the singlets $\chi$, $\nu_R$, and $\eta$ are negative and the doublet $\psi$ is positive. The CP-violating out-of-equilibrium decay of heavy scalar $\eta$ generates an equal and opposite $B-L$ asymmetry among the left-handed ($\nu_L$) and right-handed ($\nu_R$) neutrinos. The $\nu_L-\nu_R$ equilibration process does not take place until below the Electroweak phase transition scale because of tiny Yukawa couplings. During this time, Sphaleron processes, which are active at temperatures higher than 100 GeV, transform a portion of the $B-L$ asymmetry stored in left-handed neutrinos into baryon asymmetry. MeV scale gauge boson $Z'$ of $U(1)_D$ sector mediates both annihilation of symmetric dark matter component and self-interaction among dark matter particles. Moreover, $Z'$ mixes with the Standard Model Z-boson and provides a portal for dark matter direct detection.</description>

      <title>Maximum mass limit of strange stars in quadratic curvature-matter coupled gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the maximum mass limit of strange stars in quadratic curvature gravity with the non-minimal matter coupling. The characteristic parameters of the quadratic curvature coupling and the non-minimal matter coupling imply the contributions from higher-order curvature terms and the coupling between matter and geometry, respectively. We explicitly demonstrate that the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor can be modified, and that in the vanishing limit of the non-minimal matter coupling, the formalism of general relativity is recovered. By deriving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations from the gravitational field equations and applying the MIT bag model equation of state, we obtain the corresponding mass-radius relationships for strange stars. Furthermore, we show that the maximum mass limit of strange stars can exceed the general relativistic counterpart. Specifically, we find that a maximum mass up to 3.11 solar mass is achievable, suggesting that the lighter companion of GW190814 could plausibly be a strange star.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals in the cold vector dark matter environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With regard to the observed dark matter density profile in galaxies and clusters, the scalar dark matter scenario has been previously studied for potential detectability through gravitational wave observations at measurable signal-to-noise ratios. In the present study, we consider the case of dark matter described by a massive vector field, also referred to as the Proca field. The density profile in the vicinity of the black hole is explicitly constructed for a broad range of dark matter mass, $\mu\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-15}{\mathrm eV}$, which allows it to exhibit both particle and wave-like characteristics. While in the particle regime, the computation of the DM density distribution is analytically tractable, we find it convenient to compute the same numerically in the wave regime. Nevertheless, in the outer region, the surrounding dark matter is assumed to follow a broken power-law distribution, represented by a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile with a central spike. For the purpose of investigating the detectability of the vector dark matter in the gravitational wave spectrum, we have modelled a stellar-mass black hole ($1M_{\odot}$) inspiralling into a Schwarzschild black hole of mass $10^4M_{\odot}$ within such a vector dark matter environment. With this setup, we analyzed the dephasing in the gravitational wave strain induced by vector dark matter and performed a Fisher forecast for upcoming LISA observations, with particular emphasis on the distinctive features in both the particle and wave regimes of the dark matter. Additionally, most of the important results have been compared with the scalar dark matter case.</description>
