      <title>On n-dependent groups and fields III. Multilinear forms and invariant connected components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop some model theory of multi-linear forms, generalizing Granger in the bi-linear case. In particular, after proving a quantifier elimination result, we show that for an NIP field K, the theory of infinite dimensional non-degenerate alternating n-linear spaces over K is strictly n-dependent; and it is NSOP1 if K is. This relies on a new Composition Lemma for functions of arbitrary arity and NIP relations (which in turn relies on certain higher arity generalizations of Sauer-Shelah lemma). We also study the invariant connected components $G^{\infty}$ in n-dependent groups, demonstrating their relative absoluteness in the abelian case.</description>

      <title>The Logics of Individual Medvedev Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n$-Medvedev's logic $\mathbf{ML}_n$ be the intuitionistic logic of Medvedev frames based on the non-empty subsets of a set of size $n$, which we call $n$-Medvedev frames. While these are tabular logics, after characterizing $n$-Medvedev frames using the property of having at least $n$ maximal points, we offer a uniform axiomatization of them through a Gabbay-style rule corresponding to this property. Further properties including compactness, disjunction property, and structural completeness of $\mathbf{ML}_n$ are explored and compared to those of Medvedev's logic $\mathbf{ML}$.</description>

      <title>Weakly Boolean maximal chains of homeomorphic topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $\lambda &lt;\kappa$ are infinite cardinals, a linear order $L$ is isomorphic to a maximal chain in $[\kappa ]^{\kappa |\kappa }$ (resp. $[\kappa ]^{\lambda |\kappa }$; $[\kappa ]^{\kappa |\lambda }$) iff $L$ is weakly Boolean, the weight of all initial segments of $L$ is equal to $\kappa$ (resp. $\lambda$, $\lambda ^+$) and the weight of all final segments of $L$ is equal to $\kappa$ (resp. $\lambda ^+$, $\lambda $). We also provide an application of this result in topology.</description>

      <title>Countable models of weakly quasi-o-minimal theories I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notions of triviality and order-triviality for global invariant types in an arbitrary first-order theory and show that they are well behaved in the NIP context. We show that these two notions agree for invariant global extensions of a weakly o-minimal type, in which case we say that the type is trivial. In the o-minimal case, we prove that every definable complete 1-type over a model is trivial. We prove that the triviality has several favorable properties; in particular, it is preserved in nonforking extensions of a weakly o-minimal type and under weak nonorthogonality of weakly o-minimal types. We introduce the notion of a shift in a linearly ordered structure that generalizes the successor function. Then we apply the techniques developed to prove that every weakly quasi-o-minimal theory that admits a definable shift has $2^{\aleph_0}$ countable models.</description>

      <title>Comparing semantic frameworks for dependently-sorted algebraic theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algebraic theories with dependency between sorts form the structural core of Martin-L\"of type theory and similar systems. Their denotational semantics are typically studied using categorical techniques; many different categorical structures have been introduced to model them (contextual categories, categories with families, display map categories, etc.) Comparisons of these models are scattered throughout the literature, and a detailed, big-picture analysis of their relationships has been lacking.
  We aim to provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the relationships between as many such models as possible. Specifically, we take *comprehension categories* as a unifying language and show how almost all established notions of model embed as sub-2-categories (usually full) of the 2-category of comprehension categories.</description>

      <title>On the Elementary Equivalence of Group Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use techniques of distortion systems, introduced by James Hanson to show that any two elementarily equivalent infinite discrete ICC groups give rise to elementarily equivalent group von Neumann algebras. This answers a question raised by Goldbring-Pi (and attributed there to Koichi Oyakawa), in the negative. In a special case, this resolves the model theoretic free factor isomorphism problem.</description>

      <title>Homeomorphisms of the Pseudoarc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct homeomorphisms of compacta from relations between finite graphs representing their open covers. Applied to the pseudoarc, this yields simple Fra\"iss\'e theoretic proofs of several important results, both old and new. Specifically, we recover Bing's classic results on the uniqueness and homogeneity of the pseudoarc. We also show that the autohomeomorphism group of the pseudoarc has a dense conjugacy class, thus confirming a conjecture of Kwiatkowska.</description>

      <title>Biquadratic spaces of length two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A tensor space is a vector space equipped with a finite collection of multilinear forms. The length of a tensor space is its length as a representation of its symmetry group. Infinite dimension tensor spaces of finite length are special, highly symmetrical objects. We classify the (universal) biquadratic spaces of length two; there are seven families of them. As a corollary, we establish some cases of the linear analog of the Ryll-Nardzewski theorem. We view this work as a first attempt to classify highly symmetrical tensor spaces.</description>

      <title>The limitless First Incompleteness Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.12233v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is motivated from finding the limit of the applicability of the first incompleteness theorem ($\sf G1$). A natural question is: can we find a minimal theory for which $\sf G1$ holds? We examine the Turing degree structure of recursively enumerable (RE) theories for which $\sf G1$ holds and the interpretation degree structure of RE theories weaker than the theory $\mathbf{R}$ with respect to interpretation for which $\sf G1$ holds. We answer all questions that we posed in \cite{Cheng20}, and prove more results about them. It is known that there are no minimal essentially undecidable theories with respect to interpretation. We generalize this result and give some general characterizations which tell us under what conditions there are no minimal RE theories having some property with respect to interpretation.</description>

      <title>On Rosser theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11749v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rosser theories play an important role in the study of the incompleteness phenomenon and meta-mathematics of arithmetic. In this paper, we first define the notions of $n$-Rosser theories, exact $n$-Rosser theories, effectively $n$-Rosser theories and effectively exact $n$-Rosser theories (see Definition 1.6). Our definitions are not restricted to arithmetic languages. Then we systematically examine properties of $n$-Rosser theories and relationships among them. Especially, we generalize some important theorems about Rosser theories for recursively enumerable sets in the literature to $n$-Rosser theories in a general setting.</description>

      <title>Weakly o-minimal types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study weak o-minimality in the context of complete types in an arbitrary first-order theory. A type $p\in S(A)$ is weakly o-minimal if for some relatively $A$-definable linear order, $&lt;$, on $p(\mathfrak{C})$ every relatively $L_{\mathfrak{C}}$-definable subset of $p(\mathfrak{C})$ has finitely many convex components in $(p(\mathfrak{C}),&lt;)$. We establish many nice properties of weakly o-minimal types. For example, we prove that weakly o-minimal types are dp-minimal and share several properties of weight-one types in stable theories, and that a version of monotonicity theorem holds for relatively definable functions on the locus of a weakly o-minimal type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the consistency strength of the GCH of a measurable cardinal is the existence of a cardinal $\kappa$ with $o(\kappa)=\kappa^{++}$. As the literature does not contain more than a proof sketch of the lower bound of this equiconsistency, we give an expository proof which fills in the details in order to fill this gap in the literature.</description>

      <title>On the first-order theories of quaternions and octonions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04976v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $L$ be the language of rings. We provide an axiomatization of the $L$-theories of quaternions and octonions and we characterize the models of mentioned theories: they coincide, up to isomorphism, to quaternion and octonion algebras over a real closed field, respectively. We bi-interpret these theories in terms of real closed fields and we prove they are complete, model complete and they do not have quantifier elimination. Then, we focus on the class of ordered polynomials. Over $\mathbb{H}$ and $\mathbb{O}$ these polynomials are of special interest in hypercomplex analysis since they are slice regular. We deduce some fundamental properties of their zero loci from model completeness and we prove the failure of quantifier elimination for the fragment of ordered formulas.</description>
