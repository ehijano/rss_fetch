      <title>BioMD: All-atom Generative Model for Biomolecular Dynamics Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are essential tools in computational chemistry and drug discovery, offering crucial insights into dynamic molecular behavior. However, their utility is significantly limited by substantial computational costs, which severely restrict accessible timescales for many biologically relevant processes. Despite the encouraging performance of existing machine learning (ML) methods, they struggle to generate extended biomolecular system trajectories, primarily due to the lack of MD datasets and the large computational demands of modeling long historical trajectories. Here, we introduce BioMD, the first all-atom generative model to simulate long-timescale protein-ligand dynamics using a hierarchical framework of forecasting and interpolation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of BioMD on the DD-13M (ligand unbinding) and MISATO datasets. For both datasets, BioMD generates highly realistic conformations, showing high physical plausibility and low reconstruction errors. Besides, BioMD successfully generates ligand unbinding paths for 97.1% of the protein-ligand systems within ten attempts, demonstrating its ability to explore critical unbinding pathways. Collectively, these results establish BioMD as a tool for simulating complex biomolecular processes, offering broad applicability for computational chemistry and drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Anharmonicity within Density Functional Theory Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple and efficient method to incorporate anharmonic effects in the vibrational frequency of molecules within density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This approach is closely related to the traditional vibrational complete interaction (VCI) technique, which uses the harmonic oscillator wavefunctions as the basis. In our implementation, we employ Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs), with polynomial prefactors, as the basis set to evaluate the anharmonic Hamiltonian. Although these basis functions are non-orthogonal, the matrix elements such as overlap, kinetic energy terms, and position moments can be evaluated analytically. The terms in the Hamiltonian due to the anharmonic potentials are numerically calculated on a Hermite-Quadrature grid. The potentials can be evaluated using any electronic structure method. This framework enables us to accurately calculate the anharmonicity-corrected vibrational frequencies, the fundamental frequencies, and the corrections to bond lengths in diatomic molecules. This method is also generalized to handle coupled anharmonic oscillators, which is essential to model more complex phenomena such as nitrogen tunneling in the umbrella mode of ammonia (NH$_3$) and Fermi resonances in carbon dioxide (CO$_2$)</description>

      <title>Parquet theory for molecular systems. I. Formalism and static kernel parquet approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $GW$ approximation has become a method of choice for predicting quasiparticle properties in solids and large molecular systems, owing to its favorable accuracy-cost balance. However, its accuracy is the result of a fortuitous cancellation of vertex corrections in the polarizability and self-energy. Hence, when attempting to go beyond $GW$ through inclusion of vertex corrections, the accuracy can deteriorate if this delicate balance is disrupted. In this work, we explore an alternative route that theoretically goes beyond $GW$: the parquet formalism. Unlike approaches that focus on a single correlation channel, such as the electron-hole channel in $GW$ or the particle-particle channel in $T$-matrix theory, parquet theory treats all two-body scattering channels on an equal footing. We present the formal structure of the parquet equations, which couple the one-body Green's function, the self-energy, and the two-body vertex. We discuss the approximations necessary to solve this set of equations, the advantages and limitations of this approach, outline its implementation for molecular systems, and assess its accuracy for principal ionization potentials of small molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed machine learning for combustion: A review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) represents an emerging paradigm that integrates various forms of physical knowledge into machine learning (ML) components, thereby enhancing the physical consistency of ML models compared to purely data-driven paradigms. The field of combustion, characterized by a rich foundation of physical laws and abundant data, is undergoing a transformation due to PIML. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of PIML for combustion, systematically outlining fundamental principles, significant contributions, key advancements, and available resources. The application of PIML in combustion is categorized into three domains: combustion chemical kinetics, combustion reacting flows, and other combustion-related problems. Additionally, current challenges, potential solutions, and practical guidelines for researchers and engineers will be discussed. A primary focus of this review is to demonstrate how combustion laws can be integrated into ML, either through soft or hard constraints, via loss functions or representation models, and within coordinate-to-variable or field-to-field paradigms. This paper shows that PIML offers a unified framework linking physics, model, and data in combustion--integrating physical knowledge in model-to-data simulation and reconstruction tasks, as well as data-to-model modeling tasks--resulting in enhanced data, improved physical models, and more reliable ML models. PIML for combustion presents significant opportunities for both the combustion and ML communities, encouraging greater collaboration and cross-disciplinary engagement.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Complexity in Many-body Systems from Positivity Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Area laws describe how entanglement entropy scales and thus provide important necessary conditions for efficient quantum many-body simulation, but they do not, by themselves, yield a direct measure of computational complexity. Here we introduce a complementary framework based on $p$-particle positivity conditions from reduced density matrix (RDM) theory. These conditions form a hierarchy of $N$-representability constraints for an RDM to correspond to a valid $N$-particle quantum system, becoming exact when the Hamiltonian can be expressed as a convex combination of positive semidefinite $p$-particle operators. We prove a general complexity bound: if a quantum system is solvable with level-$p$ positivity independent of its size, then its entanglement complexity scales polynomially with order $p$. This theorem connects structural constraints on RDMs with computational tractability and provides a rigorous framework for certifying when many-body methods including RDM methods can efficiently simulate correlated quantum matter and materials.</description>

      <title>Shift Current Anomalous Photovoltaics in a Double Perovskite Ferroelectric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric anomalous photovoltaic (APV) effect, as a fascinating physical conceptual phenomenon, holds significant potentials for new optoelectronic device applications. However, due to the knowledge lacking on the origin and underlying mechanism of ferroelectric APV effect, substantial challenges still remain in exploring new APV-active candidate materials. The emerging shift current model, involving the transfer of photogenerated charges through the displacement of wave functions, has attracted considerable attention for its unique insights into the bulk photovoltaic effect. Here, we present strong APV properties in a high-temperature double perovskite ferroelectric (cyclohexylmethylammonium)$_2$CsAgBiBr$_7$, showing an extremely large above-bandgap photovoltage up to about 40 V. This figure-of-merit is far beyond its bandgap of about 2.3 eV and comparable to the state-of-art molecular ferroelectrics. Strikingly, the shift current model reveals an intrinsic correlation with Cs$^{+}$ cation displacement and provides, for the first time, an explicit explanation for the structural origin of ferroelectric APV activities. Besides, its steady-state APV photocurrent exhibits the unique light-polarization dependence, which endows remarkable polarization-sensitivity with the highest polarization ratios of about 41 among the known 2D single-phase materials. As the unprecedented exploration of ferroelectric APV characteristics illuminated by the shift current mechanism, this finding paves a pathway to assemble new optoelectronic smart devices.</description>

      <title>Conditions for Suppression of Gas Phase Chemical Reactions inside a Dark Infrared Cavity: O$_{2}$ + 2NO$\to$ 2NO$_{2}$ as an example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to slow down chemical reactions using a seemingly simple setup reactions confined within a cavity formed by two parallel mirrors is fascinating. However, theory and experiment have not yet fully converged. In this work, we provide the conditions and guidelines for selecting reactions that can be suppressed in a dark cavity. The primary requirement is that the reaction's potential energy surface must contain two saddle points (and not one saddle point as required for enhancement). This condition enables a reduction in the reaction rate. Specifically, we demonstrate that the reaction rate of O$_{2}$ + 2NO$\to$ 2NO$_{2}$ can be suppressed by a dark cavity composed of two parallel mirrors. We show that the suppression of the reaction rate depends on the distance between the mirrors, which determines the cavity parameters, and on the number of molecules in the transition state configuration that simultaneously interact with the cavity.</description>

      <title>First detection of ethylene oxide and acetaldehyde in hot core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1: Tracing prebiotic oxygen chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ethylene oxide (c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O) and its isomer, acetaldehyde (CH$_{3}$CHO), are important complex organic molecules owing to their potential role in the formation of amino acids (R-CH(NH$_{2}$)-COOH) in ISM. The detection of c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O in hot molecular cores suggests that the possible existence of larger ring-shaped molecules containing more than three carbon atoms, such as furan (c-C$_{4}$H$_{4}$O), which shares structural similarities with ribose (C$_{5}$H$_{10}$O5), the sugar component of DNA. In this study, we report the first detection of the rotational emission lines of c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O and CH$_{3}$CHO towards the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1, based on observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) in band 7. The fractional abundances of c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O and CH$_{3}$CHO relative to H$_{2}$ are $(2.1\pm0.2)\times10^{-9}$ and $(7.1\pm0.9)\times10^{-9}$, respectively. The column density ratio between CH$_{3}$CHO and c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O is $3.4\pm0.7$. A Pearson correlation heat map reveals strong positive correlations ($r$ $&gt;$ 0.5) between the abundances and excitation temperatures of c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O and CH$_{3}$CHO, suggesting a possible chemical connection between those two molecules. To investigate this further, we conducted a two-phase warm-up chemical model using the gas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM. A comparison between our derived abundances and the predictions from our chemical model and existence model demonstrates good agreement within factors of 0.73 and 0.74, respectively. We propose that c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O may form in G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 via the grain surface reaction between C$_{2}$H$_{4}$ and O, but CH$_{3}$CHO may be produced through the surface reaction between CH$_{3}$ and HCO.</description>

      <title>Speeding up Brownian escape via intermediate finite potential barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mean first-passage time (MFPT) for a Brownian particle to surmount a potential barrier of height $\Delta U$ is a fundamental quantity governing a wide array of physical and chemical processes. According to the Arrhenius Law, the MFPT typically grows exponentially with increasing barrier height, reflecting the rarity of thermally activated escape events. In this work, we demonstrate that the MFPT can be significantly reduced by reshaping the original single-barrier potential into a structured energy landscape comprising multiple intermediate barriers of lower heights, while keeping the total barrier height $\Delta U$ unchanged. Furthermore, this counterintuitive result holds across both linear and nonlinear potential profiles. Our findings suggest that tailoring the energy landscape -- by introducing well-placed intermediate barriers -- can serve as an effective control strategy to accelerate thermally activated transitions. These predictions are amenable to experimental validation using optical trapping techniques.</description>

      <title>The Enduring Relevance of Semiempirical Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13424v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of semiempirical models to simplify quantum mechanical descriptions of atomistic systems is a practice that started soon after the discovery of quantum mechanics and continues to the present day. There are now many methods for atomistic simulation with many software implementations and many users, on a scale large enough to be considered as a software market. Semiempirical models occupied a large share of this market in its early days, but the research activity in atomistic simulation has steadily polarized over the last three decades towards general-purpose but expensive ab initio quantum mechanics methods and fast but special-purpose molecular mechanics methods. I offer perspective on recent trends in atomistic simulation from the middle ground of semiempirical modeling, to learn from its past success and consider its possible paths to future growth. In particular, there is a lot of ongoing research activity in combining semiempirical quantum mechanics with machine learning models and some unrealized possibilities of tighter integration between ab initio and semiempirical quantum mechanics with more flexible theoretical frameworks and more modular software components.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic force matching for alchemical free-energy estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to compute free-energy differences from nonadiabatic alchemical transformations using flow-based generative models. The method, nonadiabatic force matching, hinges on estimating the dissipation along an alchemical switching process in terms of a nonadiabatic force field that can be learned through stochastic flow matching. The learned field can be used in conjunction with short-time trajectory data to evaluate upper and lower bounds on the alchemical free energy that variationally converge to the exact value if the field is optimal. Applying the method to evaluate the alchemical free energy of atomistic models shows that it can substantially reduce the simulation cost of a free-energy estimate at negligible loss of accuracy when compared with thermodynamic integration.</description>
